AIM: To evaluate the long-term treatment outcomes of entecavir monotherapy in treatment naive patients in an Australian tertiary care setting. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of treatment naive patients receiving entecavir monotherapy through Westmead Hospital was performed. Patients were excluded if they had received previous treatment with another nucleoside or nucleotide analogue, were pregnant or less than 18 years old. RESULTS: Out of 336 patients, 163 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. Range of follow up was 3-46 mo (mean 26 mo). 134 patients (82.2%) had pre-treatment biopsies, with 26 patients (16.0 %) demonstrating F3-4 fibrosis. In total, 153 patients (93.9%) achieved at least Partial Virological Suppression (PVS), with 134 patients (82.2%) achieving complete virological suppression. The cumulative CVS and PVS rates at 36 mo were 82.1% and 96.4%, respectively. 3 patients (1.8%) failed to achieve PVS, while 5 patients (3.0%) developed virological rebound. 128 patients (78.5%) maintained CVS throughout follow up. Predictors of CVS included lower baseline DNA level (P = 0.001), hepatitis B virus e antigen negative status (P = 0.001) and increasing age at treatment (log rank 0.001). No significant adverse effects were reported necessitating cessation of entecavir. CONCLUSION: Entecavir monotherapy is efficacious and safe in an Australian tertiary care setting. Resistance and rebound rates are very low. This is similar to data from controlled and uncontrolled trials around the world.
