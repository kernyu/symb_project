AIMS: To investigate the susceptibility pattern and the molecular epidemiology of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates in two periods (1994-1996 and 2004-2007) in Londrina University Hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of 150 A. baumannii isolates was assessed by disc diffusion and agar dilution methods. Genetic similarity amongst the isolates was evaluated by ERIC-PCR. Resistance of A. baumannii to carbapenems increased from 2% (1994-1996) to 73% (2004-2007). Thirty-eight clones were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study suggest that the high prevalence of carbapenem resistance amongst Acinetobacter baumannii organisms in this institution is not caused by the spread of a predominant clone. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work reinforces the importance monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility rates.
