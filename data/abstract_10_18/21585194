A new type of polymer highly resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption is reported. Poly(N-methyl-beta-alanine) (PMeA) and poly(N-ethyl-beta-alanine) (PEtA) synthesized via cobalt-catalyzed carbonylative polymerization of N-methylaziridine and N-ethylaziridine were end-functionalized with thiol groups and grafted onto Au surfaces. Protein adsorption was studied by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method. The amounts of representative single proteins adsorbed onto the PMeA- and PEtA-grafted surfaces were below the detection limit of SPR at the pg/mm(2) level. After exposure to full blood plasma and serum for 10 min, protein adsorption was at the level of approximately 100 pg/mm(2), similar to the level of protein adsorption on poly(ethylene glycol) surfaces subjected to identical conditions. These poly(beta-peptoid)s therefore provide excellent protein resistance comparable to the best antifouling materials known to date. The strong proton-accepting ability when forming hydrogen bonds is suggested to be an important attribute for these poly(beta-peptoid)s as well as other poly(tertiary amide)s as antifouling materials.
