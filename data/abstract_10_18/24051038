BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Staphylococcus aureus is a principal cause of human bacterial infection worldwide. The dissemination of antibiotic resistance among S. aureus strains is very import in the treatment of Staphylococcal infections. We undertook this study to identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones responsible for nosocomial infection in five medical centers in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon (N.L.), Mexico from 2005-2009. METHODS: One hundred ninety MRSA strains collected from 2005-2009 from five hospitals affiliated with the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) in Monterrey, N.L., Mexico were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. RESULTS: Only one clone was present in the five hospitals (clone C); this clone is strongly associated with the New York-Japan clone (SCCmec II) with a broad resistance profile. CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly documented the high ability for dissemination and the persistence of the New York-Japan clone in these centers.
