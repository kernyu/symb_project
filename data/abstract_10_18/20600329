A real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay was designed and evaluated for the detection of the point mutation in the influenza A N1 neuraminidase gene that results in a tyrosine to histidine substitution at amino acid position 275 (H275Y) causing resistance to oseltamivir, an antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor. The rRT-PCR assays detected the presence or absence of the H275Y mutation in 387/388 (99.7%) of clinical samples containing the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus. The H275Y mutation was not detected in any of the community patient samples (0/132) but was detected in four hospitalized patients who had been treated with oseltamivir for several days. The sensitive rRT-PCR assays may be performed directly on patient specimens, can detect resistant virus at low levels, and therefore may provide early warning of developing resistance within individual patients or the wider population.
