The dissemination of plasmid-mediated multidrug resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is a major public health concern. We investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR), 16S rRNA methylases, CTX-M, and acquired AmpC enzymes in ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=40) from Tehran hospitals. Plasmid replicon typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were carried out for typing. CTX-M group 1 (confirmed as bla(CTX-M-15) in selected isolates) was found in 35/40 isolates. Thirty-two isolates hosted PMQR genes. Twenty isolates featured aac(6')-Ib-CR only; 9 isolates had aac(6')-Ib-CR and qnrB; 2 isolates had aac(6')-Ib-CR and qnrS; and 1 isolate had aac(6')-Ib-CR, qnrS, and qepA. The 16S rRNA methylase RmtB was found in 1 isolate; and acquired AmpC enzymes, in 6 isolates. PFGE detected 7 pulsotypes, the largest corresponded to sequence type 16. The successful clone ST101 was also found. The emergence of successful clones of K. pneumoniae in Tehran hospitals is concerning.
