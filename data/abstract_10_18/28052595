Multidrug-resistant bacteria pose a serious threat to public health worldwide. Previously, alpha-peptide/beta-peptoid hybrid oligomers were found to display activity against Gram-negative multidrug-resistant bacteria. In the present work, the influence of hydrophobicity, fluorination, and distribution of cationic/hydrophobic residues on antimicrobial, hemolytic, and cytotoxic properties of alpha-peptide/beta-peptoid hybrids were investigated. An array of 22 peptidomimetics was tested. Analogues with enhanced hydrophobicity were found to exhibit increased activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Incorporation of fluorinated residues into the peptidomimetics conferred increased potency against Gram-positive bacteria, while hemolytic properties and activity against Gram-negative bacteria depended on the degree and type of fluorination. Generally, shorter oligomers were less potent than the corresponding longer analogues. However, some short analogues exhibited equal or higher antimicrobial activity. The alternating hydrophobic/cationic design proved superior to other distribution patterns of cationic side chains and hydrophobic moieties.
