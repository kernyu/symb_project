BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pretreatment insulin resistance (IR) is associated with treatment response to peginterferon plus ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection. However, the impact of PegIFN/RBV therapy on both IR and beta-cell function in CHC patients has rarely been investigated. METHODS: A total of 277 non-diabetic patients treated with PegIFN-alpha and weight-based RBV, with 80/80/80 adherence, were recruited. Their IR and beta-cell function by homeostasis model assessment model (HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B) before treatment and at 24 week after treatment [end of follow-up (EOF)] was measured. RESULTS: A sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved by 79.4% (220/277) of all patients: 63.6% (75/118) of genotype-1 and 91.2% (145/159) of genotype-non-1 patients. There was no significant change of HOMA-IR post-therapy (2.25 +/- 2.46 vs 2.04 +/- 2.12, P=0.42). By contrast, there was a significant reduction of HOMA-%B of all patients at EOF (122.9 +/- 145.2 vs 92.4 +/- 73.2, P=0.001), particularly in those responders (119.1 +/- 142.1 vs 89.6 +/- 70.3, P=0.002). In 80 patients with high baseline HOMA-IR, both HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B decreased significantly at EOF, irrespective of SVR achievement. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated pancreatic beta-cell function was ameliorated by PegIFN/RBV therapy in CHC patients, particularly in those responders.
