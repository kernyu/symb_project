INTRODUCTION: Globally, extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli are one of the predominant causative agents of bacteraemia. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report outlines a presentation of community-acquired pyelonephritis and secondary bloodstream infection in an 81-year-old man. Laboratory investigations revealed that the causative isolate was a multi-drug-resistant E. coli of a novel multi-locus sequence type. This sequence type (ST) was designated ST-458 and was most closely related to the globally prevalent ST-131 lineage. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a novel E. coli ST, ST-458, which caused pyelonephritis and bacteraemia.
