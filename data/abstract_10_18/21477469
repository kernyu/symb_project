The present study was carried out to identify virulence properties (siderophores, serum resistance, and hemolysin) and antibiotic resistance in extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella isolates from 60 calf and chicken meat samples purchased from various supermarkets in Ankara, Turkey. Of the 45 Klebsiella isolates, 24 (53%) were identified as K. oxytoca and 21 (47%) were identified as K. pneumoniae. A high proportion of Klebsiella isolates had virulence factors such as hemolytic activity (67%), siderophore production (44%), and serum resistance (38%). The double-disk synergy test was used to determine ESBL production. ESBL production was detected in 13 (29%) of the 45 Klebsiella isolates. Resistance to 14 antimicrobials was tested in all Klebsiella isolates by the disk diffusion method. All isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobial agents. All ESBL-producing Klebsiella isolates were highly resistant to cephalosporins and monobactams. Our findings indicate that meat and its products represent potential hazardous sources of multidrug-resistant and virulent Klebsiella species.
