A previous local study revealed high levels of fusidic acid (FA) resistance within dermatology. It was therefore decided to limit use of topical FA within dermatology and then assess the effect on resistance rates. The local microbiology department produced FA resistance data within dermatology over a five-year period. This was then compared with data provided for four other control specialties. Since withdrawal of FA in dermatology, between 2002 and 2006, there was a statistically significant fall in FA resistance rates, while the other four control specialty areas showed increases in resistance rates. In conclusion, it would appear that, in dermatology, withdrawal of topical FA could have a beneficial effect on overall resistance rates for this antibiotic. Given these findings, we made recommendations that other local dermatology units consider their policy on the routine use of topical fusidic preparations.
