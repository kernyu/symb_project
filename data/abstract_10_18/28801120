Susceptibility breakpoints provide fundamental information for rational administration of antibiotics. The present investigation reports the first valnemulin susceptibility breakpoint (MIC<0.25 mug/mL) against Clostridium perfringens infections in rabbits based on the wild-type cutoff (COWT) and the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) cutoff (COPD). The established susceptibility breakpoint of valnemulin might be useful in resistance surveillance of pleuromutilins and development of clinical breakpoints.
