INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections represent one of the most frequent reasons for hospitalization. As a result of their prevalence from community-based origins as well as those which develop in hospital setting, this constellation of infections represents a tremendous burden to the global healthcare system. Areas covered: Over the last several decades the management of these infections has become more complicated due to the underlying comorbid conditions of the patients as well as escalating antimicrobial resistance to many of the most frequently used oral and parenteral agents. One such example is the emergence of extend spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) bacteria that render many of the most frequently utilized oral and parenteral penicillin and cephalosporin based regimens of little clinical utility. As such new treatment strategies are required to effectively manage the growing population of patients with multi-drug resistant bacteria. Expert commentary: Herein, we review some of the current literature which reveals the challenges associated with the contemporary management of UTIs, while presenting strategies such as the implementation of clinical pathways that have the potential to enhance the quality and efficiency of care while reducing the overall cost of care.
