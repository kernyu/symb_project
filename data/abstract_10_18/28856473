Natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a family of small polypeptides that are produced by constitutive or inducible expression in organisms, are integral components of the host innate immune system. In addition to their broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, natural AMPs also have many biological activities against fungi, viruses and parasites. Natural AMPs exert multiple immunomodulatory roles that may predominate under physiological conditions where they lose their microbicidal properties in serum and tissue environments. Increased drug resistance among microorganisms is occurring far more quickly than the discovery of new antibiotics. Natural AMPs have shown promise as 'next generation antibiotics' due to their broad-spectrum curative effects, low toxicity, the fact that they are not residual in animals, and the low rates of resistance exhibited by many pathogens. Many types of synthetic AMPs are currently being tested in clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of various diseases such as chemotherapy-associated infections, diabetic foot ulcers, catheter-related infections, and other conditions. Here, we provide an overview of the types and functions of natural AMPs and their role in combating microorganisms and different infectious and inflammatory diseases.
