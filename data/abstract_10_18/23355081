Bacteria are able to adapt to changes in the environment using two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) composed of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR). Deinococcus radiodurans, one of the most resistant organisms to ionizing radiation, has 20 putative HKs and 25 putative RRs. In this study, we constructed 12 D. radiodurans mutant strains lacking a gene encoding a HK and surveyed their resistance to gamma-radiation, UV-B radiation (302 nm), mitomycin C (MMC), and H(2)O(2). Five (dr0860 (-), dr1174 (-), dr1556 (-), dr2244 (-), and dr2419 (-)) of the 12 mutant strains showed at least a one-log cycle reduction in gamma-radiation resistance. The mutations (1) dr1174, dr1227, and dr2244 and (2) dr0860, dr2416, and dr2419 caused decreases in resistance to UV radiation and MMC, respectively. Only the dr2416 and dr2419 mutant strains showed higher sensitivity to H(2)O(2) than the wild-type. Reductions in the resistance to gamma-radiation and H(2)O(2), but not to UV and MMC, were observed in the absence of DR2415, which seems to be a cognate RR of DR2416. This result suggests that DR2415/DR2416 (DrtR/S: DNA damage response TCS) may be another TCS responsible for the extreme resistance of D. radiodurans to DNA-damaging agents.
