Prenylated and O-methylflavonoids including one new pterocarpan (1), three new isoflavones (2-4), and nineteen known natural products (5-23) were isolated and identified from the root, stem bark, and leaf extracts of Erythrina schliebenii. The crude extracts and their constituents were evaluated for antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv strain), showing MICs of 32-64 mug mL(-1) and 36.9-101.8 muM, respectively. Evaluation of their toxicity against the aggressive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 indicated EC50 values of 13.0-290.6 muM (pure compounds) and 38.3 to >100 mug mL(-1) (crude extracts).
