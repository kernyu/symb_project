UNLABELLED: Increasing levels of paediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), caused by drug-resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance, vary with age and countries and, in some cases, serotypes. When empirical first-line treatment administration fails, paediatricians should consider second-line treatments based on the prevalence of local resistance. A more judicious use of antimicrobial agents is also required. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of local epidemiology and an appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs are necessary to treat CAP in this era of antimicrobial resistance.
