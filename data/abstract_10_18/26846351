Although antimicrobial resistance poses a great challenge to clinicians in China, there are limited antimicrobial resistance data on Gram-negative bacteria nationwide. We investigated the phenotypic characteristics of carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CREC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) as well as extensively drug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDRPA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB) isolated from blood cultures in China. Data were collected on 24113 isolates from the China surveillance of antimicrobial resistance program in 2013, which comprised 208 hospitals located in all seven administrative regions of China. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for common antimicrobials were determined by commercial automated systems available at local hospitals, and associations with geographic and clinical distributions was further studied. The overall prevalence of CREC, CRKP, XDRAB and XDRPA strains was 1.0, 5.5, 13.7 and 4.2%, respectively. Except for CREC, which did not differ greatly by region, the prevalence of the remaining three strains varied significantly across regions. The highest prevalence of CRKP (10.6%) and XDRAB (13.1%) were found in the pediatric group, and higher prevalence of all four target strains was found in the intensive care unit. For imipenem, 55.8% of CREC and 22.9% of CRKP strains had MICs of </=4 mug/mL, while 97.4% XDRAB and 84% XDRPA isolates had MICs of >/=16 mug/mL. All CREC, CRKP and 81.2% of XDRAB strains were susceptible to tigecycline, with MIC90 values of 0.5, 2 and 4 mug/mL, respectively. In conclusion, a high prevalence of CRKP and XDRAB has emerged in China, especially in children and in the intensive care unit.
