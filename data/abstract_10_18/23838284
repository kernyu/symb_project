Carbapenem resistance among Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from clinical settings in Brazil has increased dramatically in the last 10 years due to the emergence and dissemination of OXA-type carbapenemase encoding genes. This study aimed to characterize the presence of carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D beta-lactamases (CHDL)-encoding genes and clonal complexes playing a major role in the dissemination of OXA-carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii in Southeast Brazil. A total of 74 A. baumannii strains isolated from patients admitted to 4 hospitals in Southeast Brazil were analyzed. Molecular characterization of strains revealed that 67 strains carried blaOXA-23 (72%), blaOXA-143 (25%) or both genes (3%). PFGE analysis identified 12 PFGE clusters, grouping 26 pulsotypes. Two PFGE clusters were predominant, comprising more than 66% of OXA-producing A. baumannii isolates. Among 23 representative strains characterized by MLST-UO (Multilocus Sequence Typing Scheme - University of Oxford, http://pubmlst.org/abaumannii/), 14 different STs were identified, of which six were confirmed as novel sequence types (designated as STs 402-407). Most of these isolates belonged to clonal complexes CC104,CC109 or CC113, whereas three STs were singletons (ST339, 403 and 407). In conclusion, the presence of blaOXA-23- and blaOXA-143-like genes was not related to specific ST/CC, suggesting that the dissemination of OXA-carbapenemase-encoding genes may involve different STs, in which the spread of OXA-23-like is most likely due to mobile elements (i.e., plasmids). In this regard, CC104, CC109 and CC113 played a major role as predominant CDHL-carrying clones, instead of CC92, which was not identified.
