The antimicrobial peptide human ss-defensin 1 (hBD1) is continuously produced by epithelial cells in many tissues. Compared to other defensins, hBD1 has only minor antibiotic activity in its native state. After reduction of its disulfide bridges, however, it becomes a potent antimicrobial agent against bacteria, while the oxidized native form (hBD1ox) shows specific activity against Gram-negative bacteria. We show that the killing mechanism of hBD1ox depends on aerobic growth conditions and bacterial enzymes. We analyzed the different activities of hBD1 using mutants of E. coli lacking one or more specific proteins of their outer membrane, cytosol or redox systems. We discovered that DsbA and DsbB are essential for the antimicrobial activity of hBD1ox, but not for hBD1red. Furthermore, our results strongly suggest that hBD1ox uses outer membrane protein FepA to penetrate the bacterial periplasm space. In contrast, other bacterial proteins in the outer membrane and cytosol did not modify the antimicrobial activity. Using immunogold labeling, we identified the localization of hBD1ox in the periplasmic space and partly in the outer membrane of E. coli However, in resistant mutants lacking DsbA and DsbB, hBD1ox was mainly detected in the bacterial cytosol. In summary we discovered that hBD1ox could use FepA to enter the periplasmic space where its activity depends on presence of DsbA and DsbB. HBD1ox concentrates in the periplasm in Gram-negative bacteria, which finally leads to bleb formation and death of the bacteria. Thus the bacterial redox system plays an essential role for resistance mechanisms against host derived peptides such as hBD1.
