We describe a real-time PCR-based assay capable of simultaneously detecting femA (Staphylococcus aureus-specific), mecA (methicillin resistance), qacA/B (chlorhexidine tolerance), and mupA (high-level mupirocin resistance) from bacterial cells in less than 90 minutes. The assay was validated with 1968 clinical MRSA submitted to a surveillance network.
