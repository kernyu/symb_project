Although the arsenal of agents with anti-Aspergillus activity has expanded over the last decade, mortality due to invasive aspergillosis remains unacceptably high. Resistance of the Aspergillus spp. species to antifungal drugs increased in the last 20 years with the increase in antifungal drugs use and might partially account for treatment failures. Recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of antifungal drug action in Aspergillus, along with the standardization of in vitro susceptibility testing methods, have brought resistance testing to the forefront of clinical mycology. Recent modifications in taxonomy and understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms of Aspergilli to drugs should support a better management of Aspergillus infections. In this paper, we review the current knowledge on epidemiology and underlying mechanisms involved in antifungal resistance in Aspergillus.
