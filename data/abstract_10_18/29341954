BACKGROUND: Production of Bla OXA-23, OXA-24, OXA-58 and hyperexpression of OXA-51 due to ISAba1 insertion sequence are the leading causes of carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii. The loss of OprD transmembrane protein and the overexpression of some effl ux pumps are considered to be the main factors for carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa whereas metallo-enzymes' production has a secondary role. AIM: capital TE, Cyrillico examine the carbapenem resistance due to carbapenemase production among clinically signifi cant Gram-negative non-fermenters from St George University hospital, Plovdiv: A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty three A. baumannii and 43 P. aeruginosa isolates, resistant or with intermediate resistance to imipenem and/or meropenem were included in the study. They were collected from patients admitted in 14 various hospital wards between 2010 and 2014. Both phenotypic and genetic methods were used for identifi cation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: All A. baumannii demonstrated carbapenemase production determined by a modifi ed Hodge test whereas P. aeruginosa isolates did not show this phenomenon. OXA-23 genes were determined in 97.7% (42 out of 43) of A. baumannii isolates indistinguishable from the sequence of the classical ARI-1 gene. OXA-24, OXA-58 and overexpression of OXA-51 were not registered in any of the isolates. All P. aeruginosa were negative for blaVIM and blaIMP genes. CONCLUSION: The leading cause of carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii isolates from our hospital is the carbapenemase production due to the expression of OXA- 23 gene, whereas in P. aeruginosa - the loss of transmembrane OprD protein and the effl ux pumps' hyperexpression are suspected to be the main mechanisms.
