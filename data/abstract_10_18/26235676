INTRODUCTION: The carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1), a group of ubiquitously expressed metalloenzymes, are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes, as well as in the growth and virulence of pathogens belonging to bacteria, fungi and protozoa. AREAS COVERED: CAs belonging to at least four genetic families, the alpha-, beta-, gamma- and eta-CAs, were discovered and characterized in many pathogens: i) Bacteria encode enzymes from one or more such families, which were investigated as potential drug targets. Inhibition of bacterial CAs by sulfonamides/phenol derivatives lead to inhibition of growth of the pathogen for Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella suis; ii) Fungi encode for alpha- and beta-CAs, and inhibitors of the sulfonamide, thiol or dithiocarbamate type inhibited the growth of some of them (Malassezia globosa, Candida albicans, Crytpococcus neoformans, etc) in vivo; and iii) Protozoa encode alpha-, beta- or eta-CAs. Sulfonamide, thiols and hydroxamates effectively killed such parasites (Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania donovani chagasi, Plasmodium falciparum) in vivo. EXPERT OPINION: None of the microorganism CAs is validated as drug targets as yet, but the inhibitors designed against many such enzymes showed interesting in vitro/in vivo results. By interfering with the activity of CAs from microorganisms, both pH homeostasis as well as crucial biosynthetic reactions are impaired, which lead to significant antiinfective effects, not yet exploited for obtaining pharmacological agents. As resistance to the clinically used antiinfectives is a serious healthcare problem worldwide, inhibition of parasite CAs may constitute an alternative approach for obtaining such agents with novel mechanisms of action.
