Urogenital Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates (266) collected in San Francisco, CA, in 2009 were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility and were subsequently genotyped by N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST). Isolates of identical or closely related sequence types were found to possess highly similar phenotypes with regard to drug susceptibility. Isolates containing decreased susceptibility to oral cephalosporins were detected in 2009 and were found to contain the mosaic penA allele (XXXIV) found previously to be associated with decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins. A better understanding of the relationships between phenotypic and genotypic markers for antimicrobial resistance may be helpful to the development of effective surveillance systems for drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae.
