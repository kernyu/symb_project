The applicability of Etest for synergy testing was evaluated in 100 carbapenem-nonsusceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Combinations of doripenem with amikacin, colistin, or levofloxacin were synergistic or additive against 67%, 31%, and 23% of isolates, respectively. The use of Etest was practical to evaluate the synergy of doripenem with other antipseudomonal agents.
