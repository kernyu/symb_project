INTRODUCTION: Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) is a new antibiotic resulting from the combination of a novel cephalosporin, structurally similar to ceftazidime, with tazobactam, a well-known beta-lactamase inhibitor. C/T remains active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and multi-drug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa, and has been recently approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). A trial on hospital-acquired pneumonia is ongoing. Areas covered: The place in therapy of C/T is delineated by addressing the following main topics: (i) antimicrobial properties; (ii) pharmacological properties; (iii) results of clinical studies. Expert commentary: C/T is approved for cIAI and cUTI. However, the drug has a special value for clinicians in any kind of infectious localization for two main reasons. The first is that C/T is especially valuable in suspected or documented severe infections due to MDR P. aeruginosa, which is not a rare occurrence in many countries. The second is that C/T may provide an alternative to carbapenems for the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producers, thus allowing a carbapenem-sparing strategy. Reporting of off-label use is mandatory to increase the body of evidence and the clinicians' confidence in using it for indications other than cIAI and cUTI.
