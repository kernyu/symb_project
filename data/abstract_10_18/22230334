The aim of this study was to determine the current susceptibility of hospital isolates of contemporary Gram-negative pathogens to the carbapenems doripenem, imipenem and meropenem. Between May and October 2008, seven centres in Germany were invited to collect and submit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae and other Gram-negative bacterial Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/non-ICU isolates from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), bloodstream infections (BSIs) or nosocomial pneumonia (NP). Susceptibility was determined at each centre by Etest. A central laboratory performed species confirmation as well as limited susceptibility and quality control testing. In total, 363 isolates were collected, comprising 46.0% Enterobacteriaceae, 45.2% P. aeruginosa, 4.7% Acinetobacter spp. and 4.1% other Gram-negatives. Most isolates (47.9%) were collected from NP, 32.8% were from cIAIs and 19.3% from BSIs; 57.3% were obtained from ICU patients. The MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the isolates) for doripenem, meropenem and imipenem were, respectively, 4, 16 and 32 mg/L against P. aeruginosa, 0.06, 0.06 and 0.5mg/L against Enterobacteriaceae and >/= 64 mg/L for each carbapenem against other Gram-negative isolates. Using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints, 81.1%, 75.6% and 79.3% of P. aeruginosa were susceptible to doripenem, imipenem and meropenem, respectively. Against all pathogens combined, MIC(90) values for ICU versus non-ICU isolates, respectively, were 4 mg/L vs. 1mg/L for doripenem, 8 mg/L vs. 1mg/L for meropenem and >/= 64 mg/L vs. 8 mg/L for imipenem. Doripenem showed comparable activity against P. aeruginosa from patients with BSIs, cIAIs or NP. Similar findings were observed for Enterobacteriaceae and other Gram-negatives, including Acinetobacter spp. Doripenem generally showed similar or slightly better activity than meropenem and better activity than imipenem against Gram-negative pathogens collected in Germany.
