PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in HIV treatment, including simplified and better tolerated antiretroviral drug regimens, have led to increasing numbers of HIV-positive children and adolescents surviving into adulthood. Effective pediatric and adolescent primary care provided by pediatricians working together with an HIV specialist can help to optimize their current and future health. RECENT FINDINGS: New data are showing youth with HIV may be at increased risk for early cardiovascular disease and metabolic derangements as compared with their uninfected peers. Both the virus itself and complications of antiretroviral medications are implicated in these findings. SUMMARY: In addition to standard age-appropriate healthcare maintenance, care of HIV-positive children and adolescents should have special emphasis on evaluation for possible cardiovascular and metabolic complications of HIV infection and its treatment. Goals of care are moving toward chronic disease management and improved long-term health.
