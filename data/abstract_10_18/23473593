With the increased emergence of anti-infective resistance in recent years, much focus has recently been drawn to the development of new anti-infectives and the optimization of treatment regimens and combination therapies for established antimicrobials. In this context, the field of pharmacometrics using quantitative numerical modeling and simulation techniques has in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool in the pharmaceutical industry, academia and regulatory agencies to facilitate the integration of preclinical and clinical development data and to provide a scientifically based framework for rational dosage regimen design and treatment optimization. This review highlights the usefulness of pharmacometric analyses in anti-infective drug development and applied pharmacotherapy with select examples.
