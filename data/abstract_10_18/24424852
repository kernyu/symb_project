We studied the prevalence of fluconazole resistance in esophageal candidiasis. Patients with suspected esophageal candidiasis during gastroscopy underwent culture of white plaques. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >64 mug/mL of fluconazole for Candida was indicative of resistance. Sensitivity of itraconazole was tested in a subset of resistant strains. Sixty-five patients were included. Mean (SD) age was 50.03 (13.5) years and 67.7 % were males. Predisposing factors for candidiasis were found in 42 (64.6 %) patients. C. albicans was identified in 64 (97.4 %) patients and C. glabrata in one patient. Fluconazole resistance was seen in 38 (59.4 %) patients with C. albicans and also in the one patient with C. glabrata. All the fluconazole resistant isolates of C. albicans had MIC >128 mug/mL suggesting very high resistance. Twelve patients with fluconazole resistance had itraconazole resistance as well. The study shows a high rate of fluconazole resistance in patients with esophageal candidiasis.
