INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common infections encountered by physicians either on an outpatient or inpatient basis. These infections have taken center stage due to increasing resistance being reported for commonly used antibiotics. Understanding the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of uropathogens would facilitate appropriate therapy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the culture isolates obtained from urine samples received at the Department of Microbiology, St. John's Medical College Hospital, Bengaluru India, was performed between January 2012 and May 2012. RESULTS: Of the 5592 urine specimens received, 28.2% showed significant growth. A total of 1673 identified pathogens were used in the analysis. Escherichia coli (54.6%) was the most common Gram-negative bacillus, followed by Klebsiella species (9.7%) and Pseudomonas species (7.5%). The most common Gram-positive coccus was Enterococcus (8.8%). Most of the Gram-negative isolates were resistant to ampicillin (79.3%) and cephalosporins (60%). Resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones was higher in isolates from inpatients. Other than Klebsiella spp., all other Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to carbapenems (93%) and aminoglycosides (85%), whilst fluoroquinolones were effective for all Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Due to a high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the pathogens causing UTI in India, it is cautious to advise or modify therapy, as far as possible, after culture and sensitivity testing have been performed. Regional surveillance programs are warranted for the development of national UTI guidelines.
