DT104 emerged as a new branch of Salmonella typhimurium with resistance to multiple antimicrobials. To reveal some general genomic features of DT104 for clues of evolutionary events possibly associated with the emergence of this relatively new type of this pathogen, we mapped 11 independent DT104 strains and compared them with non-DT104 S. typhimurium strains. We found that all 11 DT104 strains contained three insertions absent in non-DT104 strains, i.e., the previously reported ST104, ST104B and ST64B. However, SGI-1, a genomic island known to be responsible for DT104 multidrug resistance, was not present in all DT104 strains examined in this study: one DT104 strain did not contain SGI-1 but carried a 144 kb plasmid, suggesting possible evolutionary relationships between the two DNA elements in the development of antimicrobial resistance.
