BACKGROUND: Twice-daily darunavir/ritonavir is indicated in treatment-experienced children (>/=3 years). This study assessed once-daily administration in treatment-naive adolescents. METHODS: Phase 2, 48-week, open-label, single-arm study evaluating pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg in treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected adolescents (>/=12 to <18 years, >/=40 kg) with zidovudine/lamivudine or abacavir/lamivudine. RESULTS: Twelve patients (67% female; median 14.4 years) were enrolled. After 24 and 48 weeks, respectively, 11 of 12 (92%) and 10 of 12 (83%) patients achieved viral load <50 copies/mL (intent-to-treat time-to-loss of virologic response); all had >/=1 log10 drop in viral load versus baseline. Median CD4 cell count increased by 175 and 221 cells/mm (intent-to-treat-noncompleter = failure) after 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. Eighty-three percent of patients were adherent to darunavir/ritonavir. One patient was never suppressed and 1 patient rebounded. No patients developed darunavir resistance-associated mutations or lost phenotypic susceptibility to any commercially available protease inhibitor or any background nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Eleven patients (92%) reported >/=1 adverse event (AE), considered in 2 patients to be at least possibly related to darunavir (gastrointestinal-related events and dizziness). Four patients had >/=1 serious AE. Three patients reported >/=1 grade 3/4 AE; no serious or grade 3/4 AEs were considered darunavir related. No patients discontinued because of AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Over 48 weeks, once-daily darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg plus NRTIs was effective and well-tolerated for treatment of HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral-naive adolescents (>/=12 to <18 years). These findings support use of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg in this population.
