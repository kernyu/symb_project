Research that leads to better strategies to diagnose and treat prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is critical because PJI is a devastating complication of total knee arthroplasty. A key to the diagnosis and management of PJI is defining the microbiology of PJI and improving the medical management of PJI utilizing both systemic and local antimicrobial therapy. In this review, the author will present his opinions on future research needs as they relate to the microbiology of PJI, including antimicrobial resistance and the antimicrobial treatment of PJI. This paper summarizes a presentation given at a recent multidisciplinary research conference entitled "Strategies to improve total knee arthroplasty" sponsored by the Knee Society. It was a part of a session entitled "Periprosthetic Joint Infection."
