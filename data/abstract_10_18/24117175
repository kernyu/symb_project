A strategy of using silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-loaded electrospun membrane as a novel coating material for preventing implant associated infections is reported. The strategy takes both the advantages of the excellent antibacterial as well as no drug resistance properties of AgNPs, and the widely used biodegradable electrospun membrane to serve as AgNP carrier and physical obstruction of bacteria adhesion. However, AgNPs have not been applied in clinical treatment yet because the concern of the potential toxicity. For the first time, we systematically investigated toxicity of AgNP-based coating materials in vitro and in vivo. Three dosages (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 wt %) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were embedded in biodegradable PLGA electrospun membranes as treatment devices to determine the precise concentration of AgNPs, minimize the dosage, and consequently reduced the toxicity in clinical applications. On the basis of antibacterial results and toxicity evaluations, PLGA electrospun membranes containing 0.5 wt % of AgNPs was considered as the most suitable combination, which is safe and effective for clinical application.
