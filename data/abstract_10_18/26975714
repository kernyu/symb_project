BACKGROUND: Monitoring of performance indicators and implementation of a computerized decision support system (CDSS) have been suggested as effective measures to improve quality of care. We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of monitoring of surgical prophylactic antibiotics (SPAs) and the CDSS on the antimicrobial use and resistance rate of major nosocomial pathogens. METHODS: An interrupted time series with segmented regression analysis in 3 periods (preintervention, SPAs monitoring, and CDSS) was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Immediate change and change in trends of antimicrobial use density, resistance rate of nosocomial pathogens, and cost of antibiotics in each intervention period were compared with those of the preintervention period. RESULTS: Compared with the preintervention period, the change in the slope of the total use of antibiotics was -8.71 defined daily dose (DDD) per 1,000 patient days per month (95% confidence interval [CI], -11.43 to -5.98; P < .01) in the SPAs monitoring period and -1.95 DDD per 1,000 patient days per month (95% CI, -2.93 to -0.96; P < .01) in the CDSS period. Use of third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides showed change comparable with that of total antibiotics use, but use of vancomycin and carbapenem was unchanged in the CDSS period. Trends of the proportions of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have been reversed or decreased in slope in the CDSS period. Length of hospital stay also showed a negative change in slope in the CDSS period. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of SPAs and implementation of the CDSS can be effective measures for antimicrobial stewardship.
