Recent surveillance data on antimicrobial resistance predict the beginning of the post-antibiotic era with pan-resistant bacteria even overcoming polymyxin as the last available treatment option. Thus, new substances using novel modes of antimicrobial action are urgently needed to reduce this health threat. Antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immune system of most vertebrates and invertebrates and accepted as valid substances for antibiotic drug development efforts. Especially, short proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMP) of insect origin have been optimized for activity against Gram-negative strains. They inhibit protein expression in bacteria by blocking the 70S ribosome exit tunnel (oncocin-type) or the assembly of the 50S subunit (apidaecin-type binding). Thus, apidaecin analog Api137 and oncocin analog Onc112 supposedly bind to different nearby or possibly partially overlapping binding sites. Here, we synthesized Api137/Onc112-conjugates bridged by ethylene glycol spacers of different length to probe synergistic activities and binding modes. Indeed, the antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa improved for some constructs, although the conjugates did not bind better to the 70S ribosome of E. coli than Api137 and Onc112 using 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-labelled Api137 and Onc112 in a competitive fluorescence polarization assay. In conclusion, Api137/Onc112-conjugates showed increased antimicrobial activities against P. aeruginosa and PrAMP-susceptible and -resistant E. coli most likely because of improved membrane interactions, whereas the interaction to the 70S ribosome was most likely not improved relying still on the independent apidaecin- and oncocin-type binding modes.
