Antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae, can be conferred by a large number of different acquired resistance genes, although it appears that relatively few dominate. A previous survey of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from Sydney, Australia, revealed that a limited set of genes could reliably predict resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) and aminoglycosides. Here we tested E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates with a cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and/or ceftazidime minimum inhibitory concentration of >/= 2 mug/mL from China and Singapore, with significantly higher resistance rates than Australia, as well as the USA. Few targets were needed to predict non-susceptibility to 3GCs (95/95; 100%) and gentamicin (47/51; 92%). The gene types detected here are consistent with previous surveys in similar countries with similar resistance rates, where the majority of 3GC resistance can be explained by blaCTX-M genes. This study identified a limited set of genes capable of predicting resistance to 3GC and aminoglycoside antibiotics and implies a restriction in the global resistance gene pool that can be exploited for diagnostic purposes.
