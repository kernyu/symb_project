Selection of resistant pathogens by antimicrobial use is probably the most important cause of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) refers to a multifaceted approach to optimise prescribing. The benefits of AMS programmes have been widely demonstrated in terms of reductions in antimicrobial use, mortality, Clostridium difficile and other healthcare-associated infections, hospital length of stay and bacterial resistance. Several kinds of interventions (i.e. restriction of drugs, pre-authorisation of certain antimicrobials, joint clinical rounds with prescribers, implementation of guidelines and education) have shown positive results. Regrettably, in most hospitals in Latin America, Asia and Africa as well as in a significant proportion of institutions in Europe and North America, essential human and material resources are scarce or absent, and teams are neither developed nor well functioning. Despite current or potential barriers, we should start or improve our already ongoing initiatives on AMS by considering the main specific problems and act accordingly with the available human and material resources. From supervising the use of specific classes of drugs to implementing more sophisticated decision support programmes, there is a wide range of possible useful interventions.
