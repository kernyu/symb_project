BACKGROUND: Prevention of infection due to multi-drug resistant organisms is particularly challenging because of the spread of resistant bacteria beyond hospitals into the community, including nursing homes. This study aimed to identify risk factors for the acquisition of a multidrug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli in a local outbreak. METHODS: Study participants were all aged over 65 years. Cases had the MDR E. coli isolated from a routine urine sample, and controls had a urine sample submitted to the laboratory in the same time period but the MDR E. coli was not isolated. Information from clinical records was used to identify risk factors both in the hospital and the community setting for acquisition of the MDR E. coli. RESULTS: 76 cases and 156 controls were identified and included in the study. In a multivariate analysis, risk factors statistically significantly associated with acquisition of the MDR E. coli were female gender (adjusted OR 3.2; 95 % confidence interval 1.5-6.9), level of care (high dependency OR 7.5; 2.2-25.7) compared with living independently), and in hospital prescription of antimicrobials to which the MDR E. coli was resistant (OR 5.6; 2.5-12.9). CONCLUSIONS: The major risk factors for the acquisition of a MDR E. coli were found to be residence in a nursing home and in-hospital prescription of antimicrobials to which the MDR E. coli was resistant. This emphasises that prevention of transmission of MDROs within a community needs to involve both hospitals and also other healthcare organizations, in this case nursing homes.
