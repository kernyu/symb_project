BACKGROUND: Lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir (ADV) are widely used in most Asian countries, though monotherapy is associated with the occurrence of resistance. AIM: To evaluate the efficiency of LAM and ADV combined treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients with compensated cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 206 eligible Chinese patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LAM or ADV for the first 24 weeks. According to virologic response at 24 weeks, the patients either continued to monotherapy or switched to combined therapy for 48 weeks. After 48 weeks, all patients received LAM and ADV combined therapy for 96 weeks. RESULTS: Serum HBV DNA levels significantly decreased in patients with ADV or LAM monotherapy and continuously reduced after the combined therapy. Serum ALT normalized rate were 88.24% and 81.37% at week 48, and 95.74% and 87.36% at week 96 in ADV and LAM group respectively, comparing to 60.78% and 56.73% in ADV and LAM groups at baseline. The accumulated virological breakthrough rate at week 48 and 96 was significantly higher in LAM group. CONCLUSIONS: Both combination strategies were resulted in the long term virological, biochemical improvement in Chinese chronic hepatitis B patients with compensated cirrhosis.
