The HCV viral life cycle provides targets for drug development at virtually every step, and many new drugs aimed at these targets are currently being developed. Clinical practice takes a major step forward this year with the arrival of telaprevir and boceprevir, which will be added to the current standard of care of pegIFNalpha/RBV. Patients will need to be monitored closely and counseled extensively, and clinicians will need to learn the new response-guided therapy algorithms with these therapies. Although there remains work to be done in the field of HCV, these therapies will allow many more patients the opportunity to eradicate HCV infection.
