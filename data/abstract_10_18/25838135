This report describes the first known laboratory-confirmed case of Mycobacterium fortuitum breast infection related to the hospital water supply. The source of the M fortuitum infection was identified by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based polymerase chain reaction genotyping. In addition, we discuss appropriate infection control measures to minimize patient exposure to waterborne pathogens, in particular, in the context of nontuberculous mycobacteria, which is difficult to eradicate from the water supply network.
