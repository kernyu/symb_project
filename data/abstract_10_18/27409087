OBJECTIVE: To determine the microbiological and resistance profiles of community acquired and nosocomial intra abdominal infections (IAIs) at the Surgery Service of Emergency and surgery critical care units from the Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From August 1st, 2013 till July 31st, 2014, patients undergoing surgery/interventional drainage for IAIs were included. RESULTS: The suitable cultures for the analysis were 169 (74 bile and 95 no bile cultures; 142 community acquired and 27 nosocomials). The microorganims more frequently isolated were E. coli (63.3%), K. pneumoniae (12%) and Enterococcus spp. (10%). The 43.5% of E. coli and the 21.23% of Klebsiella were ESBL producers. The carbapenems were the most active agents in vitro (100%), while the quinolones showed high resistance (>50%). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the most common microorganism in the IAIs. Because of the quinoloneaeuros high aeurooein vitroaeuro resistance, they should not be recommended as initial empirical therapy.
