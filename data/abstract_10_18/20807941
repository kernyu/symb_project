A 7-year-old female buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) from a local herd in Serres, northern Greece, was presented to a private veterinary clinic with a chronic loss of appetite for 15 days. The clinical examination revealed high fever (41.5 degrees C), lethargy, yellow discoloration of skin and mucous membranes, an abdomen that appeared to be empty, hyperactive rumen motility, and tachypnea. A biochemical profile revealed an elevated total bilirubin concentration and hepatic enzyme activities, whereas globulin, creatinine, and glucose concentrations were within the reference intervals. The animal received a 12-day course of treatment with intramuscular administration of ampicillin and corticosteroids. However, no significant clinical improvement was achieved, and the buffalo was euthanized. Gross necropsy lesions included serous atrophy of adipose tissue and hepatomegaly. Microscopic lesions included necrotizing pyogranulomatous hepatitis with thrombosis, hemorrhages, edema, and fibrosis. Small, nonpigmented, bacterial colonies were harvested in pure culture from the liver and were confirmed as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by polymerase chain reaction. The bacterium was sensitive to ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, colistin, polymyxin, trimethoprim/sulfamethaxazole, and chloramphenicol. In contrast, resistance to ticarcillin, piperacillin, imipenem, ceftazidime, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and tetracycline was displayed. The bacterial strain carried the L1 metallo-beta-lactamase (L1) and tet35 genes, which contribute to high-level resistance to beta-lactams and tetracycline, respectively. Although S. maltophilia is widely believed to be a contaminant, the present report suggests that the isolation, identification, and susceptibility testing of this multidrug-resistant bacterium may be of clinical importance in diagnostic samples.
