Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis has been controversial through the years, with various changes made to recommendations provided to treating physicians and dentists. The dentist must always use his or her best judgment when applying any guideline. However, it is important to remember that the guidelines may be cited in any malpractice litigation as evidence of the standard of care. Early diagnosis with prompt treatment with effective antimicrobial therapy is the best way to lower the mortality and morbidity. When prescribing antibiotics, the clinician must realize that the overprescription of antibiotics has led to resistance to antibiotic regimens and the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
