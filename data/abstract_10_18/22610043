Acinetobacter baumannii, a Gram negative bacterium causes nosocomial infections including bacteremia, secondary meningitis and urinary tract infections. Increased resistance of A. baumannii has been global concern. Till recently, carbapenems, latest generation of beta-lactams are used for treating infections caused by A. baumannii. Emerging resistance to carbapenem class is an immediate threat to mankind. The objective of present study is to understand the growing carbapenem resistance of A. baumannii. By using iso-electric focusing followed by (in-gel) nitrocefin assay of carbapenem resistant strains of A. baumannii, we could identify three beta-lactamases with pIs in the range 5.4-9.5. Expression of the beta-lactamase with a pI approximately 8.5, was found only in very high carbapenem resistant (MIC for imipenem 128 mug/ml) strains. On PCR analysis and sequencing of PCR product, this beta-lactamase was confirmed to be OXA-51. Identification of this protein from IEF gel was reconfirmed with the help of Liquid chromatography and Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Based on the amino acid sequence, OXA-51 found to be a 30 kDa beta-lactamase containing conserved functional motifs of class D serine beta-lactamase. In the present study, we have established the emergence of OXA-51 in clinical strains of A. baumannii in India which suggests its role in carbapenem resistance.
