BACKGROUND: Biofilms may contribute to refractory chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), as they lead to antibiotic resistance and failure of effective clinical treatment. l-Methionine is an amino acid with reported biofilm-inhibiting properties. Ivacaftor is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator with mild antimicrobial activity via inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether co-treatment with ivacaftor and l-methionine can reduce the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. METHODS: P aeruginosa (PAO-1 strain) biofilms were studied in the presence of l-methionine and/or ivacaftor. For static biofilm assays, PAO-1 was cultured in a 48-well plate for 72 hours with stepwise combinations of these agents. Relative biofilm inhibitions were measured according to optical density of crystal violet stain at 590 nm. Live/dead assays (BacTiter-Glo assay, Promega) were imaged with laser scanning confocal microscopy. An agar diffusion test was used to confirm antibacterial effects of the drugs. RESULTS: l-Methionine (0.5 muM) significantly reduced PAO-1 biofilm mass (32.4 +/- 18.0%; n = 4; p < 0.001) compared with controls. Low doses of ivacaftor alone (4, 8, and 12 mug/mL) had no effect on biofilm formation. When combined with ivacaftor (4 mug/mL), a synergistic anti-biofilm effect was noted at 0.05 muM and 0.5 muM of l-methionine (two-way analysis of variane, p = 0.0415) compared with corresponding concentrations of l-methionine alone. CONCLUSION: Ivacaftor enhanced the anti-biofilm activity of l-methionine against the PAO-1 strain of P aeruginosa. Further studies evaluating the efficacy of ivacaftor/l-methionine combinations for P aeruginosa sinusitis are planned.
