The Ecl1 family genes extend the lifespan of fission yeast when overexpressed. They also cause resistance against H(2)O(2) stress. In this study, we found that the bZip transcription factor Atf1 is a direct activator of the induction of extender of chronological lifespan (ecl1 (+)) by H(2)O(2) stress. Based on ChIP analysis, we identified that Atf1 binds to the upstream DNA region of ecl1(+). Previously, we reported that overexpression of ecl1(+) increased the expression of the catalase-encoding ctt1(+). This ecl1(+)-dependent increase of ctt1(+) expression occurred in atf1 mutant. On the other hand, the activation of ctt1 (+) caused by the pyp1 mutation, which enhances Sty1-Atf1 activity, could occur in ecl1 mutant. Based on these results, we propose that Atf1 can regulate ctt1(+) in both an Ecl1-dependent and an Ecl1-independent manner.
