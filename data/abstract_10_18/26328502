Triazole antifungals are frontline drugs for the treatment and prophylaxis of infections due to Aspergillus species. Azole resistance is an emerging problem and is associated with treatment failure in several case series. The management of azole-resistant invasive aspergillosis remains a challenge and there are no guidelines with appropriate recommendations. The current clinical practice suggests that liposomal amphotericin B or a combination of voriconazole or posaconazole with an echinocandin may be effective. Although cross-resistance within the azoles seems to be common, the role of azoles in the management of azole-resistant aspergillosis remains unclear, but optimizing drug exposure is critical for treatment success.
