Objectives: To evaluate the in vitro activity of ceftazidime/avibactam relative to comparator agents against Gram-negative isolates from a Phase 3 clinical trial programme for complicated urinary tract infections (RECAPTURE). Methods: The in vitro activity of ceftazidime/avibactam was evaluated against 840 Gram-negative pathogens isolated at baseline from 1033 randomized patients in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections. The trials were conducted in 160 institutions from 25 countries worldwide. Susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution at a central laboratory according to CLSI methodologies. Results: Overall, ceftazidime/avibactam showed significant activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MIC 90 values of 0.5 and 8 mg/L, respectively. Against the most common Enterobacteriaceae, MIC 90 values were 0.25 mg/L for Escherichia coli , 1 mg/L for Klebsiella pneumoniae , 0.06 mg/L for Proteus mirabilis and 2 mg/L for Enterobacter cloacae . The ceftazidime/avibactam MIC 90 for 154 ceftazidime-non-susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae was 1 mg/L and the ceftazidime/avibactam MIC 90 for 15 non-susceptible isolates of P. aeruginosa was 64 mg/L. There was a significant reduction in the ceftazidime/avibactam MIC relative to ceftazidime alone for most of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Conclusions: The ceftazidime/avibactam in vitro activity against these clinical urinary tract isolates demonstrates the potential utility of the drug in complicated urinary tract infections.
