Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) which is fatal if left untreated. This disease occurs in 36 African countries, south of the Sahara, where 60 million people are at risk of acquiring infection. The current chemotherapy relies on only four drugs, three of which were developed more than 60 years ago. These drugs have many limitations, ranging from oral inabsorption, acute toxicities, short duration of action and the emergence of trypanosomal resistance. Despite decades of use of most of the current trypanocides, little is known about their mode of action. That being said, African trypanosomes continue to be among the most extensively studied parasitic protists to date. Many of their intriguing biological features have been well documented and can be viewed as attractive targets for antitrypanosomal chemotherapy. A considerable number of natural products with diverse molecular structures have revealed antiparasitic potency in the laboratory and represent interesting lead compounds for the development of new and urgently needed antiparasitics. The major validated drug targets in T. brucei are discussed with particular emphasis on those known to be attacked by natural compounds.
