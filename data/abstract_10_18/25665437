INTRODUCTION: Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has revolutionized the care of infected patients. Among these novel compounds are non-nucleoside analogs, which bind viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase resulting in a conformational change inhibiting RNA synthesis. AREAS COVERED: Efficacy and tolerability of treatment regimens containing the non-nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitor dasabuvir (ABT-333). EXPERT OPINION: Dasabuvir-containing regimens achieve high rates of sustained virologic response in HCV genotype 1a and 1b-infected patients when combined with other DAAs, namely paritaprevir (ABT-450), ritonavir and ombitasvir (ABT-267). In the populations studied, dasabuvir seems to be well tolerated and safe. The major limitations of this novel drug are its genotype-restricted activity, the necessity to include ribavirin for HCV genotype 1a and the emergence of resistance if not combined with other DDAs.
