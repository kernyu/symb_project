In the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) era of hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy, health care providers must be knowledgeable about genotype and subtype of HCV infection and interpretation of quantitative HCV viral assays to monitor treatment responses. They may also choose to assess interleukin 28B genotypes or resistance-associated variants after ineffective DAA therapy. DAA therapies require understanding of performance characteristics of quantitative HCV RNA assays and the definitions of terms used to report results. Only quantitative HCV RNA assays with a limit of detection of 10 to 15 IU/mL are appropriate for managing patients on DAA therapy.
