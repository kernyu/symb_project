Flavobacterium psychrophilum is a serious pathogen of salmonids worldwide, a matter that is compounded by the lack of effective vaccine preparations. As a result, biosecurity measures and antimicrobial agents remain the only available methods to control diseases caused by F. psychrophilum. It is feared that antimicrobial use may have led to the development of F. psychrophilum strains with reduced susceptibility. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 50 F. psychrophilum isolates from Michigan in response to 10 antimicrobial compounds. As recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute and the World Organization of Animal Health, a standardized microdilution broth assay was employed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ampicillin (AMP), gentamicin (GEN), enrofloxacin (ENRO), oxolinic acid (OXO), flumequine (FLUQ), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (SXT), ormetoprim-sulphadimethoxine (PRI), erythromycin (ERY), florfenicol (FFN), and oxytetracycline (OXY). Epidemiological cutoff values were calculated using the normalized resistance interpretation (CONRI) and the ECOFFinder analysis methods (COECOFF). The MIC distributions in response to OXY exhibited bimodality, indicating the presence of isolates with reduced susceptibility in addition to the wild-type isolates. The OXY epidemiological cutoff values (COECOFF <0.06 mug/ml; CONRI <0.12 mug/ml) demonstrated that 24% of Michigan isolates exhibited reduced susceptibility to this commonly used drug. No other antimicrobial exhibited a bimodal distribution of MICs. This study represents the first antimicrobial susceptibility assessment of F. psychrophilum strains recovered from Michigan and contributes valuable data to the worldwide validation efforts to determine universal epidemiological cutoff values of this deadly fish pathogen.
