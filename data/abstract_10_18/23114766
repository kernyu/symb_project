A Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate recovered in Tunisia showed resistance to all beta-lactams and decreased susceptibility to carbapenems. K. pneumoniae 204 expressed the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase OXA-204, differing from OXA-48 by two amino acid substitutions (Gln98His and Thr99Arg) (class D beta-lactamase [DBL] numbering). OXA-48 and OXA-204 shared similar resistance profiles, hydrolyzing carbapenems but sparing broad-spectrum cephalosporins. The bla(OXA-204) gene was located on a ca. 150-kb IncA/C-type plasmid, which also carried the bla(CMY-4) gene. The bla(OXA-204) gene was associated with an ISEcp1 element, whereas the bla(OXA-48) genes are usually associated with IS1999.
