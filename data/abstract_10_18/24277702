Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important pathogen often encountered after solid organ transplantation and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Resistance of CMV to antiviral agents is becoming more common but with few treatment strategies. Two specific mutations in the CMV genome--the UL97 and UL54 genes--correlate with antiviral drug resistance. We describe a 49-year-old, CMV-seronegative woman who received a CMV-seropositive donor kidney transplant and appropriate CMV prophylaxis. Approximately 1 month after transplantation, the patient developed CMV viremia that responded to valganciclovir. She was later diagnosed with recurrent CMV infection, CMV resistance, and both the UL97 and UL54 gene mutations. The patient responded to foscarnet and significant reduction of immunosuppression; she was negative for CMV viremia for the next 12 months. This case illustrates the importance of having heightened awareness for the possibility of panresistant CMV early and decreasing immunosuppression as the cornerstone of treatment.
