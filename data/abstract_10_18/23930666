INTRODUCTION: The Herpesviridae are responsible for debilitating acute and chronic infections, and some members of this family are associated with human cancers. Conventional anti-herpesviral therapy targets the viral DNA polymerase and has been extremely successful; however, the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains, especially in neonates and immunocompromised patients, underscores the need for continued development of anti-herpes drugs. In this article, we explore an alternative target for antiviral therapy, the HSV helicase/primase complex. AREAS COVERED: This review addresses the current state of knowledge of HSV DNA replication and the important roles played by the herpesvirus helicase- primase complex. In the last 10 years several helicase/primase inhibitors (HPIs) have been described, and in this article, we discuss and contrast these new agents with established inhibitors. EXPERT OPINION: The outstanding safety profile of existing nucleoside analogues for alpha-herpesvirus infection make the development of new therapeutic agents a challenge. Currently used nucleoside analogues exhibit few side effects and have low occurrence of clinically relevant resistance. For HCMV, however, existing drugs have significant toxicity issues and the frequency of drug resistance is high, and no antiviral therapies are available for EBV and KSHV. The development of new anti-herpesvirus drugs is thus well worth pursuing especially for immunocompromised patients and those who develop drug-resistant infections. Although the HPIs are promising, limitations to their development into a successful drug strategy remain.
