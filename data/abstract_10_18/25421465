p-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS) is an important compound for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Previous studies showed that thyA mutations are often related to PAS resistance in clinical isolates. We performed a systematic analysis of isolate genotypes and detected mutations in three folate pathway genes (folC, thyA, and ribD) in 61.1% (127/208) of PAS-resistant isolates, including 11 double mutants. This result expands our knowledge about the distribution and frequency of mutations related to PAS resistance in mycobacterial clinical isolates.
