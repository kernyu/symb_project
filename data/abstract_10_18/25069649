Oxidative stress and tissue destruction are at the heart of periodontal diseases. The dental research area is geared toward the prevention of free radicals by nutrient antioxidants. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have recently attracted attention in alternative dental therapies. We aimed at highlighting the antioxidative property of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium strains and at determining their protective effect on gingival fibroblasts (GFs). Two Lactobacilli and 2 Bifidobacterium strains were screened for their exopolysaccharide (EPSs) production. Antioxidative assays were conducted by spectrophotometer analysis. Resistance to different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was determined by the serial dilution technique. The protective effect of strains on GFs on hydrogen peroxide exposure was also examined by a new trypan blue exclusion assay method. Bifidobacterium breve A28 showed the highest EPS production (122 mg/l) and remarkable antioxidant activity, which were demonstrated by its ability to scavenge 72% alpha,alpha-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical and chelate 88% of iron ion, respectively. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation was determined as 71% for the A28 strain. We suggest that LAB with antioxidative activity could be a good natural therapy agent for periodontal disorders.
