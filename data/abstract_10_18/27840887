Cutaneous tuberculosis (CTB) is probably underreported due to difficulties in detection and diagnosis. To address this issue, genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from 30 patients with CTB were mapped at multiple loci, namely, RD105 deletions, spacer oligonucleotides, and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit-Variable Number Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTRs). Fifty-eight strains of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) were mapped as experimental controls. Drug resistance-associated gene mutations were determined by amplicon sequencing of target regions within 7 genes. Beijing family isolates were the most prevalent strains in CTB and PTB. MIRU-VNTR typing separated the Beijing strains from the non-Beijing strains, and the majority of CTB could be separated from PTB counterparts. Drug resistance determining regions showed only one CTB strain expressing isomazid resistance. Thus, while the CTB strains belonged to the same phylogenetic lineages and sub-lineages as the PTB strains, they differed at the level of several MIRU-VNTRs and in the proportion of drug resistance.
