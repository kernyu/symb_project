In the era of carbapenem-resistance in Acinobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae, there are limited treatment options for these pathogens. It is essential that clinicians fully assess all available therapeutic alternatives for these multidrug-resistant organisms. We herein describe the approach of the antimicrobial stewardship team at the Detroit Medical Center (DMC) for the evaluation and use of intravenous (IV) minocycline for the treatment of these resistant organisms, given potential advantages of IV minocycline over tigecycline and doxycycline. In vitro analyses at the DMC demonstrated good activity against A. baumannii (78% susceptibility), including 74% of carbapenem-resistant strains, but limited activity against our carbapenem-resistant K.pneumoniae (12% susceptibility.) Based in part on these results, IV minocycline was added to the formulary, primarily for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Early experience has been positive: 6/9 (67%) of patients who received IV minocycline had infections due to these organisms cured, including 6/7 (86%) who received doses of 200 mg twice daily.
