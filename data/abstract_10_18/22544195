Burkina Faso began rapid antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up in 2003 and by December 2009, 26,448 individuals were on treatment. With rapid scale-up of ART, some degree of human immunodeficiency virus transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is inevitable. Following World Health Organization methods, between June 2008 and July 2009, Burkina Faso assessed TDR in primigravid pregnant women aged <25 years attending antenatal care clinics in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. TDR was classified as moderate (5%-15%) for both nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The observed moderate TDR in Ouagadougou is a cause for concern and calls for closer monitoring of Burkina Faso's ART program.
