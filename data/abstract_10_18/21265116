OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Tanshinone II A (Tan II A) on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) characterized by resistance to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). METHODS: A 21-year-old male patient with relapsed APL, who previously received the maintenance therapy with ATRA,ATO, 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and Methotrexate (MTX) for 1 year, was given Tan II A 80 mg intravenously once a day, and the changes of hematological parameters and side effects of Tan II A were observed. RESULTS: The patient reached morphologically complete remission after using Tan II A intravenously for 54 days. During Tan II A treatment, obvious side effect was not observed. CONCLUSION: Tan II A treatment may be effective in relapsed APL cases with ATRA and ATO resistance.
