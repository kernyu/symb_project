Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) is one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite its efficiency against AML cells, the emergence of drug resistance due to prolonged chemotherapy in most patients is still a major obstacle. Several studies have shown that drug resistance mechanisms alter the sensitivity of leukemia cells to immune system effector cells. To investigate this phenomenon, parental acute myeloid cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1, were continuously exposed to increasing doses of cytarabine in order to establish equivalent resistant cell lines, HL-60(R) and KG-1(R). Our data indicate that cytarabine-resistant cells are more susceptible to natural killer (NK)-mediated cell lysis as compared with parental cytarabine-sensitive cells. The increased susceptibility correlates with the induction of UL-16 binding proteins (ULBP) 1/2/3 and NK group 2, member D (NKG2D) ligands on target cells by a mechanism involving c-Myc induction. More importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that ULBP1/3 are direct targets of c-Myc. Using drug-resistant primary AML blasts as target cells, inhibition of c-Myc resulted in decreased expression of NKG2D ligands and the subsequent impairment of NK cell lysis. This study provides for the first time, the c-Myc dependent regulation of NKG2D ligands in AML.
