N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU) is a pivotal bifunctional enzyme, its N and C terminal domains catalyzes uridyltransferase and acetyltransferase activities, respectively. Final product of GlmU catalyzed reaction, uridine-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), acts as sugar donor providing GlcNAc residues in the synthesis of peptidoglycan and a disaccharide linker (D-N-GlcNAc-1-rhamnose), the key structural components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) cell wall. In the present study, we have searched new inhibitors against acetyltransferase activity of M. tuberculosis GlmU. A subset of 1607 synthetic compounds, selected through dual approach i.e., in-silico and whole cell screen against 20,000 compounds from ChemBridge library, was further screened using an in-vitro high throughput bioassay to identify inhibitors of acetyltransferase domain of M. tuberculosis GlmU. Four compounds were found to inhibit GlmU enzyme specific to acetyltransferase activity, with IC50 values ranging from 9 to 70 muM. Two compounds (6624116, 5655606) also exhibited whole cell activity against drug susceptible as well as drug resistant M. tuberculosis. These two compounds also exhibited increased anti-TB activity when tested in combination with rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol, however 5655606 was cytotoxic to eukaryotic cell line. These results demonstrate that identified chemical scaffolds can be used as inhibitors of M. tuberculosis cell wall enzyme after optimizations for future anti-TB drug development program.
