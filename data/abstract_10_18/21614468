OBJECTIVE: With growing antibiotics failure due to emerging resistance of bacteria, non-surgical management of pediatric UTI plays a more important role because of its non-invasive characteristics and little adverse effects. METHODS: We searched the Pubmed for management of UTI in children other than surgical correction and antibiotics using terms: risk factor, prepuce/phimosis, steroid cream/steroid, behavioral therapy, urotherapy, biofeedback/pelvic floor exercise, adrenergic antagonist, anticholinergics, diet/dietary, dysfunctional voiding/dysfunctional elimination syndrome, constipation, dietary, clean intermittent catheterization, probiotics/lactobacillus, cranberry, vitamin supplement, breastfeeding, breast milk, with infant/child/children/pediatrics/pediatrics and urinary tract infection. RESULTS: The proposed non-surgical management of pediatric UTI included behavioral modification (timed voiding and adequate fluids intake), topical steroid for phimosis, nutrient supplements (breast milk, cranberry, probiotics, and vitamin A), biofeedback training for dysfunctional voiding, anticholinergics for reducing intravesical pressure, alpha-blockers in dysfunctional voiding and neurogenic bladder, and intermittent catheterization for children with large PVR. CONCLUSION: The published reports usually included small number of patients and were lacking of randomization and controlled group. Further well-designed studies are warranted to support the concepts of non-operative management for pediatric UTI.
