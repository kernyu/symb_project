Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents in primary healthcare is low in Denmark compared with most other European countries. Denmark has a vaccination programme for children that recommends immunization against 10 infectious diseases, including a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and a vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV). Outbreaks in schools due to other infectious illnesses are well recognized and have seasonal variations. A quarter of young people have had a sexually transmitted disease before the age of 25 years. Denmark had a considerable interest in joining the e-Bug project to keep a focus on the low prevalence of bacterial resistance and the prevention of infectious diseases, and to maintain the acceptance of the immunization programme. Furthermore, the Danish Folkeskole, which is the Danish municipal primary and lower secondary school, uses the principle of differentiated teaching, integrating information technology, and there are no recommended textbooks in the curriculum. The teaching is organized so that it both strengthens and develops an individual student's ability to act and care for themselves and for society in general. e-Bug, in its design, was seen as a tool that could be implemented well in the Danish Folkeskole, as it fulfils the goals on teaching methods and output. Two thousand e-Bug packs were printed, 100 local education authorities and 1507 school principals were contacted, and e-Bug was presented to important stakeholders in relevant scientific magazines and at meetings. It has been well accepted.
