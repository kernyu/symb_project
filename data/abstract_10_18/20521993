IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Clostridium difficile is the most important definable cause of healthcare acquired diarrhea. The increasing incidence and mortality associated with this enteric pathogen and the significant rate of treatment failures and recurrences with current antibiotics emphasize the need for the discovery of new and improved therapeutic and preventative agents. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: We review upcoming novel therapeutic agents and the clinical evidence to support their efficacy in treating C. difficile infection. We also provide an extensive comparison of antimicrobial susceptibilities of C. difficile based on in vitro susceptibilities published in the literature. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review was conducted by a thorough examination of the public sources, including journals and scientific meeting abstracts, up to February 2009. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: A number of new therapeutic agents are in development and being tested in clinical trials. However, high costs and concerns for resistance may limit the use of these antimicrobials for the treatment of C. difficile infection. Passive and active immunotherapy may have important future roles as therapeutic and preventative strategies for C. difficile infection.
