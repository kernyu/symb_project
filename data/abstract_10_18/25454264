INTRODUCTION: The clinical manifestations of urinary infections, commonly mild and uncomplicated, have resulted in a generally empirical therapeutic decision-making process, which does not help fight resistances to antibacterial agents, thus causing a high rate of recurrence. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to reduce the clinical variability in the diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs). MATERIAL AND METHOD: The consensus document was developed using a nominal group methodology, using scientific evidence on RUTIs extracted from a systematic (noncomprehensive) literature review, along with the expert judgment of specialists and their experience in clinical practice. RESULTS: RUTIs are considered the manifestation of at least 3 episodes of uncomplicated infection, with a positive culture in the past 12 months, in addition to (for men) the absence of structural or functional abnormalities. We maintain that the treatment should be empiric when suspecting RUTIs (prior to obtaining a urine sample for culture) in those patients who have a high probability of recurrence, associated risk factors and/or urinary or general symptoms, such as fever and chills. Homogeneous criteria are recommended for the diagnosis and treatment in order to fight the increased rates of resistance that the microorganisms develop against antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: Imprecision in the identification of the infection requires a search for agreements on homogenized criteria and decision algorithms that guide the management of these patients.
