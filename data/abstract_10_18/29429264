Objective: Tests were carried out for obtaining contamination level and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella on broiler carcasses after chilling in four poultry slaughterhouses in Henan. Methods: Totally, two hundred sixty nine broiler carcasses after chilling were collected in four slaughterhouses with the daily slaughter amount around 15 000 to 50 000. For qualitative analysis of Salmonella EFSA method was used and for quantitative analysis of Salmonella modified Rappaport-Vassiliadis most probable number (MSRV-MPN) method was used. All of the isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 8 antibiotics by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: Overall, 48.7% (131/269) of the broiler carcasses after chilling were contaminated by Salmonella, and the average of contamination level is 1.32 most probable number MPN/g. Eight serotypes were detected. The dominant serotype is Salmonella enteritidis (93, 71.0%) followed by Salmonella Indiana (21, 16.0%). Only 2 (1.5%) Salmonella enteritidis strains were sensitive to all the tested antibiotics and the remaining 129 isolates were resistant to at least one kind of eight class antibiotics. Among them, resistant to NAL was the common (104, 79.4%) and 51 (38.9%) Salmonella isolates were multidrug-resistant. Conclusion: The contamination rate and multiple antimicrobial resistant of Salmonella on broiler carcasses after chilling from slaughterhouses was very serious, while the isolates contained various serotypes.
