Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most common opportunistic infections that affects patients with HIV. HIV and TB coinfection have a synergistic effect on each other, with one disease worsening the effects and treatment of the other. In the recent past, varying levels of drug resistance are also found in patients coinfected with HIV and TB, but rarely is it reported in children in India. The present case documents partial extensively drug-resistant TB in an 8-year-old child.
