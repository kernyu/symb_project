S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to a protein cysteine thiol to form an S-nitrosothiol (SNO) is rapidly emerging as a prototypic, redox-based post-translational modification during plant immune function. Here we review recently identified targets for S-nitrosylation and the consequences of these modifications in relation to the control of plant disease resistance.
