Renal fibrosis is a process that is characterized by declining excretory renal function. The molecular mechanisms of fibrosis are not fully understood. Oxidative stress pathways were reported to be involved in renal tissue deterioration and fibrosis progression. In order to identify new molecular targets associated with oxidative stress and renal fibrosis, differential proteomics analysis was performed with established renal cell lines (TK173 and HK-2). The cells were treated with oxidative stress triggering factor H(2)O(2) and the proteome alterations were investigated. Two dimensional protein maps were generated and differentially expressed proteins were processed and identified using mass spectrometry analysis combined with data base search. Interestingly the increase of ROS in the renal cell lines upon H(2)O(2) treatment was accompanied by alteration of a large number of proteins, which could be classified in three categories: the first category grouped the proteins that have been described to be involved in fibrogenesis (e.g. ACTA2, VIN, VIM, DES, KRT, COL1A1, COL4A1), the second category, which was more interesting involved proteins of the oxidative stress pathway (PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX6, SOD, PARK7, HYOU1), which were highly up-regulated under oxidative stress, and the third category represented proteins, which are involved in different other metabolic pathways. Among the oxidative stress proteins the up-regulation of PARK7 was accompanied by a shift in the pI as a result of oxidation. Knockdown of PARK7 using siRNA led to significant reduction in renal cell viability under oxidative stress. Under H(2)O(2) treatment the PARK7 knockdown cells showed up to 80% decrease in cell viability and an increase in apoptosis compared to the controls. These results highlight for the first time the important role of PARK7 in oxidative stress resistance in renal cells.
