The in vitro activities of 11 antifungal drugs against 68 Scopulariopsis and Microascus strains were investigated. Amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and ciclopirox showed no or poor antifungal effect. The best activities were exhibited by terbinafine and caspofungin, where the MIC and MEC (minimal effective concentration) ranges were 0.0313 to >16 mug/ml and 0.125 to 16 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC and MEC modes were both 1 microg/ml for terbinafine and caspofungin; the MIC50 and MEC50 were 1 microg/ml for both drugs, whereas the MIC90 and MEC90 were 4 microg/ml and 16 microg/ml, respectively.
