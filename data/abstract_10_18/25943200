Prolonged treatment of an immunocompromised child with oseltamivir and zanamivir for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection led to the emergence of viruses carrying H275Y and/or E119G in the neuraminidase (NA). When phenotypically evaluated by NA inhibition, the dual H275Y-E119G substitution caused highly reduced inhibition by 4 NA inhibitors: oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir.
