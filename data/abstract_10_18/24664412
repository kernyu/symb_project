The therapeutic applications of many anticancer or antimicrobial metal complexes often suffer from low solubility and low stability in physiological conditions or from drug resistance. To circumvent these problems, nanoparticle systems that allow controlled release and specific accumulation in the targeted disease tissue are of advantage for efficient treatment with minimal toxicity. The focus of this Research News is metal-based nanomaterials comprising anticancer gold(III)/platinum(II) complexes or antimicrobial silver, highlighting the controlled-release properties of self-assembled metal systems.
