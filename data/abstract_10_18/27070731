Tuberculosis (TB) remains a serious public health threat worsened by emerging drug resistance. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has become resistant not only to front-line drugs but also to second-line antimicrobials directed at drug-resistant TB. Renewed efforts are devoted for the development of new antibiotics active against TB. Also, repurposing of other antibiotics is being explored to shorten the time to develop new drugs against M. tuberculosis. As a result, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) has emerged as a potential new option to treat drug-resistant TB. SXT has been found to be surprisingly active against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis, not only in vitro but also in vivo. The potential role of SXT for the treatment of multidrug resistant/extensively drug resistant TB might be explored in further clinical evaluations.
