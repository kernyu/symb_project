We report the long-term results of the management of neglected chronically infected total knee replacements with a two-stage re-implantation protocol. In 18 of 34 patients (53%) a resistant organism was isolated. All cases were treated by the same surgical team in a specialist centre and had a mean follow-up of 12.1 years (10 to 14). They were evaluated clinically and radiologically using the Knee Society Score (KSS) and the American Knee Society Roentgenographic scoring system, respectively. One patient died after eight years from an unrelated cause and two were lost to follow-up. Three patients (8.8%) developed a recurrent infection for which further surgery was required. The infection was eradicated successfully in 31 patients (91.1%). There was one case of aseptic loosening after 13 years. We found a significant improvement in the KSS at final follow-up (p < 0.001).
