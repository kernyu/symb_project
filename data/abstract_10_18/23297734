Inclusion of low levels of antibiotics in the feed of domestic food animals promotes improved growth, animal performance and overall health benefits. However, this practice has come under scrutiny due to concerns over such feeding on bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR) and potential impact on human health. There is a paucity of data on the types and levels of AR genes that may be present in agricultural practices. Using PCR detection of AR genes, this study demonstrates that both stored swine manure and swine faeces harbour a variety of AR genes, and bacterial members of these communities contain genes that may move between micro-organisms. Thus, both ecosystems may serve as reservoirs of AR genes.
