OBJECTIVES: Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are the most common serious bacterial infections which are seen during infancy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate aetiology, and antimicrobial resistance patterns among infants and children who approached our hospital for treatment of UTIs. METHODS: In this observational study which was carried out from 2007 to 2010, 1575 urine samples which were collected from children with suspected UTIs were studied. Demographic characteristics, aetiological agents and antimicrobial resistance were evaluated. RESULTS: UTIs were more common in the 0-1 year age group, among males. Among females, UTIs were commonly seen after 2 years of life. The most common isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli spp (45.12%), followed by Klebsiella spp (18.17%) and Enterococcus spp (9.23%). Isolated pathogens were highly resistant to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and norfloxacin (82%-98%) and highly sensitive to gentamicin (83%),amikacin (76.5%), and nitrofurantoin (71.5%). CONCLUSION: The most common pathogen which caused UTIs in children was E. coli spp. The isolated pathogens were highly resistant to commonly used antibiotics, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole, while they were highly sensitive to gentamicin, amikacin and nitrofurantoin. So, these antibiotics may be used as alternative drug therapies for the treatment of UTIs.
