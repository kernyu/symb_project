CONTEXT: Multidrug-resistant organisms continue to be a problem for clinicians worldwide. AIMS: To analyze the changing trend of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in the blood isolates over a period of 4 years in our hospital. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a retrospective study done in tertiary care cardiac institute over a period of 4 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed blood culture positive isolates and studied the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of microorganisms during the period starting from January 2007 to December 2010. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS for windows version 13.0. Fisher exact test or chi-square test was applied for comparison of categorical variables. P values less than .05 were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The rate of blood culture positivity was 3.72%. Gram-negative bacteria were more common than Gram-positive bacteria. There was a gradual increase in Gram-negative bacteria especially Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter species. Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a significant increase of resistance to cefoperazone sulbactam (P = .023), piperacillin tazobactam (P < 0.001), imipenem (P < 0.001), and meropenem (P < 0.001) between the first (2007-2008) and second period (2009-2010) of study. The carbapenems resistance is on rise in Gram-negative bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is a definite increase in the multidrug resistant organisms. The data on the changing trends in antibiotic resistance, we believe is an important pillar in our efforts at improving infection control practices.
