BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is associated with high case-fatality rates and serious chronic sequelae. The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude of invasive pneumococcal infections in a pediatric population without universal vaccination during childhood in a single hospital. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of all pediatric cases of invasive pneumococcal infection during a 7-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the microbiological and clinical records of cases of IPD in children <13 years of age admitted to the Armed Forces Hospital, Southern Region, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: We identified 41 patients with IPD; 27 (66%) were <2 years of age. Four (50%) of those with pneumoccal meningitis were <2 years of age. The case fatality was 3 of 41 (7.3%) due to meningitis and 2 of 41 (5%) due to sepsis, with a case fatality of 5 (12%) due to meningitis and sepsis. Nine patients developed sequelae; of those with meningitis, 5 (73%) developed sequelae. Only 15 (41%) patients had predisposing medical conditions. The overall intermediate and high levels of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and ceftriaxone were found to be 48.5%, 2.4% and 2.4%, 0%, respectively. None of the pneumococcal isolates were serotyped, and none of the patients had been vaccinated against pneumococcal infections in our hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the presence of a targeted immunization program, a considerable number of cases of invasive pneumococcal infections were reported among our pediatric population over a period of 7 years. Prospective studies in serotypes and antibiotic resistance from the southern region are needed to provide baseline information for the formulation and evaluation of a national prevention and control program.
