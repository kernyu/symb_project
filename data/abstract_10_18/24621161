Mupirocin is a topical antimicrobial agent and part of most Staphylococcus aureus decolonization regimens. Thus, knowing the mupirocin susceptibility profile of colonizing S. aureus is paramount for the proper use of this agent. We evaluated S. aureus isolates from 128 colonized children, using disc diffusion (with 5 mcg and 200 mcg discs) and Etest. None were low-level or high-level mupirocin-resistant. Since mupirocin will be increasingly needed for the control of S. aureus infection, continuous monitoring of its susceptibility status is necessary.
