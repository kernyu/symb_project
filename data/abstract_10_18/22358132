BACKGROUND: Here, we investigated the treatment response and evolution of HBV resistance during lamivudine (LAM) plus adefovir (ADV) and entecavir (ETV) monotherapy in patients with ADV-resistant mutants. METHODS: Of the 53 patients with ADV-resistant mutants, 25 received combined LAM plus ADV therapy (LAM+ADV group) and 28 received ETV monotherapy (ETV group) for at least 12 months (median 24 months and range 12-67 months). RESULTS: During 24 months therapy, no significant difference was noted in HBV DNA reduction from baseline, HBV DNA<200 copies/ml, hepatitis B e antigen loss and ALT normalization between the two groups. In the LAM+ADV group, patients with single rtN236T resistant mutation had higher rates of undetectable HBV DNA than those with the double mutant rtA181T/V+rtN236T at months 3-18 of therapy. No virological breakthrough occurred except for one patient with rtN236T resistant mutation who experienced virological and biochemical breakthrough after the emergence of an additional rtA181T mutant under LAM+ADV therapy. Of the 28 patients receiving ETV monotherapy, ETV-resistant mutants developed in 8. The cumulative rates of ETV-resistant mutations and virological breakthrough at months 12, 24 and 36 were 3.6%, 25.7% and 46.8%, respectively. ADV-resistant mutations were rapidly replaced by LAM-resistant mutations (median 12 months) followed by ETV-resistant mutations. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in virological response between the LAM+ADV and ETV groups in patients with ADV-resistant mutants. LAM+ADV were less effective in patients with the double mutant rtA181T/V+rtN236T than the single rtN236T mutation. The incidence of ETV-resistant mutation was high in patients with LAM/ADV-resistant mutants treated with ETV monotherapy.
