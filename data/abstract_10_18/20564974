The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of C. difficile in the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized children under two years of age and a comparison of phenotypic and genotypic features. Hundred and seventy-eight samples collected from the faecal samples of children aged 2 months to 2 years, hospitalized in 2003-2006 were examined for the presence of toxin A/B of C. difficile. Toxigenicity of strains was confirmed using PCR. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using E-test. The percentage of children infected with C. difficile was 68.6%. Toxigenic of C. difficile strains A+B+CDT- accounted for 35%, A-B+CDT- 10%, and 5% were strains of A+B+CDT+. 50% of the cultivated strains were non-toxigenic. The percentage of strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin was respectively 52% and 42%. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was widespread concern 98% of strains, and the moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin was 8%. The percentage of resistant strains to imipenem was 50%. All tested strains were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin.
