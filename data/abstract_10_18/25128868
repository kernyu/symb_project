In this review we have evaluated the state of the art of CNT/UHMWPE and graphene/UHMWPE composites from four different points of view: mechanical properties, chemical stability, wear resistance and biocompatibility. The performance of these new carbonaceous composites allows us to conclude that these materials have overcome a first step on the way to developing into an alternative to the current HXLPEs used in orthopedic applications.
