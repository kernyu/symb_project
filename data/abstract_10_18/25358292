Syphilis is a chronic, multi-stage infectious disease that is usually transmitted sexually by contact with an active lesion of a partner or congenitally from an infected pregnant woman to her fetus. Although syphilis is still endemic in many developing countries, it has re-emerged in several developed countries. The resurgence of syphilis is a major concern to global public health, particularly since the lesions of early syphilis increase the risk of acquisition and transmission of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Because there is no vaccine to prevent syphilis, control is mainly dependent on the identification and treatment of infected individuals and their contacts with penicillin G, the first-line drug for all stages of syphilis. The emergence of clinically significant azithromycin resistance in Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, the syphilis agent, has resulted in treatment failures, thus precluding the routine use of this second-line drug. Information is presented here on the diagnosis and recommended antibiotic treatment of syphilis and the challenge of macrolide-resistant T. pallidum.
