AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) harbouring mutations associated with decreased susceptibility to protease inhibitors (Boceprevir/Telaprevir) among Polish untreated patients infected with HCV genotype 1. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Population sequencing was used, sequencing data were interpreted by web based geno2pheno algorithm. A total of 91 serum samples were obtained from patients infected with HCV genotype 1, admitting Outpatient Clinics of Hospital of Infectious Diseases, Warsaw. RESULTS: Sequencing analysis of the NS3 protease catalytic domain was successful in 85 out of 91 subjects. In seventy three (85.9%) out of 85 samples wild-type HCV was detected; in 12 (14.1%) samples mutations associated with clinically observed Boceprevir/Telaprevir-decreased susceptibility were detected. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results document the presence of HCV strains harbouring protease inhibitors (PIs) resistance-associated mutations among Polish therapy-naive patients. The determined prevalence of drug resistant HCV variants is 14.1%. Further and continuous surveillance is necessary to estimate how preexisting and emerging drug resistance mutations influence clinical outcome in triple-therapy experienced patients.
