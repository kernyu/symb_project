Medicinal leeches are commonly used after finger replantation to treat surgically unsalvageable venous congestion. Infection from Aeromonas hydrophila is a recognized complication of leech therapy that can be underestimated by the medical community. Ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are the most commonly recommended prophylactic antibiotics used to prevent A. hydrophila infections during leech therapy. Here, we report 2 cases of ciprofloxacin-resistant Aeromonas infections, occurring within 4 months of each other. Both cases developed after leech therapy for unsuccessful digital replantation. These infections were successfully treated with ceftriaxone. Ciprofloxacin-resistant Aeromonas should be recognized when determining prophylactic antibiotic protocols for replant centers when leech therapy is used for finger replantation.
