The aim of this study was to identify the resistance genes and genetic relationship of carbapenemase-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) identified in a tertiary university hospital in Turkey. During the study, CRKP was isolated from 137 patients. Resistance genes were studied in 94 isolates. Among these isolates, most of the CRKP produced only oxacillinase (OXA)-48 (91.5%); however, 4.3% of the isolates produced only New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), 1% produced both OXA-48 and NDM-1, and 3.2% produced imipenem. This study adds Turkey to the growing list of countries with NDM-1-producing bacteria and shows that NDM-1 may easily spread worldwide.
