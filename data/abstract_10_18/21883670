Despite intensive eradication therapy, some CF patients with early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection rapidly develop a chronic infection. To elucidate factors associated with this persistence, bacterial characteristics of early P. aeruginosa isolates were analysed that were either eradicated rapidly or persisted despite multiple antimicrobial treatments. Eighty-six early infection episodes were studied. First P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with eradication (36) or persistent infection (16) were included; isolates from patients with intermittent infection (34) were omitted from the study. Virulence assays, antimicrobial resistance, cytotoxicity and mutation frequencies were analysed in vitro. P. aeruginosa was genotyped by SNP-array. Transcriptomic profiles of two eradicated and two persistent strains were compared. Nineteen per cent of patients developed persistent infection; 42% achieved eradication. Secretion of virulence factors and mutation frequencies were highly variable among both eradicated and persistent isolates and were not different between the groups. Cytotoxicity was present in 57% of eradicated vs. 100% of persistent isolates (p <0.01). None of the isolates were resistant to antibiotics. The isolates were genotypically highly diverse. Multivariate analysis showed that in vitro determined bacterial characteristics could not predict persistence after first P. aeruginosa infection. Preliminary transcriptomic data showed increased expression of some genes related to a metabolic pathway. The early onset of chronic infection was not associated with (in vitro determined) bacterial characteristics only. Although the persistent isolates were more often cytotoxic, for the individual patient it was not possible to predict the risk of persistence based on bacterial characteristics. Unknown factors such as host-pathogen and pathogen-pathogen interactions should be further explored.
