OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of isolation and antifungal susceptibility profile of various opportunistic yeasts in faeces of patients with chronic diarrhea. PATIENTS: The study included 120 patients who received the consultation and treatment for the complaints of chronic diarrhea for a period of more than 15 days. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microscopy of samples of stool was followed by the culture on Sabourauds-dextrose agar. Isolate were tried for their sensitivity to fluconazole, flucytosine, amphotericin B and voriconazole. RESULTS: The significant growth of fungal organism was seen in 32 (26.7%) stool specimen. These fungal isolates include five (15.6%) of C. albicans, 14 (43.8%) of C. tropicalis, five (15.6%) of C. krusei, two (6.3%) of C. famata, two (6.3%) of C. parapsilosis isolates and one isolate each of C. lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii, Stephanoascus ciferri and Trichosporon asahii (3.1% each). Most of the yeast isolates (65.6%) were found to be sensitive to all four antifungal agents i.e., fluconazole, flucytosine, amphotericin B and voriconazole. The highest resistance was seen against fluconazole in 10 (31.3%) isolates followed by flucytosine in eight (25%) isolates. No resistance to voriconazole was observed in any of the isolates. The resistance to the antifungal agents was higher among the other species of Candida compared to C. albicans. CONCLUSION: The study could establish the relation between the opportunistic yeasts and chronic diarrhea and gives information on the antifungal sensitivity profile of the isolated yeasts.
