The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, multiple drug-resistance, and extremely drug-resistant strains demonstrates the need for improved strategies to discover new drug-based compounds. The development of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has provided new tools for global studies of living organisms. However, the compendium of expression profiles produced by these methods has introduced new scientific challenges into antimicrobial research. In this review, we discuss the practical value of transcriptomic techniques as well as their difficulties and pitfalls. We advocate the construction of new databases of transcriptomic data, using standardized formats in addition to standardized models of bacterial and yeast similar to those used in systems biology. The inclusion of proteomic and metabolomic data is also essential, as the resulting networks can provide a landscape to rationally predict and exploit new drug targets and to understand drug synergies.
