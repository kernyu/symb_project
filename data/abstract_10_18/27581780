Although many new antifungals have become commercially available since 2000, candidemia remains an important public health issue because of its poor prognosis. Some studies have suggested that early antifungal therapy is associated with decreased mortality; however, it is difficult to promptly diagnose candidemia because of the poor sensitivity of blood cultures. Thus, prophylaxis against Candida infection is recommended in patient groups in whom the risk of infection is high, such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients or those undergoing intensive remission-induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Non-Candida albicans candidemia is dominant among hematology patients, and the use of an echinocandin is recommended as the initial therapy. However, echinocandin-resistant Candida have been reported with increasing frequency, mainly in Candida glabrata. Several studies have reported that echinocandin resistance is associated with prior exposure to an echinocandin. Therefore, susceptibility testing is vital in treating severe or refractory candidemia, and the introduction of an antifungal stewardship program is recommended.
