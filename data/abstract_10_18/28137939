Objectives: A previous study on 12 in vitro -selected azithromycin-resistant Legionella pneumophila lineages showed that ribosomal mutations were major macrolide resistance determinants. In addition to these mechanisms that have been well described in many species, mutations upstream of lpeAB operon, homologous to acrAB in Escherichia coli , were identified in two lineages. In this study, we investigated the role of LpeAB and of these mutations in macrolide resistance of L. pneumophila . Methods: The role of LpeAB was studied by testing the antibiotic susceptibility of WT, deleted and complemented L. pneumophila Paris strains. Translational fusion experiments using GFP as a reporter were conducted to investigate the consequences of the mutations observed in the upstream sequence of lpeAB operon. Results: We demonstrated the involvement of LpeAB in an efflux pump responsible for a macrolide-specific reduced susceptibility of L. pneumophila Paris strain. Mutations in the upstream sequence of lpeAB operon were associated with an increased protein expression. Increased expression was also observed under sub-inhibitory macrolide concentrations in strains with both mutated and WT promoting regions. Conclusions: LpeAB are components of an efflux pump, which is a macrolide resistance determinant in L. pneumophila Paris strain. Mutations observed in the upstream sequence of lpeAB operon in resistant lineages led to an overexpression of this efflux pump. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of macrolides themselves participated in upregulating this efflux and could constitute a first step in the acquisition of a high macrolide resistance level.
