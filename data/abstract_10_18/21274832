Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) were isolated from ovine and caprine mastitis milk samples originating from more than 40 Swiss farms. CNS dominated as causal microorganisms of mastitis in small ruminants. By restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the groEL gene and sequencing of 16S rDNA, various CNS species were identified, albeit certain of them predominated. For susceptibility testing of mastitis pathogens to selected antibiotics, minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined. Of the 67 S. aureus and 208 CNS strains, 31.3 % and 8.2 % were resistant to penicillin, 29.9 % and 1.0 % to ampicillin, 1.5 % and 10.6 % to erythromycin, and 3.0 % and 7.7 % to tetracycline, respectively. Moreover, 10 CNS strains (4.8 %) were resistant to oxacillin and one CNS strain to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The results obtained describe for the first time the resistance situation of mastitis pathogens from sheep and goats in Switzerland. However, accompanying and preventing measures are also of importance in mastitis control of small ruminants.
