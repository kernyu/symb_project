A qnrVC-like gene, qnrVC4, was found in a novel complex class 1 integron gene cassette array following the ISCR1 element and bla(PER-1) in a multidrug-resistant strain of the aquatic bacterium Aeromonas punctata. The deduced QnrVC4 protein sequence shares 45% to 81% amino acid identity with quinolone resistance determinants QnrB6, QnrA1, QnrS1, QnrC, QnrVC1, and QnrVC3. A Ser-83 to Ile amino acid substitution in gyrase A may be mainly responsible for ciprofloxacin resistance in this strain.
