Influenza causes substantial morbidity in children in the United States each year. The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic disproportionately affected the pediatric population and resulted in a substantially increased number of hospitalizations and deaths among children. Early influenza antiviral treatment reduces the duration of illness, frequency of complications, antibiotic use, and health care utilization costs attributable to influenza. A comprehensive strategy to reduce influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths among children should include empiric antiviral treatment for suspected or confirmed influenza of any severity in children who are hospitalized; who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; or who are at high risk for influenza complications. Here, we summarize data on the burden of influenza among children in the United States, the indications for influenza antiviral treatment among children, the available evidence for influenza antiviral treatment, and antiviral treatment considerations, including resistance and adverse events.
