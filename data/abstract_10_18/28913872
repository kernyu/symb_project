BACKGROUND: The rate of H. pylori resistance to different antibiotics is increasing and determines the selection of eradication therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the resistance patterns of H. pylori strains in our area. METHODS: Biopsies from gastric corpus for microbiological culture and antibiotic resistance were obtained in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for dyspepsia. Selective Agar Pylori for isolation of the bacteria and Agar Mueller-Hinton supplemented with blood to test the sensitivity to antibiotics were used. Presence of H. pylori was confirmed using direct observation with phase-contrast microscopy and/or smears stained with acridine orange. In vitro bacterial susceptibility to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and levofloxacin was tested using diffusion MIC test strips. Minimum inhibitory concentration values were determined based on the 6th version of the EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) Clinical Breakpoint (2016). RESULTS: Two hundred and seventeen patients were included (58.1% female, median age 64 years, range 25-92). H. pylori was identified in 108 patients (49.8%); culture and antibiogram were completed in 77 of them (71.3% of H. pylori-positive patients). The resistance rates were as follows: levofloxacin 38.7%, rifampicin 33.3%, metronidazole 27% and clarithromycin 22.4%. No case of amoxicillin or tetracycline resistance was identified. Dual clarithromycin-metronidazole resistance was observed in 10% of strains, whereas multiple drug-resistant was observed in 14.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance rate of H. pylori to antibiotics is high in the northwest of Spain. The high resistance to levofloxacin and clarithromycin advises against their wide empirical use of these antibiotics in eradication regimens.
