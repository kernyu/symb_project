A high-resolution melt (HRM) assay using a Rotor-Gene 6000 instrument was developed to characterize the codon for glycine 54 in the cyp51A genes from 13 reference isolates and 12 clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus. Mutations in this codon confer reduced susceptibility to itraconazole and posaconazole. The assay is simple to perform, and a result of "wild type" or "mutant" is available after approximately 1 h following DNA extraction using commercially available reagents and conventional primers.
