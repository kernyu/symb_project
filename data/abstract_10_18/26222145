Bastimolide A (1), a polyhydroxy macrolide with a 40-membered ring, was isolated from a new genus of the tropical marine cyanobacterium Okeania hirsuta. This novel macrolide was defined by spectroscopy and chemical reactions to possess one 1,3-diol, one 1,3,5-triol, six 1,5-diols, and one tert-butyl group; however, the relationships of these moieties to one another were obscured by a highly degenerate (1)H NMR spectrum. Its complete structure and absolute configuration were therefore unambiguously determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of the nona-p-nitrobenzoate derivative (1d). Pure bastimolide A (1) showed potent antimalarial activity against four resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum with IC50 values between 80 and 270 nM, although with some toxicity to the control Vero cells (IC50 = 2.1 muM), and thus represents a potentially promising lead for antimalarial drug discovery. Moreover, rigorous establishment of its molecular arrangement gives fresh insight into the structures and biosynthesis of cyanobacterial polyhydroxymacrolides.
