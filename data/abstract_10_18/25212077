INTRODUCTION: The increasing frequency and antibiotic resistance among extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing bacteria are posing a serious threat. This study sought to investigate the frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae at a tertiary care hospital. METHODOLOGY: Data were collected from samples sent to the microbiology laboratory between 2006 and 2010 at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh. ESBLs were confirmed using Etest strips of cefotaxime/cefotaxime + clavulanic acid, ceftazidime/ceftazidime + clavulanic acid, and cefepime/cefepime + clavulanate. RESULTS: Out of 17,105 samples, 1,076 (6.3%) ESBL-producing isolates of E. coli (808) and K. pneumoniae (268) were confirmed. Among these, 680 (63.2%) isolates were found in urine samples, followed by 287 (26.7%) in superficial swabs, deep wounds swabs, tissues and sterile body fluids, 71 (6.6%) in respiratory, and 38 (3.5%) in blood samples. The overall frequency rates of ESBL E. coli and K. pneumoniae were 6.6% and 5.5%, respectively. The frequency of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae increased significantly during the study period. E. coli resistance against cotrimoxazole was 71.1%, followed by ciprofloxacin (68.2%) and gentamicin (47%). Similarly, 62.7% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to gentamicin, 59.5% to cotrimoxazole, and 49.8% to ciprofloxacin. There was no statistically significant change in antimicrobial resistance over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Although the frequency rates of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae increased, no change in the anti-microbial susceptibility was observed over the study period.
