In this study, we demonstrate the antibacterial activity of P128 on Staphylococcus isolates responsible for canine pyoderma. Eighty seven swabs were collected from dogs suffering from pyoderma and subjected to antibiotic sensitivity test and 46 Staphylococcus strains were isolated and characterized. In-vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing with P128 was done by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) method as per CLSI guidelines. All the Staphylococci isolated from the dogs with pyoderma, although showed resistance to various antibiotics tested, were lysed by P128. Clinical efficacy of P128 was examined in 17 dogs with pyoderma by application of the P128 hydrogel twice daily for 8 days and the results indicated complete healing of all the lesions of all the dogs under treatment. Under the conditions of this study, P128 was found to be a potent convenient proteinaceous drug for the treatment of staphylococcal pyoderma in dogs.
