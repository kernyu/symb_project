The preparation of cells from heavily contaminated tissue is challenging. It is usually best to avoid such specimens if possible, but for the study of colorectal and some other tumours, it is inevitable that this must be overcome. The best methods seem to use a combination of (1) debridement of necrotic or infected areas of the tumour, (2) enzymatic dissociation in the presence of antibiotics, (3) density centrifugation to remove debris, and (4) extensive washing of the tumour-derived cells prior to their use in cell culture methods. It is possible to obtain cells from up to 80-90% tumours with careful technique and cooperation from the clinical team.
