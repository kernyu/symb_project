The function of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family member c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-2 in resistance and pathology during infection has not been greatly studied. Here, we employed Jnk2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of JNK2 in resistance and immunity during oral infection with the protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. We found increased host resistance in the absence of JNK2 as determined by lower parasite burden and increased host survival. Lack of JNK2 also correlated with decreased neutrophil recruitment to the intestinal mucosa and less pathology in the small intestine. In the absence of JNK2, IL-12 production was slightly but significantly increased in restimulated splenocyte populations as well as in purified splenic dendritic cell cultures. These results provide evidence that expression of JNK2 plays a role in T. gondii-induced immunopathology, at the same time in promoting susceptibility to this parasitic pathogen.
