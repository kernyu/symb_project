Gonorrhea remains as a significant public health concern with an estimated 88 million new cases per year globally. Gonorrhea is a disease of sexual networks and is most prevalent in youth, men who have sex with men, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Highly adaptive through years of co-evolution, gonorrhea has developed multiple ways of evading the human immune system. Although new molecular-based strategies have opened avenues for less invasive testing, education and accessibility issues persist. Novel strategies, including use of the internet and social media, are required to better target high risk groups for education, testing, and treatment. Increasing the availability of youth-friendly health services will also help foster earlier gonorrhea diagnosis and management. The inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics and propensity of gonococcus for mutation has led to growing microbe resistance. Treatment failures now include both oral and intravenous formulations of third generation cephalosporins; key front line recommended gonococcal treatment in many countries. With treatment options dwindling, the need for better preventative strategies has never been more important. This overview highlights some of the major aspects of gonococcal infection, including the epidemiology of the disease with an emphasis on sexual networks, new diagnostic techniques, treatment options in the face of evolving gonococcal resistance, and notes potential new preventative strategies.
