AIMS: To characterize the diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli isolates recovered within the faecal microbiota of Iberian lynx. The identification of other associated resistance genes and the analysis of clonal relationship were also focused in this study. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 2008 to 2010, 128 faecal samples of Iberian lynx (wild and captive animals) were collected. Eleven tested samples contained cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates (all belonging to captive animals) and 10 ESBL-producing isolates were showed. CTX-M-14 and SHV-12 ESBL-types were detected and seven different patterns were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of unrelated multiresistant E. coli in faecal flora of captive specimens of Iberian lynx, including the presence of ESBLs, resistant genes in integrons and virulence determinants was showed in this study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results obtained in this study highlight the environmental problem as future reintroductions of Iberian lynx could lead to a spread of resistant bacteria. Additionally, ESBL-producing bacteria can represent a health problem for this endangered species.
