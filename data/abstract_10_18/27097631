Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is characterized by chronic inflammation, recurrent abscesses, and scarring. Surgery is performed when medical management and antibiotic therapy fails. This study sought to evaluate the demographics, surgical procedures, bacteriology, pharmacologic intervention, and quality of life of patients with recalcitrant HS requiring surgical intervention. A retrospective chart review was performed of 76 recalcitrant HS patients at the University of Illinois Medical Center. Patient demographics, bacterial culture, and surgery data were reviewed. Quality of life was assessed using the 36-item short-form health survey. Patients were mostly female (73.7%) and African American (81.6%) with a mean duration of symptoms of 8.6 years before surgery. Patients underwent at least one surgical procedure, most often to the axillae (57.6%) and 73.7 per cent received antibiotics. The most common culture isolates were Corynebacterium species (14.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (13.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%) with varying resistance patterns. Surveyed patients had depressed 36-item short-form health survey physical functioning and social functioning scores. Recalcitrant HS patients with progressive symptomology over approximately nine years before surgical intervention were more likely to be African American women with axillary HS. Quality of life was diminished. We recommend initial treatment of HS with clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in clindamycin refractory cases.
