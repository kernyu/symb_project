PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to: (1) examine the antibiotic prescribing practices of pediatric dentists and adherence to professional guidelines; and (2) assess their knowledge of and attitudes toward antibiotic resistance. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey regarding antibiotic use, resistance, and knowledge of antibiotic stewardship programs was emailed to 4,636 members of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD). RESULTS: 987 surveys (21 percent) were completed; 984 were analyzed. Lack of adherence to AAPD antibiotic guidelines was noted. There was a trend toward overuse of antibiotics for the following conditions: irreversible pulpitis with (32 percent) and without vital pulp (42 percent); localized dentoalveolar abscess with (68 percent) and without draining fistula (39 percent); mitral valve relapse with regurgitation (43 percent); intrusion (15 percent); extrusion (13 percent); and rheumatoid arthritis (12 percent). Determinants of antibiotic use were: facial swelling (88 percent); pain relief (15 percent); unavailable appointment for several weeks (six percent); and parental satisfaction (four percent). Although 98 percent of respondents believed that antibiotic resistance is of growing concern, only 15 percent were aware of antibiotic stewardship programs. CONCLUSION: AAPD members overprescribe antibiotics. Educational programs to increase knowledge of antibiotic resistance and stewardship programs should be implemented to increase adherence to professional guidelines.
