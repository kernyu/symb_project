To gain insight into the epidemiology of childhood drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in China that has the second largest burden of TB and the largest number of multidrug resistant (MDR) TB cases in the world, we performed the cross-sectional study to investigate drug resistance of four first-line anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol) using Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 196 culture-confirmed pediatric TB cases diagnosed in the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China during 2008-2013. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between patient demographic and clinical characteristics and DR-and MDR-TB, respectively. Twenty-eight percent (56/196) of the study patients exhibited resistance to at least one of the four first-line anti-TB drugs tested. MDR was found in 4.6% (9/196) of the study patients. More than half (5/9, 55.6%) of the MDR cases were from a single county of Chongqing. A significant association was found between being acid-fast bacilli-smear negative and DR-TB (adjusted OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.13-4.80) and between having concurrent thoracic-extrathoracic involvement and MDR-TB (adjusted OR, 9.49; 95% CI, 1.05-85.92), respectively. The findings of this study indicate that the rate of DR is high among pediatric TB patients in Chongqing and suggest an urgent need for studies to identify MDR transmission hotspots in Chongqing, thereby contributing to the control DR- and MDR-TB epidemics in China. The study also generates new insight into the pathogenesis of DR and MDR M. tuberculosis strains and highlights the importance of studying childhood TB to the goal of global TB control.
