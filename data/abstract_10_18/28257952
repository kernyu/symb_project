BACKGROUND: Giardiasis is one of the main parasites that infect the gastrointestinal tract of humans, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Antiparasitics administered to treat giardiasis are inefficient in 20% of the cases, usually because of parasite resistance and side effects. In this scenario, microemulsions are a promising pharmaceutical alternative as carriers of molecules with therapeutic action that stimulate the immune system. METHODS: The study evaluated the effects of a microemulsion delivery system with levamisole hydrochloride on the functional activity of MN phagocytes incubated with G. lamblia. RESULTS: The microemulsion formulated was incorporated with levamisole hydrochloride using distilled water, caprylic/capric triglyceride-Polymol 812(R), Sorbitan Oleate-Span 80(R), Polysorbate 80 - Tween 80(R) and 1-butanol. The activity of the microemulsion was analyzed by phagocytosis rate, microbicidal activity, apoptosis rate and intracellular calcium concentration. Phagocytosis rate, microbicidal activity and apoptosis index increased in the microemulsion treatment. The results suggest that the microemulsion improves the therapeutic efficacy of levamisole, increasing the functional activity of phagocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The microemulsion with a levamisole delivery system is therefore an efficient alternative for treating giardiasis, acting as an immunomodulator that probably causes fewer side effects than conventional drugs.
