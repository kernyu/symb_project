The in vitro and in vivo activity of the inositol acyltransferase inhibitor E1210 was evaluated against echinocandin-resistant Candida albicans. E1210 demonstrated potent in vitro activity, and in mice with invasive candidiasis caused by echinocandin-resistant C. albicans, oral doses of 10 and 40 mg E1210/kg of body weight twice daily significantly improved survival and reduced fungal burden compared to those of controls and mice treated with caspofungin (10 mg/kg/day). These results demonstrate the potential use of E1210 against resistant C. albicans infections.
