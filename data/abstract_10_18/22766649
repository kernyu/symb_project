PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria can cause serious infections in solid-organ transplant recipients. This review focuses on the role of MDR bacteria in posttransplant infections. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of MDR bacterial infections among solid-organ transplant recipients is increasing steadily. There is wide variability in the specific MDR bacteria causing infection based on the organ transplanted, geography, timing with respect to transplantation, and additional risk factors. Rarely these infections can be transmitted via the transplanted organ. Prompt recognition and early appropriate treatment of MDR bacterial infections are especially critical in this immunosuppressed population. In order to promptly initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy for these organisms, high-risk patients should receive appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics. SUMMARY: MDR bacterial infections vary widely and require careful antibiotic selection to reduce mortality.
