Novel series of novel 3-O-arylalkylcarbamoyl descladinosylazithromycin derivatives with the 2'-O-acetyl and 11,12-cyclic carbonate groups, the 11,12-cyclic carbonate group and the 11-O-arylalkylcarbamoyl side chain, and 2'-O-arylalkylcarbamoyl descladinosylazithromycin with the 11,12-cyclic carbonate group were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity using broth microdilution method. The results showed that the majority of the target compounds showed moderate to favorable activity against six kinds of susceptible strains and almost all of them displayed significantly improved activity compared with references against three erythromycin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae B1 expressing the ermB gene, S. pneumoniae AB11 expressing the ermB and mefA genes, and S. pyogenes R1. In particular, compound 6h exhibited the most potent activity against susceptible B. subtilis ATCC9372 (0.5 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (0.125 mug/mL), and erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae B1 (1 mug/mL) and S. pneumoniae AB11 (1 mug/mL), which were 2-, 2-, 256-, 256-fold better activity than azithromycin, respectively. Additionally, compounds 6f (0.5 mug/mL) and 6g (0.25 mug/mL) were the most active against S. pneumoniae A22072, which were 8- and 16-fold better activity than azithromycin (4 mug/mL). As for erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes R1, compound 5a presented the most excellent activity (8 mug/mL), showing 32- and 32-fold higher activity than azithromycin (256 mug/mL) and clarithromycin (256 mug/mL).
