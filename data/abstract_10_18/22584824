The growing resistance of many strains of bacteria to antibiotics and antiseptics is becoming a serious problem in medicine. Nano-silver is one of the most prominent products in medicine because it exhibits unusual physicochemical properties and a strong biological activity. In this work an innovative silver deposition technology was applied to temporary polyurethane catheters for haemodialysis. The working conditions of catheters were reproduced through laboratory equipment that ensured the flow of deionized water and simulated body fluid inside the lumina at corporeal temperature. The growth and the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus on the surface of the device were studied through fluorescence microscopy. ICP-AES was adopted to calculate the amount of silver released from the substrate. The stability of the coating during the whole working life of the device was demonstrated through thermo-gravimetric analysis.
