In recent years the proportion of multi-drug resistance (MDR) among the bacterial pathogens causing infections, particularly those acquired in healthcare settings, has risen worryingly worldwide. It poses a serious public health threat as the multiple patterns of resistance limit the effective treatment options for such infections. Although many bacterial species have developed reduced susceptibility to a wide array of antimicrobial molecules, a particular group of pathogens acronymically referred to as ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) plays a clinically relevant role in the aetiology of life-threatening nosocomial infections. In this review, we represent the rise of MDR among the ESKAPE pathogens over the decades and report studies from each continent showing the current prevalence and burden of such infections worldwide.
