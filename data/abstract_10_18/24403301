The identification of pathogens directly from blood cultures by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) can be a valuable tool for improving the treatment of patients with sepsis and bacteremia. However, the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria makes it difficult to predict resistance patterns based only on pathogen identification. Most therapy regimens for sepsis caused by Gram-negative rods consist of at least one beta-lactam antibiotic. Thus, it would be of great benefit to have an early marker of resistance against these drugs. In the current study, we tested 100 consecutive blood cultures containing Enterobacteriaceae for resistance against 3rd-generation cephalosporins in a MALDI-TOF MS beta-lactamase assay. Escherichia coli was also tested for resistance against aminopenicillins. The results of the beta-lactamase assay were compared with those of conventional methods. The assay permitted discrimination between E. coli strains that were resistant or susceptible to aminopenicillins with a sensitivity and a specificity of 100%. The same was true for resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae that constitutively produced class C beta-lactamases. Discrimination was more difficult in species expressing class A beta-lactamases, as these enzymes can generate false-positive results. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity for this group were 100% and 91.5%, respectively. The test permitted the prediction of resistance within 2.5 h after the blood culture was flagged as positive.
