Wetland construction is a recommended domestic sewage treatment technique, owing to its simplicity and cost efficiency. Concentrations of 14 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in an integrated surface flow constructed wetland (ICW) steadily operated over 10 years were investigated in the winter and summer. Domestic sewage was observed to be the primary source of ARGs in the ICW, and 77.8% and 59.5% removal rates of total targeted ARGs in the ICW were achieved in the winter and summer, respectively. Concentrations of five ARGs (sul1, tetA, tetC, tetE, and qnrS) in the winter and of six ARGs (sul1, sul3, tetA, tetC, tetE, and qnrS) in the summer were increased throughout the treatment process. Strong correlations were found between ARGs in water and those found in sediments, especially in the summer, indicating that ARGs may be exchanged between water and sediment. Strong positive correlations were also observed between concentrations of intI1 and several ARGs, implying that mobile genetic elements may play a key role in the dissemination of ARGs in an ICW. Our study results suggest aqueous ARGs could be effectively removed via an ICW and that ICWs can also act as reservoirs of specific ARGs.
