The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu((R))), zanamivir (Relenza((R))), laninamivir octanoate (Inavir((R))), and peramivir (Rapiacta((R))) have been available for the treatment of influenza in Japan since 2010. The emergence of resistant virus to any of the NAIs is a great concern for influenza treatment. To assess the extent of viral resistance, we measured the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each NAI for influenza virus isolates in the 2012-2013 influenza season and compared the results to those of the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 influenza seasons. Viral isolation of specimens obtained prior to treatment was done using Madine-Darby canine kidney cells, and the type and subtype of influenza, A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), or influenza B, was determined by RT-PCR using type- and subtype-specific primers. The IC50 was determined by a neuraminidase inhibition assay using a fluorescent substrate. A total of 329 influenza viruses were isolated:5 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (1.5%), 316 influenza A(H3N2) (96.1%), and 8 influenza B (2.4%). No isolate showed an IC50 value exceeding 50 nM for any of the neuraminidase inhibitors. The IC50 values for A(H3N2) and B were similar to those of the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 seasons. No isolate showed an increased IC50 value for A(H1N1)pdm09. These results indicate that the currently epidemic influenza viruses are susceptible to all four neuraminidase inhibitors, with no trend for IC50 values to increase at present.
