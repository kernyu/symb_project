The development of new antibacterial agents to combat worsening antibiotic resistance is still a priority area in anti-infectives research, but in the post-genomic era it has been more difficult than expected to identify new lead compounds from high-throughput screening, and very challenging to obtain antibacterial activity for lead compounds. Bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis is a well-established target for antibacterial chemotherapy, and recent developments enable the entire biosynthetic pathway to be reconstituted for detailed biochemical study and high-throughput inhibitor screening. This review article discusses recent developments in the availability of peptidoglycan biosynthetic intermediates, the identification of lead compounds for both the earlier cytoplasmic steps and the later lipid-linked steps, and the application of new methods such as structure-based drug design, phage display and surface science.
