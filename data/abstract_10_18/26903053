OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, clinical features, and treatment of perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, as well as the factors affecting the therapeutic effect of ganciclovir. METHODS: The clinical data of 237 infants who were hospitalized and diagnosed with perinatal CMV infection from 2008 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical features of infants with perinatal CMV infection and the proportion of such infants in all hospitalized infants showed no significant differences across the five years. In most infants, two or more systems were involved, and CMV hepatitis plus CMV pneumonia was most common (43.1%). The results of pathogen detection showed that the percentage of the infants with positive blood CMV-IgM and blood/urine CMV-DNA was 3.8%, while 90.3% of all infants had positive blood CMV-IgM alone and 5.9% had positive blood/urine CMV-DNA alone. A total of 197 infants were treated with ganciclovir, and the cure rate was 88.3%. An abnormal history of pregnancy (OR=6.191, 95% CI: 1.597-24.002) and liver involvement before medication (OR=3.705, 95% CI: 1.537-8.931) were the independent risk factors affecting the therapeutic effect of ganciclovir in infants with perinatal CMV infection. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological characteristics of perinatal CMV infection have remained generally stable for the last 5 years. CMV often involves several organs or systems, especially the liver and lung. Ganciclovir has a significant efficacy in the treatment of perinatal CMV infection, and an abnormal history of pregnancy and liver involvement before medication can increase the risk of ganciclovir resistance in infants with perinatal CMV infection.
