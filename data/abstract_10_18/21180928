Surveillance systems monitoring the spread and divergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are critical if preventive and therapeutic measures targeting MRSA infection are to be employed optimally. Surveillance provides information on the spread of MRSA, on the emergence of new strains within hospitals and communities, on the antibiotic resistance profile and virulence of strains, and on the risk factors associated with infection. These data help clinicians to provide appropriate empiric treatment of infections circulating in their region, leading to improved patient outcomes. While information on MRSA epidemiology in Latin America is growing, significant gaps exist in the available data, especially in local areas where fewer resources are available for characterizing and reporting MRSA strains. Here, we describe current knowledge of healthcare- and community-associated MRSA epidemiology in the region, and provide recommendations for future development of surveillance systems with a view to providing robust data at regional, national and local levels.
