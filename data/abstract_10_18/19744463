A total of 182 Escherichia coli isolates from animals, environment and workers of dairy cattle, swine and chicken farms in Shandong which locates in Eastern China, were investigated for antimicrobial resistance as well as prevalence and the transfer mechanisms of integrons. The results revealed isolates from swine and chicken farm exhibited high levels of resistance to antimicrobial agents. The positive rate of gene cassette of class 1 integron in dairy cattle, swine and chicken farms was 5%, 20% and 41.94%, respectively. Only four isolates possessed class 2 integron, all of which were from chicken farm. Nine distinct cassette arrays were detected and two novel gene cassette arrays yheSDelta-yheR-kefBDelta and chrADelta-sul1-qacEDelta1-orf5-aadA5-dfrA17 were identified in class 1 integron for the first time. Class 1 integrons were found to be located mostly in both chromosomal and conjugative plasmid through southern hybridization and conjugation. PFGE revealed clonal relatedness among the isolates from different sources, especially within the same farm. The results confirmed the antimicrobial resistance and prevalence of integrons were strongly associated with the selection pressure of antimicrobial agents, and resistance genes in animal farms were probably spread by both vertical and horizontal transfer.
