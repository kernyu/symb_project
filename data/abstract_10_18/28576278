Conventional antimicrobial strategies have become increasingly ineffective due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria. In order to overcome this problem, antimicrobial PhotoDynamic Therapy (PDT) is considered a promising alternative therapy. PDT has a broad spectrum of action and low mutagenic potential. It is particularly effective when microorganisms present endogenous photosensitizing pigments. Helicobacter pylori (Hp), a pathogen notoriously responsible of severe gastric infections (chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, MALT lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma), produces and accumulates the photosensitizers protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin, thus it might be a suitable target of antimicrobial PDT. With the aim to design and develop an ingestible LED-based robotic pill for intragastric phototherapy, so that irradiation can be performed in situ without the use of invasive endoscopic light, photophysical studies on the Hp endogenous photosensitizers were carried out. These studies represent an important prerequisite in order to select the most effective irradiation conditions for Hp eradication. The photophysical characterization of Hp porphyrins, including their spectroscopic features in terms of absorption, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, was performed on bacterial extracts as well as within planktonic and biofilm growing Hp cells.
