PURPOSE: Kidney fibrosis is the most common final stage of progressive renal disease. Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) has been shown to be important in both preservation of kidney function and resistance to injury. Recently, it has been realized that uterine sensitization-associated gene-1 (USAG-1) functions as a kidney-specific BMP antagonist. Because of the reported anti-fibrotic effects of artesunate (Art), this study was designed to investigate the effects of Art on renal fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) rats and to explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: Sham group, UUO group, low-dose Art-treated (Art-L), middle-dose Art-treated (Art-M), and high-dose Art-treated (Art-H) groups. The UUO rat model was established by ligating the left ureter. Fourteen days later, interstitial collagen deposition, expression of USAG-1, BMP-7, E-cadherin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), fibronectin (FN), collagen I, as well as the inflammatory infiltration levels in the kidneys were assessed. RESULTS: Art treatment significantly attenuated the deposition of interstitial collagens in the UUO rats' kidneys and exhibited the ability to improve renal function, followed by the up-regulated expression of BMP-7 and E-cadherin and the down-regulated expression of USAG-1 and alpha-SMA. In addition, increased macrophages infiltration in the kidneys of the UUO rats were also attenuated by the administration of Art. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Art is able to improve the renal function decline and renal fibrosis induced by UUO, which may be associated with the up-regulation of BMP-7 and down-regulation of USAG-1. Accordingly, Art may become a potential preventive or therapeutic agent for chronic kidney diseases.
