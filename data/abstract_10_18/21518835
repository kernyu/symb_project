VIM-27 metallo-beta-lactamase, an Ala(57) --> Ser variant of VIM-1, was identified in three Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates belonging to sequence type 147. bla(VIM-27) was part of a class 1 integron carried by non-self-transferable plasmids. Kinetic parameters and MIC determinations indicated that VIM-27 hydrolyzed most beta-lactams, especially imipenem and cefoxitin, less effectively than VIM-1.
