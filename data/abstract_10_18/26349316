The community associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a serious issue of public health. Here, we conducted an experimental approach to determine: (i) the optimal significant stimulation range of electrical current for effective checking of CA-MRSA growth; (ii) the effect of electrical stimulations on methicillin susceptibility and possible beta lactam resistance reversal; and (iii) the variation in the level of ATP as function of exposure to electric current. An 8 chambered electrical system was developed for DC flow in control and test sets, with and without drug (oxacillin 4 mg/ml). Measurement of growth by CFU/ml and spectrometry, susceptibility and ATP levels were calculated and interpreted. Linear pattern in reduction of ATP was observed with respect to the intensity of electric current (EC) and an enhanced inhibitory effect was explicit with 1000 microampere (muA) with 30 min exposure. At 4000 muA exposure to DC at 180 min and in combination of drug (muA+D), the growth of CA-MRSA was substantially checked to 0.23 absorbance in comparison to current without drug and the effect of DC electrical current to the culture showed that 10 muA, 100 muA and 4000 muA current exposure in combination of oxacillin (muA+D), markedly reduced the CFU to an average of 256.4. ATP level was linearly reduced with exposure to EC.
