Mycoplasma contaminations have a multitude of effects on the cultured cell lines that may influence the results of experiments or pollute bioactive substances used in human medicine. The elimination of mycoplasma contaminations of cell cultures has become a practical alternative to discarding and reestablishing important or irreplaceable cell lines. Different quinolones, tetracyclines, and pleuromutilins shown to have strong antimycoplasma properties are employed for the decontamination. We provide detailed protocols to assure eradication of mycoplasma, to prevent formation of resistant mycoplasma strains, and to cure heavily contaminated and damaged cells. To date, we have not detected any consistent and permanent alterations to eukaryotic cells either during or after the treatment.
