INTRODUCTION:: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus hominis (MRSHo) has been recognized as an important human pathogen, particularly in immunocompromised patients. METHODS:: A total of 19 S. hominis isolates were collected from children at the Children's Medical Centre, Tehran, Iran, from March 2012 to February 2013. MRSHo susceptibility against 13 antimicrobial and 3 antiseptic agents was determined using disk diffusion (DAD) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), respectively. All isolates were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for 15 distinct resistance genes, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), and arginine catabolic mobile elements (ACMEs). Biofilm production of the isolates was determined using a colorimetric microtiter plate assay. RESULTS: : Of the 19 isolates, 16 were resistant to oxacillin and harbored mecA. High resistance was also observed against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (81.2%). All MRSHo isolates were susceptible to the three disinfectants tested (Septicidine-PC, Septi turbo, and Sayacept-HP). In total, 15 (78.9%) isolates produced biofilms. Three isolates had SCCmec types (V and VIII), 13 were untypable (UT), and 5 had ACME type II. CONCLUSIONS:: The results indicate that MRSHo with high antibiotic resistance and unknown SCCmec might become a serious problem in the future for the treatment of patients such as children.
