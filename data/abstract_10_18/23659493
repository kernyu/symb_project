There are limited data comparing the clinical outcomes between telbivudine and entecavir. We consecutively enrolled 115 telbivudine-naive and 115 entecavir-naive chronic hepatitis B patients, who were matched for age, sex, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status and cirrhosis, and treated for at least 2 years or less than 2 years but had developed resistance. Except for the rate of HBeAg seroconversion, which was similar, patients in the entecavir group had better clinical outcomes than those in the telbivudine group for alanine aminotransferase normalization (85.2% vs 78.4%, p <0.048), undetectable HBV DNA (96.5% vs 74.8%, p <0.001), and viral resistance (0.9% vs 21.7%, p <0.001) after 2 years of treatment, After applying roadmap or super-responders concepts, entecavir still had better outcomes than telbivudine in undetectable HBV DNA and viral resistance. The cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma development was similar between telbivudine-naive and entecavir-naive patients (p 0.565). In renal function analysis, there were significantly more patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) category improvement in both the telbivudine and entecavir groups at year 1 (p 0.006 and p 0.047, respectively). The rate of virological improvement was significantly higher with entecavir than with telbivudine after 2 years of treatment, whether applying the concepts of roadmap or super-responders. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was similar between telbivudine and entecavir. Both telbivudine and entecavir were associated with eGFR improvement, especially in patients with renal insufficiency.
