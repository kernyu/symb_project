Burkholderia cepacia complex has emerged as an important opportunistic bacteria group for immunocompromised patients, and it has a high level of intrinsic resistance for different antibiotic classes. Hydrolysis of beta-lactam antibiotics by beta-lactamases is the most common resistance mechanism in Gram-negative bacteria, and the presence of such enzymes complicates the selection of appropriate therapy. This study aimed at investigating the antimicrobial resistance profile and the presence of beta-lactamase encoding genes in B. cepacia complex isolated from Brazilian soils. High-level ceftazidime resistance and several beta-lactamase encoding genes were found, including the first report of blaKPC genes in bacteria isolated from soil.
