The emergence of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria is widespread. Therefore, it is urgently required to enhance the development of novel antimicrobial agents with high antibacterial activity and low cytotoxicity. A series of novel dialkyl cationic amphiphiles bearing two identical length lipophilic alkyl chains and one non-peptidic amide bond were synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Particular compounds synthesized showed excellent antibacterial activity toward drug-sensitive bacteria such as S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli and S. enterica, and clinical isolates of drug-resistant species such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), KPC-producing and NDM-1-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). For example, the MIC values of the best compound 4g ranged from 0.5 to 2 mug/mL against all these strains. Moreover, these small molecules acted rapidly as bactericidal agents, and functioned primarily by permeabilization and depolarization of bacterial membranes. Importantly, these compounds were difficult to induce bacterial resistance and can potentially combat drug-resistant bacteria. Thus, these compounds can be developed into a new class of antibacterial peptide mimics against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including drug-resistant bacterial strains.
