Despite available treatment, Hepatitis C remains one of most serious burdens to public health. Current therapy based on pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin has significant side effects and its effectiveness varies for different genotypes of the virus. Four novel drugs - viral protease inhibitors (telaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir) and polymerase inhibitor - sofosbuvir have been introduced in last years for use in combination with standard-of-care treatment. For the first time interferon free therapies were approved with the use of combination of sofosbuvir+ribavirin. New therapies improve virological response rates but also increase the cost, side effects and raise the issue of drug resistance. Numerous novel anti-HCV compounds have been evaluated in advanced clinical trials including inhibitors of viral proteins (protease, polymerase and NS5A) and inhibitors of host factors involved in HCV replication (cyclophilin A, microRNA - miR-122). New interferon-free therapies reducing severe side effects are expected to enter the market within few months. At the same time efforts are undertaken to determine the host and viral factors with predictive value for HCV treatment response, enabling personalized therapy approach. The main success in this field was the discovery of interleukin IL28B polymorphism, which correlates with positive standard-of-care treatment response. An effective vaccination may be an alternative for antiviral drugs, but no anti-HCV vaccine is available currently. It is well proved that successful vaccination should induce antibody and T-cell responses specific against a range of HCV genotypes. With this aim, new subunit and genetic candidate vaccines have been evaluated in I and II phase clinical trials. This review summarizes the recent developments in the field of new drug development and vaccine studies against hepatitis C virus.
