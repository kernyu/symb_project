INTRODUCTION: The treatment options for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) remain limited. Immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs), such as thalidomide and lenalidomide, have changed the landscape in the treatment of patients with MM while newer IMiDs such as pomalidomide are showing promise in early clinical trials. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the biologic rationales of IMiDs and the clinical results supporting their use in MM. It includes data on the new IMiD, pomalidomide and also explores the possible utility of combining IMiDs with other agents. A PubMed search and abstracts from oncology scientific meetings (ASCO and ASH) of articles related to IMiDs and MM was conducted. EXPERT OPINION: IMiDs have shown clinical activity as single agents and in combination. Thalidomide was the first in class drug. Lenalidomide has a better toxicity profile than thalidomide. Pomalidomide may overcome resistance to lenalidomide indicating differences in their mechanisms of action and resistance. Molecular biomarkers may allow us to identify patients who will respond to IMiDs.
