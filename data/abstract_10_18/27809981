Haemonchus contortus parasitism is a major disease of sheep, with these parasites frequently demonstrating multi-drug class anthelmintic resistance. Copper oxide wire particles (COWP) have shown potential as adjuncts or alternatives to anthelmintics in resistant flocks. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two different COWP treatment regimens or placebo in the control of H. contortus in weaned lambs within a flock historically shown to have multi-drug resistant H. contortus using the DrenchRite((R)) assay. Data from 43 lambs within 3 treatment groups in a double blind study were included in the experiment. Treatments were administered as a total of 2 boluses, each given on separate occasions (day 0 and day 42), so that each lamb received either 2 placebos, a single dose of 2g COWP followed by placebo, or two doses of 1g COWP. Strongyle-type fecal egg counts (FEC) were performed at initial treatment (day 0), on day 10, at second treatment (day 42), on day 52, and at study end (day 84). At the start of the trial, mean+/-standard deviation FEC were 1634.4+/-825.2, 2241.7+/-1496.8, and 2013.3+/-1194.2epg for the 2g, 1gx2, and control groups, respectively. At the end of the trial, FEC were 757.1+/-825.3, 483.4+/-557.2, and 1660.0+/-1345.3epg for the 2g, 1gx2, and control groups, respectively. Lambs given a 2g single dose of COWP or a 1g dose of COWP twice had reductions in strongyle-type FEC (p</=0.01) from trial start to trial end, whereas lambs given placebo did not. Average daily gains did not differ significantly among groups. Although copper is potentially toxic to sheep, no signs of toxicity were observed during this trial, which was consistent with similar studies at this treatment dose. The study indicated that administering COWP to lambs at weaning reduced FEC.
