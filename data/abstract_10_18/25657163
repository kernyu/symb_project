BACKGROUND: Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) infection has the highest mortality rate among Enterobacter infections. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the transmission route of the class I integron, qnr genes, and CTX-M ESBLs genes in clinical isolates and to analyse the association between the prevalence of MDR genes and the antibiotic resistance of E. cloacae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility was tested the agar dilution method. The class I integron, qnr genes, and CTX-M ESBLs genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence data were analysed with the Chi-square test. RESULTS: In the 100 clinical isolates, the class I integron-positive rate was 65%, with 12% on chromosome, 15% on plasmids and 38% on both. The positive rate of qnr genes was 37% with plasmid location. The positive rates for qnrA, qnrB and qnrS were 6%, 23% and 8%, respectively. The CTX-M ESBLs-positive rate was 34%. For CTX-M-1 ESBLs, 15% were on chromosome, 6% on plasmids and 4% on both; for CTX-M-9 ESBLs, 1% was on chromosome and 7% on plasmid; for CTX-M-25 ESBLs, 3% were on chromosome and 1% on plasmid. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance genes may be horizontally and vertically disseminated among E. cloacae, which helps multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of E. cloacae to be successful nosocomial agents.
