Tuberculosis is a serious contagious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is endemic in many countries. Over the past two decades, there has been an increase in the number of multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB cases around the world. As in many countries, TB is common in Saudi Arabia. The disease is particularly relevant in the Kingdom because of its population dynamics including a large number of resident expatriates mainly from TB endemic regions and the influx of millions of pilgrims to the country each year during the Hajj and Umrah seasons. This review investigates the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance among M. tuberculosis isolates from Saudi Arabia, highlighting the variations in rates in different geographical areas with particularly high rates in the main cities and regions hosting the annual pilgrimage. The review also refers to the measures needed to prevent and control TB transmission in the country.
