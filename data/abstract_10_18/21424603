Candida species that show an increasing number of clinical and/or microbiological resistance to several antifungals and are the most common agents of invasive fungal infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro susceptibility of Candida blood isolates to antifungal agents (amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole) by comparative use of the CLSI reference microdilution method and Etest. Four hundred Candida blood isolates (215 Candida albicans, 185 non-albicans Candida strains) were included in the study. The broth microdilution test was performed according to the CLSI M27 A2 document. Etest was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MIC results obtained with reference microdilution were compared with those obtained with the Etest by using percent and categorical agreements. According to MIK(90) values, voriconazole was the most active and itraconazole was the least active drug in vitro against all Candida species. Other than voriconazole, statistically significant differences were found when the susceptibility of Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida spp. to amphotericin B, fluconazole, and itraconazole were compared. These antifungal agents were found to be more active to C. albicans. Among the non-albicans Candida species, the lowest MIC values were obtained for Candida parapsilosis isolates. When the standard method was compared with Etest, the total agreement was higher for C. albicans than for non-albicans species, especially for fluconazole and voriconazole. In view of the findings, it was concluded that itraconazole showed the lowest activity against all Candida species. Etest could be an alternative method in assessing the in vitro antifungal susceptibility of Candida spp., but it is more convenient to use the microdilution method for studying in vitro susceptibility of non-albicans species, in particular for those possessing high MIC values against azoles.
