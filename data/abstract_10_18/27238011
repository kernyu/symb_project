Progress made in understanding pharmacokinetic behaviour and pharmacodynamic mechanisms of drug action/resistance has allowed deep insights into the pharmacology of the main chemical classes, including some of the few recently discovered anthelmintics. The integration of pharmaco-parasitological research approaches has contributed considerably to the optimization of drug activity, which is relevant to preserve existing and novel active compounds for parasite control in livestock. A remarkable amount of pharmacology-based knowledge has been generated using the sheep abomasal nematode Haemonchus contortus as a model. Relevant fundamental information on the relationship among drug influx/efflux balance (accumulation), biotransformation/detoxification and pharmacological effects in parasitic nematodes for the most traditional anthelmintic chemical families has been obtained by exploiting the advantages of working with H. contortus under in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experimental conditions. The scientific contributions to the pharmacology of anthelmintic drugs based on the use of H. contortus as a model nematode are summarized in the present chapter.
