We describe a patient with two recent episodes of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-associated acute kidney injury and six-class drug-resistant HIV infection who achieved and maintained viral suppression without worsening kidney function on a regimen including tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) through 48 weeks of therapy. The safety and efficacy of TAF in patients with TDF-associated renal tubulopathy and multiple drug resistant HIV has not yet been described. TAF may represent a useful option to maximally suppress HIV in patients with these complications.
