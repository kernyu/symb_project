OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of primary HIV drug resistance in antiretroviral therapy (ART) areas of Henan province. METHODS: A total of 121 drug-naive long-term infected individuals and 154 patients with newly diagnosed from January 2011 to March 2012 were recruited, the questionnaires were surveyed and whole blood were collected to analyze the CD4(+)T cell counts and viral load. In-house method for genotypic resistance test was determined in those with viral load > 1000 copies/ml samples, the differences of demographic characteristics, immunological parameters and primary drug resistance were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 121 cases of long-term individuals who had infected (12.50 +/- 3.21) years were mainly previous paid blood donors, and the age was (46.61 +/- 9.32) years old. The infection route of the newly diagnosed were diversity, including blood, sexual transmission and others, the cases were 73, 73, 8, respectively, the confirmatory year was (0.91 +/- 0.28) years, and average age was (22.21 +/- 3.11) years old. The difference were statistically significant in the route of transmission, age and infection time from demographic analysis of the two groups (P < 0.05). The absolute M(P(25)-P(75)) counts of CD4(+)T lymphocytes of long-term group was 322 (217 - 422) cell/microl, which was lower than the newly diagnosed was 434(308 - 578) cell/microl (P < 0.05), and viral load was 4.0 (2.96 - 4.64) copies/ml, 3.77 (2.94 - 4.53) copies/ml, the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). The prevalence of primary drug resistance in long-term group and newly diagnosed was 5.79% (7/121), 9.09% (14/154), respectively, and the difference was statistically different (P < 0.05), and one PI-resistant strain was found in the newly diagnosed group. CONCLUSION: The primary drug resistant strains in untreated patients were found in Henan province of ART areas, and there was difference in degree of resistance between long-term infected individuals and newly diagnosed.
