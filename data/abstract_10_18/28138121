Candidiasis involving the biofilms of Candida albicans is a threat to immunocompromised patients. Candida biofilms are intrinsically resistant to the antifungal drugs and hence novel treatment strategies are desired. The study intended to evaluate the anti-Candida activity of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) alone and with fluconazole (FLC), particularly against the biofilms. Results revealed the concentration-dependent activity of AITC against the planktonic growth and virulence factors of C. albicans. Significant (p <0.05) inhibition of the biofilms was evident at < or =1 mg/ml concentrations of AITC. Notably, a combination of 0.004 mg/ml of FLC and 0.125 mg/ml of AITC prevented the biofilm formation. Similarly, the preformed biofilms were significantly (p <0.05) inhibited by the AITC-FLC combination. The fractional inhibitory concentration indices ranging from 0.132 to 0.312 indicated the synergistic activity of AITC and FLC against the biofilm formation and the preformed biofilms. No hemolytic activity at the biofilm inhibitory concentrations of AITC and the AITC-FLC combination suggested the absence of cytotoxic effects. The recognizable synergy between AITC and FLC offers a potential therapeutic strategy against biofilm-associated Candida infections.
