BACKGROUND: Long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities admit patients with complex, advanced disease states. Study aims were to determine the burden posed on hospitals associated with LTAC exposure and analyze the differences between "present on admission" (POA) multidrug-resistant (MDR), gram-negative organisms (GNO) and POA MDR gram-positive organisms (GPO). METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted in 13 hospitals from southeast Michigan, from September 1, 2008, to August 31, 2009. Cultures obtained in the first 72 hours of hospitalization (ie, POA) of MDR-GPO and MDR-GNO were reviewed. LTAC exposures in the previous 6 months and direct admission from a LTAC were recorded. RESULTS: Overall, 5,297 patients with 7,147 MDR POA cultures were analyzed: 2,619 (36.6%) were MDR-GNO, and 4,528 (63.4%) were MDR-GPO. LTAC exposure in the past 6 months was present in 251 (5.2%) infectious episodes and was significantly more common among POA MDR-GNO than MDR-GPO (158 [8.6%] and 94 [3.1%], respectively, odds ratio, 2.87; P < .001). Recent LTAC exposure was strongly associated with both carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) (31.6% of all CRE cases, P < .001) and Acinetobacter baumannii (14.9% of all A baumannii cases, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Nearly 10% of MDR-GNO POA had recent LTAC exposure. Hospital efforts to control the spread of MDR-GNO should focus on collaborations and communications with referring LTACs and interventions targeted towards patients with recent LTAC exposure.
