From humble beginnings of a contaminated petri dish, beta-lactam antibiotics have distinguished themselves among some of the most powerful drugs in human history. The devastating effects of antibiotic resistance have nevertheless led to an "arms race" with disquieting prospects. The emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria threatens an ever-dwindling antibiotic arsenal, calling for new discovery, rediscovery, and innovation in beta-lactam research. Here the current state of beta-lactam antibiotics from a structural perspective was reviewed.
