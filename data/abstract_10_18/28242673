Clarithromycin (CLA) is a commonly recommended drug for Helicobacter pylori eradication. However, the prevalence of CLA-resistant H. pylori is increasing. Although point mutations in the 23S rRNA are key factors for CLA resistance, other factors, including efflux pumps and regulation genes, are also involved in the resistance of H. pylori to CLA. Guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate and guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate [(p)ppGpp)], which are synthesized by the bifunctional enzyme SpoT in H. pylori, play an important role for some bacteria to adapt to antibiotic pressure. Nevertheless, no related research involving H. pylori has been reported. In addition, transporters have been found to be related to bacterial drug resistance. Therefore, this study investigated the function of SpoT in H. pylori resistance to CLA by examining the shifts in the expression of transporters and explored the role of transporters in the CLA resistance of H. pylori A DeltaspoT strain was constructed in this study, and it was shown that SpoT is involved in H. pylori tolerance of CLA by upregulating the transporters HP0939, HP1017, HP0497, and HP0471. This was assessed using a series of molecular and biochemical experiments and a cDNA microarray. Additionally, the knockout of genes hp0939, hp0471, and hp0497 in the resistant strains caused a reduction or loss (the latter in the Deltahp0497 strain) of resistance to CLA. Furthermore, the average expression levels of these four transporters in clinical CLA-resistant strains were considerably higher than those in clinical CLA-sensitive strains. Taken together, our results revealed a novel molecular mechanism of H. pylori adaption to CLA stress.
