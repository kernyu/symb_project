OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between Beijing genotype (Beijing family) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and drug resistance. METHODS: A computer retrieval of Medline, Embase, SCI, EBSCO, CNKI, Weipu and Wanfang databases from 1990 to 2010 was conducted. A total of 525 articles exploring the relationship of Beijing genotype of MTB and drug resistance were found through literature search. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a Meta-subgroup analysis was conducted in Beijing genotype of MTB and drug resistance. RESULTS: A total of 38 articles were selected, including 22 articles on isoniazid resistance, 24 articles on rifampin resistance, 19 articles on ethambutol resistance, 18 articles on ethambutol resistance, 26 articles on multi-drug resistance (MDR). Meta-subgroup analysis showed that in China, there was an association between Beijing genotype and resistance to rifampin, ethambutol and MDR: rifampin (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.13 - 2.31), ethambutol (OR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.16 - 2.40), MDR (OR = 1.79, 95%CI: 1.20 - 2.68); in Russia, there was an association between Beijing genotype and resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and MDR: isoniazid (OR = 4.82, 95%CI: 3.19 - 7.29), rifampin (OR = 4.84, 95%CI: 3.84 - 6.10), ethambutol (OR = 3.32, 95%CI: 2.51 - 4.40), MDR (OR = 5.42, 95%CI: 3.36 - 8.74); in Vietnam, there was an association between Beijing genotype and resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and MDR: isoniazid (OR = 2.12, 95%CI: 1.55 - 2.91), rifampin (OR = 4.71, 95%CI: 3.01 - 7.36), ethambutol (OR = 3.78, 95%CI: 1.63 - 8.77), MDR (OR = 4.21, 95%CI: 1.58 - 11.18); in other countries, there was an association between Beijing genotype and resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and MDR: isoniazid (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.19 - 2.42), rifampin (OR = 2.48, 95%CI: 1.92 - 3.19), ethambutol (OR = 3.04, 95%CI: 2.13 - 4.33), MDR (OR = 2.36, 95%CI: 1.52 - 3.68). CONCLUSION: Beijing genotype of MTB was positively associated with three kinds of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol) and MDR, and the relationship intensity was different in different countries.
