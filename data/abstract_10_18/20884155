The aim of this study was to investigate Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and to characterize epidemiologically C. difficile strains obtained from an outbreak of CDAD. Within almost a 4-year surveillance period, CDAD incidence was determined for the first time in Brazil, and a 3-fold increase was observed in the average rate of CDAD, featuring an outbreak. About 80% of the patients were over 65 years. The main antibiotic that could be probably associated to CDAD was piperacillin/tazobactam. Four toxigenic strains were isolated, 3 from stools and 1 from environmental samples. They were all resistant to clindamycin and fluoroquinolones. Fingerprinting analysis revealed their distribution between 2 different polymerase chain reaction ribotypes, with one of them being exclusively found in Brazil. It was possible to detect cross-infection and environmental contamination in the ICU. Our results highlight the importance of a continuous CDAD surveillance in the hospitals, especially when a risk group is exposed.
