The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of commercial gradient test (Etest) in the detection of triazole resistant Aspergillus fumigatus isolates using reference microdilution methods and the analysis of sequences of the cyp 51A gene. The study was performed on twenty clinical isolates which were identified as Aspergillus fumigatus based on the DNA sequences of the ITS1-2 fragment of ribosomal DNA and the beta-tubulin gene, out of them seventeen isolates showed wild-type cyp51A sequence and three were positive for the mutation TR34/L98H. All isolates were tested for the susceptibility to itraconazole (ITZ), voriconazole (VOR) and posaconasole (POS) using microdilution methods, according to EUCAST and CLSI protocols, as well as using Etest. The results of microdilution and Etests were analysed separately according to clinical breakpoints (CBP) defined by EUCAST version 7.0 and epidemiological cut off values (ECV). Etest as well as reference methods excellently recognised the WT isolates, which were susceptible to all tested triazoles, regardless of the method and CBP or ECV criteria used. The Etest recognized three non-WT isolates as resistant or intermediately sensitive to ITZ and POS and one as resistant to VOR. The categorical concordance between Etests and EUCAST and Etests and the CLSI method ranged from 90 to 100%. The interpretation of the results obtained from routine A. fumigatus Etests requires great caution. The use of the confirmative examinations with reference AST methods as well as with molecular tests is recommended.
