Neutropenic fever is an important cause of morbidity and mortality during therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia are at increased risk of acquiring vancomycin resistant enterococcal infection and its treatment remains problematic. Vancomycin therapy for more than 7 days is usually associated with inducible vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. We report a case of vancomycin resistant enterococcal sepsis in a patient of acute myeloid leukemia.
