Trueperella pyogenes can be found as a commensal or pathogenic bacterium among animals causing a variety of pyogenic infections in several species. The agent appears to act primarily as an opportunistic pathogen but may disseminate and produce metastatic abscesses accompanied or not by mastitis, metritis or pneumonia. In this study, 30 porcine T. pyogenes strains were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA sequencing and further evaluated in relation to their resistance and genetic profiles through broth microdilution and single enzyme AFLP. All strains were susceptible to beta-lactams, florfenicol, gentamicin, spectinomycin and tiamulin. The highest resistance rates were observed for sulfonamides, tetracyclines and clindamycin. All isolates could be characterized by SE-AFLP presenting more than 80% of similarity, despite their distinct origins. Four genotypes were detected with the segregation of T. pyogenes ATCC 19411 from Brazilian T. pyogenes strains. No correlation between genotypes and isolates origins and susceptibility profile was observed.
