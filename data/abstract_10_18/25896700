Seventy-two A. fumigatus clinical isolates from China were investigated for azole resistance based on mutations of cyp51A. We identified four azole-resistant strains, among which we found three strains highly resistant to itraconazole, two of which exhibit the TR34/L98H/S297T/F495I mutation, while one carries only the TR34/L98H mutation. To our knowledge, the latter has not been found previously in China. The fourth multiazole-resistant isolate (with only moderate itraconazole resistance) carries a new G432A mutation.
