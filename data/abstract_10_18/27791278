The link between insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes has been recognized for a long time. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with basal hyperinsulinemia, reduced sensitivity to insulin, and disturbances in insulin release. There are evidences showing the reversal of IR by mesenchymal stem cells. However, the effect of conditioned media from adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs-CM) in reversal of IR has not been established. We established an insulin resistant model of 3T3L1 and C2C12 cells and treated with ADSCs-CM. 2-NBDG (2-[N-[7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]Amino]-2-Deoxyglucose) uptake was performed to assess improvement in glucose uptake. Genes involved in glucose transport and in inflammation were also analysed. Western blot for glucose transporter-4 and Akt was performed to evaluate translocation of Glut4 and insulin signaling respectively. We found that the ADSCs-CM treated cells restored insulin, stimulated glucose uptake as compared to the untreated control indicating the insulin sensitizing effect of the CM. The treated cells also showed inhibition adipogenesis in 3T3L1 cells and significant reduction of intramuscular triglyceride accumulation in C2C12 cells. Gene expressions studies revealed the drastic upregulation of GLUT4 gene and significant reduction in IL6 and PAI1 gene in both 3T3L1 and C2C12 cells, indicating possible mechanism of glucose uptake with concomitant decrease in inflammation. Enhancement of GLUT4 and phospho Akt protein expression seems to be responsible for the increment in glucose uptake and enhanced insulin signaling, respectively. Our study revealed for the first time that ADSCs-CM acts as an alternative insulin sensitizer providing stem cell solution to IR. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 2037-2043,2017.
