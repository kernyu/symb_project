To address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), it is necessary to invest in, inspire and attract future generations of scientists to this research area. Undergraduate education should be a focus for attention and efforts should be made to ensure that students are afforded opportunities to actively engage with AMR. We illustrate how as a topic AMR provides opportunities to deliver effective research-led teaching in addition to traditional teaching methods. We have used a selection of case studies to illustrate how students can be engaged with AMR using a variety of research-led approaches to develop the required skills for biology-centric students. In addition, we indicate how these skills map to the UK Quality Assurance Framework and the Vision and Change report developed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
