Because of its corrosion resistance palladium (Pd) has been widely used in many consumer products ranging from fashion accessories to dental materials. Recently, however, an increase in Pd allergy cases has been reported. Metal allergy is categorized as a Type IV allergy, which is characterized as a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in which T cells are known to play an important role; however, the precise mechanism of their action remains unclear. Here we defined the relationship between histamine and the Pd allergic reaction specifically with respect to T cell responses. To verify the effects of histamine on T cells, we examined whether there is a change in IFN-gamma production following stimulation of histamine or the antihistamine, olopatadine hydrochloride (OLP), in vitro. In addition, we assessed whether OLP administration affected the degree of footpad swelling or IFN-gamma production during the Pd allergy response in mice. We found that histamine stimulation increased IFN-gamma production in T cells, specifically enhancing IFN-gamma production in CD8(+) T cells compared with CD4(+) T cells. Interestingly, OLP suppressed the production of IFN-gamma in CD8(+) T cells, and this compound inhibited footpad swelling and IFN-gamma production in mice with Pd allergy. These results suggest that histamine promotes the Type IV allergic reaction and thus, the histamine 1 receptor (H1R) might be useful therapeutic target for treatment of metal allergy.
