A cerium doped ternary SnO(2) based oxides anode that is CeO(2)-RuO(2)-SnO(2) (Ce-Ru-SnO(2)) anode, was prepared by facile thermal decomposition technique. XRD was used to characterize the crystal structures of modified SnO(2) anodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and accelerated life test were also utilized to study the electrochemical property of Ce-Ru-SnO(2) anode. The results indicated that Ce-Ru-SnO(2) anode possessed smaller charge transfer resistance and longer service life than other modified SnO(2) anodes. Oxidants, such as hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite ions were determined. Electrochemical oxidation of nitrophenols (NPs) were conducted and compared with previous studies. The degradation of nitrophenols revealed two distinguishing laws for mononitrophenol and multinitrophenols. The Ce-Ru-SnO(2) anode is considered to be a promising material for the treatment of organic pollutants due to its high electrochemical activity and benign stability.
