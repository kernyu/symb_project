BACKGROUND: The complex relationship between drug concentrations and bacterial growth rates require not only the minimum inhibitory concentration but also other parameters to capture the dynamic nature of the relationship. To analyse this relationship between tetracycline concentration and growth of Escherichia coli representative of those found in the Danish pig population, we compared the growth of 50 randomly selected strains. The observed net growth rates were used to describe the in vitro pharmacodynamic relationship between drug concentration and net growth rate based on E max model with three parameters: maximum net growth rate (amax); concentration for a half-maximal response (E max); and the Hill coefficient (gamma). RESULTS: The net growth rate in the absence of antibiotic did not differ between susceptible and resistant isolates (P = 0.97). The net growth rate decreased with increasing tetracycline concentrations, and this decline was greater in susceptible strains than resistant strains. The lag phase, defined as the time needed for the strain to reach an OD600 value of 0.01, increased exponentially with increasing tetracycline concentration. The pharmacodynamic parameters confirmed that the alphamax between susceptible and resistant strains in the absence of a drug was not different. EC 50 increased linearly with MIC on a log-log scale, and gamma was different between susceptible and resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro model parameters described the inhibition effect of tetracycline on E. coli when strains were exposed to a wide range of tetracycline concentrations. These parameters, along with in vivo pharmacokinetic data, may be useful in mathematical models to predict in vivo competitive growth of many different strains and for development of optimal dosing regimens for preventing selection of resistance.
