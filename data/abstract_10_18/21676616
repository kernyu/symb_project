The bridged monobactam beta-lactamase inhibitor MK-8712 (1) effectively inhibits class C beta-lactamases. Side chain N-alkylated and ring-opened analogs of 1 were prepared and evaluated for combination with imipenem to overcome class C beta-lactamase mediated resistance. Although some analogs were more potent inhibitors of AmpC, none exhibited better synergy with imipenem than 1.
