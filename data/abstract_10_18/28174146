INTRODUCTION: In this study, membranes composed of honey (Manuka or Honeydew) and pectin were developed, and the ISO 22196 method was used to evaluate their antibacterial activities against multidrug-resistant bacteria (i.e., Staphylococcus pseudointermedius, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) that cause wound infection in animals. The results demonstrated that both Manuka and Honeydew honey-based membranes had strong antibacterial activities against the strain of methicillin-resistant S. pseudointermedius tested. Specifically, membranes composed of Manuka honey were effective in inhibiting the growth of Gram-negative bacteria within 3 h, whereas those composed of Honeydew honey needed 24 h to neutralise bacterial growth. The antimicrobial activities of both membranes developed in this study suggest that they can be effectively used as wound dressing in veterinary clinical medicine.
