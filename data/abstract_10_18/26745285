Cyclohexyliden- and 2-methylcyclohexyliden-hydrazo-4-arylthiazoles were synthesized and tested as antifungal agents. All compounds exhibited minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values comparable with those of fluconazole (FLC). Moreover, some compounds showed fungicidal activity at low concentration. Worth noting five out of nine compounds were active towards Candida albicans 25 FLC resistant isolated from clinical specimens. The cellular toxicity was evaluated and none of the compounds is toxic at the MIC. On the basis of our data we can conclude that these derivatives are promising agents for the treatment of resistant C. albicans.
