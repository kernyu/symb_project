Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become one of the most significant pathogens affecting global public health and health care systems. In Canada and the United States, the spread of MRSA is primarily attributed to a single dominant epidemic clone: CMRSA10/USA300. Despite this, the CMRSA7/USA400 epidemic clone has been reported to be the predominate epidemic clone in several Canadian provinces and some parts of the United States. This study examined the epidemiology of CMRSA7/USA400 MRSA in Alberta, Canada, from June 2005 to December 2012. Molecular characterization of CMRSA7/USA400 isolates was done using spa, SCCmec, PVL, and PFGE typing and identified two predominant spa types in Alberta: t128 and t1787. Although closely related, these spa types have distinct geographic distributions. From 2010 to 2012, the number of t128 infections has remained stable while there has been a nearly 3-fold increase in the number of provincial t1787 infections, accompanied by 10-fold increases in t1787 infection rates in some communities. Most t128 and t1787 patients were First Nations or Inuit people, and isolates were usually from skin and soft tissue infections in outpatients. t128 patients were significantly older than t1787 patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed higher mupirocin resistance in t1787 than in t128 MRSA. Improved strategies to reduce or stabilize t1787 infections in Alberta are needed.
