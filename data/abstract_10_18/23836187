We have previously reported that Cryptococcus neoformans strains are innately heteroresistant to fluconazole in vitro, producing minor, highly resistant subpopulations due to adaptive formation of disomic chromosomes. Using a mouse model, we assessed the emergence of heteroresistant clones in the brain during fluconazole treatment and found that the occurrence of heteroresistant clones in vivo with chromosomal disomy is strain dependent. Interestingly, emergence of heteroresistant clones in vivo was unrelated to the strain's MIC to fluconazole.
