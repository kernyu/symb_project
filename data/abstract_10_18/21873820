Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is known to be associated with many gastrointestinal diseases including peptic ulcer. In Korea, eradication of H. pylori is recommended for peptic ulcer disease, low grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and early gastric cancer. Standard triple therapy using proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin and bismuth-containing quadruple therapy have been the main first-line and second-line therapy for H. pylori in Korea. Although eradication rate of second-line quadruple therapy remains similar to that of the past, the success rate of eradication with triple therapy has decreased with increasing antimicrobial resistance to H. pylori. There is no standard third-line therapy, and some regimens that incorporate levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin can be used. New regimens such as sequential or concomitant therapy are suggested as alternative treatment for H. pylori. We need more well designed randomized controlled studies to choose proper treatment for H. pylori infection.
