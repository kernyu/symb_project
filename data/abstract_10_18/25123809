Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates usually carry a single carbapenemase (e.g. KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like). Here we describe an XDR K. pneumoniae of sequence type 101 that was detected in the screening rectal swab of a patient transferred from the intensive care unit of a hospital located in Belgrade (Serbia) to Bern University Hospital (Switzerland). The isolate was resistant to all antibiotics with the exception of colistin [minimum inhibitory concentration] (MIC </= 0.125 mug/mL), tigecycline (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL) and fosfomycin (MIC = 2 mug/mL). The isolate co-possessed class B (NDM-1) and class D (OXA-48) carbapenemases, class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-M-15), class C cephalosporinase (CMY-16), ArmA 16S rRNA methyltransferase, substitutions in GyrA and ParC, loss of OmpK35 porin, as well as other genes conferring resistance to quinolones (qnrA), tetracyclines [tet(A)], sulfonamides (sul1, sul2), trimethoprim (dfrA12, dfrA14), rifampicin (arr-1), chloramphenicol (cmlA1, floR) and streptomycin (aadA1). The patient was placed under contact isolation precautions preventing the spread of this nearly untreatable pathogen.
