BACKGROUND: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress results from protein misfolding imbalance and has been postulated as a therapeutic strategy. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response which leads to a complex cellular response, including the upregulation of aberrant protein degradation in the ER, with the goal of resolving that stress. O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), and Rad51 are DNA damage repair proteins that mediate resistance to temozolomide in glioblastoma. In this work we sought to evaluate whether ER stress-inducing drugs were able to downmodulate DNA damage repair proteins and become candidates to combine with temozolomide. METHODS: MTT assays were performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the treatments. The expression of proteins was evaluated using western blot and immunofluorescence. In vivo studies were performed using 2 orthotopic glioblastoma models in nude mice to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: Treatment of glioblastoma cells with ER stress-inducing drugs leads to downregulation of MGMT, MPG, and Rad51. Inhibition of ER stress through pharmacological treatment resulted in rescue of MGMT, MPG, and Rad51 protein levels. Moreover, treatment of glioblastoma cells with salinomycin, an ER stress-inducing drug, and temozolomide resulted in enhanced DNA damage and a synergistic antitumor effect in vitro. Of importance, treatment with salinomycin/temozolomide resulted in a significant antiglioma effect in 2 aggressive orthotopic intracranial brain tumor models. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a strong rationale for combining temozolomide with ER stress-inducing drugs as an alternative therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma.
