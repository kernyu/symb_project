Whole-genome sequencing of non-H(2)S-producing Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and S. enterica serovar Infantis isolates from poultry meat revealed a nonsense mutation in the phsA thiosulfate reductase gene and carriage of a CMY-2 beta-lactamase. The lack of production of H(2)S might lead to the incorrect identification of S. enterica isolates carrying antimicrobial resistance genes.
