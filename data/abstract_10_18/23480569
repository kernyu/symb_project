Daptomycin non-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was rarely encountered at our medical centre until 2010, when 10 isolates (0.4% of S. aureus) were confirmed by E-test as non-susceptible. These isolates were not of the same strain type and there was no link between the 10 patients. Daptomycin non-susceptibility may be increasing.
