INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare the fracture resistance of cast posts versus the fracture resistance of fiber posts by means of meta-analysis when they were used in the restoration of endodontically treated teeth. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and China Biology Medicine disc were used in the literature search. Two independent reviewers assessed the titles and abstracts of all articles that were found according to the predefined inclusion criteria. Relevant articles were acquired in full-text form. Data in these studies were independently extracted. Standardized mean differences of included studies were combined and analyzed by using meta-analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. There was considerable heterogeneity among these studies. The standardized mean difference of the combined data was 0.64 (95% confidence interval, 0.08-1.20; P < .001), indicating that the cast post group displayed significantly higher fracture resistance than the fiber post group. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the current best available evidence, we concluded that cast posts had higher fracture resistance than fiber posts.
