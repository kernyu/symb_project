OBJECTIVES: To determine the characteristics of bloodstream infections (BSIs) and to evaluate the impact of BSIs on mortality in severe burn patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in 20 tertiary hospitals. A total of 185 patients who experienced a massive dust explosion in eastern China were included. RESULTS: After exclusion, 177 patients were analysed. The median total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 95% (interquartile range 85%-98%). Inhalation injuries occurred in 97.2%. The overall 90-day mortality was 35% (62/177). During the study period, 120 (67.8%) patients developed 253 episodes of BSI with 323 unique causative pathogens. Sixty-six episodes were polymicrobial infections. Catheter-related BSIs (CRBSIs) accounted for 41.5% of the episodes. Acinetobacter baumannii (19.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.9%) and Candida (12.7%) were the most common organisms. Antimicrobial resistance was found in 63.5% of the isolates, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria. Patients who developed BSIs had a greater illness severity at admission to the intensive care unit, and worse outcomes. After adjusting for demographics, severity of illness and treatment characteristics in a multivariate logistic model, there was a trend toward BSI increasing the risk of 90-day mortality (adjusted OR 3.4; 95% CI 0.9-12.9; p=0.069). In subgroup analyses, CRBSIs (adjusted OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.3-24.9; p=0.021 versus no BSI) and polymicrobial BSIs (adjusted OR 6.1; 95% CI 1.3-28.1; p=0.020 versus no BSI) had greater risk of 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A strikingly high rate of BSIs was observed in severe burn patients. Gram-negative organisms and fungi were the leading causes. CRBSIs and polymicrobial BSIs were associated with high mortality.
