Deficient antibiotic production in an afsB mutant, BH5, of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) was recently shown to be due to a mutation (G243D) in region 1.2 of the primary sigma factor sigma(HrdB). Here we show that intracellular ppGpp levels during growth, as well as after amino acid depletion, in the mutant BH5 are lower than those of the afsB(+) parent strain. The introduction of certain rifampicin resistance (rif) mutations, which bypassed the requirement of ppGpp for transcription of pathway-specific regulatory genes, actII-ORF4 and redD, for actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin, respectively, completely restored antibiotic production by BH5. Antibiotic production was restored also by introduction of a new class of thiostrepton-resistance (tsp) mutations, which provoked aberrant accumulation of intracellular ppGpp. Abolition of ppGpp synthesis in the afsB tsp mutant Tsp33 again abolished antibiotic production. These results indicate that intracellular ppGpp level is finely tuned for successful triggering of antibiotic production in the wild-type strain, and that this fine tuning was absent from the afsB mutant BH5, resulting in a failure to initiate antibiotic production in this strain.
