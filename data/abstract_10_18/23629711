Orthopedic surgeons at our institution have noticed an increase in the number of infections due to Propionibacterium acnes, especially following operations on the shoulder. We collected P. acnes isolates from our hospital microbiology laboratory for 1 year and performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing on 28 strains from the shoulder. Antibiotics with the lowest MIC values against P. acnes (MIC50 and MIC90) included penicillin G (0.006, 0.125), cephalothin (0.047 and 0.094), and ceftriaxone (0.016, 0.045), while others also showed activity. Strains resistant to clindamycin were noted.
