BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, is characterized by excessive brain infiltration which prevents the complete surgical resection. These tumors also display treatment non-compliance and responses to standard therapy are invariably transient; consequently, the prognosis barely exceeds 14 months and recurrence is inevitable. Accordingly, several new treatment strategies have been studied. One such option is the use of chloroquine (CQ), a lysosomotropic weak base and renowned antimalarial drug, that has shown promising results in several pre-clinical studies. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of CQ to hinder the malignant phenotype of GBM, namely extensive proliferation, invasion and radio-resistance. RESULTS: In cell cycle analysis, proliferation assays and immunofluorescence, CQ treatments halved proliferation of primary cultures from GBM specimens and GBM cell lines (U-373 MG et U-87 MG). Gelatin zymography and Matrigel(TM)-coated transwell invasion assays also revealed a 50 % CQ induced inhibition of MMP-2 activity and GBM invasion. Concomitant treatment with CQ and radiation also radiosensitized GBM cells as shown by an accumulation in the G2/M phase, increased cell death and reduced clonogenic formation. Moreover, radiation-induced invasion was considerably restrained by CQ. We also observe that these effects are owed to CQ-induced inhibition of TGF-beta secretion and signaling pathway, a predominant growth factor in GBM progression. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CQ, alone or as an adjuvant therapeutic, could be used to inhibit the GBM malignant phenotype and could benefit GBM afflicted patients.
