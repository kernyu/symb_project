Fighting the resistance: biodegradable and injectable/moldable hydrogels with hierarchical nanostructures were made with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities and biofilm-disruption capability. They demonstrate no cytotoxicity in vitro, and show excellent skin biocompatibility in animals. These hydrogels have great potential for clinical use in prevention and treatment of various multidrug-resistant infections.
