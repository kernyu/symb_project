From January 2014 to December 2014, 972 consecutive non-replicate carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from colonised or infected patients were collected at the Associated French National Reference Centre as part of the French national survey on antimicrobial resistance. It included 577 Klebsiella spp. (59%), 236 Escherichia coli (24%), 108 Enterobacter spp. (11%), 50 Citrobacter spp. (5%), and a single Salmonella spp. isolate (0.1%). Of 561 K. pneumoniae isolates, 35 were found to be resistant to colistin (6.2%). PFGE analysis revealed a clonal outbreak involving 15 K. pneumoniae isolates belonging to sequence type ST11, recovered in a single hospital in the Picardie region in northern France. Those clonally related isolates showed variable levels of resistance to colistin, ranging from 4 to 64 mg/L. They harboured the blaOXA-48 carbapenemase gene and the blaCTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene. Among the 91 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, seven were resistant to colistin and produced different types of carbapenemases. Surprisingly, none of the E. coli and Citrobacter spp. isolates showed resistance to colistin. This national survey including carbapenemase-producing isolates recovered in 2014 reported a high rate of colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae (6.2% and 7.7%, respectively) in France.
