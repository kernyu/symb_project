Efficacy of ertapenem in biliary tract infections in daily practice was retrospectively analyzed. Records of patients admitted to five Spanish hospitals (January 2007/February 2011) with biliary infections (cholecystitis/cholangitis) treated with ertapenem for >/=72 hours were reviewed. A total of 187 patients (mean 63.8+/-19.3 years, 52.9% males) were identified. Up to 96 (51.3%) were operated, with cholecystectomy (97.9%) and primary laparoscopy approach (75%) as most frequent intervention. Non-operated patients presented higher age (71.0+/-17.5 vs 56.9+/-18.5 years; P<0.001), heart insufficiency (11.0 vs 3.1%; P = 0.044) and the Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis score (2.99+/-2.26 vs 1.94+/-2.34; P<0.001); and longer length of stay (10.3+/-6.6 vs 9.1+/-7.0; P = 0.005). Mean duration of treatment was 6.89+/-3.38 days. Overall favourable response was 87.7% (95% CI = 83.0-92.4) at the end of treatment. In the multivariate analysis (P<0.001, R(2) Cox = 0.10), non-favourable response was associated with Charlson index>/=5 (OR = 18.71; 95% CI: 1.26-278.55; P = 0.034), pericholecystic abscess (OR = 5.30; 95% CI: 1.26-22.37; P = 0.023) and >3 days from symptoms start to admission (OR = 3.02; 95% CI: 1.13-8.04; P = 0.027).
