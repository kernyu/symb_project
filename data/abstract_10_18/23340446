Avian Pasteurella multocida is a causative agent of fowl cholera. Two proteins OmpH and OmpA are the major immunogenic antigens of avian P. multocida, which play an important role in inducing immune responses that confer resistance against infections. In the present study, we used pcDNA3.1(+) as a vector and constructed DNA vaccines with the genes encoding the two antigens mentioned above. These DNA vaccines include monovalent (pcDNA-OMPH, pOMPH and pcDNA-OMPA, pOMPA), divalent combination (pcDNA-OMPH+pcDNA-OMPA, pOMPH+pOMPA) and fusion of two gene vaccines (pcDNA-OMPH/OMPA, pOMPHA). The immune responses to these DNA vaccines were evaluated by serum antibody titers, lymphocyte proliferation assay and titers of a cytokines, IFN-gamma. The protective efficacy after challenging with a virulent avian P. multocida strain, CVCC474, was evaluated by survival rate. A significant increase in serum antibody levels was observed in chickens vaccinated with divalent combination and fusion DNA vaccines. Additionally, the lymphocyte proliferation (SI value) and the levels of IFN-gamma were both higher in chickens immunized with divalent combination and fusion DNA vaccines than in those vaccinated with monovalent DNA vaccines (P<0.05). Furthermore, the protection provided by divalent combination and fusion DNA vaccines was superior to that provided by monovalent DNA vaccines after challenging with the avian P. multocida strain CVCC474. And the protective efficacy in chickens immunized three times with the fusion DNA vaccine was equivalent to the protective efficacy in chickens vaccinated once with the attenuated live vaccine. This suggests that divalent combination and fusion DNA vaccines represent a promising approach for the prevention of fowl cholera.
