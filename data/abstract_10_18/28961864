Background: Novel drug discovery against non-tuberculous mycobacteria is beset with a large number of challenges including the existence of myriad innate drug resistance mechanisms as well as a lack of suitable animal models, which hinders effective translation. In order to identify molecules acting via novel mechanisms of action, we screened the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds against non-tuberculous mycobacteria to identify such compounds. Methods: Whole-cell growth inhibition assays were used to screen and identify novel inhibitors. The hit compounds were tested for cytotoxicity against Vero cells to determine the selectivity index, and time-kill kinetics were determined against Mycobacterium fortuitum. The compound's ability to synergize with amikacin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and meropenem was determined using fractional inhibitory concentration indexes followed by its ability to decimate mycobacterial infections ex vivo. Finally, the in vivo potential was determined in a neutropenic murine model mimicking mycobacterial infection. Results: We have identified diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPIC), an NADPH/NADH oxidase inhibitor, as possessing potent antimicrobial activity against non-tuberculous mycobacteria. DPIC exhibited concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against M. fortuitum and synergized with amikacin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and meropenem. When tested in a murine neutropenic M. fortuitum infection model, DPIC caused a significant reduction in bacterial load in kidney and spleen. The reduction in bacterial count is comparable to amikacin at a 100-fold lower concentration. Conclusions: DPIC exhibits all properties to be repositioned as a novel anti-mycobacterial therapy and possesses a potentially new mechanism of action. Thus, it can be projected as a potential new therapeutic against ever-increasing non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections.
