New treatment options for patients with myeloma have helped to change the natural history of this disease, even in the context of relapsed disease. For standard-risk patients, doublet-based therapy may offer benefit, whereas for patients with aggressive or genetically high-risk disease combinations of agents are needed for adequate disease control. Second-generation agents offer significant activity for patients with refractory myeloma, and new categories of agents provide new targets for future study and clinical use. Combinations of these agents in selected patient populations represent the next stage in the quest to cure myeloma.
