Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, especially in women. Low-dose daily or postcoital antimicrobial prophylaxis is effective for prevention of recurrent UTIs and women can self-diagnose and self-treat a new UTI with antibiotics. The increasing resistance rates of Escherichia coli to antimicrobial agents has, however, stimulated interest in nonantibiotic methods for the prevention of UTIs. This article reviews the literature on efficacy of different forms of nonantibiotic prophylaxis. Future studies with lactobacilli strains (oral and vaginal) and the oral immunostimulant OM-89 are warranted.
