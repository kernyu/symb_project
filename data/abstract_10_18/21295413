UNLABELLED: The fight against healthcare-associated infections is based on preventive measures of multidrug resistant bacteria diffusion. Hand hygiene is the simplest and the most effective preventive measure to reduce cross-transmission of infectious agents. Hydroalcoholic solutions for hand hygiene was recently introduced in the University Hospital of Brest (France). The aims of the study were: to describe the epidemiology of healthcare-associated infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); to determine the annual consumptions of antistaphylococcal antibiotics; and to discuss the relation between consumption of antiseptic products or antibiotics and the epidemiology of MRSA. METHODS: A retrospective epidemiological and pharmaco-epidemiological study was realized from January 2004 to December 2007 in the University Hospital of Brest (France). It allowed to bring to light the cases of healthcare-associated infections due to MRSA and to quantify the consumptions of hang hygiene products and antistaphylococcal antibiotics. RESULTS: this retrospective study showed a decrease of healthcare-associated infections due to MRSA and an increase of the consumption of hydroalcoholic solutions. Antistaphylococcal resistance rates also decreased in a context of fall of the global antibiotics consumption in the hospital.
