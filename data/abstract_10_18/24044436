A straightforward strategy for the synthesis of triazole-containing MraY inhibitors has been developed. It involves the sequential introduction of a terminal alkyne at the 5' position of an uridine derivative and O-glycosylation with a protected aminoribose leading to an elaborated alkyne scaffold. An efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) allowed the introduction of chemical diversity toward a small library of inhibitors.
