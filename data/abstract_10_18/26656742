Staphylococcus haemolyticus is a healthcare-associated pathogen and can cause a variety of lifethreatening infections. Additionally, multi-drug resistance (MDR), in particular methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus (MRSH) isolates, have emerged. Dissemination of such strains can be of great concern in the hospital environment. A total number of 20S. haemolyticus isolates from blood cultures obtained from children were included in this study. A high prevalence of MDR-MRSH isolates with high MIC values to vancomycin was found and 35% of the isolates were intermediate resistant to vancomycin. Multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVF) revealed 5 MLVF types among 20 isolates of S. haemolyticus. Twelve isolates shared the same MLVF type and were isolated from different wards in a pediatric hospital in Iran. This is a serious alarm for infection control; i.e. in the absence of adequate infection diagnostics and infection control guidelines, these resistant strains can spread to other sectors of a hospital and possibly among the community.
