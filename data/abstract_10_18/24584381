Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common bacterial infection in mankind. The changing antimicrobial sensitivity in UTI demands use of appropriate antibiotics. This prospective study was performed in Comilla Medical Collage during the period of January 2011 to December 2011. Five hundred and fifty one urine specimens from clinically suspected UTI patients were examined by Semi quantitative culture method and their antimicrobial sensitivity patterns were determined by disc diffusion technique. The study was designed to isolate and identify the nature of bacteria in UTI with their sensitivity pattern to common antibiotics. Of the 551 tested sample 131 samples showed growth of pathogens among which the most prevalent were E. coli 98(75%) followed by Klebsiella pneumonia 14(10.7%) and Enterococcus 8(6%). The majority 96(73.3%) of the isolates were from female while the remaining were from male and this sex difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, nitrofurantoin, gentamycin, mecillinum and amoxyclav are found to be effective against 76-100% of the uropathogens. Most powerful antibiotics in our study were imipenem, meropenem, amikacin and nitrofurantoin which show their efficacy against 91-100% isolates. In more than 60% case shows their resistance against amoxycillin, nalidexic acid, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole and cephalosporins which raises the question regarding rationality to empirically use of these antibiotics in UTI with out culture and sensitivity reports.
