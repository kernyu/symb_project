BACKGROUND/AIMS: The effects of cigarette smoke (CS) on cyclosporine (CsA)-induced nephrotoxicity are poorly studied. This study aims to assess the effects of previous exposure to CS on CsA nephrotoxicity. METHODS: Rats were either exposed to CS or sham (S) procedures for 10 min twice a day for 20 weeks. From the 16th to the 20th week, they received a low-salt diet. Beginning with the 17th week, they were given 2.5 mg/day CsA or vehicle (VH) for 3 weeks. The final groups were VH/CS, CsA/CS, VH/S, and CsA/S. On day 141, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood flow (RBF), renal vascular resistance (RVR), tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and CsA blood levels were measured and immunohistochemistry was analyzed for renal alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), nitrotyrosine, and vimentin. RESULTS: CsA decrease in GFR was enhanced by CS exposure. CsA associated with CS induced higher periglomerular alpha-SMA and renal nitrotyrosine expression. CsA decreased RBF, but increased RVR, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and alpha-SMA and renal vimentin expression. These changes and the CsA blood levels were not affected by CS exposure. CONCLUSION: CS aggravated the CsA-induced impairment of GFR and CS associated with CsA caused the development of periglomerular structural lesions and oxidative stress in a rat model of CsA nephrotoxicity.
