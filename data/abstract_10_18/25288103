The genome sequence of a Sphingobium strain capable of tolerating high concentrations of Ni ions, and exhibiting natural kanamycin resistance, is presented. The presence of a transposon derived kanamycin resistance gene and several genes for efflux-mediated metal resistance may explain the observed characteristics of the new Sphingobium isolate.
