The experiment was performed to investigate the tetracycline resistance and antibiotic-resistant genotype of avian Escherichia coli in North China and to analyze the correlation of genotype and phenotype. The resistance of 164 E. coli isolates (from Beijing, Tianjin, inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Hebei regions of China) to tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline was investigated by using a drug susceptibility test. The results show that the rate of resistance to tetracycline antibiotics was 89.63% (147/164). The higher resistance rate was 84.76% (139/164) to tetracycline and 70.12% (115/164) to doxycycline, and the lowest resistance rate was 4.88% (8/164) to minocycline. The distribution of tetracycline resistance (Tcr) genes (tetA, tetB, tetC, and tetM) in avian E. coli isolates was detected by PCR. Of the isolates, 82.32% (135/164) carried tetracycline resistance genes. The positive rates of tetA, tetB, and tetM were 57.93% (95/164), 38.41% (63/164), and 10.97% (18/164), respectively. No tetC was amplified in avian E. coli isolates. The total positive rate of resistance genes (82.32%) was almost equal to the total rate of resistance to tetracycline antibiotics (89.63%). Thus, the positive rate of genotype was basically in line with that of phenotype for tetracycline resistance. The tetracycline resistance genes are widely distributed in E. coli and their main resistance mechanism to tetracycline is the active efflux effect mediated by tetA and tetB.
