Staphylococcus aureus is an important agent of bacterial mastitis in milking animals and of foodborne intoxication in humans. The purpose of this study was to examine the genetic and phenotypic diversity, enterotoxigenicity, and antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus strains isolated from raw milk used for the production of artisan cheese in Vermont. Cross-tabulations revealed that the 16 ribotypes identified among the 90 milk isolates examined were typically associated with a specific animal species and that more than half of these ribotypes were unique to individual farms. In general, specific EcoRI ribotypes were commonly associated with specific phenotypical characteristics, including staphylococcal enterotoxin production or the lack thereof. Limited antimicrobial resistance was observed among the isolates, with resistance to ampicillin (12.51%) or penicillin (17.04%) most common. Two isolates of the same ribotype obtained from the same farm were resistant to oxacillin with 2% NaCl. More than half (52.22%) of isolates produced toxin, and 31 of the 32 isolates solely produced staphylococcal enterotoxin type C. Although these data demonstrate that S. aureus strains found in raw milk intended for artisan cheese manufacture are capable of enterotoxin production, staphylococcal enterotoxin C is not typically linked to foodborne illness. Because S. aureus is a common contaminant of cheese, an understanding of the ecology of this pathogen and of the antimicrobial susceptibility and toxigenicity of various strains will ultimately contribute to the development of control practices needed to enhance the safety of artisan and farmstead cheese production.
