Listeria monocytogenes isolates from bovine hides and carcasses (n = 812) were mainly of serogroup 1/2a. All strains were positive for internalin genes. Several isolates were resistant to oxacillin (72.2%) or clindamycin (37.0%). These findings indicate that L. monocytogenes of beef origin can be considered a public health concern.
