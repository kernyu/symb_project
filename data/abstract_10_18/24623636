The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of silver nanoparticles on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their interactions with several conventional antibiotics and ability to induce a stress response were examined. Interactions between silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and antibiotics against free-living cells and biofilm of P. aeruginosa were studied using the chequerboard method and time-kill assays. The ability of AgNPs to induce a stress response was determined by evaluation of cellular levels of the DnaK and HtpG chaperones using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Synergistic activity against free-living P. aeruginosa between AgNPs and ampicillin, streptomycin, rifampicin and tetracycline, but not oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem or ceftazidime, was demonstrated by the chequerboard method. No such interactions were observed against P. aeruginosa biofilm. The results of time-kill assays confirmed synergy only for the AgNPs-streptomycin combination. AgNPs induced the expression of chaperone DnaK. No induction of the HtpG chaperone was detected. In conclusion, AgNPs not only display potent bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa, but also act synergistically with several conventional antibiotics to enhance their effect against free-living bacteria as determined by the chequerboard method. The time-kill assay proved synergy between AgNPs and streptomycin only. The ability of AgNPs to induce the major chaperone protein DnaK may influence bacterial resistance to antimicrobials.
