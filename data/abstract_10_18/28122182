This is the first report of the design of a new series of symmetric xanthone derivatives that mimic antimicrobial peptides using a total synthesis approach. This novel design is advantageous because of its low cost, synthetic simplicity and versatility, and easy tuning of amphiphilicity by controlling the incorporated cationic and hydrophobic moieties. Two water-soluble optimized compounds, 6 and 18, showed potent activities against Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA and VRE (MICs = 0.78-6.25 mug/mL) with a rapid bactericidal effect, low toxicity, and no emergence of drug resistance. Both compounds demonstrated enhanced membrane selectivity that was higher than those of most membrane-active antimicrobials in clinical trials or previous reports. The compounds appear to kill bacteria by disrupting their membranes. Significantly, 6 was effective in vivo using a mouse model of corneal infection. These results provide compelling evidence that these compounds have therapeutic potential as novel antimicrobials for multidrug-resistant Gram-positive infections.
