OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between colour Doppler findings, infectious parameters and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in patients with mild acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-seven patients diagnosed with PID were enrolled in the study. Resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) of uterine, arcuate and utero-ovarian arteries were measured, as well as VAS score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count and body temperature at hospital admission. After the initial visit, all measurements were repeated and recorded on days 7, 15 and 30. RESULTS: PI and RI values of uterine arteries showed significant increases between days 1 and 7. However, PI and RI values of uterine arteries, RI values of arcuate arteries and RI values of utero-ovarian arteries showed significant increases between days 1 and 30. Statistically significant decreases in infectious parameters and VAS scores were observed between days 1 and 7, days 1 and 15 and days 1 and 30. CONCLUSION: Infectious parameters and VAS scores showed concordant changes with clinical recovery in mild PID. Significant changes were also observed in PI and RI values of uterine arteries, but Doppler measurements of arcuate and utero-ovarian arteries showed a slower and later response to treatment.
