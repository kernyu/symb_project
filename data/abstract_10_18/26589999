We describe the first nosocomial outbreak of a toxic shock syndrome-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sequence type 5 Geraldine clone. Infection control interventions that are usually successful were implemented to control the outbreak. Spread of this virulent MRSA strain highlights the need to be vigilant to MRSA antibiotic susceptibilities.
