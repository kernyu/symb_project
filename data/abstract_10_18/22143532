Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major public health problem globally, especially because the bacterium has developed resistance to most antimicrobials introduced for first-line treatment of gonorrhea. In the present study, 96 N. gonorrhoeae isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin from 121 clinical isolates in Thailand were examined to investigate changes related to their plasmid-mediated penicillin resistance and their molecular epidemiological relationships. A beta-lactamase (TEM) gene variant, bla(TEM-135), that may be a precursor in the transitional stage of a traditional bla(TEM-1) gene into an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), possibly causing high resistance to all extended-spectrum cephalosporins in N. gonorrhoeae, was identified. Clonal analysis using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) revealed the existence of a sexual network among patients from Japan and Thailand. Molecular analysis of the bla(TEM-135) gene showed that the emergence of this allele might not be a rare genetic event and that the allele has evolved in different plasmid backgrounds, which results possibly indicate that it is selected due to antimicrobial pressure. The presence of the bla(TEM-135) allele in the penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae population may call for monitoring for the possible emergence of ESBL-producing N. gonorrhoeae in the future. This study identified a bla(TEM) variant (bla(TEM-135)) that is a possible intermediate precursor for an ESBL, which warrants international awareness.
