Thirty-nine HIV-1-infected patients treated for 156 weeks with a new nucleoside analogue-sparing regimen [raltegravir, etravirine and maraviroc (REM) or raltegravir, etravirine and darunavir/ritonavir (RED)] showed a uniform increase in fasting glucose levels and a uniform decrease in insulin secretory capacity. Diabetes mellitus occurred in one RED-treated and four REM-treated patients. A worsening glucose tolerance was observed in highly treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients receiving effective antiretroviral therapy after virological failure.
