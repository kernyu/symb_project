Corynebacterium striatum is often dismissed as a contaminant when cultivated from blood samples; indeed, it is a skin saprophyte that may therefore be introduced into the clinical specimen accidentally. Nevertheless, the organism can be responsible for true bacteraemias, and multidrug resistance spread among nosocomial strains is of increasing concern. Specific criteria for testing have not been defined yet, but we however suggest to report clear resistances (i.e. absence of any inhibition zones with the disc test), in order to try to understand this species behaviour under antibiotic exposure. In this context, features of a blood isolate (strain DSM 45711) are here depicted.
