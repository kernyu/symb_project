Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes various acute and chronic infections in humans. Treatment with azithromycin (AZM) has been shown to benefit patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infections. By binding to the exit tunnel of the 50S ribosome, AZM causes ribosome stalling and depletion of the intracellular tRNA pool. It has been shown that AZM is able to kill stationary-phase P. aeruginosa cells and repress quorum sensing-regulated virulence factors as well as swarming motility. In P. aeruginosa, the PA5470 gene encodes a putative peptide chain release factor whose expression is highly induced by macrolide antibiotics. However, its function remains unknown. Here, we found that overexpression of PA5470 increased bacterial tolerance against AZM and alleviated the repression of swarming motility. Ribosome pulldown assays revealed that PA5470 contributes to the release of ribosome stalled by AZM. We further demonstrate that overexpression of PA5470 counteracts AZM-mediated repression of the translation of the quorum sensing regulator RhlR. Overall, our results revealed a novel role of PA5470 in the bacterial response to AZM.
