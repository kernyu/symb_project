Broncho-pulmonary salmonelloses are rare manifestations of extraintestinal focal infections in adults caused by different subspecies of Salmonella. They may appear without previous gastroenteritic symptoms especially in patients older than 60 years, as well as in patients who are immunocompromised or suffer from chronic pulmonary diseases. The transmission route is hematogenous or via aspiration of contaminated gastric fluid. Complications are acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung abscesses and pleural empyemas. Complicated und lethal courses have been described frequently. Therefore, antibiotic therapy should be initiated in every case with sufficient duration of treatment and in accordance to antibiotic resistance. Recommended antibiotics are third generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin or fluoro-quinolones. In this review 4 different clinical courses of broncho-pulmonary salmonellosis caused by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Brandenburg, Salmonella groups B (O4), C (O6) and O11 to O67 are presented and discussed in the context of the current literature.
