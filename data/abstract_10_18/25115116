In the past years opportunistic fungal infections have seriously increased, mainly in immunocompromised patients. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of yeast-like fungi in invasive candidiasis and to estimate its susceptibility to chosen antifungal agents. One hundred and sixty strains of yeast-like fungi were cultured from various clinical material: samples from lower respiratory tract, blood, the peritoneal cavity and others. The susceptibility tests were established according to the quantitative E-test method. The Candida genus represented the main etiological factor of invasive candidiasis. The predominant species were: C. glabrata (71/160), C. albicans (34/160), C. krusei (17/160), C. tropicalis (14/160). All tested strains were the most resistant to itraconazole. Candida glabrata presented the 100% susceptibility to amphotericin B and caspofungin and was the least susceptible to itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole. Candida albicans was the most susceptible species to all antymicotics.
