The aim of this study was to assess the resistance level of Helicobacter pylori to levofloxacin and rifampicin from samples collected from pediatric and adult Israeli patients from 2012 to 2013. A total of 117 isolate samples of H. pylori were collected between 2012 and 2013. Isolates were cultured from stomach antrum biopsies and identified by the microbiology laboratory. Isolates were considered susceptible to levofloxacin and rifampicin by an Etest. Out of 117 isolates, 105 were found susceptible and 12 resistant to levofloxacin. For rifampicin, 104 isolates were susceptible and 13 were resistant. Study results estimate an alarming resistance rate, which reiterates the need for prudent use of alternative antibiotics to prevent further spread of resistant strains. Therefore, we suggest subjecting cultures from biopsy samples to susceptibility testing for the purpose of identification of strains resistant to levofloxacin and rifampicin among other antibiotic agents. This will allow for successful monitoring of microbial resistance and will assure prudent use of antimicrobial modalities.
