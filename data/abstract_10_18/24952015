The in vitro activity of isavuconazole and nine antifungal comparator agents was assessed using reference broth microdilution methods against 1,421 common and uncommon species of Candida from a 2012 global survey. Isolates were identified using CHROMagar, biochemical methods and sequencing of ITS and/or 28S regions. Candida spp. were classified as either susceptible or resistant and as wild type (WT) or non-WT using CLSI clinical breakpoints or epidemiological cutoff values, respectively, for the antifungal agents. Isolates included 1,421 organisms from 21 different species of Candida. Among Candida spp., resistance to all 10 tested antifungal agents was low (0.0-7.9 %). The vast majority of each species of Candida, with the exception of Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, and Candida guilliermondii (modal MICs of 0.5 microg/ml), were inhibited by </=0.12 microg/ml of isavuconazole (99.0 %; range 94.3 % [Candida tropicalis] to 100.0 % [Candida lusitaniae and Candida dubliniensis]). C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. guilliermondii were largely inhibited by </=1 microg/ml of isavuconazole (89.7, 96.9 and 92.8 %, respectively). Decreased susceptibility to isavuconazole was most prominent with C. glabrata where the modal MIC for isavuconazole was 0.5 microg/ml for those strains that were SDD to fluconazole or WT to voriconazole, and was 4 microg/ml for those that were either resistant or non-WT to fluconazole or voriconazole, respectively. In conclusion, these data document the activity of isavuconazole and generally the low resistance levels to the available antifungal agents in a large, contemporary (2012), global collection of molecularly characterized species of Candida.
