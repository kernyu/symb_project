HIV is known for its genetic variability across the globe. The HIV epidemic in India is primarily driven by subtype C, although sporadic circulating and unique recombinant forms are also reported from a few metropolitan cities in which genotyping facilities are available. Here we report a novel CRF01_AE/C recombinant from a multicenter study on the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART), 12 months after its initiation. Our subject is a 32-year-old heterosexual female, a native of Pune city in western India. Identification and analyses of recombination breakpoints using jpHMM@Gobics and SimPlot bootscanning revealed six recombination breakpoints, indicating insertion of the CRF01_AE genome at three points in the backbone of subtype C. Both subtype C and CRF01_AE are commonly seen in the population at risk of heterosexual HIV transmission, thereby providing an opportunity for cocirculation and recombination. The emergence of a novel recombinant of CRF01_AE/C is indicative of the increasing genetic diversity of the HIV epidemic in India.
