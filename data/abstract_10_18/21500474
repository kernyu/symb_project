UNLABELLED: Thanks of underreported and of difficulties of isolation, antibiotic susceptibility profile of N. gonorrhoeae strains circulating is not sufficiently known in our country as well in the Suceava county. In addition, WHO' experts recommended the establishment of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) values using E-test strips, completing the database at the European level. AIM: To determine the type of resistance of N. gonorrhoeae strains by E-test in patients with gonorrhoea in Suceava county, in the 2009 -2010 period. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We tested the sensitivity of 32 strains of N. gonorrhoeae isolated using classical algorithm and E-test strips according with CLSI 2008 (Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute) standard. We tested the sensitivity for penicillin, amoxicillin, augmentin, clarytromycin, tetracycline, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and spectinomycin. Production of beta-lactamases was performed using API-NH test (Neisseria-Haemophylus-Biomerieux). RESULTS: 96.9% strains were sensitive for ceftriaxone and spectinomycin, each 10 strains (31.2%) were resistant for penicillin and tetracycline, 34.5% strains were sensitive for amoxicillin, 37.5% sensitive for ciprofloxacin, and 13/32 strains (40.6%) were sensitive for augmentine. 7 strains were beta-lactamases positive and sensitive to all antibiotics, excepting penicillin and tetracyclin. Our results, especially the low rate of sensitivity for penicillin and tetracycline (68.8%) were similar with other from Asia, America or Africa, including Iasi region. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated for first time in the studied aria, using E-test strips, the level of resistance of N. gonorrhoeae offering useful informations for clinicians in order to treat the patients with ceftrixone and spectinomycine as empirical treatment, and for other antibiotics, according with antibiogram results.
