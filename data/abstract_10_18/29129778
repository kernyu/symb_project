OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze strains of the genera Bacteroides and Parabacteroides isolated from clinical specimens for phenotypic resistance to clindamycin; to detect erm genes; and to determine any correlation between in vitro resistance and the presence of erm genes. METHODS: The analyzed Bacteroides and Parabacteroides isolates had been obtained from patients hospitalized at teaching hospitals in Poland. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed with E-tests. The results were interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. All isolates were analyzed for resistance genes ermF, ermB, and ermG with the PCR technique. RESULTS: Resistance to clindamycin was detected in 31% of all evaluated isolates, with ermF and ermB genes detected in 31% and 0.5% of isolates, respectively. No isolates with the ermG gene were detected among the evaluated strains. Pearson's test showed an almost perfect correlation between clindamycin MIC values and the presence of ermF in Bacteroides spp. and Parabacteroides distasonis isolates although the ermF gene was also present in 10 clindamycin-susceptible isolates of Bacteroides spp. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a substantial proportion (22.52-100%, depending on the species) of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides strains exhibiting resistance to clindamycin. The clindamycin MIC value for resistant strains in each case was 256mg/L or higher. Resistance to clindamycin in Bacteroides and Parabacteroides species is correlated mainly with the presence of the ermF gene.
