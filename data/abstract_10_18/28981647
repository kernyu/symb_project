Objectives: To assess the prevalence of cryptic silver (Ag+) resistance amongst clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, and to examine how overt Ag+ resistance becomes activated in such strains. Methods: Established methods were used to determine the susceptibility of 444 recent clinical isolates to Ag+, and to evaluate the potential for overt Ag+ resistance to emerge in susceptible isolates by spontaneous mutation. The genetic basis for Ag+ resistance was investigated using PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Results: None of the isolates tested displayed overt Ag+ resistance. However, upon silver challenge, high-level Ag+ resistance (silver nitrate MIC >128 mg/L) was selected at high frequency (10-7 to 10-8) in 76% of isolates of Enterobacter spp., approximately 58% of isolates of Klebsiella spp. and approximately 0.7% of isolates of Escherichia coli. All strains in which Ag+ resistance could be selected harboured the sil operon, with resistance apparently resulting from activation of this system as a consequence of single missense mutations in silS. By contrast, Ag+ resistance was not selected in isolates lacking sil, which included all tested representatives of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter spp. and Proteus spp. Conclusions: Whilst overt Ag+ resistance in Gram-negative pathogens is uncommon, cryptic Ag+ resistance pertaining to the sil operon is prevalent and readily activated in particular genera (Enterobacter and Klebsiella).
