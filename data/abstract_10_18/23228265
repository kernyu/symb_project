INTRODUCTION: This investigation sought to compare the fracture resistance under static and fatigue loading of endodontically treated teeth restored with fiber-reinforced composite posts and experimental dentin posts milled from human root dentin by using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing. METHODS: Seventy maxillary central incisors were obturated and divided into 4 groups: control group without any post (n = 10), carbon fiber post group (n = 20), glass fiber post group (n = 20), and dentin post group (n = 20). Control group teeth were prepared to a height of 5 mm. In all other teeth, post space was prepared; a post was cemented, and a core build-up was provided. Half the samples from each group were statistically loaded until failure, and the remaining half were subjected to cyclic loading, followed by monostatic load until fracture. RESULTS: One-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni multiple comparisons revealed a significant difference among test groups. The control group demonstrated highest fracture resistance (935.03 +/- 33.53 N), followed by the dentin post group (793.12 +/- 33.69 N), glass fiber post group (603.44 +/- 46.67 N), and carbon fiber post group (497.19 +/- 19.27 N) under static loading. These values reduced to 786.69 +/- 29.64 N, 646.34 +/- 26.56 N, 470 +/- 36.34 N, and 379.71 +/- 13.95 N, respectively, after cyclic loading. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that human dentin can serve as post material under static and fatigue loading. Although at an early stage in research, the use of dentin posts in root-filled teeth looks promising.
