Antimicrobial resistance is a major health concern worldwide. A narrowing of the antibiotic development pipeline and a resurgence in public opinion towards 'natural' therapies have renewed the interest in using essential oils as antimicrobial agents. The drawbacks of bulk dosing of essential oils can be mitigated by formulating them as micro- and nanoemulsions. These emulsions have an added advantage as they are in the nanometre size range whose thermodynamic properties enable them to be used as an effective drug delivery system. This review describes the current work on the antimicrobial activities of essential oil micro- and nanoemulsions and their role as drug delivery vehicles.
