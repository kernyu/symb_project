Little information is available about pediatric infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli. We characterized an outbreak caused by a CTX-M-14-producing E. coli isolate in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and studied other infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli in non-NICU pediatric units. All children </=4 years old who were infected or colonized by ESBL-producing E. coli isolates between January 2009 and September 2010 were included. Molecular epidemiology was studied by phylogroup analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing. Antibiotic resistance genes were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Plasmids were studied by PFGE with S1 nuclease digestion and by incompatibility group analysis using a PCR-based replicon-typing scheme. Of the ESBL-producing E. coli isolates colonizing or infecting the 30 newborns, identical PFGE results were observed for 21 (70%) isolates, which were classified as CTX-M-14-producing E. coli of ST23 phylogroup A. bla(CTX-M-14a) was linked to ISEcp1 and was carried on an approximately 80-bp IncK plasmid. A smaller ongoing outbreak due to SHV-12-producing ST131 E. coli was also identified in the same NICU. Fifteen additional infections with ESBL-producing E. coli were identified in non-NICU pediatric units, but none was caused by the CTX-M-14-producing E. coli epidemic clone. Overall, CTX-M-14 (71.1%), CTX-M-15 (13.3%), and SHV-12 (13.3%) were the most important ESBLs causing pediatric infections in this study. Infections of newborns with CTX-M-14-producing E. coli were caused by both clonal and nonclonal isolates.
