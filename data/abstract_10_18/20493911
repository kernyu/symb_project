Candida glabrata is one of the most frequent organisms isolated from superficial and invasive fungal infections, after Candida albicans. This organism also exhibits intrinsically low susceptibility to azole antifungals and treatment often fails. The microdilution method is not very practical for use in routine susceptibility testing in the clinical laboratory, thus necessitating the use of other methods. In this study, we compared the in vitro activity of five antifungal agents in three different groups (echinocandin, polyene and azole) against 50 C. glabrata isolates by broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute CLSI M27-A3 and CLSI M44-A, respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B (100%) and 98% of the isolates were susceptible to caspofungin by the broth microdilution method. Within the azole group drugs, voriconazole was the most active followed by fluconazole and itraconazole in vitro. The highest rate of resistance was obtained against itraconazole with a high number of isolates defined as susceptible-dose dependent or resistant. Although the disk diffusion method is easy to use in clinical laboratories, it shows very poor agreement with the reference method for fluconazole and itraconazole against C. glabrata (8% and 14%, respectively).
