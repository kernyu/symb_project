Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing (QS) is a sophisticated network of genome-wide regulation triggered in response to population density. A major component is the self-inducing pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) QS system that regulates the production of several nonvital virulence- and biofilm-related determinants. Hence, QS circuitry is an attractive target for antivirulence agents with lowered resistance development potential and a good model to study the concept of polypharmacology in autoloop-regulated systems per se. Based on the finding that a combination of PqsR antagonist and PqsD inhibitor synergistically lowers pyocyanin, we have developed a dual-inhibitor compound of low molecular weight and high solubility that targets PQS transcriptional regulator (PqsR) and PqsD, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of PQS-QS signal molecules (HHQ and PQS). In vitro, this compound markedly reduced virulence factor production and biofilm formation accompanied by a diminished content of extracellular DNA (eDNA). Additionally, coadministration with ciprofloxacin increased susceptibility of PA14 to antibiotic treatment under biofilm conditions. Finally, disruption of pathogenicity mechanisms was also assessed in vivo, with significantly increased survival of challenged larvae in a Galleria mellonella infection model. Favorable physicochemical properties and effects on virulence/biofilm establish a promising starting point for further optimization. In particular, the ability to address two targets of the PQS autoinduction cycle at the same time with a single compound holds great promise in achieving enhanced synergistic cellular effects while potentially lowering rates of resistance development.
