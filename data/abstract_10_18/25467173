The study aimed to identify the proportion of tetM-positive Ureaplasma spp. isolates phenotypically susceptible to tetracycline by real-time PCR. Ureaplasma spp. strains of urogenital origin were isolated from 100 female or male adults on A7 agar plates. The presence of Ureaplasma was confirmed by the presence of urease gene by a novel real-time PCR method. Genotyping and sensitivity to tetracyclines were examined using commercial methods. The tetM gene was detected by a novel real-time PCR method especially designed for this study. Ureaplasma parvum was isolated from 87 of the specimens; Ureaplasma urealyticum, from 12; and both species were isolated from a single specimen. All isolates were phenotypically susceptible to tetracyclines. Thirty-five strains were tetM carriers; 29 (82.9%), U. parvum; 5 (14.3%), U. urealyticum; and 1 (2.9%), U. parvum/U. urealyticum. No statistically significant difference was observed between the 3 groups. Four (40%) tetM carriers were isolated from 10 symptomatic men; 11 (32.4%), from 34 symptomatic women; and 20 (35.7%), from 56 asymptomatic women. No statistically significant difference was observed between the 3 groups. The tetM determinant is detected in 35% of phenotypically susceptible to tetracycline Ureaplasma spp. Greek isolates. The use of a real-time PCR technique is particularly helpful, as it makes its detection easy; cost-effective; rapid; and, therefore, more convenient for the surveillance of the dissemination of the tetM resistance gene.
