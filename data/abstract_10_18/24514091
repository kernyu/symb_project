Moxifloxacin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants were selected in vitro using different concentrations of moxifloxacin. gyrA mutations at codons 88 and 94 were associated with resistance (defined as an MIC of >/=2 mug/ml) (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0053, respectively). Despite the presence of gyrA mutations, moxifloxacin significantly impedes bacterial growth, supporting its use for the treatment of ofloxacin-resistant M. tuberculosis.
