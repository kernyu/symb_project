The prevalence of anthelmintic resistance in Northern Ireland sheep flocks was evaluated between July and October 2011. Sampling kits were sent to 172 flock owners and returns were received from 91. Within this survey population, 27 flock owners used benzimidazole products, 10 used levamisole products, 15 used avermectin products, 26 used milbemycin products and 4 flock owners used the amino acetonitrile derivative, Monepantel. The remaining 9 flock owners used combination drenches (broad spectrum wormer plus fasciolicide). However, 15 sets of samples were ineligible for faecal egg count reduction testing due to either too low an egg count or insufficient faecal volume. Treatment efficacy below 95%, indicating significant resistance, was detected in 81% (n=24) of flocks tested for benzimidazole resistance; in 14% (n=1) of flocks tested for levamisole resistance; and in 50% (n=7) and 62% (n=13) of flocks tested for avermectin and milbemycin resistance, respectively. Monepantel resistance was absent in all (n=3) flocks tested. Combination products (broad spectrum nematocide plus flukicide) containing levamisole were entirely effective, while treatment efficacy below 95% was detected in 60% (n=3) of flocks where the nematocide in the combination product was a benzimidazole. Where parasite identification based on coproculture was completed, Trichostrongylus was the dominant genus detected in all cases post-treatment, indicating the occurrence of anthelmintic-resistant Trichostrongylus spp. populations. Benzimidazole efficacy was highest in treating Trichostrongylus spp. (51%) and lowest when treating Teladorsagia spp. Levamisole was 100% effective in treating Cooperia, but ineffective (0%) in treating Trichostrongylus spp. Avermectin efficacy was highest when treating Haemonchus contortus (100%) and Teladorsagia spp. (73%), with a marginally lower efficacy against Trichostrongylus spp. (71%). Moxidectin efficacy was 33% against Trichostrongylus spp., 68% against Teladorsagia spp., 97% against Cooperia spp. and 100% against Haemonchus contortus infections.
