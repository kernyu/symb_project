OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective study was to assess the extent of dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae at the hospital level in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 662 Escherichia coli and Klebsiellapneumoniae samples were collected from three UAE hospitals between January and December 2008. ESBL screening and confirmatory test for ESBL phenotype were conducted using the VITEK system. Molecular typing was performed using specific primers and then sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 240 (36%) samples were identified as ESBL producers, including both E. coli (n = 150) and K. pneumoniae (n = 90). All of these isolates were resistant to cefazoline and cefotaxime, but remained susceptible to imipenem. Molecular analysis revealed that, of the 240 ESBL producers, 228 carried the ESBL bla genes. A majority of the strains 199 (87%) expressed the CTX-M-15 gene. The SHV-28 gene was detected in 29 (13%) of the strains. CONCLUSION: The present study highlighted the emergence and dissemination of CTX-M-15-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the UAE. This is the first report of SHV-28-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the country.
