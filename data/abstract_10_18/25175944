OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of a novel anti-hepatitis C agent, sofosbuvir. KEY FINDINGS: Sofosbuvir is a novel nucleotide analogue inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase that has recently been approved by the Federal Drug Administration for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4 in a variety of patients. The emergence of such a novel treatment provides benefit to previously untreated genotypes and patient populations, with little chance of promoting significant viral resistance. Excellent sustained virologic response rates 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12) were seen in phase II and III clinical trials when sofosbuvir was used with ribavirin. Even more promising are the results from phase II and III clinical trials that evaluated sofosbuvir in combination with other oral direct acting antivirals (DAAs). Data with sofosbuvir in the hepatitis C virus (HCV)/HIV coinfected and in the pre- and post-transplantation populations are still emerging. The drug was very well tolerated in clinical studies, with the most common adverse events of headache, nausea and fatigue. SUMMARY: Overall, sofosbuvir presents a new and effective treatment option for HCV-infected patients.
