Spectinomycin is an aminocyclitol antibiotic used clinically to treat a variety of infections in animals. Here, we characterized drug resistance prevalence in clinical Streptococcus suis isolates and discovered a novel resistance mechanism in which the s5 mutation (Gly26Asp) results in high spectinomycin resistance. Additionally, a novel integrative and conjugative element encompassing a multidrug resistance spw_like-aadE-lnu(B)-lsa(E) cluster and a cadmium resistance operon were identified, suggesting a possible cause for the wide dissemination of spectinomycin resistance in S. suis.
