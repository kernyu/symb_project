INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistances to antimicrobial drugs pose serious public health challenges. The observed increase of resistances is attributed to the uncontrolled, massive and often unnecessary administration of antibiotics both in human and veterinary medicine. To support the responsible use of antimicrobials in animals and help veterinarians selecting the most suitable antimicrobial drugs, we developed the AntibioticScout.ch as a comprehensive decision supporting tool providing online access to the current knowledge of rational antibiotic prescription practices. User-friendly search functions allow for the fast and efficient retrieval of information that is structured in this database by animal species, organ systems and therapeutic indications. In addition, an online form allows to report treatment failures in order to identify problematic cases as well as ensuing risks and take appropriate mitigation measures. The present report describes the workflow of this decision support system applied to the prudent use of antimicrobials in companion animal medicine.
