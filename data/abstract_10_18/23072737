We report on the synthesis of ferrocenyl-ampicillin and ferrocenyl-6-aminopenicillinic acid bioconjugates. Title compounds were characterized by (1)H NMR, IR, MS and elemental analysis. These novel ferrocenyl-antibiotic conjugates were also investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Ferrocenyl-ampicillin complexes revealed reversible uncomplicated oxidation whereas ferrocenyl-6-aminopenicillinic acid derivatives were found to exhibit adsorption waves in cathodic scans. Antibacterial activities of our ferrocenyl-antibiotic conjugates against Gram-positive methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacterial strains were determined. Our experiments show significant antibacterial activity of ferrocenyl-6-aminopenicillinic acid bioconjugates against the bacterial strains tested. Contrary to that ferrocenyl-ampicillin derivatives were inactive. The inhibitory effects on the dd-carboxypeptidase 64-575 II exerted by our ferrocenyl-6-aminopenicillinic acid bioconjugates were established in the low nanomolar range. The tumor cell growth inhibition of representative ferrocenyl-ampicillin and ferrocenyl-6-aminopenicillinic acid bioconjugates against MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma and HT-29 colon carcinoma cell lines were studied in vitro. Similar to the antibacterial activity tests the assays in tumor cells revealed significant antiproliferative effects exerted by ferrocenyl-6-aminopenicillinic acid bioconjugates.
