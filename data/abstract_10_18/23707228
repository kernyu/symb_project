It has been shown that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) can greatly affect the cell uptake of antiretroviral drugs, thus hampering their access to HIV-1 replication sites. Lymphocytes are important sites of replication of HIV and target of other drugs, modification on these cells of P-gp could have an effect on pharmacokinetic of antiretrovirals and drug substrates. Blood samples from 16 healthy volunteers were used to determine the expression of P-gp on total, T and T helper lymphocytes after exposure to darunavir, a second generation protease inhibitor, and raltegravir, the first approved integrase inhibitor. Moreover, the effect of the drugs on P-gp functional activity was also studied by the rhodamine-123 efflux test. Darunavir, but not raltegravir, exposure caused a moderate, dose-dependent increment in P-gp expression in total, T and T helper lymphocytes, as demonstrated by the relative frequency of P-gp+ cells and by the amount of P-gp molecules present on cell surface. Functionally, incubation with darunavir led to a marked inhibition of P-gp activity measured by the efflux of rhodamine-123 similar to that observed by verapamil, a specific P-gp inhibitor. Raltegravir was not able to modify the efflux of rhodamine-123 level. Data show that darunavir, unlike raltegravir, may modify the expression and functionality of P-gp on human lymphocytes, thus leading to potential changes in intracellular concentrations of darunavir in patients treated with other drugs substrate of P-gp and vice versa. Our study highlights the need for studies on drug interactions via the P-gp modulation mechanism, especially with the current multi-drug regimens.
