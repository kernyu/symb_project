BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Poor compliance to therapy and antibiotic resistance are the main causes for failure of anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) therapy. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of omeprazole-based triple therapy in Iranian children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven children with H. pylori-related gastroduodenal disease received 1-week triple therapy with a combination of omeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin (according to the susceptibility test). Success of eradication was assessed by (13)C-urea breath test and endoscopy. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (mean age 11.3years; range 2.7-16years) were included. Eradication was successful in 84.2% (95% confidence interval, 72.8% intention to treat). CONCLUSION: One-week triple therapy was effective for the eradication of H. pylori infection in children.
