Five new pinocembrin derivatives (MC1-MC5) were synthesized by Steglich reaction, and investigated for their antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activity. MC2 (oleoyl derivative) and MC3 (linoleoyl derivative) have shown the highest inhibitory effects on bacterial proliferation, with MIC values of 32 mug/mL against Staphylococcus aureus. The docosahexaenoyl derivative MC5 displayed the highest anti-inflammatory activity, decreasing NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages with an IC50 value of 15.51 mug/mL higher than the positive control diclofenac (IC50 of 39.71 mug/mL). All new synthesized compounds showed no anti-proliferative effects on RAW 264.7 cells. Results demonstrated as the introduction of fatty acid substituents improved the biological profile of pinocembrin. Moreover, the chemical nature of substituents significantly affects the bioactivity. These preliminary results outline the importance to investigate the synthesis of pinocembrin fatty acids derivatives as new and safe anti-microbial/anti-inflammatory agents.
