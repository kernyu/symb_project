Recently the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux pumps have been proved to be a major component of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression profiles of Rv1456c-Rv1457c-Rv1458c efflux system in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and its involvement in drug-resistance mechanisms. Significantly increased mRNA expression of Rv1456c, Rv1457c, and Rv1458c appeared among the clinical isolates (P < 0.05), which are resistant to at least one of the four first-line drugs including rifampin, isoniazid, streptomycin, and ethambutol. In addition, overexpression of this efflux system was more frequently found in multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. Therefore, Rv1456c-Rv1457c-Rv1458c efflux pumps may play an important role in drug resistance of treatment of M. tuberculosis. Further investigation of this gene may lead to the development of countermeasures against M. tuberculosis drug resistance.
