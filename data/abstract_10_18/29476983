OBJECTIVES: Klebsiella pneumoniae is considered an opportunistic pathogen and important agent of nosocomial and community infections. It presents the ability to capture and harbor several antimicrobial resistance genes, and in this context, the extensive use of carbapenems to treat serious infections was responsible for selection of several resistance genes. In this study, we report the draft genome sequence of a KPC-2-procuding K. pneumoniae strain (Kp10) simultaneously harboring the blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-59 genes, isolated from urine culture of a patient with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Classical microbiologic methods were applied to isolate and identify the strain, and PCR and sequencing were used to identify and characterize the genes and the genetic environment. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using Nextera XT DNA library and a NextSeq platform. RESULTS: WGS analysis revealed the presence of 5,915 coding genes, 46 RNA-encoding genes, and 255 pseudogenes. Kp10 belongs to Sequence Type (ST)340, Clonal Complex (CC)258, and carries 20 transferable genes associated to antimicrobial resistance, comprising seven drug classes. Instead not common in a single strain, blaKPC-2, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-59 genes are not associated to the same genetic mobile structure in Kp10. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the capacity of K. pneumoniae to harbor several antimicrobial resistance genes. Thus, this draft genome could help in future epidemiological studies regarding the dissemination of clinically relevant resistance genes.
