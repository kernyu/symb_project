We examined the susceptibility in vitro of 99 isolates of Mycoplasma (M. bovirhinis, M. bovis, M. alkalescens and M. bovoculi) and one of Acholeplasma laidlawii collected in 2008 and 2009 from Japanese homebred cattle and cows imported from Australia to 13 antimicrobial agents. Mycoplasma species isolated from homebred cattle were susceptible to spectinomycin and fluoroquinolones but resistant to macrolides, tetracyclines, thiamphenicol and flumequine. Kanamycin, lincomycin and chloramphenicol maintained intermediate effectiveness against these species. The isolates from the imported cows maintained sufficient susceptibility to all antimicrobials examined except for erythromycin and thiamphenicol. These results showed that four species of Mycoplasma isolated from Japanese homebred cattle had obviously higher drug resistance compared with previous reports, even within this decade.
