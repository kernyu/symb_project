AIM: To describe the clinical, endoscopic and histological particularities of early stage HP associated gastric MALT lymphoma resistant to anti Hp treatment and identify predicting factors of resistance. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 12 patients with primary low grade gastric localized MALT lymphoma treated with anti HP treatment and diagnosed at La Rabta Hospital from 1999 to 2009. RESULTS: The ultrasonography was normal in 5 patients between the 6 responding patients. Perigastric lymph nodes were found in non responders (33.3%). Hp eradication was achieved in 66% of patients not responding while Hp was eradicated in 100% of responders. The two non-responding patients with failure of eradication of Hp had a strain resistant to Clarithromycin Hp. CONCLUSION: Predicting factors of failure of anti HP: HP resistance to antibiotics, the proximal head, and the presence of perigastric lymph nodes. Recently, chromosomal aberrations and immune-histochemical markers have been implicated as factors of non response to anti Hp.
