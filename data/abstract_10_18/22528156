Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are presently the only effective antiviral drugs for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza A and B infections, due to the high prevalence of resistance to the adamantane class of drugs among influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain. The limited pharmaceutical options currently available for control of influenza infections underscore the critical need for surveillance on NAI susceptibility of influenza viruses circulating globally. This chapter describes the fluorescent neuraminidase (NA) inhibition (NI) assay, a functional method used for assessing influenza virus susceptibility to NAIs. The IC(50) (drug concentration needed to reduce the NA enzymatic activity by 50%) values generated in this assay are used to evaluate the NAI-susceptibility of test viruses relative to those of sensitive reference viruses of the same antigenic type and subtype. Test viruses with significantly elevated IC(50)s are further analyzed by pyrosequencing or conventional sequencing to identify known markers of NAI resistance or novel changes in the NA. The harmonization of NI assay conditions and interpretation of results across surveillance laboratories is necessary to improve NAI susceptibility testing and analysis.
