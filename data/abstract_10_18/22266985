The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains disappointing due to a high intrinsic resistance against chemotherapeutic agents. Standard gemcitabine therapies have improved overall survival only marginally and recently, inhibition of the proteasome by the boronic acid derivative bortezomib has been introduced as a novel therapeutic strategy for solid and hematological malignancies including pancreatic cancer. The mucus-producing pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 was cultured under standard conditions and treated with different concentrations of gemcitabine or bortezomib. Mucus production was suppressed by siRNA-mediated silencing of apomucin genes. Cell proliferation was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation and apoptosis was quantified after propidium iodide staining by flow cytometry. Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by TUNEL staining, determination of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and assessment of caspase 3/7 activity. NFkappaB-activity was determined by EMSA. The unfolded protein response (UPR) was further investigated by PCR, Western blotting and caspase 12 activity assays. Silencing of MUC4 significantly reduced expression of mucins for up to 5 days after transfection. While native cells showed an increased sensitivity to bortezomib treatment, silenced cells were more sensitive to gemcitabine treatment. Bortezomib induces mitochondrial damage in native cells and also activates the UPR by splicing of Xbp-1 and induction of CHOP, which is significantly reduced by silencing of MUC4. Our data suggest that mucinous pancreatic cancers are more sensitive towards proteasome inhibition by bortezomib and that alternative pathways of apoptosis are involved in cell death induction, while tumor cells with a low secretory activity show a better response to gemcitabine.
