Despite the adoption of antifungal prophylaxis, fungal infections remain a significant concern in lung transplant recipients. Indeed, some concern exists that such prophylaxis may increase the risk of infection with drug-resistant fungal organisms. Here, we describe a case of disseminated Scedosporium prolificans infection, presenting as pericarditis, which developed in a lung transplant patient receiving prophylactic voriconazole for 8 months. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of S. prolificans infections are reviewed, and controversies surrounding antifungal prophylaxis and the development of resistant infections are discussed.
