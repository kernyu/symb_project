A bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (BMAP-28) is a member of the cathelicidin family which is included in the innate immune system of mammals. Recently, there have been many studies about antimicrobial peptides. This study aims to clarify whether BMAP-28 has bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and compares its activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA. We found that the peptide was effective in killing MRSA (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range; 5-20 microg/mL). It was also revealed that MSSA (MIC range; 1.25-20 microg/mL) had two levels of susceptibility to BMAP-28. We also examined the effect of BMAP-28 on bacterial shape to visually show its activity. After exposure to the peptide, both MSSA and MRSA cells showed the morphological changes on their surfaces. Our results indicate that BMAP-28 is a promising candidate for medicine against drug-resistant bacteria.
