BACKGROUND: Abscess of native kidney is a rare postoperative event after renal transplantation. This report describes a case of back pain, fever and pyuria caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) in a patient who underwent renal-transplantation. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old man, presenting with hypertension and renal failure, underwent renal transplantation 1 month previously. He developed sudden intense back pain and fever (39 degrees C). There was normal blood flow in graft kidney but there were the swelling and cyst of right native kidney. We aspirated the pus in native kidney and performed the native nephrectomy. The carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) was isolated as in pus and native kidney. We performed the tigecyline monotherapy during 3 weeks. He recovered without complication after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, no report in the literature to date describes abscess in native kidney secondary to CRAB in a renal transplant. Infections caused by CRAB have become critical for immunosuppressed patients. The presence of complication greater risk, by an organism whose pathogenicity and virulence are not yet elucidated should determine an aggressive empirical antimicrobial therapy.
