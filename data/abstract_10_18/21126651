BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To evaluate the epidemiology, clinical features, and microbiological features (including antibiotic susceptibility) of infective endocarditis (IE) at Kitasato University Hospital, Japan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients (155 episodes) with definite IE according to the Duke criteria, who presented over a 17-year period. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics for cultured causative microorganisms were also examined. RESULTS: Viridans group streptococci were the most common pathogens (36.8%, 57 episodes), followed by Staphylococcus aureus [21.3%, 33 episodes, including 10 episodes due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)]. Thirty-nine of the 40 strains of viridans streptococci were fully susceptible to penicillin. Comparison of IE due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA showed that the latter had a higher mortality rate (34.8%, 8/23 vs. 70.0%, 7/10). Compared with MSSA, IE caused by MRSA was significantly more likely to be related to nosocomial infection (10/10, p < 0.001), hemodialysis (4/10, 40.0%, p = 0.005), and surgery or intravascular catheter insertion (8/10, 80.0%, p = 0.007). There was a significantly higher mortality rate in non-operated (15/43, 34.9%) than in operated (2/21, 9.5%) (p < 0.001) elderly patients. In 92/155 episodes (59.4%), antibiotics were given before blood cultures were obtained. Culture-negative IE occurred in 20.7% (19/92) of patients on antibiotics versus 6.3% (4/63) of those not on antibiotics (p = 0.02). Of 155 episodes of IE, 34 (21.9%) were fatal and staphylococcal had significantly higher mortality than streptococcal IE [(19/40, 47.5%) vs. (7/72, 9.7%); p < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: The most frequently isolated pathogens were viridans group streptococci, which differed from other recent studies. In the present study, no penicillin-resistant strains were detected and there was a higher mortality rate for IE caused by MRSA than MSSA. IE should be considered in MRSA patients with the following risk factors: nosocomial infection, hemodialysis, and surgery or intravascular catheter insertion.
