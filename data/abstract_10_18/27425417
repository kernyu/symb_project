INTRODUCTION: Fungating classic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) tumors represent a therapeutic challenge given the increased risk of resistance to traditional local chemotherapy and the frequent concomitant skin infections. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect and tolerability of silver nitrate cauterization in patients with fungating KS tumors. METHODS: A single arm, prospective study in patients with soft, fungating and/or oozing KS tumors cauterized with silver nitrate sticks. The application was repeated once every three weeks until the lesion became fibrous or after two consecutive applications without any clinical improvement. RESULTS: Eleven patients (10 males, one female, mean age of 75.8 years) with at least one fungating KS tumor of the lower limbs were treated. Complete or partial resolution of the KS lesion was achieved in 91% of patients after an average of 2.1 treatments (range, 1-4 treatments). CONCLUSIONS: Fungating KS tumors can be treated simply, effectively and safely in the office with silver nitrate cauterization.
