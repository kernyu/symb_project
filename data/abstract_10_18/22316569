OBJECTIVES: The colonization of indwelling medical devices and subsequent biofilm formation represents a global challenge since it promotes the persistence of infection and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual microbial colonizers and to assess their efficacy regarding biofilm formation on polyurethane (PUR)-like catheters. METHODS: The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effect of cerium nitrate, low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC) and hamamelitannin was tested against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans strains. Biofilm formation was assessed with PUR-like catheter segments and the metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. RESULTS: Cerium nitrate and LMWC inhibited the microbial growth of all microbial strains tested; hamamelitannin showed no inhibition. Regarding biofilm formation on PUR-like catheters, with subinhibitory concentrations: cerium nitrate significantly inhibited the metabolic activity of C. albicans; LMWC reduced the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and C. albicans; and hamamelitannin decreased the metabolic activity of all tested bacteria, but not of yeasts. CONCLUSIONS: The microbicidal activity of cerium nitrate and LMWC was clearly demonstrated in this study, as was their fungistatic effect at lower concentrations. Hamamelitannin significantly reduced biofilm metabolic activity of all tested bacteria. These microbial inhibitors may play a promising role regarding different biomedical applications.
