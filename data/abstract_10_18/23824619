Infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms are becoming more frequently in daily practice and are associated with an increase in duration of treatment and mortality. During the past decades, particular attention in the field of MDR pathogens was paid to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For the last years, MDR gram-negative organisms, with e.g., "extended-spectrum beta-lactamases" (ESBL), have been gaining a growing significance. Currently, treatment of infections with these organisms displays a greater challenge for the clinician compared to MRSA infections. This review illustrates the emergence of antibiotic resistance, provides information on the most important gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, Clostridium difficile and measures to prevent their further spread.
