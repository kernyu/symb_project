The role of vancomycin in the treatment of serious Staphylococcus aureus infections, both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant, is becoming increasingly ineffective due to increasing MIC and failure. The development of reduced vancomycin susceptibility by S. aureus to glycopeptides highlights the need for clinicians to reexamine the roles of non-glycopeptide therapy. As the use of these alternative non-glycopeptides antimicrobials increases, it will become pertinent to monitor the rates of resistance. Large surveillance programs have provided data for resistance against S. aureus for the non-glycopeptides (daptomycin, ceftaroline, tigecycline, linezolid, and tedizolid). The current published literatures suggest that worldwide resistance rates to these non-glycopeptides for serious MRSA infections are still low. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs will be crucial in prevention of resistance of these antimicrobials against S. aureus.
