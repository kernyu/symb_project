The emergence of multiple-resistant isolates poses a serious problem in the hospital environment making it important to evaluate the responsible factors. This work ascertains the mechanisms responsible for the development of resistance in enterobacterial clinical isolates. The major resistance mechanisms have been explored. The presence of target mutations, drug hydrolyzing enzymes, active efflux pump, and drug-resistance genes were elucidated experimentally employing standard methods. One of the clinical isolates was resistant to five classes of structurally unrelated antibiotics and showed involvement of multiple resistance mechanisms. Here, we report the simultaneous presence of multiple drug-resistance mechanisms in an Escherichia coli clinical isolate.
