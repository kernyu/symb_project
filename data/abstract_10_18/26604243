OBJECTIVES: Mutations in the gyrase genes cause fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the predictive value of these markers for clinical outcomes in patients with MDR-TB is unknown to date. The objective of this study was to determine molecular markers and breakpoints predicting second-line treatment outcomes in M. tuberculosis patients treated with fourth-generation fluoroquinolones. METHODS: We analysed treatment outcome data in relation to the gyrA and gyrB sequences and MICs of ofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin for pretreatment M. tuberculosis isolates from 181 MDR-TB patients in Bangladesh whose isolates were susceptible to injectable drugs. RESULTS: The gyrA 90Val, 94Gly and 94Ala mutations were most frequent, with the highest resistance levels for 94Gly mutants. Increased pretreatment resistance levels (>2 mg/L), related to specific mutations, were associated with lower cure percentages, with no cure in patients whose isolates were resistant to gatifloxacin at 4 mg/L. Any gyrA 94 mutation, except 94Ala, predicted a significantly lower proportion of cure compared with all other gyrA mutations taken together (all non-94 mutants + 94Ala) [OR = 4.3 (95% CI 1.4-13.0)]. The difference in treatment outcome was not explained by resistance to the other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that gyrA mutations at position 94, other than Ala, predict high-level resistance to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, as well as poor treatment outcome, in MDR-TB patients in whom an injectable agent is still effective.
