The first synthesis of 2-methyl-6-pentadecyl-Delta(1,6)-piperideine (1), a major alkaloid of the piperideine chemotype in fire ant venoms, and its analogues, 2-methyl-6-tetradecyl-Delta(1,6)-piperideine (2) and 2-methyl-6-hexadecyl-Delta(1,6)-piperideine (3), was achieved by a facile synthetic method starting with glutaric acid (4) and urea (5). Compound 1 showed in vitro antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans with IC50 values of 6.6 and 12.4 mug/mL, respectively, and antibacterial activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium with an IC50 value of 19.4 mug/mL, while compounds 2 and 3 were less active against these pathogens. All three compounds strongly inhibited the parasites Leishmania donovani promastigotes and Trypanosoma brucei with IC50 values in the range of 5.0-6.7 and 2.7-4.0 mug/mL, respectively.
