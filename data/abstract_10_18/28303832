Central nervous system (CNS) shunts are commonly used to treat patients with hydrocephalus. Its placement is associated with increased risk of infection. The study was intended to evaluate infection rate associated with CNS shunt surgeries and identify risk factors for shunt infection. The frequency and characterisation of aetiological agents along with their antibiotic resistance pattern were also studied. A prospective study of 86 patients who underwent 97 surgeries over a period of 18 months was conducted. One hundred seventy-six cerebrospinal fluid samples and 44 shunt tips obtained were processed using standard microbiological techniques. Of 86 patients, 39 (45.35%) operated for shunt revision were infected while 47 patients operated for shunt insertion were not found to be infected. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate. 57.58% isolates of Staphylococci were found to be biofilm producers. Mortality of 15% was observed among infected patients. Shunt infection remains a serious issue in the patients undergoing shunt surgery. Accurate diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infection are essential in such patients.
