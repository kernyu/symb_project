Staphylococcus aureus with the ability of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) production is one of the most common causes of bacterial foodborne outbreaks worldwide. In our study, 336 S. aureus isolates were recovered from 3476 food samples during 2010-2014. A total of 86 S. aureus isolates were proved to be enterotoxin-producing strains with PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the 86 isolates, 20 STs were identified using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and 20 isolates were typed as sequence type 5 (ST5), which was the most prevalent ST using MLST. There were six SE profiles and high carrier rates of sec (50%) and sed (75%) genes in the 20 S. aureus ST5 isolates. Additionally, 8 antibiotic resistance patterns were observed, and 10 multidrug-resistant isolates (50%) and 4 methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were identified. Our findings illustrate high prevalence of S. aureus ST5 isolates from food sources and diversity in SE profiles and antibiotic resistance patterns. These results indicate that great difference in the ability of obtaining SE production and antimicrobial resistance may exist between different genetic lineages of S. aureus strains.
