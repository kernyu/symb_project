Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense strain MSR-1 has the unique capability of taking up large amounts of iron and synthesizing magnetosomes (intracellular magnetic particles composed of Fe(3)O(4)). The unusual high iron content of MSR-1 makes it a useful model for studying biological mechanisms of iron uptake and homeostasis. The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein plays a key role in maintaining iron homeostasis in many bacteria. We identified and characterized a fur-homologous gene (MGR_1314) in MSR-1. MGR_1314 was able to complement a fur mutant of E. coli in iron-responsive manner in vivo. We constructed a fur mutant strain of MSR-1. In comparison to wild-type MSR-1, the mutant strain had lower magnetosome formation, and was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and streptonigrin, indicating higher intracellular free iron content. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that Fur protein directly regulates expression of several key genes involved in iron transport and oxygen metabolism, in addition it also functions in magnetosome formation in M. gryphiswaldense.
