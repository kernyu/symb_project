Multidrug-resistant infections represent an increasing problem in the management of hospitalized patients worldwide. With respect to Gram-negative infections, carbapenems are an important antimicrobial class for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum beta lactamase producers enterobacteriaceae. However, the emergence of novel beta-lactamases with direct carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity has contributed toward an increased prevalence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae. Recent reports have described the spread of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae across the world. There are very few existing agents that can be used against these pathogens and there are limited options on the horizon. In recent years, the epidemiology of bacterial strains involved in the pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has also been changing rapidly. In this setting, we report the first case of nosocomial spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae.
