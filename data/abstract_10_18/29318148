Resistant uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infections in dogs. The present research was done to study the prevalence rate and antimicrobial resistance properties of UPEC strains isolated from healthy dogs and those which suffered from UTIs. Four-hundred and fifty urine samples were collected and cultured. E. coli-positive strains were subjected to disk diffusion and PCR methods. Two-hundred out of 450 urine samples (44.4%) were positive for E. coli. Prevalence of E. coli in healthy and infected dogs was 28% and 65%, respectively. Female had the higher prevalence of E. coli (P = 0.039). Marked seasonality was also observed (P = 0.024). UPEC strains had the highest levels of resistance against gentamicin (95%), ampicillin (85%), amikacin (70%), amoxicillin (65%), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (65%). We found that 21.50% of UPEC strains had simultaneously resistance against more than 10 antibiotics. Aac(3)-IV (77%), CITM (52.5%), tetA (46.5%), and sul1 (40%) were the most commonly detected antibiotic resistance genes. Findings showed considerable levels of antimicrobial resistance among UPEC strains of Iranian dogs. Rapid identification of infected dogs and their treatment based on the results of disk diffusion can control the risk of UPEC strains.
