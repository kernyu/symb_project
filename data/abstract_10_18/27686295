OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Enterococcus faecalis and recent trends in antimicrobial sensitivity profiling. METHODS: The study was conducted at Chughtais Lahore Lab, Lahore, Pakistan, from December 2013 to May 2014, and comprised urine specimens from suspected patients. Antimicrobial profiling of isolated strains of Enterococcus faecalis was determined by Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the230 specimens, 161(70%) were positive for Enterococcus faecalis. The prevalence of Enterococcus faecalis-mediated urinary tract infections was 120(74.53%) in females and 41(25.46%) in males. Age-wise distribution of urinary tract infections among female patients was 41(34.16%) in >65 years age group. In males, the prevalence in the same age group was 19(46.34%). Besides, 145(90.09%) strains of Enterococcus faecalis exhibited resistance to gentamicin, 140(86.95%) to norfloxacin. Moreover, 138(85.71%) strains exhibited multi-drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: An overall pattern of drug resistance infections was observed in a majority of isolates.
