1,2,3,4-Butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) was reacted with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) to a poly(amic)acid (PAA). The molar ratios of BTCA and APTES were 1/1 (B/A-1/1), 1/2 (B/A-1/2), 1/3 (B/A-1/3), and 1/4 (B/A-1/4). The as-prepared precursor solution was applied to cotton substrates. After thermal treatment (180 degrees C) the physical-mechanical properties of the cotton samples were tested by means of dry crease recovery angle and tensile strength. For B/A-1/1 treated fabrics a significant improvement of the crease resistance was observed. FT-IR spectra revealed the formation of an imide group and an ester linkage, indicating the cross-linking of the cellulosic material. SEM images showed a smooth surface. As evidenced by TGA data the thermal stability of the cotton samples was not increased. No hydrophobicity could be observed. For B/A-1/3 and (B/A-1/4) modified cotton samples no crease resistant properties were detected. However, enhanced contact angle values were measured. A reaction mechanism for the formation of the ladder-like polysilsesquioxane and the cross-linking reaction is proposed.
