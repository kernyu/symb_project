A 10-year-old male giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) presented for severe, acute swelling and protrusion of the right nictitating membrane, unresponsive to topical therapy. Excisional biopsy of the nictitating membrane and its associated lacrimal gland was elected due to necrosis and friability of the tissue. Histopathology revealed suppurative, necrotizing conjunctivitis and dacryoadenitis. Culture grew Stenotrophomonas maltophila and Enterococcus spp with extensive antibiotic resistance. Treatment with topical and systemic antibiotics based on sensitivity results was initiated. All treatments were well tolerated. Healing was uncomplicated with no recurrence of the lesion and no clinical evidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Ophthalmic exams and Schirmer tear tests performed opportunistically during postoperative anesthetic procedures were unremarkable, confirming that excision of the nictitating membrane had not caused clinically significant detrimental effects. The etiology of this lesion remains undetermined, but trauma is suspected. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of nictitating membrane pathology and excision in the giant panda.
