PURPOSE: To determine the characteristics and outcome of patients with refractory gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after primary chemotherapy (CTx). METHODS: The outcome of low- and high-risk patients with refractory GTN (n = 14, 37%) was compared to those with non-refractory GTN (n = 24, 63%). Methotrexate treatment was used for patients with low-risk disease and EMA/CO for patients with high-risk disease. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 53 months (range 1-173 months). All non-refractory patients and 11 refractory patients (79%) survived (p = 0.015). Factors related to resistance to primary CTx was age (p = 0.012), duration between causal pregnancy and initial treatment (p = 0.003), surgery (p = 0.014), hCG level before CTx (p = 0.09) and half-life of hCG (p = 0.061). Six out of 10 low-risk refractory patients treated with EMA/CO regimen in the second-line setting had been followed by no evidence of disease. Nine of 38 (24%) patients underwent surgery (TAH +/- BSO) for GTN. All of the patients treated with surgery were in the non-refractory group, but none of refractory patients underwent surgery (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery and EMA/CO regimen are one of the main factors that play a role in the management of refractory low-risk GTN.
