We report the first case of Weissella confusa bacteremia in an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient. After engraftment and discharge, the patient returned with fever and graft failure and was started on an empiric regimen of aztreonam and vancomycin. A blood culture grew an alpha-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus forming pairs and chains, originally thought to be a viridans Streptococcus and a skin contaminant. The isolation of the organism from multiple blood cultures, and the presence of vancomycin resistance prompted identification and additional susceptibility testing. The RapID() Str panel, which has W. confusa in its database, provided multiple incorrect identifications. The MicroScan WalkAway 96 SI, using PC-20 or -29 panels, also did not identify this bacterium, because it is not in their database. The organism was identified as W. confusa by 16S rDNA sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility determination by Etest revealed vancomycin resistance and daptomycin susceptibility. Therapy was changed to daptomycin, and the infection resolved. Additionally, W. confusa sepsis, with multiple positive blood cultures, developed in a patient in the burn unit at our medical center. The patient's blood cultures remained positive until vancomycin was discontinued and daptomycin therapy initiated. Infections with vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive cocci are emerging among immuno compromised hosts. Under appropriate circumstances, clinicians need to request that the laboratory perform susceptibility testing and accurate identification, by nucleic acid sequencing if necessary. Sequencing of 16S rDNA is an important tool in the accurate identification of unusual pathogens.
