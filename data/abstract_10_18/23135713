Maraviroc (MVC) is a CCR5 antagonist that inhibits HIV-1 entry by binding to the coreceptor and inducing structural alterations in the extracellular loops. In this study, we isolated MVC-resistant variants from an HIV-1 primary isolate that arose after 21 weeks of tissue culture passage in the presence of inhibitor. gp120 sequences from passage control and MVC-resistant cultures were cloned into NL4-3 via yeast-based recombination followed by sequencing and drug susceptibility testing. Using 140 clones, three mutations were linked to MVC resistance, but none appeared in the V3 loop as was the case with previous HIV-1 strains resistant to CCR5 antagonists. Rather, resistance was dependent upon a single mutation in the C4 region of gp120. Chimeric clones bearing this N425K mutation replicated at high MVC concentrations and displayed significant shifts in 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s), characteristic of resistance to all other antiretroviral drugs but not typical of MVC resistance. Previous reports on MVC resistance describe an ability to use a drug-bound form of the receptor, leading to reduction in maximal drug inhibition. In contrast, our structural models on K425 gp120 suggest that this resistant mutation impacts CD4 interactions and highlights a novel pathway for MVC resistance.
