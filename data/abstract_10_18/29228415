OBJECTIVES: To control carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we implemented a hospital-wide policy concerning the selective use of carbapenems based on the monitoring of P. aeruginosa isolates for susceptibility to five carbapenems using a customized dry plate method. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the outcome of our measures to control carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa. METHODS: To select effective carbapenems, 100 clinical isolates were collected, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 5 carbapenems (IPM/CS, MEPM, DRPM, BIPM and PAPM/BP) was monitored using a customized dry plate method from 2006 to 2013. Carbapenems, which were associated with a high rate of drug resistance in P. aeruginosa, were restricted from use during our intervention study. The antimicrobial use density per 100 bed-days (AUD(100)) of carbapenems and the detection rates of carbapenem (IPM/CS and MEPM)-resistant P. aeruginosa were determined during the period of the intervention. RESULTS: The isolates consistently showed higher rates of drug-resistant P. aeruginosa in IPM/CS and PAPM/BP. Thus, DRPM, MEPM and BIPM were adopted for hospital-wide use. The detection rates of all IPM/Cs and MEPM-resistant P. aeruginosa significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the consumption of carbapenems showed an increasing trend. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of the hospital-wide implementation of the selective use of carbapenems based on periodic monitoring of the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolates was retrospectively studied. Implementation of this measure might have contributed in part to the control of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa in our hospital.
