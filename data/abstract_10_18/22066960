This study aims to determine the resistance rates and determinants of fusidic acid among Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from Chinese pediatric patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 186 clinical S. aureus isolates were collected from the pediatric patients with SSTIs, abscess (44.6%) was the most common SSTI in children 0-16 years old. Four clinical isolates (4/186, 2.2%) were resistant to fusidic acid. Two of these isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) that carry the fusC gene. The other two isolates were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) that carry the fusB gene. In the two fusB-positive clinical isolates, the fusB gene was located in a transposon-like element that has 99% identity with a pUB101 fragment from S. aureus. The four fusidic acid-resistant clinical isolates were ST1-MRSA-SCCmecV-t127, ST93-MRSA-SCCmecIII-t202, ST680-MSSA-t5415, and ST680-MSSA-t377. The fusidic acid resistance rate of S. aureus isolated from Chinese pediatric patients with SSTIs was low, and the genes fusB and fusC were the main resistance determinants. The transposon-like element that contains the fusB gene might participate in the transmission of fusidic acid resistance genes. This is the first report regarding the emergence of fusidic acid-resistant clinical S. aureus isolates in mainland China.
