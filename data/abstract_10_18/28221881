Antibiotics have always appeared miraculous, saving innumerable lives. However, the unwise use of antimicrobial drugs has led to the appearance of resistant bacteria. The purpose of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli (n =160) isolated from food of animal origin. The focus was on E. coli -producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. E. coli was chosen because it is a part of the normal microbiota in mammals and can enter the food chain during slaughtering and food manipulation. Subsequently, its resistance genes can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria and human microbiota. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of selected antimicrobial resistances were carried out together with a molecular analysis of virulence genes. E. coli isolates from food of animal origin were compared with clinical E. coli strains isolated from the human intestinal tract. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli isolates were found in 9.4% of food isolates and in 1.8% of intestinal isolates. Phylogenetically, the majority of food (86.3%) and intestinal E. coli (58.1%) isolates were found to belong to the commensal phylogenetic groups A and B1. The distribution of 4 of 14 analyzed virulence factors was similar in the food and intestinal isolates. Strains isolated from food in Slovenia harbored resistance genes and virulence factors, which can constitute a problem for food safety if not handled properly.
