BACKGROUND: Kissing-balloon technique (KBT) is commonly performed during percutaneous coronary intervention of distal unprotected left main coronary artery (ULM) aiming at obtaining optimal opening of the side branch (left circumflex artery; LCX) ostium. Nonetheless, detailed evaluation of vascular response to stents in LCX ostium is lacking. We therefore evaluated the vascular response to different drug-eluting stents (DES) in ostial LCX after ULM by means of optical coherence tomography (OCT). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 38 consecutive patients with ULM disease, who were treated with single-stent procedure using DES, crossover the ULM-left anterior descending artery (LAD) followed by KBT. Twelve patients were treated with sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) and 26 patients were treated with everolimus-eluting stents (EES). OCT was conducted at post-PCI and 9-month follow-up. We evaluated the DES-vessel interactions and number of stent struts at the side branch (LCX) ostium (SO) at post-PCI, and compared the narrowing of ostial area at LCX between SES and EES. RESULTS: Post-procedure, the number of stent struts at SO was significantly higher in SES compared to EES (median 14.47% vs 0.19%, p<0.001). The narrowing of LCX ostial area at follow-up was more pronounced in SES compared with EES (29.16% vs 2.46%, respectively, p<0.001). Linear regression analysis showed a high correlation between the number of stent struts in LCX ostium and ostial area narrowing (r=0.771, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: OCT showed differences between EES- and SES-vessel interactions at ULM bifurcation PCI. Number of LCX ostium struts at post-PCI impacted the narrowing of ostial area at 9-month follow-up.
