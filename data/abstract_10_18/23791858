In recent years, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections have been responsible for outbreaks in medical facilities. A 35-year-old Japanese woman developed a skin and soft tissue infection due to carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. The isolate was resistant to antibiotics other than ampicillin-sulbactam and colistin, suggesting drug resistance due to carbapenemase production by OXA-23. We selected a combination therapy consisting of intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam and meropenem. No changes were observed in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, or serum creatinine during therapy, and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii was not detected in wound exudates 3 days after therapy initiation. In our patient's case, combination therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam and meropenem was successful. Thus, combination therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam and meropenem is effective against skin and soft tissue infection due to carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Combination therapy with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam and meropenem may be an option for skin and soft tissue infections due to carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
