OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of immersion in sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) on cyclic fatigue resistance of three different rotary nickel-titanium (NiTi) retreatment files. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 90 new ProTaper, D-RaCe, and Mtwo retreatment files were tested. Thirty files of the same brand were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 15). Group 1 was no immersion (control group) and 16 mm of group 2 instruments were immersed in 5 % NaOCl at 37 degrees C for 5 min. All instruments were then tested for cyclic fatigue. Resistance to cyclic fatigue was determined by counting the numbers of cycles to failure in a 60 degrees curve with a 5-mm radius, recording the time in seconds to fracture. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Resistance to cyclic fatigue decreased significantly for D-RaCe retreatment files after immersion in NaOCl. ProTaper and Mtwo retreatment files were not affected from immersion to NaOCl. D-RaCe retreatment instruments showed better cyclic fatigue resistance than ProTaper and Mtwo retreatment instruments, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between ProTaper and Mtwo retreatment instrument groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: D-RaCe retreatment instruments had the highest cyclic fatigue resistance among retreatment files tested in this study, but immersion to NaOCl decreased the cyclic fatigue resistance of D-RaCe retreatment instrument. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: It should be considered that cyclic fatigue resistance of D-RaCe can decrease in contact with NaOCl during the removal of canal filling material.
