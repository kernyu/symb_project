With the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy already guaranteed for all practical purposes, the main objective in the management of HIV-positive patients has moved to reduce and prevent potential long-term toxicities. Nucleos(t)ide-sparing regimens could enable the best to address this issue, with a wide range of current options that may allow adaptation to distinct patient populations. Monotherapy with boosted darunavir and lopinavir has been safely prescribed as maintenance therapy to stable patients on stable antiretroviral therapy without nadir CD4 count < 200/mm(3), low-level baseline viremia, prolonged viral suppression, and without prior virologic failure. In the presence of all these requirements, dual therapy with lamivudine plus boosted lopinavir or atazanavir has been shown to be equivalent to standard triple therapy. Other nucleoside-sparing dual therapies, especially using raltegravir combined with boosted darunavir or lopinavir and etravirine or rilpivirine in combination with boosted darunavir, have performed well as simplification strategies or rescue interventions in a wide spectrum of patients as long as drug resistance was absent. With current economical constrains, nuke-sparing regimens have attained a degree of maturity that makes it possible to anticipate that they will play an important role in the optimization of antiretroviral therapy in the near future.
