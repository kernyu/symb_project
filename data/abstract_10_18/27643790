BACKGROUND: Cupriavidus gilardii is an aerobic, Gram-negative, glucose-nonfermenting rod that was first identified in 1999. Because of the difficulty in accurate species identification of C. gilardii, there are few case reports of infection caused by this organism. In previous reports, C. gilardii has been characterized as an organism with low pathogenicity that causes opportunistic infections. CASE PRESENTATION: We encountered a case of pacemaker-associated bloodstream infection caused by C. gilardii in a 90-year old woman without obvious immunodeficiency. We identified the isolates as C. gilardii by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The patient was treated with removal of the lead and administration of antimicrobial agents. Because of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance during antibiotic treatment, the antimicrobial agent was changed during the course of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an infection caused by this organism in a patient without obvious immunodeficiency. Although the true pathogenicity of C. gilardii is unclear, the possibility that it exerts pathogenicity not only in persons with immunodeficiency but also in immunocompetent persons is suggested.
