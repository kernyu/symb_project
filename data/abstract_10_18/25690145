INTRODUCTION: Based on tigecycline linear pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics, dose increases have been advocated to maximise activity especially when severe infections with high bacterial load and/or multidrug resistance are suspected. This practice-based observational study explored factors associated with tigecycline administration (100 mg/12h, 200 mg loading dose) in severely ill patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) admitted to four Surgical Critical Care Units (SCCUs). METHODS: Medical records of all consecutive adult patients with cIAI and controlled infection source requiring surgery and admission for >/= 48 h to SCCU were reviewed and divided into patients treated with a regimen including tigecycline (tigecycline group) and those that not (control group). A logistic regression model was performed using "tigecycline administration" (dependent variable) and variables showing differences (p </= 0.1) in bivariate analyses (independent variables). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty one patients were included. In the tigecycline group, higher percentage of patients (vs. controls) presented colon as surgical site (66.7% vs. 41.8%, p = 0.006), nosocomial infection (55.6% vs. 26.9%, p = 0.001), mechanical ventilation (48.1% vs. 28.4%, p = 0.025), chronic renal replacement therapy (40.7% vs. 19.4%, p =0.008), septic shock (72.2% vs. 46.3%, p = 0.004), and higher values of SAPS II (48.0 +/- 15.0 vs. 39.6 +/- 15.5, p = 0.003), SOFA at admission (7.0 +/- 3.3 vs. 5.5 +/- 3.7, p = 0.020), lactate-24h (2.5 +/- 2.8 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.9, p = 0.029) and CRP-72 h (207.4 +/- 87.9 vs. 163.7 +/- 76.8, p = 0.021). In the multivariate analysis (R2 = 0.187, p < 0.001) nosocomial infection (OR = 7.721; 95%CI = 2.193, 27.179; p = 0.001), colon as infection site (OR = 4.338; 95%CI = 1.432, 13.145; p = 0.009) and CRP-72 h (OR = 1.009 per-unit; 95%CI = 1.002, 1.016; p = 0.012) were associated with tigecycline administration. CONCLUSIONS: In severely ill patients with cIAI, high-dose tigecycline administration was associated with nosocomial origin of cIAI and colon as source infection site.
