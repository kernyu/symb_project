ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The traditional use of 40 plant species used for treatment of wounds and associated infections by the Huilliche people of Chile was evaluated against bacterial and fungal human pathogens, especially including wound pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extracts were tested against the fungi Penicillium expansum, Candida albicans and the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (four different strains), Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli (four different strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (four different strains with one being resistance to streptomycin). RESULTS: Thirteen of the plant species have interesting antimicrobial activities, with that of Acaena argentea, Aristotelia chilensis, Blechnum chilense, Francoa appendiculta, Gevuina avellana and Laureliopsis philippiana being the most noteworthy. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in the manuscript support the traditional use by the Huilliche people, and allow enhanced economical benefit and use by the locals. The results obtained on Acaena argentea, Aristotelia chilensis, Blechnum chilense, Francoa appendiculta, Gevuina avellana and Laureliopsis philippiana are of specific scientific interest, and further studies is needed in order to establish the active constituents of the species.
