OBJECTIVE: To investigate the appropriate therapy for treating recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). METHODS: Individual consolidated and maintenance therapy were chosen according to fungal culture of vaginal secretion and antifungal drug sensitivity per month as one therapy duration. Drugs were used orally and vaginally together to consolidate the therapy. Oral drugs were fluconazole (0.15 qw after 0.15 q3d for 2 times) or ketoconazole (0.2, bid for 3 days ) or itraconazole (0.2 bid for 3 days ). After Nystain (400 000 unit qn for 7 days ) or clotrimazole(0.1 qn for 7 days) or amphotericin B (0.01 qn for 6 days ) being vaginally used, Living preparation of lactobacillus (0.25 qn for 5 days) was vaginally used. The therapy was continued for 2 to 5 therapy durations after the symptoms disappeared with negative fungal culture. RESULTS: Among 80 cases of RVVC, C. albicans was mostly detected (74%), C. glabrata was 20%. The susceptivity to candidas of oral agents revealed that the sensitive rare of ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole were (91.3%), (81.3%) and (62.5%), respectively. As for vaginal agents, nystain and amphotericin B were 100% sensitive, clotrimazole was 92.5%sensitive, miconazole was 55.0% sensitive. The remote cure of 3 and 6 therapy durations after discontinuing for 12 months was 78.9% and 90.4% CONCLUSION: The predominant pathogen in RVVC is C. albicans. The effective measures to cure RVVC are to choose sensitive drugs for individual consolidated, maintenance therapy and restore vaginal acidic environment.
