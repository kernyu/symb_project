OBJECTIVE: The inappropriate use of antibiotics remains the primary factor in antimicrobial drug resistance. In this study, we evaluate the use of meropenem in surgical/medical wards of Imam Khomeini Tertiary Referral Hospital, Sari, Iran. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was used to assess rational use of meropenem. The study was conducted by reviewing medical records of 100 admitted patients who received meropenem during March 2013 to January 2014. FINDINGS: Meropenem was prescribed most frequently in Intensive Care Unit (22%), and pneumonia was the most common diagnosis (35%). The third-generation cephalosporins were the most frequently prescribed antimicrobials after meropenem (53%). In 21% of the patients, imipenem was changed to meropenem. Most of the inappropriate uses were seen in terms of frequency of meropenem use (34%), followed by duration of meropenem therapy (28%). CONCLUSION: Comparing our study results has shown higher inappropriate use. It is necessary to take action to improve prescribing habit in order to reduce the unnecessary usage of antibiotic thus enhance rational antibiotic use.
