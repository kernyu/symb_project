Yeasts from water sources have been associated with diseases ranging from superficial mucosal infections to life threatening diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the water quality as well as diversity and antifungal susceptibility of yeasts from two rivers. Yeast levels and physico-chemical parameter data were analyzed by principal component analysis to determine correlations between physico-chemical data and yeast levels. Yeast morphotypes were identified by biochemical tests and 26S rRNA gene sequencing. Disk diffusion antifungal susceptibility tests were conducted. Physico-chemical parameters of the water were within target water quality range (TWQR) for livestock farming. For irrigational use, total dissolved solids and nitrates were not within the TWQR. Yeast levels ranged between 27 +/- 10 and 2,573 +/- 306 cfu/L. Only non-pigmented, ascomycetous yeasts were isolated. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata were most frequently isolated. Several other opportunistic pathogens were also isolated. A large number of isolates were resistant to azoles, especially fluconazole, but also to other antifungal classes. Candida species were resistant to almost all the antifungal classes. These water sources are used for recreation and religious as well as for watering livestock and irrigation. Of particular concern is the direct contact of individuals with opportunistic yeast, especially the immune-compromised. Resistance of these yeast species to antifungal agents is a further health concern.
