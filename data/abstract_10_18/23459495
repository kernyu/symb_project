An in vitro single-compartment dilutional pharmacokinetic model was used to study the pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline against Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]). Mean serum free concentrations of ceftaroline (the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil) dosed in humans at 600 mg every 12 h (q12h) were simulated, and activities against 12 S. aureus strains (3 MSSA strains and 9 MRSA strains, 3 of which had a vancomycin-intermediate phenotype) were determined. Ceftaroline produced 2.5- to 4.0-log10-unit reductions in viable counts by 24 h with all strains and a 0.5- to 4.0-log-unit drop in counts at 96 h. The antibacterial effect could not be related to the strain MIC across the ceftaroline MIC range from 0.12 to 2.0 mug/ml. In dose-ranging studies, the cumulative percentage of a 24-h period that the free drug concentration exceeded the MIC under steady-state pharmacokinetic conditions (fT(MIC)) of 24.5% +/- 8.9% was associated with a 24-h bacteriostatic effect, one of 27.8% +/- 9.5% was associated with a -1-log-unit drop, and one of 32.1% +/- 8.1% was associated with a -2-log-unit drop. The MSSA and MRSA strains had similar fT(MIC) values. fT(MIC) values increased with increasing duration of exposure up to 96 h. Changes in ceftaroline population analysis profiles were related to fT(MIC). fT(MIC)s of <50% were associated with growth on 4x MIC recovery plates at 96 h of drug exposure. These data support the use of ceftaroline fosamil at doses of 600 mg q12h to treat S. aureus strains with MICs of </= 2 mug/ml. An fT(MIC) of 25 to 30% would make a suitable pharmacodynamic index target, but fTMIC values of >/= 50% are needed to suppress the emergence of resistance and require clinical evaluation.
