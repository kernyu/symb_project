We herein report three cases of Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) in which the patients were resistant to steroid (PSL) and cyclosporine (CyA) therapy. All three patients had a high risk of renal failure because of persistently high levels of proteinuria. We performed low-density lipoprotein apheresis (LDL-A) and achieved complete remission in two cases. The third patients developed NS relapse and a deteriorating renal function; however, withdrawal from dialysis therapy was achieved. There are no proven therapies for treating patients with PSL- and CyA-resistant IMN with acute deteriorating renal function or difficulties in maintaining fluid balance. We evaluated the treatment course and physiological mechanisms and reviewed similar cases in the pertinent literature.
