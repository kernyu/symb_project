The aim of this study, conducted in collaboration with the Regional Mycobacteriology Centre at "Careggi" Hospital in Florence, was to describe the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) in Tuscany in the years 2007 to 2009. Epidemiological data and mycobacteriology results related to all subjects with confirmed TB in the three years considered were evaluated.Two hundred eighty-five patients were evaluated for the year 2007, 289 for 2008 and 240 for 2009 (data for three provinces are missing for 2009). A large percentage of patients were foreign-born (51.9% in 2007, 56.4% in 2008 and 66.3% in 2009) with the most frequent geographical areas of origin being Africa, Eastern Europe and Asian countries. Overall, the largest number of cases was reported in the cities of Florence and Prato. Among Italian-born patients, the disease was most frequent among patients above 75 years of age while the most frequently affected age group among foreign-born patients was 25-34 years.
