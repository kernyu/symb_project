Following a bloodstream infection in June 2011 with Ralstonia mannitolilytica in a premature infant treated with a humidifying respiratory therapy device, an investigation was initiated at the Hadassah Medical Centres in Jerusalem. The device delivers a warmed and humidified mixture of air and oxygen to patients by nasal cannula. The investigation revealed colonisation with R. mannitolilytica of two of 15 patients and contamination of components of five of six devices deployed in the premature units of the Hadassah hospitals. Ten isolates from the investigation were highly related and indistinguishable from isolates described in an outbreak in 2005 in the United States (US). Measures successful in containing the US outbreak were not included in user instructions provided to our hospitals by the distributor of the device.
