Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are rapidly increasing as multidrug resistant strains worldwide. In nosocomial settings because of heavy exposure of different antimicrobials, resistance in these pathogens turned into a grave issue in both developed and developing countries. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro antibiotic synergism of combinations of beta-lactam-beta-lactam and beta-lactam-aminoglycoside against clinical isolates of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Synergy was determined by checkerboard double dilution method. The combination of amoxicillin and cefadroxil was found to be synergistic against 47 S. aureus isolates, in the FICI range of 0.14-0.50 (81.03%) followed by the combination of streptomycin and cefadroxil synergistic against 44 S. aureus isolates in the FICI range of 0.03-0.50 (75.86%). The combination of streptomycin and cefadroxil was observed to be synergistic against 39 P. aeruginosa isolates in the FICI range of 0.16-0.50 (81.28%). Further actions are needed to characterize the possible interaction mechanism between these antibiotics. Moreover, the combination of streptomycin and cefadroxil may lead to the development of a new and vital antimicrobial against simultaneous infections of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
