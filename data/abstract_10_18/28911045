Aspergillus fumigatus remains the most common species in all pulmonary syndromes, followed by Aspergillus flavus which is a common cause of allergic rhinosinusitis, postoperative aspergillosis and fungal keratitis. The manifestations of Aspergillus infections include invasive aspergillosis, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and bronchitis. Allergic manifestations of inhaled Aspergillus include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and severe asthma with fungal sensitization. Triazoles are the mainstay of therapy against Aspergillus infections for treatment and prophylaxis. Lately, increased azole resistance in A. fumigatus has become a significant challenge in effective management of aspergillosis. Earlier studies have brought to light the contribution of non-cyp51 mutations along with alterations in cyp51A gene resulting in azole-resistant phenotypes of A. fumigatus. This review highlights the magnitude of azole-resistant aspergillosis and resistance mechanisms implicated in the development of azole-resistant A. fumigatus and address the therapeutic options available.
