We investigated 197 anaerobic isolates recovered from blood cultures in the period 2009-2013. The isolates included were Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC). Identification results by MALDI-TOF MS were compared to those obtained by 16S rRNA sequencing, and the MICs of benzylpenicillin, clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem and metronidazole were determined by Etests. The MALDI-TOF MS correctly identified 94.9% of the anaerobes to the genus level, and 86.8% to the species level, with errors mainly among the non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. and GPAC. About 73.3% of the isolates were non-susceptible to penicillin, mainly due to high resistance rates in the Bacteroides spp. (99.2%) and Prevotella spp. (69.2%). About 18.5% of the isolates were clindamycin resistant. Piperacillin-tazobactam had an excellent activity against all anaerobes except the non-fragilis Bacteroides spp., of which 43.8% were non-susceptible. The clinical significance of such a high resistance rate is unclear. Meropenem and metronidazole were the most active antibiotics, with 96.9% and 97.9% of the isolates being susceptible.
