INTRODUCTION: Staphilococcus aureus is a leading pathogen for humans causing a variety of infections such as skin, urinary tract and lung infections as well as sepsis. This study aims to evaluate the susceptibility of community-acquired strains of Staphylococcus aureus, isolated from various pathological products, compared with major antibiotics used in Nouakchott Region (Mauritania). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 281 strains of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from various pathological products from non-hospitalized patients in the National referral hospital laboratory and in two private laboratories in the city of Nouakchott between January 2014 and August 2015. Antibiotic sensitivity was determined by disk diffusion method using agar containing Mueller-Hinton medium according to CA-SFM's recommendations. RESULTS: The resistance rate to penicillin G was high (96-100%). Community-acquired MRSA rate was between 25 and 26% in suppurations, 34.3% in urine cultures and 28% in sperm cultures. Macrolide -Lincosamyne-streptogramins (MLS) resistance, giving rise to the phenotype MLSb inducible, was found in 6% of urinary strains and 27% of strains isolated from suppurations. The activity of aminoglycosides was variable, amikacin was active against all strains. Cotrimoxazole activity was low (77% had resistance) and no vancomycin resistance was reported. CONCLUSION: The activity of penicillin G against Staphylococcus aureusstrains isolated in Nouakchott region is almost zero and community-acquired MRSA rate is high, accounting for 34%. This could be explained by uncontrolled use of these molecules in our country.
