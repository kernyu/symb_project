When Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were exposed to bisphenol A (BPA) or nonylphenol (NP) within a range of 0.1-100 nM for 30-45 days, increased resistance to oxidative injury was found. Western blot analysis indicated concomitant increased expression of bcl-2 protein and reduced histone methylation levels in cells after BPA or NP exposure. Using a heterologous expression system, both chemicals could stimulate G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), a transmembrane estrogen receptor predominantly expressed in 3T3 cells, at lower concentrations, which gave increased survival. Taken together, these results suggest that BPA or NP exposure might cause alterations in cellular activity against oxidative stress, possibly through GPR30.
