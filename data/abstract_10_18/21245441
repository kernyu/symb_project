BAL30376 is a triple combination comprising a siderophore monobactam, BAL19764; a novel bridged monobactam, BAL29880, which specifically inhibits class C beta-lactamases; and clavulanic acid, which inhibits many class A and some class D beta-lactamases. The MIC(90) was </= 4 mug/ml (expressed as the concentration of BAL19764) for most species of the Enterobacteriaceae family, including strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases and were resistant to all of the other beta-lactams tested. The MIC(90) for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was 2 mug/ml, for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa it was 8 mug/ml, and for MDR Acinetobacter and Burkholderia spp. it was 16 mug/ml. The presence of the class C beta-lactamase inhibitor BAL29880 contributed significantly to the activity of BAL30376 against strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter species, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. The presence of clavulanic acid contributed significantly to the activity against many strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae that produced class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The activity of BAL30376 against strains with metallo-beta-lactamases was largely attributable to the intrinsic stability of the monobactam BAL19764 toward these enzymes. Considering its three components, BAL30376 was unexpectedly refractory toward the development of stable resistance.
