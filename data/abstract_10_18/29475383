This study reported the antimicrobial activity of the bark extract of Davilla nitida on multidrug resistant bacteria isolated from Diabetic Foot Infections. Antibacterial activity of the bark extract was evaluated by agar Disk-Diffusion (DD), Broth Dilution (BD), Checkerboard and Time-kill methods. The extract showed a significant antibacterial activity against all groups of bacteria tested. BD was more sensitive for determining the antibacterial activity of the bark extract than the DD method. The bark extract inhibited the growth of bacteria with high-levels of antibiotic-resistance, such as Pseudomonas spp. (100.0%), Enterobacer spp. (88.89%), Staphylococcus aureus (54.55%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (75.0%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (92.86%). The combination of extract with antibiotics resulted in an additive effect against most of the strains tested. Time-kill kinetics profiles of bark extract showed bactericidal and time-dependent properties. Our results suggest that the bark extract of Davilla nitida is a source of bioactive compounds, which may be useful against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
