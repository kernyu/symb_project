BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is an active immunomodulatory and antiproliferative agent in multiple myeloma. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these activities are not yet fully elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the modulation of the cytokine/growth factor patterns of myeloma cells under LEN treatment. METHODS: Lenalidomide effect on myeloma cell proliferation was investigated in a myeloma cell line collection (n=23) by (3)H-thymidine incorporation. Modulation of the cytokine/growth factor patterns of myeloma cells under LEN treatment was analysed by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Lenalidomide inhibits the proliferation of two-thirds of myeloma cell lines independently of their genetic background. We demonstrated that LEN increased TNF-alpha and IL-8 inflammatory cytokines and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) growth factor in both sensitive and resistant myeloma cells to LEN. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide favours a uniform TNF-alpha and IL-8 inflammatory and IGF-1 secretory profile of myeloma cells, an observation that raises important questions for therapeutic approaches incorporating the agent.
