To investigate the mechanisms involved in imipenem resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in southern China, 61 imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were collected from 4 hospitals between October 2011 and June 2012. All isolates were resistant to imipenem, whereas 21.3% were susceptible or intermediate to meropenem. Variable degrees of resistance to other beta-lactam and non-beta-lactam antimicrobials were observed. PFGE revealed high-level of clonal diversity. Among the 61 isolates, 50 isolates had OprD loss by disrupted oprD mutations, including 43 with frameshift mutations of oprD and 7 with a premature stop codon by single point mutation. Six isolates were oprD-negative by PCR, suggestive of a major disruption of oprD genes. Five isolates had intact oprD but had reduced expression of oprD genes. In addition, only one isolate with disrupted oprD mutation by a premature stop codon was confirmed to be a metallo-beta-lactamase producer (IMP-9). Our results show that the loss of OprD, as well as reduced expression of oprD and MBL production, were the predominant mechanisms of imipenem resistance in P. aeruginosa in southern China.
