The prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter spp. in broiler chickens were determined in Shandong Province, China. In total, 275 Campylobacter isolates were obtained from 767 broiler cecal samples, including 208 Campylobacter jejuni, 53 Campylobacter coli, and 14 unidentified Campylobacter isolates. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of 11 antimicrobial agents were determined using the agar dilution method recommended by CLSI. More than 98% of the tested Campylobacter isolates were resistant to quinolones (nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin) and tetracyclines (tetracycline and doxycycline). The C. jejuni isolates also exhibited a high rate of resistance to phenicol antibiotics and a moderate rate of resistance to macrolides and gentamicin. On the contrary, the C. coli isolates showed a high-level resistance to macrolides and gentamicin and little resistance to phenicol antibiotics. The vast majority of the Campylobacter isolates were classified as multidrug resistant. These findings reveal a broad extent of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter isolates from poultry in China and underline the need for prudent use of antibiotics in poultry production to minimize the spread of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter.
