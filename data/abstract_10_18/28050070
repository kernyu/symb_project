BACKGROUND: Burkholderia cepacia is an aerobic, motile, opportunistic Gram negative bacillus that can survive in certain disinfectants. This is a report of the emerging infection with the bacteria B. cepacia in our hospital. The awareness of this emerging bacterium is important, as it is known to cause nosocomial infection in hospitals, especially in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting. setting. B. cepacia, although known to be multidrug resistant, shows sensitivity to some antibiotics that can be used to treat infection caused by it. METHODS: The cases of infection and antimicrobial susceptibility of nosocomial B. cepacia pattern have been analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 38 cases with B. cepacia infection were isolated. Two of these cases showed the organism in two samples, totalling the sample collection to 40. The most frequent isolation of B. cepacia was from blood 21/40 (52.5%) and pus 9/40 (22.5%). B. cepacia infections were most commonly observed in the Intensive Care Unit (52.6%). Infections were more common in men than women with a mortality rate of 42%. The most sensitive antimicrobial agents were found to be Colistin (93%) and Cotrimoxazole (71%). CONCLUSION: There have been 38 cases of the emerging nosocomial B. cepacia infection in our hospital in the period from September 2012 to February 2014. There was no case reported in the records before September 2012. Infections caused by B. cepacia should be made aware of and taken seriously because of its high transmissibility, intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, high mortality and most importantly its sensitivity to simple antibiotics such as Cotrimoxazole.
