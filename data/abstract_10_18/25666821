Herein we report six novel triazole linked polyphenol-aminobenzene hybrids (3-8) as inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis FabG4 (Rv0242c), a less explored beta-ketoacyl CoA reductase that has immense potential to be the future anti-tuberculosis drug target due to its possible involvement in drug resistance and latent infection. Novel triazole linked polyphenol-aminobenzene hybrids have been synthesized, characterized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against FabG4. All of them inhibit FabG4 at low micromolar concentrations. In silico docking study has been carried out to explain the experimental findings. A comparative study of these new inhibitors with previously reported gallate counterparts leads to structure-activity relations (SAR) of substituent linked to N-1 of triazole ring.
