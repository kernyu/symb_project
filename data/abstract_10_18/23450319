The objective of the present study was to examine and determine whether the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 contains side population (SP) cells, and, if so, to increase the proportion of SP cells using arabinosylcytosine (Ara-C). Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry were employed to detect the percentage of SP cells in THP-1 cells. Then, SP and non-SP (NSP) cell subpopulations were collected and identified. THP-1 cells were incubated with different concentrations of Ara-C for 24 h and the proportion of SP cells was detected. Our results demonstrated that the percentage of SP cells was 1.81 +/- 0.99% in THP-1 cells. A majority of the SP cells remained in the G(0)/G(1) phase, and the expression of CD34(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) and the proliferation ability of the SP cells were higher compared to NSP cells (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of multidrug resistance genes (ABCG2 and ABCB1), apoptosis regulation genes (Bcl-2) and the Bcl-2/Bax value of SP cells were higher than those of NSP cells. SP cells have been shown to be more tumorigenic than NSP cells. Following co-culture with Ara-C, the proportion of SP cells increased significantly and subsequently the Ara-C concentration increased. These fi ndings suggest that the THP-1 cell line contains SP cells and that SP cells possess certain intrinsic stem cell properties and may contain a larger proportion of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). The concentrations of SP cells can be increased with Ara-C by co-culture, and this technique is a useful and important application for the study of LSCs.
