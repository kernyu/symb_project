OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and antibiogram of the isolates from infected patients in surgical units of a tertiary care hospital. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Combined Military Hospital, Quetta, from March to October 2015. METHODOLOGY: Clinical samples from the surgical units received in Department of Microbiology for culture and sensitivity were analyzed by Gram stain, culture and biochemical tests for identification of the isolates; and the antibiotic susceptibility was determined by modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Data was analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19. RESULTS: The commonest isolate was Acinetobacter baumannii (22%) followed by Escherichia coli (20%), Pseudomonas spp. (15%) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (11%). Acinetobacter baumannii showed highest susceptibility to doxycycline (41%), Enterobacteriaceae to meropenem (96%), Pseudomonas spp. to polymyxin-B (100%) and Gram positive bacteria to linezolid (100%). Seventy-two percent of the isolates were found to be multi-drug resistant. CONCLUSION: There was a high infection rate in surgical patients with Acinetobacter baumannii, Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas spp. and MRSA being the commonest isolates. Acinetobacter baumannii showed highest susceptibility to doxycycline, Enetrobacteriaceae to meropenem, Pseudomonas spp. to polymyxin-B and Gram positive bacteria to linezolid.
