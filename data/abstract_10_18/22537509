BACKGROUND: Although small-cell lung cancer is a chemosensitive malignancy, most patients rapidly relapse. Results of second-line treatment are generally poor. We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the activity and toxicity of a combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel as second-line chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were refractory or relapsed small-cell lung cancer, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 and measurable disease. Paclitaxel was administered at 135 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 immediately followed by gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks up to 6 courses. Restaging of disease was scheduled every 3 courses. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled. The median age was 65 years. Nineteen patients were considered refractory (progressive disease during or within 90 days from completion of first-line treatment), whereas 22 patients were chemotherapy sensitive. A total of 135 courses was administered (range, 1-6; median, 3). Nine patients achieved a partial remission (partial response, 22%), and 10 patients had stable disease (24%), with a disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) of 46%: in 12 (55%) of 22 patients who were sensitive and in 7 (37%) of 19 patients with refractory disease, respectively. All partial responses but one were observed in the sensitive group. The median duration of response was 5 months. The most-frequent severe toxicities were neutropenia grade 3-4 and neurologic grade 3 in 24% and 7% of delivered courses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel investigated in our study achieved a high disease control rate, but the schedule we adopted appeared to be quite toxic.
