There is limited clinical information regarding community-onset bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. This study was performed to evaluate risk factors and clinical outcomes of community-onset bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. A total of 435 patients with community-onset K. pneumoniae bacteremia were included and data from patients with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae bacteremia were compared to those with non-ESBL-producing bacteremia. Isolates with ESBLs were microbiologically characterized. Of 435 patients with community-onset K. pneumoniae bacteremia, 33 (7.6%) were infected with ESBL producers, of which 25 were further classified as healthcare-associated infections. The most common underlying diseases were solid tumors (n = 20, 60.6%) and diabetes mellitus (n = 10, 30.3%), and the most common infection was intra-abdominal infection (n = 20, 60.6%). Multivariate analysis showed that corticosteroid use (odds ratio [OR] = 13.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.93-97.6, p = 0.009), percutaneous tubes (OR = 7.30, 95% CI = 2.41-22.12, p < 0.001), and prior receipt of antibiotics (OR = 5.65, 95% CI = 2.43-14.16, p < 0.001) were significant factors associated with ESBL producers. When the 30-day mortality rate was evaluated, no significant difference was found between ESBL group and non-ESBL group (12.1% [4/32] vs. 16.0% [35/192]; p = 0.429). Among 16 isolates, for which the ESBL characterization was performed by PCR, the most common types of ESBLs were SHV (n = 16) and cefotaxime-M-2 (n = 5). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of the ESBL-producing organisms showed extensive clonal diversity. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae is a significant cause of bacteremia, even in patients with community-onset infections, particularly in patients with corticosteroid use, percutaneous tube, prior receipt of antibiotics, or healthcare-associated infections.
