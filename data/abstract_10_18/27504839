INTRODUCTION: Twenty-two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains isolated from various infected locations in domestic cats and dogs between June 2008 and September 2014 were analyzed for their genotype, genetic fingerprint, virulence and antibiotic resistance profile. Eighteen strains belonged to the clonal complex (CC) 22 [ST22(MLST)-A(PFGE)-t032(spa)-IV(SCCmec) and ST22-A-t1214-IV], 2 strains to the livestock associated MRSA ST398-t011-IV and two were individual strains of ST5-t002-II and ST1-t001-IV. They contained virulence factors such as gamma-hemolysins, beta-hemolysin converting phage genes, leukocidins and enterotoxins. Most widespread resistances were observed against beta-lactams, trimethoprim and fluoroquinolones, but single strains also exhibited resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and/or mupirocin. The predominant presence of CC22 MRSA strongly indicates clonal spread of a human associated lineage in Swiss companion animals. It is therefore of public health importance to maintain a low level of MRSA infections in animals to avoid uncontrolled dissemination of MRSA clones in humans and animals.
