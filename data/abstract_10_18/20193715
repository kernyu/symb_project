Solid-phase cytometry (SPC) was used to determine the total number and the number of itraconazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus cells in 60 air samples. Of the 570 A. fumigatus cells that were recovered, 10 (1.8%) were resistant. SPC proved more specific and rapid than culture and allowed high-troughput susceptibility testing.
