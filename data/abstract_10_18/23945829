As a result of high resistance of bacterial pathogens to broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, carbapenems have been increa-singly used recently. The presented study aimed at analyzing the association between carbapenem consumption and resistance of selected Gramnegative pathogens to meropenem. Using linear regression analysis, a statistically significant association was found between carbapenem consumption and resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
