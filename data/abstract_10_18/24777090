The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) L protein is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that contains multiple enzyme activities required for RSV replication. The RSV L inhibitors described in literature are limited by their cytotoxicity or the lack of RSV B subtype coverage. Here, we characterize a new RSV L inhibitor with strong antiviral activity against both RSV A and B subtypes and no detectable cytotoxicity. This compound, AZ-27, was equally active against RSV live viruses and subgenomic replicons and demonstrated advantages over other classes of RSV inhibitors in time-of-addition and cell line dependency studies. Resistance studies identified a dominant mutation in the putative capping enzyme domain of L protein, which conferred strong resistance to the AZ-27 series but not other classes of RSV inhibitors, supporting RSV L protein as the direct target for AZ-27. This novel and broad-spectrum RSV L polymerase inhibitor may pave the way toward an efficacious RSV therapeutic and provide a new tool for interrogation of the L protein function.
