INTRODUCTION: Infections produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens represent a therapeutic challenge because of the few therapeutic options available. Tigecycline is a relatively new antibiotic, with a wide spectrum of activity including some of these resistant bacteria. In adults is prescribed for the treatment of some infections caused by carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae, however it has not been approved in children because of potential adverse effects in the dental enamel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case series study. Medical records were reviewed in all children from 0 to 14 years of age that received tigecycline between January of 2008 and March of 2010. RESULTS: 9 patients received Tigecycline mainly for treatment of peritonitis, bacteremia, pneumonia and sepsis caused by carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae. A dose of 1 mg/kg q 12 hours was administered to all patients. No adverse events were reported and a total of 6 patients had complete resolution of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline could be considered a therapeutic option for treating infections produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens in children. The use in children is still compassionate and in this series of cases Tigecycline was well tolerated and safe.
