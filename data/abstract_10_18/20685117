A series of novel HIV integrase inhibitors active against rategravir resistant strains are reported. Initial SAR studies revealed that activities against wild-type virus were successfully maintained at single digit nanomolar level with a wide range of substitutions. However, inclusion of nitrogen-based cyclic substitutions was crucial for achieving potency against mutant viruses. Several compounds with excellent activities against wild-type virus as well as against the viruses with the mutations Q148H/G140S or N155H/E92Q were reported.
