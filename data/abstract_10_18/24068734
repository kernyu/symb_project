Our modeling work suggests that isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) can be effective in reducing drug-sensitive tuberculosis (TB) and that the risk of IPT driving resistance can be reduced by improving the detection and rapid treatment of individuals with drug-resistant disease and by limiting IPT to those in whom the intervention will have the largest benefit.
