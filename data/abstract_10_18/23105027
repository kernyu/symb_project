Similar cases of severe reproductive failure associated with the presence of Chlamydia suis in two Belgian, one Cypriote and one Israeli pig farrowing to slaughter farms are presented. Vaginal and rectal swabs from 39 sows were examined by culture and DNA microarray. Nineteen of 23 (83 %) C. suis-positive sows were infected with tetracycline-resistant C. suis strains, as determined by MIC tests. Furthermore, boar semen from a German artificial insemination centre, intended for export, was positive for C. suis. Emergence of tetracycline-resistant C. suis strains was confirmed.
