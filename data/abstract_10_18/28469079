Initial promising results with immune sera guided early human mAb approaches against Gram-negative sepsis to an LPS neutralization mechanism, but these efforts failed in human clinical trials. Emergence of multidrug resistance has renewed interest in pathogen-specific mAbs. We utilized a pair of antibodies targeting Klebsiella pneumoniae LPS, one that both neutralizes LPS/TLR4 signaling and mediates opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) (54H7) and one that only promotes OPK (KPE33), to better understand the contribution of each mechanism to mAb protection in an acutely lethal pneumonia model. Passive immunization 24 hours prior to infection with KPE33 protected against lethal infection significantly better than 54H7, while delivery of either mAb 1 hour after infection resulted in similar levels of protection. These data suggest that early neutralization of LPS-induced signaling limits protection afforded by these mAbs. LPS neutralization prevented increases in the numbers of gammadeltaT cells, a major producer of the antimicrobial cytokine IL-17A, the contribution of which was confirmed using il17a-knockout mice. We conclude that targeting LPS for OPK without LPS signaling neutralization has potential to combat Gram-negative infection by engaging host immune defenses, rather than inhibiting beneficial innate immune pathways.
