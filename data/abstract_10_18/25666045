Urinary tract infections (UTIs), predominantly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), belong to the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide. The attachment of UPEC to host cells is mediated by FimH, a mannose-binding adhesin at the tip of bacterial type 1 pili. To date, UTIs are mainly treated with antibiotics, leading to the ubiquitous problem of increasing resistance against most of the currently available antimicrobials. Therefore, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Here, we describe the development of an orally available FimH antagonist. Starting from the carboxylate substituted biphenyl alpha-d-mannoside 9, affinity and the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters (solubility, permeability, renal excretion) were substantially improved by a bioisosteric approach. With 3'-chloro-4'-(alpha-d-mannopyranosyloxy)biphenyl-4-carbonitrile (10j) a FimH antagonist with an optimal in vitro PK/PD profile was identified. Orally applied, 10j was effective in a mouse model of UTI by reducing the bacterial load in the bladder by about 1000-fold.
