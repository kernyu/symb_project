The lack of a continuous culture method for Plasmodium vivax has given the impression that investigations on this important species are severely curtailed. However, the use of new or improved ex vivo methods and tools to study fresh and thawed isolates from vivax malaria patients is currently providing useful data on P. vivax, such as sensitivity to antimalarial drugs, invasion mechanisms and pathobiology. This review discusses a practical framework for conducting ex vivo studies on the asexual erythrocytic stages of P. vivax and considers the synergies between ex vivo defined phenotypes, ex vivo derived 'omic' studies and in vivo clinical studies.
