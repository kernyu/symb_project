The trends and types of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli were analyzed from clinical specimens collected between 2005 and 2012 at a Korean teaching hospital. The proportions of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased markedly to 66%. Metallo-beta-lactamase producers significantly decreased and the majority shifted from the bla(VIM-2) type to the bla(IMP-1) type.
