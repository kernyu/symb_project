Quinolones interact with bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, the subunits of which are encoded by gyrA/gyrB and parC/parE, respectively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between changes in these genes and quinolone susceptibility of Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum (Mcc). Using in vitro selected resistant mutants and field isolates from goats, predicted amino acid changes in gyrA, gyrB and parC were associated with higher minimum inhibitory concentration values for quinolones. Alterations in parC predicted amino acid sequences were most frequently associated with quinolone resistance in Mcc.
