Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important pathogen that has exploded into clinical prominence in a short period. New medications are available for the treatment of MRSA infections, each with its own pitfalls and caveats. However, the resistance profile of the bacteria is becoming more complex. Recent guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America provide an evidence-based framework for the management of MRSA infections. This article provides additional practical advice on approaches to MRSA, including the detection, prevention, and management of a variety of its common presentations.
