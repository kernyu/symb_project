BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation is important in Candida albicans pathogenesis and constitutes a mechanism of antifungal resistance. Thus, we evaluated the effect of proanthocyanidins polymer-rich fractions from Stryphnodendron adstringens (fraction F2 and subfraction F2.4) against C. albicans biofilms. METHODS: Firstly, the antifungal activity of F2 and F2.4 against planktonic cells of Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) was determined using broth microdilution method. Anti-biofilm effect of F2 and F2.4 was evaluated during biofilm formation or on mature biofilm of C. albicans and compared with standard antifungals amphotericin B and fluconazole. Metabolic activity of sessile and dispersion cells from biofilms after antifungal treatments were measured using a tetrazolium reduction assay and the biofilm total biomass was quantified by crystal violet-based assay. Morphological alterations after treatments were observed using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The anti-biofilm effect of F2 and F2.4 were comparable to standard antifungals (amphotericin B and fluconazole). F2 and F2.4 treatments reduced biofilm metabolic activity (in sessile and in dispersion cells) during biofilm formation, and in mature biofilms, unlike fluconazole, which only prevents the biofilm formation. Treatments with F2, F2.4 or fluconazole reduced biofilm biomass during biofilm formation, but not in mature biofilm. Amphotericin B presented higher inhibitory effect on biofilm formation and on mature biofilm of C. albicans. F2 and F2.4 treatments led to the appearance of dumbbell-shaped blastoconidia and of blastoconidia clusters in biofilms. CONCLUSION: Proanthocyanidins polymer-rich fractions from S. adstringens successfully inhibited C. albicans planktonic growth and biofilm development, and they represent a potential new agent for the treatment of biofilm-associated candidiasis.
