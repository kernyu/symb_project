Thirty nine canine S. pseudintermedius strains were examined for antibiotic susceptibility and genetic polymorphisms. All strains were methicillin-sensitive S. pseudintermedius (MSSP). Resistance to penicillin was most prevalent (66.6%), followed by resistance to neomycin (56.4%), erythromycin (53.8%), clindamycin (48.7%), chloramphenicol (48.7%), and tetracycline (46.2%). Pulsed-field electrophoresis (PFGE) showed a high genetic polymorphism in the investigated strains.
