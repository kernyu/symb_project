BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the leading causes of neurological disorders in humans. Mitochondrial perturbations lead to adaptive mechanisms that include HIF-1 stabilization, though the consequences of increased levels of HIF-1 following mitochondrial stress remain poorly understood. RESULTS: Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a hif-1 loss-of-function mutation confers resistance towards the mitochondrial toxin ethidium bromide (EtBr) and suppresses EtBr-induced production of ROS. In mammals, the PD-related gene DJ-1 is known to act as a redox sensor to confer protection against antioxidants and mitochondrial inhibitors. A deletion mutant of the C. elegans homolog djr-1.1 also showed increased resistance to EtBr. Furthermore, our data implicates p38 MAP kinase as an indispensable factor for survival against mitochondrial stress in both hif-1 and djr-1.1 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that EtBr-induced HIF-1 activates pathways that are antagonistic in conferring protection against EtBr toxicity and that blocking HIF-1 activity may promote survival in cells with compromised mitochondrial function.
