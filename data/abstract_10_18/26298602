OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the susceptibility of environmental strains of Legionella spp. to 10 antimicrobials commonly used for legionellosis therapy. A study of environmental strains could be useful to timely predict the onset of antibiotic resistance in the environment before it is evidenced in clinical specimens. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 100 environmental Legionella pneumophila (Lpn) strains belonging to serogroups (sgs) 1, 6, 8, and 10 were tested using the E-test methodology on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar supplemented with alpha-ketoglutarate. The most frequent sgs were selected from those obtained during microbiological surveillance conducted in 2014 in a hospital in Southern Italy. The MICs were read after 2 days of incubation at 35 degrees C in a humidified atmosphere without CO2. RESULTS: All isolates were inhibited by low concentrations of fluoroquinolones and macrolides. Rifampicin was the most active drug against the isolates in vitro. All Lpn isolates were inhibited by the following drugs (in decreasing order of their MICs): doxycycline>tigecycline>cefotaxime. The MICs of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and tigecycline were significantly lower for Lpn non-sg 1 than Lpn sg 1 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility testing of Legionella strains to appropriate antibiotics should be performed often to evaluate the possible emergence of resistance, to improve the outcomes of patients, and to reduce the direct costs associated with hospitalization.
