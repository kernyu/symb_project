BACKGROUND: Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV), the largest known virus, has been studied as a putative pneumonia agent, especially in hospital environments. Despite the repercussions of the discovery of APMV, there has been no study related to the control of APMV and the susceptibility of this virus to disinfectants. OBJECTIVES: This work investigated the virucidal activity against mimivirus of chemical biocides commonly used in clinical practice for the disinfection of hospital equipment and rooms. STUDY DESIGN: APMV was dried on sterilized steel coupons, exposed to different concentrations of alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol) and commercial disinfectants (active chlorine, glutaraldehyde and benzalkonium chloride) and titrated in amoebas using the TCID50 value. The stability of APMV on an inanimate surface was also tested in the presence and absence of organic matter for 30 days. RESULTS: APMV showed a high level of resistance to chemical biocides, especially alcohols. Only active chlorine and glutaraldehyde were able to decrease the APMV titers to undetectable levels. Dried APMV showed long-lasting stability on an inanimate surface (30 days), even in the absence of organic matter. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented herein may help health and laboratory workers plan the best strategy to control this putative pneumonia agent from surfaces and devices.
