Preclinical data suggest increased antiviral activity and less viral resistance when neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes are used in combination to harness the complementary effects of their different mechanisms of action. Healthy volunteers were randomized to 5-day oral treatment with oseltamivir 75 mg or rimantadine 100 mg twice daily as monotherapy or to combination treatment. Each participant received all 3 regimens in 1 of 6 treatment sequences, with a minimum of 7 days' washout between periods. Final follow-up was 10 to 14 days after the final dose. Drug exposure, elimination, safety, and tolerability were assessed. There were no clinically relevant differences in 12-hour areas under the concentration-time curves of drug in plasma or peak plasma drug concentrations with combination versus monotherapy. Elimination half-life was unaffected by coadministration. There were no safety/tolerability concerns. One case of vomiting and 1 of paresthesia were considered remotely related to combination treatment, and 1 episode of toothache and 1 of acne were considered unrelated. There were no serious adverse events and no deaths. Combination therapy with oseltamivir and rimantadine at recommended dosages in adults had no discernible effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug and raised no tolerability issues.
