Novel series of 3-O-arylalkylbenzamide and 3-O-arylalkyl-2,6-difluorobenzamide derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their on-target activity and antibacterial activity. The results indicated that the 3-O-arylalkyl-2,6-difluorobenzamide derivatives possessed much better on-target activity and antibacterial activity than the 3-O-arylalkylbenzamide derivatives. Among them, 3-O-chlorobenzyl derivative 36 was the most effective in antibacterial activity (0.5, 4, and 8 mug/mL) against Bacillus subtilis ATCC9372, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, and penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus PR, while 3-O-methylbenzyl derivative 41 only exhibited the most potent activity (2 mug/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923.
