We report a case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) surgical site infection successfully treated with linezolid. A 66-year-old man had undergone total gastrectomy for gastric cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Three days after the operation, he was diagnosed with deep incisional surgical site infection due to MRSA, and wound care was started. After discharge, he received adjuvant chemotherapy and wound care, but the wound had not healed in 10 months. We started treatment with oral linezolid and nutritional support, and the wound was fully healed 12 months after the operation. Antibiotic treatment with oral linezolid may be effective for refractory deep incisional surgical site infection due to MRSA in outpatients.
