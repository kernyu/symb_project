Intestinal infections are a global challenge, connected to malnutrition and inadequate hygiene in developing countries, and to expanding antibiotic resistance in developed countries. In general, a healthy host is capable of fighting off gut pathogens or at least to recover from infections quickly. The underlying protective mechanism, termed colonization resistance, is provided by indigenous commensal communities (microbiota) that are shaped and aided by the host's epithelial and innate immune system. Commensal-pathogen interactions are governed by competition for a suitable niche for replication and stable colonization, nutrient availability, species-specific alterations of the metabolic environment, changes in oxygen tension and release of chemicals and proteinaceous toxins (bacteriocins). This protective intestinal milieu is further reinforced by antimicrobial factors and chemicals secreted by the epithelial barrier, by dendritic cell sensing and by homeostasis between T-cell subsets (Treg/Th17) in the lamina propria. The 3 players (host-microbiota-pathogen) communicate via direct interactions or secreted factors. Our recent manuscript illustrates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an integral part of colonization resistance and should be considered an interkingdom antivirulence strategy.
