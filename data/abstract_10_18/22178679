Cinnamaldehyde, its derivatives and curcumin are reported to have strong antifungal activity. In this work we report and compare anticandidal activity of curcumin (CUR) and alpha-methyl cinnamaldehyde (MCD) against 38 strains of Candida (3; standard, fluconazole sensitive, 24; clinical, fluconazole sensitive, 11; clinical, fluconazole resistant). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC(9)(0)) of CUR ranged from 250 to 650 mug/ml for sensitive strains and from 250 to 500 mug/ml for resistant strains. MIC(9)(0) of MCD varied between 100 and 250 mug/ml and 100-200 mug/ml for sensitive and resistant strains, respectively. Higher activity of MCD as compared to CUR was further reinforced by spot assays and growth curve studies. At their respective MIC(9)(0) values, in the presence of glucose, average inhibition of H+-efflux caused by CUR and MCD against standard, clinical and resistant isolates was 24%, 31%, 32% and 54%, 52%, 54%, respectively. Inhibition of H+-extrusion leads to intracellular acidification and cell death, average pHi for control, CUR and MCD exposed cells was 6.68, 6.39 and 6.20, respectively. Scanning electron micrographs of treated cells show more extensive damage in case of MCD. Haemolytic activity of CUR and MCD at their highest MIC was 11.45% and 13.00%, respectively as against 20% shown by fluconazole at typical MIC of 30 mug/ml. In conclusion, this study shows significant anticandidal activity of CUR and MCD against both azole-resistant and sensitive clinical isolates, MCD is found to be more effective.
