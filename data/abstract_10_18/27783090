Resistant strains of cytomegalovirus can be difficult to treat in cases of congenital cytomegalovirus retinitis. The authors describe a case of recurrent bilateral congenital cytomegalovirus retinitis in an immunocompetent newborn with ganciclovir resistance successfully treated uniquely with dual therapy of intravenous ganciclovir and foscarnet and dual intravitreal injections with ganciclovir and foscarnet.
