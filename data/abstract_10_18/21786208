The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was compared with that of seven antimicrobial agents against invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients (>15 years old). Characterization of erythromycin-resistant strains and serotype distribution of all pneumococci were also evaluated. Seventy invasive S. pneumoniae strains were isolated from December 2007 to January 2009. Serotyping was carried out by Quellung reaction. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by broth microdilution (CLSI guidelines). The comparator agents were penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, telithromycin, tetracycline and moxifloxacin. Phenotypic characterization of macrolide resistance was performed by the double disk method. Macrolide resistance genes [erm(B) and mef(A/E)] and the promoter of erm(B) were detected by PCR. Twenty-five different serotypes were detected of which 87% were non-PCV7 types. The percentages of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline were 20%, 8.6% and 16%, respectively. A penicillin MIC >/=0.12 mg/L was observed in 14 of the 70 invasive pneumococci strains. The cefotaxime and ceftobiprole MIC(50)/MIC(90) of these 14 strains were 1/4 and 0.03/1 mg/L, respectively. Ceftobiprole showed higher in vitro activity than penicillin and cefotaxime with all isolates being inhibited by </=1 mg/L. Its high in vitro activity should make ceftobiprole a very promising drug for the treatment of pneumococcal infections.
