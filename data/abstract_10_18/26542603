The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in microbial biofilms has been recently recognized to play a role in promoting antibiotic resistance in biofilm-growing bacteria. ROS are also over-produced when a medical device is implanted and they can promote device susceptibility to infection or aseptic loosening. High levels of ROS seem also to be responsible for the establishment of chronic wounds.In this study, a novel antioxidant polyacrylate was synthesized and investigated in terms of antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity. The polymer possesses in side-chain hydroxytyrosol (HTy), that is a polyphenolic compound extracted from olive oil wastewaters.The obtained 60 nm in size polymer nanoparticles showed good scavenging and antibacterial activity versus a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Microbial adherence assays evidenced that the hydroxytyrosol-containing polymer was able to significantly reduce bacterial adhesion compared to the control. These findings open novel perspective for a successful use of this antioxidant polymer for the prevention or treatment of biofilm-based infections as those related to medical devices or chronic wounds.
