Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is a zoonotic pathogen that exhibits high-level resistance and multi-drug resistance to classic antibiotics and causes serious human casualties and heavy economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. Therefore, alternative therapies or novel antibacterial agents need to be developed to combat this pathogen. A novel endolysin derived from the S. suis temperate phage phi7917, termed Ly7917, was identified, which had broad lytic activity against S. suis type 1, 2, 7 and 9. Ly7917 consisted of an N-terminal cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidase catalytic domain and C-terminal SH3b cell wall binding domain. The endolysin maintained activity at high pH and its catalytic activity could be improved by addition of 10 muM 1.5 mM Ca(2+). In animal studies, 90% of BALB/c mice challenged with typical virulent strain HA9801 of S. suis 2 were protected by Ly7917 treatment. The bacterial load in the blood of HA9801-challenged mice was efficiently reduced almost 50% by Ly7917 while that of penicillin-G-treated mice kept almost unchanged. Our data suggest that Ly7917 may be an alternative therapeutic agent for infections caused by virulent S. suis strains.
