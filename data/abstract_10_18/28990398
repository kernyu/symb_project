We assessed the level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices on antibiotics through a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey among the general public in Bhutan. Of the 692 participants, 52.6% (364) were females with a mean age of 34.2 years. More than half of the respondents showed unsatisfactory knowledge varying significantly from 23.1% to 69.6%. Cotrimoxazole (septran) was the least known while amoxicillin was the most known antibiotics assessed. Two-thirds of the responsents (267) knew that inappropriate use of antibiotics could lead to antimicrobial resistance and 89% (319) were aware of the need to complete the antibiotic courses. In bivariate analysis, satisfactory knowledge was associated with the education level of graduate and higher as compared with no education. This study revealed unsatisfactory knowledge and attitude but satisfactory practices on antibiotics use among participants. Efforts are needed to improve public awareness on antibiotics. Enforcement of regulations on sale of antibiotics over the counter needs a revamp.
