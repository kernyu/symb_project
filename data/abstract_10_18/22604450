OBJECTIVES: Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli are reported increasingly and represent an emerging public health concern. Laboratory detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), plasmid-mediated cephalosporinase (pAmpC) and carbapenemase producers remains a challenge for microbiology laboratories and is important to avoid clinical failure due to inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and to prevent nosocomial outbreaks. We evaluated a novel microarray, the 'Check-MDR CT103 array' test (Check-Points, Wageningen, The Netherlands), that employs highly specific DNA markers to identify the beta-lactamase genes of ESBLs (TEM, SHV and CTX-M, and discriminates between ESBL and non-ESBL TEM and SHV variants), of pAmpC (CMY-2-like, DHA, FOX, ACC-1, ACT/MIR and CMY-1-like/MOX) and of carbapenemases (KPC, OXA-48, VIM, IMP and NDM). METHODS: One-hundred-and-eighty-seven well-characterized Gram-negative bacilli isolates possessing different bla genes were tested. Total DNAs were extracted using a Qiagen DNA mini kit. The 'Check-MDR CT103 array' was used as recommended by the manufacturer. RESULTS: The system correctly identified representatives of the three ESBL gene families tested, including differentiation between non-ESBL and ESBL TEM and SHV variants. All bla(CTX-M) genes were classified into the appropriate family group (i.e. CTX-M-1 group, CTX-M-2 group, CTX-M-9 group and CTX-M-8/25/26 group). In addition, the clinically relevant plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase and carbapenemase genes were also reliably detected. Specificities and sensitivities of 100% were recorded for most bla genes. CONCLUSIONS: The 'Check-MDR CT103 array' is a powerful high-throughput tool for rapid identification of ESBL, pAmpC and carbapenemase producers in culture. Because of its rapid performance, this platform is a valuable tool for epidemiological or infection control studies.
