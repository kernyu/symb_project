Pregnancy is related to change in glucose metabolism and insulin production. The aim of our study was to determine the association of serum IFN-gamma and TGF- beta levels with insulin resistance during normal pregnancy. This cross sectional study was carried out on 97 healthy pregnant (in different trimesters) and 28 healthy non-pregnant women. Serum TGF-beta and IFN- gamma level were measured by ELISA method. Pregnant women had high level TGF-beta and low level IFN-gamma as compared non-pregnant women. Maternal serum TGF-beta concentration significantly increased in third trimester as compared first and second trimester of pregnancy. Maternal serum IFN-gamma concentration significantly decreased in third trimester as compared first and second trimester of pregnancy. Pregnant women exhibited higher score of HOMA IR as compared non-pregnant women. There were association between gestational age with body mass index (r=0.28, P=0.005), TGF-beta (r=0.45, P<0.001) and IFN-gamma (r=-0.50, P<0.001). There was significant association between Insulin resistance and TGF-beta (r=0.17, p=0.05). Our findings suggest that changes in maternal cytokine level in healthy pregnant women were anti-inflammatory. Furthermore, Tumor Growth Factor-beta appears has a role in induction insulin resistance in healthy pregnant women. However, further studies needed to evaluate role of different cytokines on insulin resistance in normal pregnancy.
