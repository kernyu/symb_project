The drug susceptibility pattern of klebsiella species and Escherichia coli to cephalosporins was examined in the year 2004 and 2005. A total of 180 klebsiella and 220 E coli in 2004 and 95 klebsiella and 210. E coli in the year 2005, isolated from various clinical specimens were studied. Resistance rates among the klebsiella species, ranged from 50.00%-86.36% and 42.10%-84.21% in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Resistance rates among E coli ranged from 46.66%-90.8% and 50.0%-86.66% in 2004 and 2005 respectively. In the year 2005 resistance to cefixime and cefpodoxime significantly increased. Resistance marginally increased to cephalexin, cefuroxime and ceftazidime. Resistance to cefotaxime was considerably low (42.10%) in 2005 compared to 62.96% in 2004. The study highlights the importance of exercising caution in the choice of empirical therapy. It also points towards the need for regular monitoring of resistance pattern in the hospital and temporary withholding of the antibiotic with high resistance so as to prevent the spread of multidrug resistant strains in the hospital and the community.
