Due to their direct antiviral activity, Mx proteins play a main role in the response mediated by type I interferon against viral infections. The study on gilthead seabream Mx proteins is especially interesting, since this species is unusually resistant to viral diseases, being asymptomatic carrier of several viruses pathogenic to other fish species. Gilthead seabream has three Mx proteins (Mx1, Mx2 and Mx3) that, separately, display antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses, showing interesting differences in their antiviral specificities. In this work, the possible synergy between the three Mx isoforms has been studied using in vitro systems consisting of CHSE-214 cells stably expressing two or the three gilthead seabream Mx proteins. The antiviral activity of these Mx combinations has been tested against the Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV), the Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia Virus (VHSV), the European Sheatfish Virus (ESV) and the Lymphocystis Disease Virus (LCDV). A synergistic effect of the Mx proteins was only detected against ESV, no synergy was observed against LCDV, and a negative interference was detected against the two RNA viruses tested, IPNV and VHSV, as viral replication was higher in cells expressing certain Mx combinations than in cells expressing these proteins separately. These results suggest a functional interaction between gilthead seabream Mx isoforms, which results in a higher or lower antiviral activity depending on the virus tested, thus supporting the idea of complex virus-host interactions and finely tuned mechanisms controlling the antiviral activity of Mx proteins.
