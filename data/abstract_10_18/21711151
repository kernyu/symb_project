Tuberculous meningitis is the most severe form of tuberculosis and causes substantial morbidity and mortality in adults and children. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (rifampin-isoniazid) strains requires the use of more toxic second-line drugs. We report a case of tuberculous meningitis in a 3-year-old Italian child.
