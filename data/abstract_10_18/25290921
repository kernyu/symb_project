Globally, the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-co-infection has improved dramatically over the last 10 years. Nonetheless, the mortality of co-infected patients remains elevated. In European countries, the proportion of HIV-infected patients amongst all TB cases varies greatly; in Germany it is about 4 - 5%. HIV-infection changes the molecular epidemiology of TB and the drug resistance situation. In endemic areas, HIV-infected patients are often re-infected after completion of treatment for active TB. HIV has a profound influence on the anti-TB-immune response and antiretroviral therapy (ART) cannot completely restore normal immune function. The clinical presentation in advanced HIV-infection is atypical and disseminated disease is common. New "Point-of-Care" test methods are poised to improve the diagnoses of TB in HIV-infection; however, further research is required. The treatment of co-infection is complicated by drug interactions and the immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS). New concepts and treatment regimens for chemoprevention of TB are necessary, especially for HIV-infected persons.
