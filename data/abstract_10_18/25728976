We report three cases of high drug-resistant microorganisms (HDRMO) carriage by patients repatriated from a foreign country. National recommendations suggest systematic screening and contact isolation pending results of admission screening of all patients recently hospitalized abroad. HDRMO carriage (carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae) was not isolated on admission screening swabs, but later between 3 and 8 days after admission. In absence of cross-transmission, two hypotheses seem possible: a false-negative test on admission, or a late onset favored by antibiotic pressure. Prolonged isolation may be discussed even in case of negative screening on admission from high-risk patients.
