The characterization and tracking of pathogenic micro-organisms in the clinical laboratory and public health environment demand schemes that are easy to standardize and use, are automated and high-throughput, and provide portable data. A combined genomarkers approach for Salmonella enterica based on comparative sequence analysis by mass spectrometry has been developed. The scheme targets genes encoding synthesis and assembly of antigens, metabolic pathway enzymes, virulence factors and fluoroquinolone resistance, covering the essential sequences that distinguish between and identify variation within serotypes. This study demonstrated how this single method could replace the combination of methods currently required to determine serotypes, subtypes, antibiotic resistance profiles and the genomic relatedness of Salmonella isolates. The results revealed genomic variation within seven serotypes previously unreported. This variation can be detected by using nucleotide sequence differences in the Salmonella flagellin gene fliC as markers that are not detected by traditional serotyping methods.
