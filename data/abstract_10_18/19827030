Drugs based on amino acid sequence of Heptad Repeats of gp41 of HIV have been explored in search of anti-HIV drugs acting by inhibition of the gp41 6-helix formation and subsequent cellular infection. These are classified under a distinct discipline called HIV fusion inhibitors. Resistance to HIV fusion inhibitors and their solutions have also been discussed in this review.
