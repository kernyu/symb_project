The objective of this study was to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of Arcobacter spp. isolated from various sources. Seventy Arcobacter spp. isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 13 antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by using the agar disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood. The antibiotics tested included enrofloxacin, erythromycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, rifampin, tetracycline, ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, danofloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulonic acid, cefuroxime-sodium, neomycine. Although all the arcobacters tested were susceptible to gentamycin, resistance to three or more antibacterial agents (especially, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, cefuroxime-sodium and rifampin) was observed. A. butzleri isolates were found to be resistant to amoxycillin+clavulonic acid, nalidixic acid and ampicillin, at the rate of 20%, 44.28% and 78.57% respectively. In conclusion, gentamycin, streptomycin and tetracycline may be suitable antibiotics for the treatment or control of disease caused by Arcobacter spp. in veterinary and human medicine.
