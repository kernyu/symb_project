Two oral direct-acting antivirals (DAA) are now available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection and several generations of DAA are in development. Expectations are that, at some time in the near future, hepatitis C will be 'curable' with an all-oral DAA regimen. This article reviews the current problems associated with interferon-based hepatitis C treatments that are combined with DAAs, including adverse events and complications of therapy, contraindications, drug-drug interactions and cost. The article further discusses difficulties with new drug development and provides an opinion on the research issues still to be dealt with and the requirements for the successful implementation of such a strategy. These include lack of efficacy in certain populations, unexpected side effects, antiviral resistance, late relapse, lack of cooperation between drug developers and cost.
