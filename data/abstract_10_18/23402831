BACKGROUND: Infections caused by Fusarium are difficult to treat because these fungi show in vitro and in vivo resistance to practically all the antifungal agents available, which explains the high mortality rates. An attempt to overcome fungal resistance is the combination of antifungal agents, especially those with different mechanisms of action. AIMS: Evaluate the in vitro interactions of combinations of voriconazole or itraconazole with other antifungal agents against 32 isolates of Fusarium spp.: Fusarium chlamydosporum, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium proliferatum and Fusarium solani. METHODS: Drug interactions were assessed by a checkerboard microdilution method that also included the determination of the MIC of each drug alone according to CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) document M38-A2, 2008. RESULTS: The best combinations were voriconazole+terbinafine which showed synergism against 84% of Fusarium strains. Other synergistic combinations were voriconazole+itraconazole (50%), voriconazole+fluconazole (50%), voriconazole+miconazole (38%), voriconazole+flucytosine (22%) and voriconazole+ketoconazole (25%). The synergisms observed with itraconazole combinations were itraconazole+terbinafine (25%) and itraconazole+flucytosine (9.37%). The antagonisms observed were: voriconazole+fluconazole (3%) and itraconazole+flucytosine (12.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The synergism showed by voriconazole+terbinafine was remarkable. To better elucidate the potential usefulness of our findings, new in vivo and in vitro studies deserve be performed.
