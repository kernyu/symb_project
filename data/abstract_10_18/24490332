The paper reports on the emergence of strain in which Enterobacter cloacae has demonstrated an unusual form of resistance to carbapenems mediated by enzyme IMI-1, class A beta-lactamase. The strain was isolated from a wound swab in the patient who had a surgical wound infection previously treated with meropenem. Limited choice of antibiotics that can treat infections caused by these pathogens indicates the necessity of accurate identification of multiple resistant gram-negative microorganisms and mechanisms of their resistance. Recognition of multiresistant gram-negative microorganisms emphasizes the importance of continuous microbiological monitoring of patients, especially in intensive care units. In the investigated institution there was no secondary spread of this strain. Identifying new mechanisms of resistance will be helpful to clinicians in selection of targeted therapy, while important for efficient prevention of spreading infections caused by multiple resistant microorganisms.
