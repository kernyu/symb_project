Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that affects children worldwide. The number of publications discussing community-associated S. aureus infections, particularly in children, adolescents and young adults, has increased in recent years. This is related to the emergence and worldwide spread of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus and the increase in severe life-threatening community-associated S. aureus infections. The increase in severity has been seen with both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains. This suggests that other virulence factors might be associated with the observed trend. Panton-Valentine leukocidin is a distinctive virulence factor associated with a highly aggressive and often fatal form of community-acquired infections. We propose that empiric treatment should be adapted to the type of infection and the resistance profile present in each country or region. In cases of severe infection, a combination of antibiotics, including at least one molecule active against protein synthesis such as clindamycin or linezolid, will be needed.
