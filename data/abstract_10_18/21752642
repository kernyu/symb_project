Control and prevention of tuberculosis is a major challenge, as one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The resurgence of tuberculosis and the emergence of multidrug-resistance strains of mycobacteria, necessitate the search for new class of antimycobacterial agents. As a part of investigation of new antitubercular agents in this laboratory, we describe the syntheses of various hydrazides of comarins, quinolones and pyrroles and screening against M. tuberculosis (Mtb) H37(Rv) by using rifampin as a standard drug. Among the designed molecules, the most prominent compounds 2a-g, 4a and 9a showed >90% GI at MIC<6.25 mug/mL. Finally, these studies suggests that compounds 2a-g, 4a and 9a may serve as promising lead scaffolds for further generation of new anti-TB agents.
