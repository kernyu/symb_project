Background Calprotectin is an antimicrobial, calcium and zinc-binding heterocomplex protein and has been proposed as a marker to rule out inflammatory conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of calprotectin in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and to investigate the association between calprotectin and insulin resistance. Methods A total of 41 females with polycystic ovary syndrome and 54 age-matched without polycystic ovary syndrome were eligible for the study. Serum concentration of calprotectin was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical characteristics, hormone and metabolic parameters were evaluated in each subject. The predictive value of serum calprotectin was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Correlations between the serum calprotectin concentrations and insulin resistance were examined using Spearman's correlation. Results We found that the serum calprotectin concentrations were significantly higher in polycystic ovary syndrome compared with the non-polycystic ovary syndrome group ( P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve assay yielded a satisfactory result of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.81-0.95; P < 0.001). The optimum cut-off was 2.4 microg/mL with a 85.2% specificity and 75.6% sensitivity for polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis. A significant positive correlation was found between the serum calprotectin and insulin resistance. Conclusions These results suggest that calprotectin might be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, especially those with insulin resistance.
