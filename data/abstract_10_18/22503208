Twenty-eight new 13-n-octylberberine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their activities against drug-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) strain H(37)Rv. Among these compounds, compound 16e was the most effective anti-tubercular agent with a MIC value of 0.125 mug/mL. Importantly, compound 16e exhibited more potent effect against rifampicin (RIF)- and isoniazid (INH)-resistant M. tuberculosis strains than both RIF and INH, suggesting a new mechanism of action. Therefore, it has been selected as a drug candidate for further investigation, or as a chemical probe for identifying protein target and studying tuberculosis biology. We consider 13-n-octylberberine analogs to be a promising novel class of antituberculars against multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains of M. tuberculosis.
