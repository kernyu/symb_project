Diarrhoea continues to be one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among infants and children in developing countries. To investigate the incidence, antimicrobial resistance and genetic relationships of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in children with diarrhoea, a total of 612 stool specimens were collected in Tehran, Iran, and cultured to isolate strains of EPEC. The disc diffusion method was used to determine the susceptibility of the isolates according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The presence of eae, stx and bfp-A genes was determined by PCR. The genetic relationships between EPEC isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Out of the 412 strains of E. coli obtained from 612 diarrhoeal stool specimens, 23 (5.6 %) were identified as EPEC, of which seven (30.4 %) were classified as typical strains of EPEC and 16 (69.6 %) were classified as atypical. Out of the 23 EPEC isolates, 69.5 % were resistant to ampicillin, 39.1 % were resistant to tetracycline and cotrimoxazole, 30.4 % were resistant to cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and aztreonam, and 26.1 % were resistant to imipenem. The isolates were classified into 21 pulsotypes by PFGE profiles. The present study shows that typical and atypical EPEC isolates displayed considerable heterogeneity in PFGE profiles and EPEC infections were only sporadic in Tehran. Overall 69 % of isolates were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics tested.
