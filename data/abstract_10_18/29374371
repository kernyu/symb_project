PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The use of prophylactic antibiotics during the neutropenic period in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been the standard of care at most institutions for the past 20 years. We sought to review the benefits and risks of this practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging data has highlighted the potential costs of antibacterial prophylaxis, from selecting for antibiotic resistance to perturbing the microbiome and contributing to increase risk for Clostridium difficile and perhaps graft-versus-host-disease, conditions which may lead to poorer outcomes. Though in many studies prophylactic antibiotics improved morbidity and mortality outcomes, the potential harms including antibiotic resistance, Clostridium difficile infection, and alterations of the gut microbiome should be considered. Future studies aimed to better risk-stratify patients and limit the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics are warranted.
