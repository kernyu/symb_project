In this study, the effect of different crosslinkers including glutaraldehyde (GTA), genipin (GIP) and procyanidine (PA) on the properties of the electrospun gelatin membranes was compared. The water-resistant ability of the membranes could be significantly improved after being crosslinked with PA at T > 40 degrees C. In contrast with GTA and GIP, the PA-crosslinking process did not apparently affect the fibrous structure, and induced the lowest shrinkage of the membranes. At the concentration of 5% of PA, the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the hydrated membrane were 0.87 MPa and 148%, respectively, which were higher than those of the GIP-crosslinked counterparts. In addition, the PA-crosslinked membranes displayed the highest resistance to pepsin degradation, and fibroblast cells could migrate deeper into the interior of the membranes due to the good preservation of the fibrous structure during the cell culture process.
