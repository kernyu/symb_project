The aim of this study was to investigate the toxin gene profile and antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from raw chicken in the People's Republic of China. In total, 289 S. aureus isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and genes encoding enterotoxins, exfoliative toxins, Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin were revealed by PCR. Overall, 46.0% of the isolates were positive for one or more toxin genes. A high proportion of toxin genes were pvl (26.6%), followed by sej (12.5%), sea (9.0%), seh (8.3%), seb (6.9%), sec (6.9%), sed (4.8%), sei (3.1%), and see (2.4%). None of the isolates harbored seg, tsst-1, or exfoliative toxin genes. In total, 29 toxin gene profiles were obtained, and pvl (10.7%) was the most frequent genotype, followed by sea (5.9%), seb (4.8%), and sej (4.2%). Furthermore, 99.7% of the strains were resistant to at least one of the tested antimicrobial agents, and 87.2% of them displayed multidrug resistance. Resistance was most frequently observed to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin (86.2% for each), followed by tetracycline (69.9%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (45.0%), and ampicillin (42.6%). None of the strains were resistant to vancomycin. This study indicates that S. aureus isolates from raw chicken harbored multiple toxin genes and exhibited multiple antimicrobial resistance, which represents a potential health hazard for consumers.
