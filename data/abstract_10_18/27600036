Two extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were discovered among 6,340 (0.03%) French isolates between 2010 and 2014. One isolate corresponded to the F89 multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolate harboring a penA mosaic; whole-genome sequencing highlighted an additional R251H substitution in the ftsX gene recently involved in cephalosporin resistance. The other, ceftriaxone-resistant isolate (MIC, 0.25 mg/liter) harbored the PBP2 pattern XXXVI plus a P551S substitution and belonged to sequence type ST1579 (multilocus sequence typing [MLST]).
