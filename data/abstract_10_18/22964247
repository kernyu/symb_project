A bla(KPC-9) carbapenemase variant was discovered in isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli from a single patient. It differed from bla(KPC-3) by one amino acid substitution (Val239Ala). The K. pneumoniae isolate was typed as ST258, as was the epidemic Israeli KPC-3 clone. bla(KPC-9) was found on a plasmid indistinguishable from pKpQIL that carries bla(KPC-3) in the epidemic clone. Compared to KPC-3, KPC-9 conferred less resistance to carbapenems and higher resistance to ceftazidime.
