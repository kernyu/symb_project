Currently gemcitabine-based regimens and FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) are widely used standard for first-line treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Refractory patients may receive either FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) or gemcitabine based on the first line regimen. This review is an update from the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium regarding recent developments in the treatment of refractory pancreatic cancer, as these were presented in Abstracts #248 and #373 of the meeting.
