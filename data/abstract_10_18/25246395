Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting proteins encoded by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome have great potential for the treatment of HCV infections. However, the efficacy of DAAs designed to target genotype 1 (G1) HCV against non-G1 viruses has not been characterized fully. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory activities of nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) against the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We examined the ability of six NNIs to inhibit G1b, G2a, and G3a subgenomic replicons in cell culture, as well as in vitro transcription by G1b and G3a recombinant RdRps. Of the six G1 NNIs, only the palm II binder nesbuvir demonstrated activity against G1, G2, and G3 HCV, in both replicon and recombinant enzyme models. The thumb I binder JTK-109 also inhibited G1b and G3a replicons and recombinant enzymes but was 41-fold less active against the G2a replicon. The four other NNIs, which included a palm I binder (setrobuvir), two thumb II binders (lomibuvir and filibuvir), and a palm beta-hairpin binder (tegobuvir), all showed at least 40-fold decreases in potency against G2a and G3a replicons and the G3a enzyme. This antiviral resistance was largely conferred by naturally occurring amino acid residues in the G2a and G3a RdRps that are associated with G1 resistance. Lomibuvir and filibuvir (thumb II binders) inhibited primer-dependent but not de novo activity of the G1b polymerase. Surprisingly, these compounds instead specifically enhanced the de novo activity at concentrations of >/= 100 nM. These findings highlight a potential differential mode of RdRp inhibition for HCV NNIs, depending on their prospective binding pockets, and also demonstrate a surprising enhancement of de novo activity for thumb RdRp binders. These results also provide a better understanding of the antiviral coverage for these polymerase inhibitors, which will likely be used in future combinational interferon-free therapies.
