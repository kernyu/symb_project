Scope and Significance: The topical use of antiseptics for wound care has a role in an antimicrobial stewardship strategy. However, the details of this role need clarification. Further clinical research into the use of topical antiseptics in wound care would lower the risk of furthering antibiotic resistance and contribute to more effective antibiotic use. As part of this research, experimental and surveillance data are needed on the resistance and tolerance patterns associated with topical antiseptic use in wound infections. Objective: The development of antibiotic resistance presents global challenges in terms of patient harm and increased healthcare costs. The treatment of "at risk" and infected wounds contributes to this conundrum. Synergies between antibiotics and antiseptics and their appropriate combined use need exploration. Approach: A review of available evidence on the appropriateness of antiseptics as a fundamental component of antimicrobial stewardship strategies has been undertaken. Innovation: Opening up new ways of thinking and identifying gaps of knowledge will lead to optimizing justification of antimicrobial choices and combinations. This may lead to changes in practice in terms of solutions for the prevention and treatment of wound infection. Conclusion: Antiseptics are an integral part of antimicrobial stewardship strategies for the prevention and treatment of surgical site and chronic open wound infections.
