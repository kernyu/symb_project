BACKGROUND: Due to the high rates of antimicrobial resistance to certain antibiotics, together with the emergence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) with reduced susceptibility and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, gonococcal infection is becoming a public health problem. The objectives of the study were: To keep track of the antimicrobial susceptibility of NG strains obtained from January to August 2011. To study the population dynamics. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility was studied by disk-diffusion and E-test. The genotyping was performed by NG-MAST method. RESULTS: Of a total of 100strains studied, 59% showed intermediate sensitivity to penicillin and 9% were resistant. According to EUCAST, we detected 3gonococci with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone, 10 to cefixime and one with high-level resistance to both antibiotics (MIC 1.5mug/ml). MIC50 and MIC90 to cefixime were 0.016 and 0.125mug/ml, respectively, whereas to ceftriaxone they were <0.016 and 0.064mug/ml, respectively. Almost all (99%) of the strains were resistant to doxycycline, 53% to ciprofloxacin, 3% to azithromycin, and 1% to spectinomycin. The most prevalent ST was ST1407, predominantly associated to resistance or reduced sensitivity to cephalosporins or macrolides. CONCLUSIONS: NG has developed significant rates of resistance to various antibiotics. One strain has been detected with high level resistance to third generation cephalosporins, and several strains with reduced susceptibility. An increase in MIC50 and MIC90 to these antibiotics has also been observed. NG population structure remains stable and common to the rest of Europe, although two new ST (ST7226 and ST7227) have been identified that could be selected and acquire high levels of resistance to cephalosporins.
