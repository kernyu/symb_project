Haemonchus contortus is the most prevalent and pathogenic nematode of sheep in tropical areas. The objectives of this study were to assess the frequency of the F200Y polymorphism on the beta-tubulin gene in third-stage larvae of H. contortus from 33 sheep flocks in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, and to associate this frequency to risk factors based on farm management practices. The resistance allele frequency varied from 9 to 74%, and the resistance genotype frequency varied from 0 to 66.7%. Resistance genotype frequencies higher than 40% were associated with multiple risk factors - new sheep farming enterprises, the absence of farm records, the use of Dorper and Suffolk breeds, rotational grazing, the lack of wetlands on farms, pasture sharing with cattle or horses, frequent incorporation of animals into the flock, semi-intensive farming systems, whole-flock treatment, failure to use the FAMACHA method, lack of the dose-and-move practice, anthelmintic rotation after each application, visual estimation of animal weight for treatment, and lack of drug combination use. It can be concluded that genotyping the F200Y polymorphism can be used to monitor the resistance in sheep flocks and the knowledge of management strategies at the farm level is important to identify drug resistance related factors.
