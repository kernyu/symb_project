BACKGROUND: The best sequence of targeted therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has not been sufficiently defined. OBJECTIVE: To describe the efficacy and toxicity of sequential everolimus (EV) versus receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (rTKI) following failure of first rTKI treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of 108 patients receiving rTKI or EV after progression on rTKI therapy at two German academic centres. INTERVENTION: Sequence of systemic targeted treatment with sunitinib (n=85) or sorafenib (n=23) followed by EV (n=62) or another rTKI (n=46; sorafenib, n=35; sunitinib, n=11). MEASUREMENTS: We measured response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 1.0) and toxicity. Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression) was conducted for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Main patient characteristics did not significantly differ by sequence of treatment groups (rTKI-rTKI vs rTKI-EV). Response rate following first rTKI failure was not significantly different between sequential therapies with a disease control rate of 51.6% (EV) and 43.5% (rTKI). The corresponding median PFS was 3.6 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.4) for EV and 4.0 mo (3.2-4.9) for rTKI treatment. The estimated OS was longer for the rTKI-EV group (43 mo; 95% CI, 33.9-52.1) than for the rTKI-rTKI group (29 mo; 95% CI, 18.6-39.5; p=0.03), but this difference lost statistical significance in multivariable-adjusted analyses. Intrinsic rTKI resistance was independently associated with inferior subsequent PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.79; 95% CI, 1.15-3.62; p=0.015) and OS (HR: 6.54; 95% CI, 3.01-14.20; p<0.001). Limitations are the retrospective design, limited numbers of cases, and residual confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: The sequence therapies rTKI-EV and rTKI-rTKI may be equally efficacious in terms of PFS and response rate, whereas a tendency towards superior survival was observed for the rTKI-EV sequence. These data, particularly the potential benefit of an early change of mode of action, need confirmation in randomised comparative trials.
