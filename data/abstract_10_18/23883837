The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of various serotypes and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing features of Salmonella strains and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of 256 Salmonella strains other than Salmonella serotype Typhi, which were isolated at 12 university hospitals in Korea. We identified 46 serotypes of Salmonella spp. Serogroup D was the most common (39.5%), followed by B (32.4%), C (22.7%), E (2.7%), A (2.3%), and G (0.4%). The three most common Salmonella serotypes were Enteritidis (36.3%), Typhimurium (16.8%), and Infantis (7.8%). Six strains that belonged to serotype Paratyphi A and nine that belonged to serotype Paratyphi B were also detected. The 256 Salmonella strains had a 38.7% rate of resistance to ampicillin, 23.0% to chloramphenicol, 8.2% to cefotaxime, 8.6% to ceftriaxone, and 6.3% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The antimicrobial resistance rates of Salmonella serogroups B and D were higher than those of the other serogroups. Seven isolates carried blaCTX-M: four CTX-M-15, two CTX-M-14, and one CTX-M-3.
