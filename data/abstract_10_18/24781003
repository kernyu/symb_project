The antimicrobial treatment of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections is complicated by intrinsic multidrug resistance and a lack of reliable susceptibility data. We assessed the activity of colistin (COL), rifampicin (RIF) and tigecycline (TGC) alone and in combination using a range of in vitro susceptibility testing methodologies and a simple invertebrate model of S. maltophilia infection (Galleria mellonella). Synergy [fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) </=0.5] between COL and either RIF or TGC was observed against 92 % and 88 % of 25 S. maltophilia isolates, respectively, despite resistance to one or another of the single agents alone. In time-kill assays, COL combined with either RIF or TGC was superior to single agents, but only the COL/RIF regimen was reliably bactericidal. The in vitro findings correlated with treatment outcomes in G. mellonella, with heightened survival observed for larvae treated with COL/RIF or COL/TGC compared with COL, RIF or TGC alone. COL combined with RIF was the most effective combination overall in both in vitro and in vivo (p < 0.05) assays. Given the difficulty in selecting appropriate therapy for S. maltophilia infections, regimens consisting of COL combined with RIF or TGC could be considered for clinical use.
