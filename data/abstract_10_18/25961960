Bifunctional quinolinonyl DKA derivatives were first described as nonselective inhibitors of 3'-processing (3'-P) and strand transfer (ST) functions of HIV-1 integrase (IN), while 7-aminosubstituted quinolinonyl derivatives were proven IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) that also displayed activity against ribonuclease H (RNase H). In this study, we describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of new quinolinonyl diketo acid (DKA) derivatives characterized by variously substituted alkylating groups on the nitrogen atom of the quinolinone ring. Removal of the second DKA branch of bifunctional DKAs, and the amino group in position 7 of quinolinone ring combined with a fine-tuning of the substituents on the benzyl group in position 1 of the quinolinone, increased selectivity for IN ST activity. In vitro, the most potent compound was 11j (IC50 = 10 nM), while the most active compounds against HIV infected cells were ester derivatives 10j and 10l. In general, the activity against RNase H was negligible, with only a few compounds active at concentrations higher than 10 muM. The binding mode of the most potent IN inhibitor 11j within the IN catalytic core domain (CCD) is described as well as its binding mode within the RNase H catalytic site to rationalize its selectivity.
