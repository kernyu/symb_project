BACKGROUND: Data regarding multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii infections among cancer patients are limited. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to investigate the risk factors for acquisition of MDR A baumannii and the outcomes among cancer patients. Cases were inpatients with malignancy who had MDR A baumannii from any cultures between 2008 and 2011. Controls were inpatients with malignancy but no MDR A baumannii. RESULTS: A total of 31 case patients were matched with 62 control patients. Hematologic malignancy (P = .036), need for dialysis (P = .01), admission for other reasons except elective surgery (P = .03), transfer from other health care facilities (P = .02), prolonged intensive care unit stay (P = .004), mechanical ventilation (P < .001), pressor use (P = .001), tube feeding (P < .001), transfusion (P = .009), and prior antimicrobial use (P < .001) were identified as significant risk factors in univariate analysis. Need for dialysis (odds ratio [OR], 18.23; P = .04) and prolonged intensive care unit stay (OR, 19.28; P = .01) remained significant in multivariate analysis. Lengths of stay were 28 days for the case patients and 10 days for the control patients (P = .001). The 90-day mortality rates were 41.9% and 29.0%, respectively (P = .20). CONCLUSIONS: Acquisition of MDR A baumannii among cancer patients appears to be associated with general nosocomial infection risk factors rather than underlying malignancies.
