Host antimicrobial mechanisms reduce iron availability to pathogens. Iron proteins influencing the innate immune response include hepcidin, lactoferrin, siderocalin, haptoglobin, hemopexin, Nramp1, ferroportin and the transferrin receptor. Numerous global health threats are influenced by iron status and provide examples of our growing understanding of the connections between infection and iron metabolism.
