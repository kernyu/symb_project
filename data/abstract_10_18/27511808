WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats to human health. One of the most important factors leading to the emergence of resistant bacteria is overuse of antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between antimicrobial usage and bacterial resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) over a 10-year period in the Clinical Center Nis, one of the biggest tertiary care hospitals in Serbia. We focused on possible relationships between the consumption of carbapenems and beta-lactam antibiotics and the rates of resistance of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems. METHODS: We recorded utilization of antibiotics expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed days (DBD). Bacterial resistance was reported as the percentage of resistant isolates (percentage of all resistant and intermediate resistant strains) among all tested isolates. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A significant increasing trend in resistance was seen in imipenem (P < 0.05, Spearman rho = 0.758) and meropenem (P < 0.05, rho = 0.745). We found a significant correlation between aminoglycoside consumption and resistance to amikacin (P < 0.01, Pearson r = 0.837) and gentamicin (P < 0.01, Pearson r = 0.827). The correlation between the consumption of carbapenems and resistance to imipenem in P. aeruginosa shows significance (P < 0.01, Pearson r = 0.795), whereas resistance to meropenem showed a trend towards significance (P > 0.05, Pearson r = 0.607). We found a very good correlation between the use of all beta-lactam and P. aeruginosa resistance to carbapenems (P < 0.01, Pearson r = 0.847 for imipenem and P < 0.05, Pearson r = 0.668 for meropenem). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated a significant increase in antimicrobial resistance to carbapenems, significant correlations between the consumption of antibiotics, especially carbapenems and beta-lactams, and rates of antimicrobial resistance of P. aeruginosa to imipenem and meropenem.
