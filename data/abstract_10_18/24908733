OBJECTIVE: To improve the sample collection methods and bacteriologic localization patterns in male genital tract infection, and to investigate the influence of specimen collection and pathogen isolation on the diagnosis and treatment of prostatitis. METHODS: We collected the samples of the initial urinary stream, the third portion of the urinary stream, expressed prostatic secretion (ESP), and semen from 200 adult males with chronic prostatitis-like symptoms, inoculated them quantitatively in culture media for isolation of microorganisms, and evaluated their laboratory diagnostic significance according to the count of colonies and distribution of the isolates. RESULTS: A total of 468 strains of microorganisms were isolated from the samples, including 414 strains of bacteria spp (88.5%), 12 strains of fungi spp (2.6%), 40 strains of mycoplasma spp (8.5%), and 2 strains of chlamydia spp (0.4%). Pathogens were isolated from the ESP in 66 cases (33.0%), from the semen in 34 cases (17.0%), and from both the ESP and semen in 100 cases (50.0%). Only 1 species of pathogen was found in the ESP samples of 36 cases (18.0%), in the semen samples of 20 cases (10%), and in both the ESP and semen samples of 39 cases (19.5%); 2 species in the ESP samples of 30 cases (15.0%), in the semen samples of 14 cases (7.0%), and in both the ESP and semen samples of 60 cases (30.0%); and 3 species in both the ESP and semen samples of 1 case (0.5%). CONCLUSION: Multiple microbial infection (MMI), multi-organ infection (MOI) and drug-resistance strains infection are common in patients with prostatitis-like symptoms, frequently leading to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis in clinic and laboratory, and affecting the effect of antimicrobial therapy. MMI and MOI can be diagnosed and differentially diagnosed with the improved sample collection methods and bacteriologic localization patterns.
