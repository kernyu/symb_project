SETTING: A 1200-bed hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. OBJECTIVE: To describe pre-treatment drug susceptibility patterns and determine factors predicting drug resistance in new sputum-smear positive tuberculosis (TB) patients in Thailand. DESIGN: In a retrospective cohort study from October 2007 to September 2010, clinical data on all new sputum-smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB) patients were reviewed. The pre-treatment drug susceptibility patterns and statistically significant differences in variables between groups of patients were described. RESULTS: A total of 769 new smear-positive PTB patients were included in the study. Overall rates of pre-treatment isoniazid resistance and multidrug-resistant TB were respectively 11.8% and 2.5%. TB patients co-infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a four times greater risk of pre-treatment drug resistance than non-HIV-infected patients. No other groups of patients that needed to be prioritised for drug susceptibility testing (DST) were identified. CONCLUSION: Groups of patients to be prioritised for DST other than those with HIV infection could not be identified.
