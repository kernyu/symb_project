PURPOSE: Community acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections are reported to be increasing worldwide. In the United States when rates exceed 15% empiric treatment is suggested. The aim of our study was to determine local rates and treatment of CA-MRSA within our region. METHODS: Nine hundred and forty-two patients were admitted to our service during a six-year period with culture-positive hand infections identified from operative cultures at the time of surgery. RESULTS: Sixty-six (7.0%) patients had CA-MRSA positive cultures identified. Thirty-two (48.5%) patients were noted to have remained on antibiotic treatment that did not reflect their MRSA positive status after cultures returned. Despite this, re-admission and re-operation rates were low and comparable to our non-MRSA control group. CONCLUSIONS: Within our CA-MRSA group, current rates do not support automatic empiric treatment for CA-MRSA. Based on sensitivity data, co-trimoxazole and intravenous vancomycin are appropriate and effective antibiotic treatment within our region. Our data supports the importance of drainage of pyogenic infections in helping to resolve complicated hand infections.
