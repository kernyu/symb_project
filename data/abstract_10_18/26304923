Infection due to Chromobacterium violaceum is rare. Diagnosis may be delayed since Chromobacterium sepsis may mimic melioidosis, especially in melioidosis-endemic areas. Management of Chromobacterium infection is challenging given the propensity of this pathogen to cause visceral abscesses, drug resistance, and relapse. Mortality rates are high despite treatment. We report a case of C. violaceum septicemia in an immunocompetent adult from south India, who was successfully treated with combination antibiotic therapy. Physicians in tropical and subtropical regions must be aware of C. violaceum infection as it can mimic melioidosis.
