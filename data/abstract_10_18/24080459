In this Letter we report on a multi-step synthesis of 5-((arylthio- and heteroarylthio)-methylene)-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)furan-2(5H)-ones starting from gamma-keto thiolester or gamma-keto carboxylic acid. The key intermediate gamma-lactones were then reacted with 4-aminoquinoline-derived amines via ring opening-ring closure (RORC) process affording the corresponding gamma-hydroxy-gamma-lactams in moderate to good yields. In vitro antimalarial activity of the resulting new 4-aminoquinoline gamma-lactams were evaluated against Plasmodium falciparum clones of variable sensitivity (3D7 and W2) and were found to be active in the range of 89-1600 nM with good resistance index and did not show cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) up to concentration of 50 muM.
