This study further evaluated the in vitro and in vivo anti-Helicobacter pylori activities and potential underlying mechanism of patchouli alcohol (PA), a tricyclic sesquiterpene. In the in vitro assay, the capacities of PA to inhibit and kill H. pylori were tested on three standard strains at different pH values and on 12 clinical isolates. The effects of PA on H. pylori adhesion (and its alpA, alpB, and babA genes), motility (and its flaA and flaB genes), ultrastructure, and flagellation were investigated. Moreover, the H. pylori resistance to and postantibiotic effect (PAE) of PA were determined. Furthermore, the in vivo effects of PA on H. pylori eradication and gastritis were examined. Results showed that MICs of PA against three standard strains (pH 5.3 to 9) and 12 clinical isolates were 25 to 75 and 12.5 to 50 mug/ml, respectively. The killing kinetics of PA were time and concentration dependent, and its minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 25 to 75 mug/ml. In addition, H. pylori adhesion, motility, ultrastructure, and flagellation were significantly suppressed. PA also remarkably inhibited the expression of adhesion genes (alpA and alpB) and motility genes (flaA and flaB). Furthermore, PA treatment caused a longer PAE and less bacterial resistance than clarithromycin and metronidazole. The in vivo study showed that PA can effectively eradicate H. pylori, inhibit gastritis, and suppress the expression of inflammatory mediators (COX-2, interleukin 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]). In conclusion, PA can efficiently kill H. pylori, interfere with its infection process, and attenuate gastritis with less bacterial resistance, making it a potential candidate for new drug development.
