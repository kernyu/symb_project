Lipoxygenase from wheat seedlings in normal conditions, infected by Fusarium graminearum and treated by salicylic acid was isolated. The isolated enzyme was purified by the methods of salting-out (60% ammonium sulphate), dialysis, gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Specific activity of the purified enzyme was 8.0-12.5 Deltacapital IE, Cyrillic234/mg of protein, degree of purification - 11.6-15.3 times. The enzyme yield was 18.3-27.9%. Molecular mass of lipoxygenase is 90 kDa, amino acid composition is distinguished by a high content of glutamic acid, proline, valine, isoleucine, leucine and low level of histidine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, cystein. Research of lipoxygenase substrate dependence indicated that the enzyme catalysed with the maximum velocity of the reaction of arachidonic acid oxidation at a substrate concentration of 4.5 mM at pH 7.2, the reaction of linoleic acid oxidation at a substrate concentration of 4.5 mM at pH 7.2 and the reaction of linolenic acid oxidation at a substrate concentration of 9.0 mM at pH 8.0. The change of wheat lipoxygenase activity depending on genotype resistance to Fusarium graminearum and millieu of germination was shown. One of the manifestations of the protective effect of salicylic acid is its ability to induce changes of lipoxygenase activity.
