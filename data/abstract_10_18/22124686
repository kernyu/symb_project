OBJECTIVE: Compare mortality in multidrug-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii infected patients and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii-infected patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) in Colombia. METHODS: A prospective, observational, and multicenter study. A total of 165 patients admitted to the participating ICUs from April 2006 to April 2010 were included. On day 14 and day 30 of hospitalization, mortality in multidrug-resistant patients with clinical isolates of A. baumannii was compared with that in multidrug-susceptible patients. RESULTS: Of the 165 adult patients who had health care-associated infections (HAI) caused by A. baumannii, multidrug-susceptible bacteria were found in 62 patients and multidrug-resistant bacteria in 103. Statistically significant differences in mortality on day 14 of hospitalization in the ICU were not found. On the other hand, significant differences (P < 0.05) in mortality on day 30 of hospitalization were observed between patients with multidrug-resistant isolates and those with multidrug-susceptible isolates. This difference was maintained when the patients' risk factors were evaluated by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of multidrug resistance is the primary risk factor for mortality in patients with HAI caused by A. baumannii in Colombian ICUs.
