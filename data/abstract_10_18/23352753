Benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate reagent (BOP) serves as an efficient and versatile coupling reagent for the design and synthesis of new polyamino geranic acid derivatives in moderate to good chemical yields varying from 47% to 83%. These compounds induced a significant decrease of antibiotic resistance in two Gram-negative bacterial MDR strains. Our data suggested that their mechanism of action is closely associated with the inhibition of the efflux pumps.
