We characterized 12 clinical isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca with the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype (high minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] values of ceftriaxone) recovered over 9 months at a university hospital in Japan. To determine the clonality of the isolates, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and PCR analyses to detect blaRBI, which encodes the beta-lactamase RbiA, OXY-2-4 with overproduce-type promoter. Moreover, we performed the isoelectric focusing (IEF) of beta-lactamases, and the determination of the MICs of beta-lactams including piperacillin/tazobactam for 12 clinical isolates and E. coli HB101 with pKOB23, which contains blaRBI, by the agar dilution method. Finally, we performed the initial screening and phenotypic confirmatory tests for ESBLs. Each of the 12 clinical isolates had an identical PFGE pulsotype and MLST sequence type (ST9). All 12 clinical isolates harbored identical blaRBI. The IEF revealed that the clinical isolate produced only one beta-lactamase. E. coli HB101 (pKOB23) and all 12 isolates demonstrated equally resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (MICs, >128 mug/ml). The phenotypic confirmatory test after the initial screening test for ESBLs can discriminate beta-lactamase RbiA-producing K. oxytoca from beta-lactamase CTX-M-producing K. oxytoca. Twelve clinical isolates of K. oxytoca, which were recovered from an outbreak at one university hospital, had identical genotypes and produced beta-lactamase RbiA that conferred resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam. In order to detect K. oxytoca isolates that produce RbiA to promote research concerning beta-lactamase RbiA-producing K. oxytoca, the phenotypic confirmatory test after the initial screening test for ESBLs would be useful.
