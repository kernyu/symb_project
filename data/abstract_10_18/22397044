The multidrug-resistant bacterial infections cause high mortality in immunocompromised patients because of the limited antibacterial choices. Tigecycline, first member of the glycylcyclines, has in vitro activity against a wide variety of organisms, including multidrug-resistant pathogens; however, it has not yet been approved for use in children. Herein, we report a nine-year-old girl with acute myeloid leukemia who was treated successfully with tigecycline due to multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli bacteremia.
