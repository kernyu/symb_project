OBJECTIVE: To describe a North Carolina Taking Antibiotic Resistance Seriously (NC Tars) project involving a student pharmacist coalition educating patients about appropriate use of antibiotics. SETTING: Charlotte, NC, metropolitan area in October 2008. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Student pharmacists from the Wingate University School of Pharmacy were educated on the importance of antibiotic safety and the threat of antibiotic resistance, and groups of students were assigned to local community pharmacies where they assessed patients' knowledge of antibiotic resistance. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Student pharmacists expanded their knowledge of antibiotic resistance and were provided an opportunity to participate in a service-learning project in their community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient knowledge regarding proper antibiotic use and the threat of antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: Patient knowledge was increased. Patients reported that the information provided by the student pharmacists was beneficial and would be useful in the future. CONCLUSION: The NC Tars project is a unique, student-driven education program that has the potential to raise public awareness about the proper use of antibiotics and the threat of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. Through this experience, students were provided an opportunity to educate patients via a service-learning experience.
