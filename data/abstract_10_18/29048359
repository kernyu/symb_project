The aim of the present work was the development of chitosan ascorbate nanoparticles (CSA NPs) loaded into a fast-dissolving matrix for the delivery of antibiotic drugs in the treatment of atrophic vaginitis. CSA NPs loaded with amoxicillin trihydrate (AX) were obtained by ionotropic gelation in the presence of pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP). Different CSA:TPP and CSA:AX weight ratios were considered and their influence on the particle size, polydispersion index and production yield were investigated. CSA NPs were characterized for mucoadhesive, wound healing and antimicrobial properties. Subsequently, CSA NPs were loaded in polymeric matrices, whose composition was optimized using a DoE (Design of Experiments) approach (simplex centroid design). Matrices were obtained by freeze-drying aqueous solutions of three hydrophilic excipients, polyvinylpirrolidone, mannitol and glycin. They should possess a mechanical resistance suitable for the administration into the vaginal cavity and should readily dissolve in the vaginal fluid. In addition to antioxidant properties, due to the presence of ascorbic acid, CSA NPs showed in vitro mucoadhesive, wound healing and antimicrobial properties. In particular, nanoparticles were characterized by an improved antimicrobial activity with respect to a chitosan solution, prepared at the same concentration. The optimized matrix was characterized by mechanical resistance and by the fast release in simulated vaginal fluid of nanoparticles characterized by unchanged size.
