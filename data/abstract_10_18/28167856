This study was designed to determine the molecular characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcal strains isolated from patients admitted to an Iranian Hospital. Enterococcal strains were isolated from the burn patients. All strains were screened for genes encoding resistance to aminoglycoside [aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, aph (3'), ant (4')], resistance to vancomycin (vanA, vanB), resistance to tetracycline (tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO), and resistance to erythromycin (ermA, ermB, ermC) by PCR and multiplex PCR-based methods. Genetic diversity was evaluated via Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. All enterococcal isolates showed complete sensitivity to vancomycin with MIC </= 0.5mug/ml. Resistance to gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin or quinopristin-dalfopristin was detected, whilst more than 96.2% of isolates were high-level gentamicinresistant (HLGR) and multiple drug resistant. The most prevalent aminoglycoside resistance gene was aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, that was found in 96.2% (26/27) of the isolates. The most prevalent tetracycline resistance genes were tetM, found in 85.1% (23/27) followed by tetL and tetO found in 7.4% (2/27) of the isolates. The ermA and ermB genes were detected in 33.3% (9/27) and 44.4% (12/27) of the isolates respectively. RAPD-PCR analysis yielded 17 distinct profiles among 27 investigated isolates. One cluster of isolates shared the same RAPD pattern, while 16 isolates had unique RAPD pattern. Our study showed that during the examination time period one RAPD genotype was the common type and was disseminated among patients in the burn unit. Interestingly, most of these strains had an identical or very similar antibiotic and gene resistance pattern.
