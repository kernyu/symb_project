Total joint replacement (TJR), such as hip and knee replacement, is a popular procedure worldwide. Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) after this procedure have been widely reported, where treatment of such infections is complex with high cost and prolonged hospital stay. In cemented arthroplasties, the use of antibiotic loaded bone cement (ALBC) is a standard practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of PJI. Recently, the development of bacterial resistance by pathogenic microorganisms against most commonly used antibiotics increased the interest in alternative approaches for antimicrobial delivery systems such as nanotechnology. This review summarizes the efforts made to improve the antimicrobial properties of PMMA bone cements using nanotechnology based antibiotic and non-antibiotic delivery systems to overcome drawbacks of ALBC in the prophylaxis and treatment of PJIs after hip and knee replacement.
