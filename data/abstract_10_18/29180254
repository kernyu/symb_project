TB-Superbugs have emerged as one of the most challenging global health threat due to the decrease in effectiveness of conventional antibiotics. Meanwhile, Host defense peptides (HDP) have evolved as an alternative to classical therapeutics with lesser susceptibility of resistance. We describe the potential of nano-encapsulated synthetic Magainin-I analog peptide (MIAP) as Host Directed Therapy against TB. Micron-sized inhalable platform "Porous Nanoparticle Aggregates Particles (PNAP)" with nano-scale physiognomies were developed to improve the delivery of MIAP-peptide to the lungs and enhance its stability. This particle engineering enabled more control over aerodynamic characteristics and bioactive release. Antimicrobial and mechanistic studies were carried out against virulent H37Rv TB bacteria. These MIAP-PNAP nano-assemblies demonstrated dose and time dependent antibacterial action against virulent M.tb for at least 96 h, with up to approximately 3.03-log CFU reduction in numbers of viable bacteria compared to untreated group. These MIAP-PNAP at concentration of 50 muM and above showed significant antibacterial effects on M.tb after 48-96 h of incubation. Mechanistically, MIAP nano-formulation enhanced host defense mechanism by averting bacteria-induced inhibition of phagosomal-lysosome fusion (Lysostracker) and apoptosis (Annexin-FITC) as shown by confocal microscopy and flow-cytometry. Encapsulated MIAP may serve for adjunctive host-directed TB therapy which may also synergizes the efficacy of standard anti-TB drugs.
