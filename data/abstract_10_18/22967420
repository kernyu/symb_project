OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of bloodstream infections caused by Gram positive bacteria, so as to provide reference for the rational use of antimicrobial agent. METHODS: One hundred and eight patients with bloodstream infections of Gram positive bacteria in our hospital from January 2009 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical manifestations, pathogen types and antimicrobial susceptibility results of pathogens isolated from bloodstream were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients had fever and 31.89% with rigor, 22.41% of the patients had no local infection lesions, 77.59% had clear infection lesions, including oral infections, respiratory tract infections and soft tissue infections. The pathogen testing showed that 12.82% were staphylococci aureus, 50.42% coagulase-negative staphylococci, 24.8% streptococci, 9.4% enterococci and 2.56% Listeria monocytogenes. Antibiotics resistance of staphylococcus and enterococci in our hospital was severe. The percentage of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in this investigation was 68.92%. The resistant rates of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS) to the most antimicrobial agents were higher than that methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci. One strain of MRCNS was found resistant to teicoplanin and linezolid, and 1 strain of enterococci resistant to teicoplanin and linezolid. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria shows serious drug resistance, but still keeps highly sensitive to vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin.
