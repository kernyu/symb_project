We evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of a novel topical myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, E-101 solution, against 5 multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates recovered from wounded American soldiers. Time-kill studies demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against all A. baumannii strains tested in the presence of 3% blood. The in vitro bactericidal activity of E-101 solution against A. baumannii strains was confirmed in a full-thickness excision rat model. Additional in vivo studies appear warranted.
