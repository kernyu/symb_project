Point mutations with unclear molecular mechanisms are often associated with vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we observed that the walK (G223D) mutation caused decreased expression of genes associated with cell wall metabolism, decreased autolytic activity, thickened cell walls, and reduced vancomycin susceptibility. A phosphorylation assay showed that WalK (G223D) exhibited reduced autophosphorylation, which led to reduced phosphorylation of WalR. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that WalK (G223D)-phosphorylated WalR had a reduced capacity to bind to the atlA promoter.
