An outbreak of infections with a high mortality rate caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria is one of the biggest health challenges globally. A class IV drug, roxithromycin (ROX), has poor solubility. In this study, ROX was first encapsulated in the cavity of each of the beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD). Then, each of the resulting betaCD-ROX inclusion complex and HPbetaCD-ROX inclusion complex were separately loaded into poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to synthesize betaCD-ROX/PLGA and HPbetaCD-ROX/PLGA nanoparticles (NPs). Blank and ROX loaded PLGA (ROX-PLGA) NPs were also prepared. The loading efficiency of ROX is comparatively high for HPbetaCD-ROX/PLGA NPs in comparison to the betaCD-ROX/PLGA NPs and ROX-PLGA NPs. All designed formulations showed significant (P<0.0001) antibacterial activity against the selected MDR bacterial strains. In a nutshell, this study demonstrated a great therapeutic potential of the above-mentioned delivery systems for treatment of MDR bacteria.
