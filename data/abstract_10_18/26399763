BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: A subgroup analysis of a GLOBE study identified subgroups of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with excellent outcomes to telbivudine (LdT) treatment. The aim of this study was to validate this concept using a real-world clinical population. METHODS: This prospective, retrospective, and multicenter study examined both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB patients treated with LdT for 2 years. RESULTS: A total of 116 CHB patients were recruited. Of the 64 HBeAg-positive patients, 35 had favorable baseline characteristics [hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA </= 9 log(10) copies/mL and alanine aminotransferase >/= 2x the upper limit of normal (ULN)], but only 40% (14/35) achieved polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity at week 24. Among the 14 patients with favorable baseline characteristics and on-treatment response, the rates of virologic, biochemical, and serologic response and genotypic resistance were 78.6% (11/14), 64.3% (9/14), 50% (7/14), and 7.1% (1/14), respectively, at week 104 of therapy. Of the 52 HBeAg-negative patients, 34 met the criteria of a baseline serum HBV-DNA level less than 7 log(10) copies/mL, and 29 (85.3%) achieved PCR negativity at week 24. Among the 29 patients with favorable baseline characteristics and on-treatment response, the rates of virologic and biochemical response and genotypic resistance were 96.6% (28/29), 72.4% (21/29), and 6.9% (2/29), respectively. In addition, the PCR negativity at week 24 was the only factor associated with the virologic response and genotypic resistance to LdT treatment. CONCLUSION: The efficacy and resistance to LdT treatment in CHB patients with favorable predictors were comparable between a real-world clinical population and the GLOBE study. In addition, PCR negativity at week 24 could predict virologic response and genotypic resistance to LdT treatment.
