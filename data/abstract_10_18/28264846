Critically ill patients frequently have substantially altered pharmacokinetics compared to non-critically ill patients. We investigated the impact of pharmacokinetic alterations on bacterial killing and resistance for commonly used meropenem dosing regimens. A Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate (MICmeropenem 0.25 mg/liter) was studied in the hollow-fiber infection model (inoculum approximately 10(7.5) CFU/ml; 10 days). Pharmacokinetic profiles representing critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance (ARC), normal, or impaired renal function (creatinine clearances of 285, 120, or approximately 10 ml/min, respectively) were generated for three meropenem regimens (2, 1, and 0.5 g administered as 8-hourly 30-min infusions), plus 1 g given 12 hourly with impaired renal function. The time course of total and less-susceptible populations and MICs were determined. Mechanism-based modeling (MBM) was performed using S-ADAPT. All dosing regimens across all renal functions produced similar initial bacterial killing (</= approximately 2.5 log10). For all regimens subjected to ARC, regrowth occurred after 7 h. For normal and impaired renal function, bacterial killing continued until 23 to 47 h; regrowth then occurred with 0.5- and 1-g regimens with normal renal function (fT>5xMIC = 56 and 69%, fCmin/MIC < 2); the emergence of less-susceptible populations (>/=32-fold increases in MIC) accompanied all regrowth. Bacterial counts remained suppressed across 10 days with normal (2-g 8-hourly regimen) and impaired (all regimens) renal function (fT>5xMIC >/= 82%, fCmin/MIC >/= 2). The MBM successfully described bacterial killing and regrowth for all renal functions and regimens simultaneously. Optimized dosing regimens, including extended infusions and/or combinations, supported by MBM and Monte Carlo simulations, should be evaluated in the context of ARC to maximize bacterial killing and suppress resistance emergence.
