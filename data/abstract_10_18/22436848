PURPOSE: To explore the in vitro effects of multipurpose contact lens solutions (MPSs) on corneal epithelial barrier function and viability. METHODS: Human corneal epithelial cells (HCEpiC) were exposed to 50% MPSs A-G. Viability was determined using metabolic activity, protease release and caspase assays. Barrier function was evaluated using immunostaining for the tight junction protein zonnula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and resistance measurements. RESULTS: MPS A and G did not affect HCEpiC monolayer viability after 2 h, while MPSs B-F significantly decreased viability. There was a significant decrease in stratified HCEpiC viability after exposure to MPSs B-E for 2 h, while there was no effect of MPS A. After exposure of HCEpiC monolayers to MPS A, F or G for 30 min, ZO-1 staining appeared similar to control. HCEpiC exposed to MPSs B and C demonstrated tight junction breakdown. There was no significant change in HCEpiC monolayer resistance after exposure to MPS A or F for 2 h, while MPSs B-E and G reduced resistance. After exposure to MPS A-E, stratified HCEpiC resistance was significantly decreased after 2 or 4 h. The decrease in resistance was significantly less with MPS A as compared to the other MPSs. CONCLUSIONS: MPSs caused varying modifications to cell viability and barrier function in monolayer and stratified HCEpiC. MPS A did not alter monolayer HCEpiC viability or barrier function, while MPSs B-G caused significant decreases of at least one parameter. Furthermore, MPS A had significantly less effect than MPSs B-E on viability and barrier function of stratified HCEpiC.
