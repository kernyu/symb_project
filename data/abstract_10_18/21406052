Antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up in resource limited settings (RLS) has been successful, utilizing a standardized population-based approach to ART delivery. An unintended consequence of treatment scale-up is the inevitable emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIV DR) in populations even when patient adherence to ART is optimally supported. HIV DR has the potential to undermine the dramatic gains that ART has had in reducing the morbidity and mortality of HIV-infected patients in RLS. Sustaining and expanding ART coverage in RLS will depend upon the ability of ART programs to deliver ART in a way that minimizes the emergence of HIVDR. Fortunately, current evidence demonstrates that HIVDR in RLS has neither emerged nor been transmitted to the degree that had initially been feared. However, due to a lack of standardized methodologies, HIVDR data from RLS can be difficult to interpret and may not provide the programmatic evidence necessary for public health action. The World Health Organization has developed simple, standardized surveys that generate comparable results to assess acquired and transmitted HIVDR for routine public health implementation in RLS. These HIVDR surveys are designed to be implemented in conjunction with annual monitoring of program and site factors known to create situations favorable to the developments of HIV DR.
