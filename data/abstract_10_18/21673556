The substitution by generic equivalents of some of the drugs included in fixed-dose antiretroviral coformulations (FDACs) poses the potential risk of disrupting these combinations and administering the components separately in order to incorporate the new generic drug, which offers a more competitive sales price. This may represent a step backwards in the advances achieved in simplicity and adherence to therapy, posing an increased risk of selective noncompliance of some of the separately administered drug substances. Available antiretroviral drugs must be administered for life in the affected individuals - both children and adults. The FDACs represent a significant advance in the simplification of antiretroviral therapy, facilitating adherence to complex and chronic treatments, and contributing to a quantifiable improvement in patient quality of life. These drug coformulations reduce the risk of treatment error, are associated with a lower risk of hospitalization, and can lessen the possibility of covert monotherapy in situations of selective noncompliance. Thus, FDACs can reduce the risk of selection of HIV-1 resistances, which not only adversely affect the treatment options of the individual patient but also constitute a public health problem, and further increase the cost and complexity of therapy. With the exception of those cases requiring dose adjustments, the preferential use of FDACs should be recommended for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in those situations when the agents included in the coformulation are drugs of choice.
