OBJECTIVE: To study the resistance phenotype and homology of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN) in burn patients with infection. METHODS: Fifty-four strains of KPN were isolated from wound excretion, blood, sputum, venous catheter, feces, and oral cavity of patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital (briefly called our institute) from January 2007 to June 2011. Drug resistance of the 54 strains of KPN to 18 antibiotics commonly used in clinic, including ampicillin, ticarcillin, etc, was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method after being identified. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing KPN was screened based on the drug resistance result. The positive rates of drug-resistant genes SHV, TEM, and CTX-M of the ESBL-producing KPN were detected by polymerase chain reaction. The homology of the ESBL-producing KPN was analyzed by pulse field gel electrophoresis and clustering methodology. The homology of ESBL-producing KPN isolated in each year was analyzed too. RESULTS: (1) The sensitive rate of the 54 strains of KPN to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem was respectively 96.30%, 92.59%, and 81.48%, that of these strains to cefotetan and cefoxitin was respectively 70.37% and 64.81%, and that of these strains to ceftazidime was 57.41%. The sensitive rates of the 54 strains of KPN to the other antibiotics were all lower than 40.00%. (2) Twenty-six ESBL-producing KPN strains were screened and the positive rate of SHV, TEM, and CTX-M was 96.15% (25/26), 76.92% (20/26), and 57.69% (15/26), respectively. Detection rate of ESBL-producing KPN strains carrying three genes at the same time was 42.31% (11/26), that of these strains carrying both SHV and TEM was 34.62% (9/26), and those of these strains carrying only a single gene were all less than 10.00%. (3) The twenty-six ESBL-producing KPN were classified into 9 gene types, with 30.77% (8/26) in type A, 19.23% (5/26) in type B, 15.38% (4/26) in type C, 11.54% (3/26) in type D, 7.69% (2/26) in type E, and the rest four strains respectively in type F, G, H, I [3.85% (1/26)]. (4) The major gene type of ESBL-producing KPN in the year of 2007 and 2010 was type A, respectively accounting for 2/3 and 1/2, while that in the year of 2009 was type B, accounting for 1/2. The three strains in 2008 was respectively in type C, E, and F. The four strains in 2011 was respectively in type A, D, H, I. CONCLUSIONS: KPN in burn patients with infection in our institute are highly resistant to commonly used antibiotics in clinic, but carbapenems antibiotics can be used for the treatment. Most of the ESBL-producing KPN strains carry two or three drug-resistant genes, and the main gene type of them is type A.
