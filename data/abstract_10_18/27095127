BACKGROUND: Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the etiological agent of a variety of local and invasive infections as well as post-infection complications in humans. This beta-hemolytic bacterium encounters environmental heme in vivo in a concentration that depends on the infection type and stage. While heme is a noxious molecule, the regulation of cellular heme levels and toxicity is underappreciated in GAS. We previously reported that heme induces three GAS genes that are similar to the pefRCD (porphyrin regulated efflux) genes from group B streptococcus. Here, we investigate the contributions of the GAS pef genes to heme management and physiology. RESULTS: In silico analysis revealed that the PefCD proteins entail a Class-1 ABC-type transporter with homology to selected MDR systems from Gram-positive bacteria. RT-PCR experiments confirmed that the pefRCD genes are transcribed to polycistronic mRNA and that a pefC insertion inactivation mutant lost the expression of both pefC and pefD genes. This mutant was hypersensitive to heme, exhibiting significant growth inhibition already in the presence of 1 muM heme. In addition, the pefC mutant was more sensitive to several drugs and nucleic acid dyes and demonstrated higher cellular accumulation of heme in comparison with the wild type and the complemented strains. Finally, the absence of the PefCD transporter potentiated the damaging effects of heme on GAS building blocks including lipids and DNA. CONCLUSION: We show here that in GAS, the pefCD genes encode a multi-drug efflux system that allows the bacterium to circumvent the challenges imposed by labile heme. This is the first heme resistance machinery described in GAS.
