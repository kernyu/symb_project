OBJECTIVES: Staphylococcus aureus remains the most important cause of infections in hospitals and long-term care facilities. The aim of this study was to analyse the resistance, virulence, and epidemiological and genetic relationships of S. aureus from bloodstream infections (BSIs) and pneumonia from patients in Southern Poland. METHODS: All strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the disk diffusion method. Etest was also performed for vancomycin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, oxacillin, cefoxitin and penicillin. PCR amplification was used to detect selected virulence genes. The genetic similarity of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates was determined by spa typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Using the BURP algorithm and the Ridom SpaServer database, spa types were clustered into different clonal complexes (spa-CCs). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: MRSA strains were observed at a prevalence of 26.7%, but 88.6% of hospital-acquired infections were MRSA, with no difference between BSIs and pneumonia. The highest resistance was observed to erythromycin and tobramycin. None of the strains were resistant to linezolid, glycopeptides or tigecycline. The strains had no significant virulence factors and the number of virulence genes present did not correlate with the degree of drug resistance. PFGE typing showed relatively high diversity of strains. The majority of isolates belonged to spa type t003 (CC5).
