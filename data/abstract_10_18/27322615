BACKGROUND: The emergence of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria in clinical and environmental settings is a global problem. Many antibiotic resistance genes are located on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and integrons, enabling their transfer among a variety of bacterial species. Water distribution systems may be reservoirs for the spread of antibiotic resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacteria isolated from raw, treated, and municipal tap water samples from selected water distribution systems in south-western Nigeria were investigated using the point inoculation method with seeded antibiotics, PCR amplification, and sequencing for the determination of bacterial resistance profiles and class 1/2 integrase genes and gene cassettes, respectively. RESULTS: sul1,sul2, and sul3 were detected in 21.6, 27.8, and 0% of the isolates, respectively (n = 162). Class 1 and class 2 integrons were detected in 21.42 and 3.6% of the isolates, respectively (n = 168). Genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides (aadA2, aadA1, and aadB), trimethoprim (dfrA15, dfr7, and dfrA1), and sulfonamide (sul1) were detected among bacteria with class 1 integrons, while genes that encodes resistance to strepthothricin (sat2) and trimethoprim (dfrA15) were detected among bacteria with class 2 integrons. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria from these water samples are a potential reservoir of multidrug-resistant traits including sul genes and mobile resistance elements, i.e. the integrase gene.
