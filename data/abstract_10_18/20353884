The prevalence of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin as well as the presence of the resistance genes mef(A), mef(E), erm(A) and erm(B) were determined in 1076 consecutive isolates of beta-haemolytic streptococci of Lancefield groups A (n=219), B (n=562),C (n=58) and G (n=237) collected during 2005 and 2006. The prevalence of macrolide resistance was highest in group C streptococci (6.9%), followed by group B (5.3%), group G (4.6%) and group A (1.4%). Eighty-eight percent of resistance was mediated by erm(A) and erm(B) genes. Macrolide resistance in beta-haemolytic streptococci in The Netherlands is low, but increasing macrolide resistance was observed in group B streptococci.
