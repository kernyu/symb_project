Enterococcus is a significant pathogen of numerous infections, particularly nosocomial infections, thus conferring a great challenge to clinicians. Linezolid (an oxazolidinone antibiotic) is an important therapeutic option for infections caused by Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, especially vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). To characterize these infections with respect to epidemiological, microbiological and clinical scenarios, we make a systematic review of literature available on linezolid-resistant Enterococcus (LRE). The results validated the potency of linezolid against enterococcal infections, with a sustained susceptibility rate of 99.8% in ZAAPS and 99.2% in LEADER. The patients with LRE had been predominantly exposed to linezolid prior to isolation, with the mean treatment duration of 26.6+/-46.1days for Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and 25.7+/-23.1days for Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium). Paradoxically, LRE could also develop in patients without prior exposure to linezolid. The linezolid resistance was attributed to 23S rRNA (G2576T) mutations (51.2% of E. faecalis and 80.5% of E. faecium) and the presence of cfr gene (accounting for 4.7% and 4.8% respectively), which could horizontally migrate among these strains. In addition to cfr gene, 32 cases of optrA-positive LRE have been identified, whereas further study is required to determine the prevalence of novel resistant genes. The emergence of LRE thus hampers the regimes for such infections, which warrants surveillance worldwide.
