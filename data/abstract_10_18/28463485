Infectious diseases claim millions of lives every year, but with the advent of drug resistance, therapeutic options to treat infections are inadequate. There is now an urgent need to develop new and effective treatments. Nitroimidazoles are a class of antimicrobial drugs that have remarkable broad spectrum activity against parasites, mycobacteria, and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. While nitroimidazoles were discovered in the 1950s, there has been renewed interest in their therapeutic potential, particularly for the treatment of parasitic infections and tuberculosis. In this review, we summarize different classes of nitroimidazoles that have been described in the literature in the past five years, from approved drugs and clinical candidates to examples undergoing preclinical or early stage development. The relatively "nonspecific" mode of action and resistance mechanisms of nitromidazoles are discussed, and contemporary strategies to facilitate nitroimidazole drug development are highlighted.
