Bacterial resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics is a serious threat to human health. The most common cause of resistance to the beta-lactams is the production of beta-lactamase that inactivates beta-lactams. Specifically, class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase produced by antibiotic resistant bacteria is capable of hydrolyzing extended-spectrum Cephalosporins and Monobactams. Mutations in class A beta-lactamases play a crucial role in substrate and inhibitor specificity. In this present study, the E166A point mutant, R274N/R276N double mutant, and E166A/R274N/R276N triple mutant class A beta-lactamases are analyzed. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are done to understand the consequences of mutations in class A beta-lactamases. Root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, radius of gyration, solvent accessibility surface area, hydrogen bond, and essential dynamics analysis results indicate notable loss in stability for mutant class A beta-lactamases. MD simulations of native and mutant structures clearly confirm that the substitution of alanine at the position of 166, Asparagine at 274 and 276 causes more flexibility in 3D space. Molecular docking results indicate the mutation in class A beta-lactamases which decrease the binding affinity of Cefpirome and Ceftobiprole which are third and fifth generation Cephalosporins, respectively. MD simulation of Ceftobiprole-native and mutant type Class A beta-lactamases complexes reveal that E166A/R274N/R276N mutations alter the structure and notable loss in the stability for Ceftobirole-mutant type Class A beta-lactamases complexes. Ceftobiprole is currently prescribed for patients with serious bacterial infections; this phenomenon is the probable cause for the effectiveness of Ceftobiprole in controlling bacterial infections.
