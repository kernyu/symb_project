In this study, 20 samples from three different sources of animal feed were investigated and six bacterial isolates were identified. The susceptibility of four natural antimicrobials, namely, eugenol, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol, against six of these isolates was determined. Carvacrol and eugenol showed better inhibitory effects with larger zones of inhibition. The minimal inhibitory concentration for a range of antibiotics on the susceptibility of two isolates (namely, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Klebsiella oxytoca) was investigated using the VITEK(R) 2 microbiological identification system. Both isolates showed a variety of resistance to 18 antibiotics. The minimal inhibitory concentration and fractional inhibitory concentration index of those two isolates for ampicillin and nitrofurantoin in combination with four phenolic compounds was determined. Synergistic interactions were found for most antimicrobial/antibiotic combinations; thymol and carvacrol were very effective (fractional inhibitory concentration </=0.5) in combination with all antibiotics tested against S. paucimobilis and K. oxytoca, respectively. Ultra performance liquid chromatography techniques were used to investigate the physiological effects of the four natural antimicrobials against those two isolates. Two identical peaks were found to be systematically different between cinnamaldehyde-treated and -untreated cells. The identity of the peaks is unknown and further investigation is needed.
