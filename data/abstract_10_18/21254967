This study was conducted to determine the proteinase, phospholipase, and biofilm forming abilities of Candida isolates in blood cultures of specimens from patients at the University Malaya Medical Center, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Proteinase and phospholipase activities were detected in 93.7% and 73.3%, respectively, of 15 Candida albicans isolates. Amongst the 26 non-C. albicans Candida isolates, proteinase and phospholipase activities were detected in 88.5% and 7.7% of the isolates, respectively. There was no significant difference in the expression levels of proteinase amongst the Candida isolates studied (P = 0.272), but the phospholipase activity of C. albicans was significantly higher than that of the non-C. albicans Candida isolates (P = 0.003). There was no significant difference in the biofilm forming abilities of C. albicans and non-C. albicans Candida isolates on the polystyrene microtiter wells (P = 0.379). In addition, the findings of this study demonstrate increased resistance of Candida isolates in biofilms to amphotericin and fluconazole, as compared to their planktonic counterparts.
