OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates of patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) in comparison with immunocompetent patients. METHODS: Patients' antibiotic sensitivity profiles were extracted from their medical records. In order to compare the antibiotic sensitivity profiles of PID patients with immunocompetent patients, the results of antibiograms of patients who did not have a known or suspected immunodeficiency and were hospitalized during the same period were obtained and used as control subjects. RESULTS: A total number of 257 isolates were obtained from 86 PID patients. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of several organisms isolated from PID patients were significantly lower compared to that of immunocompetent patients. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance seems to be higher among PID patients compared to immunocompetent patients. This indicates a need for further investigations for the possible factors responsible for antibiotic resistance in PID patients.
