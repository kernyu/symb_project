We describe the use of organosilanes as inhibitors and structural probes of a membrane protein, the M2 proton channel from influenza A virus. Organosilane amine inhibitors were found to be generally as potent as their carbon analogues in targeting WT A/M2 and more potent against the drug-resistant A/M2-V27A mutant. In addition, intermolecular NOESY spectra with dimethyl-substituted organosilane amine inhibitors clearly located the drug binding site at the N-terminal lumen of the A/M2 channel close to V27.
