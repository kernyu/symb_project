In 2003, antiretroviral therapy became available free of charge in China's public health sector. During 2008 and 2009, 10 surveys to classify transmitted human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance (HIVDR) were conducted in 7 regions in 5 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) according to World Health Organization guidance. In 2008, transmitted HIVDR was classified as low (<5%) to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors in 6 surveys performed in 6 regions. In 2009, 3 of 4 surveys showed low rates of transmitted HIVDR to all drug classes, and 1 survey showed moderate (5%-15%) rates of transmitted protease inhibitor resistance. In China, routine surveillance of transmitted HIVDR should continue and be expanded to other regions of the country.
