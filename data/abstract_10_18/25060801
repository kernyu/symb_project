This report describes an outbreak of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in a nephrology ward in 2012, caused by the fluoroquinolone- and clindamycin-resistant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotype 027 strains. An increase in the number of cases of diarrhoea was noted among patients hospitalised between 26 November 2012 and 17 December 2012 in a hospital in North Poland. Eight patients were on haemodialysis in the outpatient dialysis facility, while one patient was receiving peritoneal dialysis. The 027 strain could be detected in eight haemodialysis patients. One strain, isolated from the patient receiving peritoneal dialysis, belonged to PCR ribotype 001. In this study, we documented the first outbreak of CDI caused by a fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR) C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 strain in Polish dialysis patients.
