OBJECTIVE: To compare fracture characteristics of root-filled teeth with variable cavity design and resin composite restoration. METHODS: 80 extracted intact maxillary premolars were divided randomly into eight groups; (1) intact teeth; (2) unrestored MOD cavity; (3) unrestored MOD cavity plus endodontic access through the occlusal floor; (4) unrestored MOD plus endodontic access with axial walls removed; (5) MOD restored with resin composite; (6) MOD plus endodontic access, resin composite; (7) MOD plus extensive endodontic access, resin composite; (8) MOD plus extensive endodontic access, GIC core and resin composite. A ramped oblique load was applied to the buccal cusp in a servohydraulic testing machine. Fracture load and fracture patterns were recorded. Fracture loads were compared statistically using 1-way ANOVA, with Dunnett test for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Unrestored teeth became progressively weaker with more extensive preparations. Endodontic access confined within the occlusal floor did not significantly affect strength compared to an MOD cavity. Loss of axial walls weakened teeth considerably [292+80N vs 747+130N for intact teeth]. Restoration increased the strength of prepared teeth particularly in teeth without axial walls. Teeth with a GIC core were not significantly weaker than intact teeth [560+167N]. Failures were mostly adhesive at the buccal interface, with the fracture propagating from the buccal line angle of the occlusal floor (MOD and MOD plus access groups) or of the proximal box (axial wall removed). CONCLUSIONS: Direct restorations increased fracture resistance of root filled teeth with extensive endodontic access. Both restored and unrestored teeth showed similar fracture patterns.
