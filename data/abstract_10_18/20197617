OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the change of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) Producing Klebsiella Pneumoniae (ESBLs-KPN) and Escherichia coli (ESBLs-ECO) causing nosocomial infection after antimicrobial intervention. METHODS: We regularly monitored the data on the yearly consumption [defined as daily dose (DDD) per 1 000 patient-days] of frequently used antibiotics from Dec. 2004 to Dec. 2007. From Jan. 2005 to Dec. 2007, we monitored the resistance of frequently used antibiotics and the timely integrative antimicrobial intervention was based on the outcome of antimicrobial resistance. We also monitored the isolation rate of ESBLs-KPN and ESBLs-ECO causing nosocomial infection. The departments studied were the experimental group and other comparable medical departments were the control group(ICU was excluded). RESULTS: The isolation rate of ESBLs-KPN (43.90%) and ESBLs-ECO (45.83%) in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group (28.04% and 24.90%, respectively) before the intervention (P<0.05). The isolation rate of ESBLs-KPN decreased (from 26.47% to 17.65%) in the experimental group and that in the control group increased ( ESBLs-KPN: from 34.18% to 52.94%; ESBLs-ECO: from 47.13% to 63.78%) from 2005 to 2007 (P<0.05). The isolation rate of ESBLs-KPN and ESBLs-ECO in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group after the antimicrobial intervention (P<0.05). Usage of ceftazidime and cefoperazone/sulbactam and imipenem was reduced and the consumption of cefepime was increased in the experimental group (P<0.05). Consumption of ceftazidime and cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime was increased. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ESBLs-KPN and ESBLs-ECO may be decreased after the integrative antimicrobial intervention.
