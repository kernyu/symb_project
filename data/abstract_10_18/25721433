Daclatasvir (Daklinza(R)) is an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein. It is a new, oral, direct-acting antiviral with potent pangenotypic activity. This article provides a narrative review of the efficacy and tolerability of daclatasvir in combination with other agents in the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection and summarizes its pharmacological properties. Since daclatasvir has a different mechanism of action to other current direct-acting antivirals, it provides additive or synergistic antiviral activity when used in combination. It produces high sustained virological response rates when used in combination with peginterferon-alpha plus ribavirin in patients chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1-4, and provides even higher response rates when used in an interferon-free, all-oral combination with sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin. Daclatasvir has a moderately high genetic barrier to resistance, is effective during short-term treatment over 12 weeks and has a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo. In conclusion, daclatasvir is a highly effective and well tolerated, oral, once-daily, direct-acting antiviral for use in combination therapy in adult patients chronically infected with HCV.
