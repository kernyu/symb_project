Fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pyogenes has rapidly emerged in several countries. The aim of this study was to survey the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible S. pyogenes in Taiwan. A total of 350 consecutive S. pyogenes isolates were collected between January 2005 and December 2012, including 152 (43.4%) invasive and 198 (56.6%) noninvasive isolates. Thirty-nine isolates (11.1%) of S. pyogenes were nonsusceptible to fluoroquinolones, including one emm1/ST28, 4 emm4/ST39, 33 emm12/ST36, and 1 emm87/ST62. Of all the isolates, emm12 (50%) demonstrated the highest prevalence of fluoroquinolone nonsusceptibility. Alterations of Ser79Phe and Ala12Val in ParC were the most frequently mutations in fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible S. pyogenes isolates. There were no amino acid substitutions in GyrB, and 1 emm87 isolate exhibited 3 nonsynonymous mutations in ParE. Our study reveals the emergence of fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible S. pyogenes emm12/ST36 in Taiwan. Regular surveillance of fluoroquinolone susceptibility in S. pyogenes is suggested.
