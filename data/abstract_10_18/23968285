The shape of nanoparticles is an important determinant of their physical and chemical properties, possibly including the little-explored area of their use as antifungal agents. Therefore, we evaluated the in vitro antifungal activities of three different shapes of silver and gold nanostructures, including nanocubes, nanospheres, and nanowires, on Candida albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, using the microdilution and disk diffusion methods as per the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. We found that silver and gold nanocubes had higher antifungal properties against the test species than nanospheres and nanowires. While some isolates were resistant to silver and gold nanospheres and nanowires, none of the isolates were resistant to silver and gold nanocubes. The occurrence of resistance is a new finding which should be further explored.
