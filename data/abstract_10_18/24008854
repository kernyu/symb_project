In the context of the substantial increase in antibiotic resistance rates of Acinetobacter baumannii, we aimed to evaluate the susceptibility rate changes of A. baumannii strains for carbapenems. A. baumannii strains isolated from patients diagnosed with healthcare-associated infections between 2007-2010 were included. A total of 127 A. baumannii strains [53 (42%) from the intensive care unit and 74 (58%) from the non-intensive care unit] were isolated. Conventional methods and an automated microbiology system were used for identification. Susceptibility testing was studied by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. In 2007, five of 26 strains, in 2008, 18 of 31, in 2009, 10 of 35, in 2010, and 20 of 35 were obtained from intensive care unit patients. The susceptibility rate for imipenem was 50% in 2007 but 20% in 2010, while for meropenem it was 55% in 2007 but 12% in 2010. Prevention and control of antibiotic resistance among Acinetobacter species needs antibiotic usage restrictions and infection control precautions.
