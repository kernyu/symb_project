Carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) are potential HIV microbicidal agents with a high genetic barrier to resistance. We wanted to evaluate whether two mannose-specific CBAs, recognizing multiple and often distinct glycan structures on the HIV envelope gp120, can interact synergistically against HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-1 strains that were selected for resistance against particular CBAs [i.e., 2G12 mAb and microvirin (MVN)]. Paired CBA/CBA combinations mainly showed synergistic activity against both wild-type HIV-1 and HIV-2 but also 2G12 mAb- and MVN-resistant HIV-1 strains as based on the median effect principle with combination indices (CIs) ranging between 0.29 and 0.97. Upon combination, an increase in antiviral potency of griffithsin (GRFT) up to approximately 12-fold (against HIV-1), approximately 8-fold (against HIV-2), and approximately 6-fold (against CBA-resistant HIV-1) was observed. In contrast, HHA/GNA combinations showed additive activity against wild-type HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains, but remarkable synergy with HHA and GNA was observed against 2G12 mAb- and MVN-resistant HIV-1 strains (CI, 0.64 and 0.49, respectively). Overall, combinations of GRFT and other CBAs showed synergistic activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and even against certain CBA-resistant HIV-1 strains. The CBAs tested appear to have distinct binding patterns on the gp120 envelope and therefore do not necessarily compete with each other's glycan binding sites on gp120. As a result, there might be no steric hindrance between two different CBAs in their competition for glycan binding (except for the HHA/GNA combination). These data are encouraging for the use of paired CBA combinations in topical microbicide applications (e.g., creams, gels, or intravaginal rings) to prevent HIV transmission.
