OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and antibiotic resistance of gram-negative pathogens isolated from children with bronchopneumonia. METHODS: The distribution and the results of susceptibility tests of 272 strains of gram-negative Bacillis isolated from children with bronchopneumonia during 2009 were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the isolates, the common pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) production rate was 52.9%. Compared with the non-ESBLs producing strains, ESBLs-producing strains had a significantly higher drug resistance rate to many antibiotics except amikacin and meropenem (P<0.05). The lowest resistance to ESBLs producing gram negative strains was found for meropenem (0.7%), followed by imipenem, amikacin and cefoperazone/sulbactam. CONCLUSIONS: More attentions should be paid to the high rate of drug-resistance of ESBLs producing strains in children. Antimicrobial therapy should be based on the results of drug resistance surveillance.
