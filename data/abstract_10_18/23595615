Otomycosis as a kind of external otitis can be caused by various species of fungi. To use the appropriate treatment, it is necessary to identify the causal agent of otomycosis. The aim of this study was to determine the pathogens that caused otomycosis and also the efficacy of different antifungal agents. 100 patients with diagnosis of otomycosis/otitis extern were entered in this study. Bacterial culture was performed by eosin methylene blue agar, blood agar; and Sabouraud dextrose agar was used to culture the fungal agents. Minimum inhibitory concentration test also was performed to determine the efficacy of Clotrimazole, Fluconazole, Ketoconazole and Nystatin on the fungal pathogens. Otomycosis was confirmed in 43% of patients by positive culture. The most prevalent fungal pathogen was Aspergillus niger which was sensitive to Clotrimazole, Fluconazole, Ketoconazole. Candida albicans was sensitive to all drugs, in which, the most sensitivity was due to fluconazole. The most frequent fungal pathogen in our otomycosis cases is A. niger, and most of fungi that caused otomycosis are sensitive to clotrimazole.
