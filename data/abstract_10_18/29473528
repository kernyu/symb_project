BACKGROUND: Genomic islands (GIs) are discrete segments of mobile DNA with defined boundaries, acquired in the bacterial genome from another organism by horizontal gene transfer during the course of evolution. GIs contribute significantly in virulence, disease development, antimicrobial resistance and metabolic process. OBJECTIVE: The present study focuses on the development of a vector based genetic tool carrying selectable and counter-selectable markers, in order to flag the GIs in the bacterial chromosome and monitor their stability in laboratory growth conditions. METHOD: We engineered suicide vectors, pSB40 and pSB41, carrying single or tandem copies of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) and levansucrase (sacB) alleles, respectively. The sacB-cat allele in both the vectors is flanked by several restriction sites. To test the suitability of sacB-cat allele for monitoring GI loss, we introduced the allele in the Vibrio Pathogenicity Island-1 (VPI-1) in Vibrio cholerae genome. RESULTS: The V. cholerae strain carrying sacB-cat allele in VPI-1 element showed resistance to chloramphenicol and sensitivity to sucrose at optimal growth conditions. Loss of VPI-1 element from the V. cholerae genome was simply monitored by growing the cells on selection plates supplemented with sucrose. Our results showed that genetic tool we developed is suitable for monitoring GI stability in bacterial genome. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that pSB40 and pSB41are efficient and sensitive genetic tool that can be used for reverse genetics experiments and monitoring stability of integrative mobile genetic elements in the bacterial genome.
