We report two patients with multidrug-resistant KPC-carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infections. A bla(KPC-2) gene was detected in both of the isolates by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The isolates had identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and belonged to sequence type ST11. The index patient probably acquired the KPC-producing strain while in hospital in Curacao, with subsequent nosocomial transmission to the second patient occurring in our hospital. We describe the interventions that were taken to prevent its further spread within the acute Trust and the community.
