The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of tetracycline resistance and the prevalence of tetracycline-resistance genes in strains of Clostridium perfringens isolated from different sources between 1994 and 2005. Susceptibility to tetracycline and minocycline in strains from humans (35 isolates), chickens (15 isolates), food (21 isolates), soil (16 isolates) and veterinary sources (6 isolates) was determined, and tetracycline-resistance genes were detected. Resistance was most common in strains isolated from chickens, followed by those from soils, clinical samples and foods. The most highly resistant strains were found among clinical and food isolates. tetA(P) was the most common resistance gene, and along with tetB(P) was found in all resistant strains and some sensitive strains. One tetracycline-resistant food isolate had an intact tet(M) gene. However, PCR fragments of 0.4 or 0.8 kb with high degrees of identity to parts of the tet(M) sequences of other bacteria were found, mainly in clinical isolates, and often in isolates with tetB(P). No correlation between level of sensitivity to tetracycline or minocycline and the presence of tetA(P), tetB(P) or part of tet(M) was found. The presence of part of tet(M) in some strains of C. perfringens containing tetB(P) may have occurred by recent gene transfer.
