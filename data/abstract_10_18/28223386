Omadacycline is a broad-spectrum aminomethylcycline in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired pneumonia as an oral and an intravenous once-daily formulation. In this study, omadacycline and comparators were tested against 69,246 nonduplicate bacterial isolates collected prospectively during 2010 and 2011 from medical centers in Asia-Pacific (11,397 isolates), Europe (23,490 isolates), Latin America (8,038 isolates), and North America (26,321 isolates). Omadacycline was tested by broth microdilution following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M07-A10 (2015) methods. A total of 99.9% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by </=2 mug/ml of omadacycline (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), including 100.0% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates and 99.8% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates. Omadacycline potencies were comparable for Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.06 mug/ml), viridans group streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) regardless of species and susceptibility to penicillin. Omadacycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae and was most active against Escherichia coli (MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml), Enterobacter aerogenes (MIC50/90, 2/4 mug/ml), Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC50/90, 1/4 mug/ml), and Citrobacter spp. (MIC50/90, 1/4 mug/ml). Omadacycline was active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) regardless of beta-lactamase status and against Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml). The potent activity of omadacycline against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria indicates that omadacycline merits further study in serious infections in which multidrug resistance and mixed Gram-positive and Gram-negative infections may be a concern.
