The purpose of the present study was to correlate gyrA mutations found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates using the GenoType((R)) MTBDRsl assay with minimum inhibitory concentrations of the fluoroquinolone levofloxacin (LVX). Of 123 archived clinical M. tuberculosis isolates evaluated, 93 isolates had an Ala90Val, Ser91Pro, Asp94Ala, Asn/Tyr, Gly or His mutation and 30 were wild-type. Phenotypically, gyrA mutations Ala90Val, Ser91Pro or Asp94Ala showed a low level of resistance to LVX, while Asp94Asn/Tyr, Asp94Gly or Asp94His mutations had high-level resistance.
