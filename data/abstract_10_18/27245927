Agents capable of eradicating bacterial biofilms are of great importance to human health as biofilm-associated infections are tolerant to our current antibiotic therapies. We have recently discovered that halogenated quinoline (HQ) small molecules are: 1) capable of eradicating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) biofilms, and 2) synthetic tuning of the 2-position of the HQ scaffold has a significant impact on antibacterial and antibiofilm activities. Here, we report the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of 39 HQ analogues that have a high degree of structural diversity at the 2-position. We identified diverse analogues that are alkylated and aminated at the 2-position of the HQ scaffold and demonstrate potent antibacterial (MIC</=0.39 mum) and biofilm eradication (MBEC 1.0-93.8 mum) activities against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium strains while demonstrating <5 % haemolysis activity against human red blood cells (RBCs) at 200 mum. In addition, these HQs demonstrated low cytotoxicity against HeLa cells. Halogenated quinolines are a promising class of antibiofilm agents against Gram-positive pathogens that could lead to useful treatments against persistent bacterial infections.
