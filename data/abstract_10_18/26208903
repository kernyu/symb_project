Future curative cancer chemotherapies have to overcome tumor cell heterogeneity and plasticity. To test the hypothesis that the tumor suppressor maspin may reduce microenvironment-dependent prostate tumor cell plasticity and thereby modulate drug sensitivity, we established a new schematic combination of two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), and suspension cultures to enrich prostate cancer cell subpopulations with distinct differentiation potentials. We report here that depending on the level of maspin expression, tumor cells in suspension and 3D collagen I manifest the phenotypes of stem-like and dormant tumor cell populations, respectively. In suspension, the surviving maspin-expressing tumor cells lost the self-renewal capacity, underwent senescence, lost the ability to dedifferentiate in vitro, and failed to generate tumors in vivo. Maspin-nonexpressing tumor cells that survived the suspension culture in compact tumorspheres displayed a higher level of stem cell marker expression, maintained the self-renewal capacity, formed tumorspheres in 3D matrices in vitro, and were tumorigenic in vivo. The drug sensitivities of the distinct cell subpopulations depend on the drug target and the differentiation state of the cells. In 2D, docetaxel, MS275, and salinomycin were all cytotoxic. In suspension, while MS275 and salinomycin were toxic, docetaxel showed no effect. Interestingly, cells adapted to 3D collagen I were only responsive to salinomycin. Maspin expression correlated with higher sensitivity to MS275 in both 2D and suspension and to salinomycin in 2D and 3D collagen I. Our data suggest that maspin reduces prostate tumor cell plasticity and enhances tumor sensitivity to salinomycin, which may hold promise in overcoming tumor cell heterogeneity and plasticity.
