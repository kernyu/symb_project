TIMEBOMB: The Global Epidemic of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis was published in September 2001 to call attention to a deteriorating global tuberculosis (TB) situation. Although its impact was blunted by the events of 11 September, it is sobering to compare its description of TB problems at that time with the state of global TB control at present. TB--and the even worse resistant forms of the disease, multi-, extensively and even totally drug-resistant TB, a problem completely of our own making-is out of control due to neglect and inattention. Urgent attention is required to begin to rectify the situation.
