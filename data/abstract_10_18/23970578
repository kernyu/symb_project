Multiple endocrine and metabolic abnormalities have been reported among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients since the pre-antiretroviral therapy era. These abnormalities present with either subclinical or overt clinical features. Endocrine and metabolic abnormalities primarily occur due to the direct destructive effects of HIV, malignancies and opportunistic infections on the varied endocrine glands and antiretroviral therapy-associated toxicities. This article offers a broad review on the commonly encountered endocrine and metabolic abnormalities among HIV-infected patients. Timely endocrine or metabolic evaluations should be performed among patients suspected with endocrine or metabolic dysfunction and appropriate treatment instituted since the majority of these conditions pose an increased risk of mortality if undiagnosed or untreated.
