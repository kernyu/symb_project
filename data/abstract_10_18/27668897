Biofilms pose a serious problem for public health. Penetration of pharmacological agents within a biofilm is hampered by the morphological structure of such microbial communities. A biofilm infection therefore entails adverse outcomes both in the field of cost management and patient prognosis. The problem is further complicated if the drugs available to combat a biofilm-related fungal infection versus a bacterial one are compared: in the case of a fungal infection, the drugs available are less efficacious than antibiotics used to counteract a bacterial infection. Furthermore, even the fairly recent introduction of antifungals, such as echinocandins, start presenting some limits of usage, such as ineffectiveness in treating some fungal populations and increased resistance. It therefore becomes imperative to search for innovative molecules in order to combat this condition. The discovery of new molecules and/or new targets can make a difference. This paper illustrates the main innovative molecules that are coming to light in the field of infection by fungal biofilms.
