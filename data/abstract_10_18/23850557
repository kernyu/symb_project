The antiviral activities of sulfated lentinan (sLNT) and lentinan (LNT) against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in tobacco seedlings and the underlying mechanism were investigated. Compared with LNT, sLNT showed significantly higher inhibitory effects on viral infection and TMV multiplication in a dose-dependent way, which might be due to its binding with TMV coat protein. In addition, both sLNT and LNT induced the transient production of H2O2 and expression of some defense-related genes (stilbene synthase, glucanase, acidic chitinase class IV, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and 5-epi-aristolochene synthase) both locally and systemically. These results suggested that sLNT and LNT could control TMV incidence and the action mechanism might be associated with the affinity towards TMV coat protein and activation of some defense genes.
