Immunostimulatory effects of the oral administration of the recombinant epinecidin-1 protein from BL21 Escherichia coli (containing the pET28a-epinecidin-1-dsRed plasmid) were studied in grouper (Epinephelus coioides) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this purpose, fish were fed diets for 30 days containing the recombinant epinecidin-1 protein from BL21 E. coli (containing the pET28a-epinecidin-1-dsRed plasmid) at different bacterial numbers (10(4), 10(6), 10(8), and 10(10) colony-forming units (cfu) of BL21 E. coli in 50 ml of LB medium) mixed with 50 g of eel powder as fodder. After 30 days of feeding, immune-related gene expressions for bacterial-infection responses and disease resistance against Vibrio vulnificus (204) were determined. The V. vulnificus (204) injected into the fish abdominal cavity mimicked gram-negative bacterial infections in culture ponds. Experimental results assessed whether the recombinant epinecidin-1 protein from BL21 E. coli (containing the pET28a-epinecidin-1-dsRed plasmid) has up- (or down-) regulation immune-related genes expression. Results indicated that the recombinant epinecidin-1 protein from BL21 E. coli administered as a feed supplement significantly enhanced expressions several immune-related genes such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-1 in grouper and Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, interleukin (IL)-1beta, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)2, and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in zebrafish. After being challenged with V. vulnificus (204) for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h, the percentage mortality was significantly reduced in treated fish, which indicated that the recombinant epinecidin-1 protein from BL21 E. coli administered as a feed supplement could bring about downregulation of TNF-1 expression and functioned like an antagonist for binding TLR4, which reduced the signal transduction pathway for inhibiting TNF and IL-1beta expressions while reducing binding of the transcription factor, NF-kappaB, to TNF and the IL-1beta promoter region. The experimental results indicated that dietary intake of the recombinant epinecidin-1 protein from BL21 E. coli modulated immune-related gene expressions and disease resistance of grouper and zebrafish after a V. vulnificus (204) infection.
