BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones are widely used for antibacterial prophylaxis during neutropenia following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Nevertheless, data are inadequate as to whether fluoroquinolones decrease mortality rate compared with other antibiotics. METHODS: We retrospectively compared the efficacy of antibacterial prophylaxis using non-absorbable polymyxin B (PB) (n = 106) or systemic levofloxacin (LVFX) (n = 140) after allogeneic SCT at our institute between 2004 and 2013. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in the cumulative incidences of failure of prophylaxis (P = 0.21), clinically documented infections (P = 0.70), or non-relapse mortality within the first 100 days after transplantation (P = 0.42). With bacteremia, the rate of resistance to LVFX was 82% in the PB group and 100% in the LVFX group (P = 0.41). Also, no significant difference was found in overall survival between the 2 groups (P = 0.78). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate no difference in the effectiveness of antibacterial prophylaxis between systemic antibiotic LVFX and non-absorbable antibiotic PB.
