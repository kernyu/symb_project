Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae may display MICs to carbapenems within susceptible or intermediate ranges, prompting confirmatory testing. Four phenotypic methods to detect KPC producers were evaluated against a collection of clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Meropenem-phenylboronic acid double disk synergy testing demonstrated the best performance with 100% sensitivity and specificity.
