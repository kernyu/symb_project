Oxaliplatin (OxP) has been used in combination therapy with gemcitabine for the treatment of pancreatic cancer (PC), but the beneficial effect was marginal, which is believed to be due to de novo and acquired drug resistance of PC. Here, we report our in vitro and in vivo preclinical evidence in support of chemosensitization of drug-resistant cells by a nontoxic chemopreventive agent (genistein). Genistein pretreatment together with low concentration of OxP showed significant reduction in cell viability and colony formation concomitant with increased apoptosis (p < 0.01), which was highly synergistic. Drug resistance of PC is allegedly linked with both constitutive and OxP-induced activation of NF-kappaB, and we found that inactivation of (nuclear factor kappa B) NF-kappaB by genistein before treatment of cells with OxP was required for cell killing, which was consistent with the downregulation of NF-kappaB and its downstream antiapoptotic genes (Bcl-2, XIAPs and survivin). Most importantly, our in vivo experiments using orthotopic mouse model showed significant reduction in tumor size (p < 0.01) and reduction of locoregional lymph node metastasis by combination treatment. These results were also consistent with inactivation of NF-kappaB and the downregulation of NF-kappaB downstream genes, decreased proliferation marker (Ki-67) and increased apoptosis (TUNEL) in tumor remnants, all of which was consistent with in vitro findings. From these results, we conclude that genistein sensitizes drug-resistant PC to OxP, which is mechanistically linked with inactivation of NF-kappaB signaling, resulting in greater antitumor effects, and thus our data suggest that this approach could be useful in improving the treatment outcome for patients diagnosed with PC.
