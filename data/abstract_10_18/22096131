The antifungal susceptibility pattern of 302 Candida isolates collected during an Italian survey on invasive fungal infections in an intensive care setting was investigated. The results were correlated with some epidemiological data and compared with the antifungal profiles obtained in a previous survey. No resistance to echinocandins was detected. The overall resistance levels to fluconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole were 12.6, 6.0 and 7.1 %, respectively. Candida tropicalis and Candida parapsilosis accounted for more than half of all the fluconazole resistant isolates. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole is not uncommon among isolates (12.3 %) and appears to be increasing, particularly among C. parapsilosis isolates, which showed an increase in resistant isolates from 2 % in the 1990s to 25.8 % in the present study. Routine antifungal susceptibility testing of this species is therefore recommended.
