We previously reported that mice lacking alpha/beta and gamma interferon receptors (IFN-alpha/betaR and -gammaR) uniformly exhibit paralysis following infection with the dengue virus (DENV) clinical isolate PL046, while only a subset of mice lacking the IFN-gammaR alone and virtually no mice lacking the IFN-alpha/betaR alone develop paralysis. Here, using a mouse-passaged variant of PL046, strain S221, we show that in the absence of the IFN-alpha/betaR, signaling through the IFN-gammaR confers approximately 140-fold greater resistance against systemic vascular leakage-associated dengue disease and virtually complete protection from dengue-induced paralysis. Viral replication in the spleen was assessed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, which revealed a reduction in the number of infected cells due to IFN-gammaR signaling by 2 days after infection, coincident with elevated levels of IFN-gamma in the spleen and serum. By 4 days after infection, IFN-gammaR signaling was found to restrict DENV replication systemically. Clearance of DENV, on the other hand, occurred in the absence of IFN-gammaR, except in the central nervous system (CNS) (brain and spinal cord), where clearance relied on IFN-gamma from CD8(+) T cells. These results demonstrate the roles of IFN-gammaR signaling in protection from initial systemic and subsequent CNS disease following DENV infection and demonstrate the importance of CD8(+) T cells in preventing DENV-induced CNS disease.
