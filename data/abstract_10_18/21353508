Candida albicans distinguishing features such as dimorphism and biofilm formation are thought to play a key role in oral tissue invasion and resistance to host defences and antifungal agents. In this study, we investigated the effect of 4-hydroxycordoin, a natural isopentenyloxychalcone, on growth, biofilm formation and yeast-hyphal transition of C. albicans. Serial dilutions of 4-hydroxycordoin in YNB medium were prepared in microplates to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and effects on biofilm formation for two strains of C. albicans. 4-Hydroxycordoin at up to 200 mug/ml had no effect on growth of C. albicans. Biofilm formation was strongly inhibited (>85%) by 4-hydroxycordoin at 20 mug/ml, while concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 mug/ml caused a significant inhibition of yeast-hyphal transition, as determined by microscopic observation. In conclusion, 4-hydroxycordoin exerts inhibitory effects on two important virulence factors of C. albicans: biofilm formation or yeast-hyphal transition. This suggests that 4-hydroxycordoin may have a therapeutic potential for C. albicans infections.
