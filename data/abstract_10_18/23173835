Enterococci are an unusual cause of meningitis, with most cases reported in the literature preceded by neurosurgical procedures. Spread to the meninges from an enterococcal bloodstream infection is even more rare, with few cases reported in the literature. We report the first documented case, to our knowledge, of successful treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) meningitis with linezolid therapy in an immunosuppressed hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient. Our case highlights the success of monotherapy with linezolid for VRE meningitis. A literature review is provided, which reveals that there is little evidenced-based data on the optimal therapy for VRE meningitis.
