Treatment of Candida glabrata cystitis remains a therapeutic challenge, and an antifungal combination using flucytosine is one option. We describe two patients with refractory C. glabrata cystitis who failed flucytosine combined with caspofungin with early-acquired high-level resistance to flucytosine due to nonsense mutations in the FUR1 gene. Rapidly acquired flucytosine resistance with microbiological failure should discourage combination of caspofungin and flucytosine during urinary candidiasis.
