Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) have been identified by global health leaders as an urgent threat. Detection of patients with gastrointestinal carriage of CPO is necessary to interrupt their spread within health care facilities. In this multisite study, we assessed the performance of the Xpert Carba-R test, a rapid real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay that detects five families of carbapenemase genes (blaIMP, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaOXA-48, and blaVIM) directly from rectal swab specimens. Using dual swabs, specimens from 755 patients were collected and tested prospectively. An additional 432 contrived specimens were prepared by seeding well-characterized carbapenem-susceptible and -nonsusceptible strains into a rectal swab matrix and inoculating them onto swabs prior to testing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, broth enriched culture, and DNA sequencing were performed by a central laboratory blind to the Xpert Carba-R results. The Xpert Carba-R assay demonstrated a positive percentage of agreement (PPA) between 60 and 100% for four targets (blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, and blaOXA-48) and a negative percentage of agreement (NPA) ranging between 98.9 and 99.9% relative to the reference method (culture and sequencing of any carbapenem-nonsusceptible isolate). There were no prospective blaIMP-positive samples. Contrived specimens demonstrated a PPA between 95 and 100% and an NPA of 100% for all targets. Testing of rectal swabs directly using the Xpert Carba-R assay is effective for rapid detection and identification of CPO from hospitalized patients.
