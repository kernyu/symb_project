Acinetobacter baumannii (American Type Culture Collection strain 19606) acquires mutations in the pmrB gene during the in vitro development of resistance to colistin. The colistin-resistant strain has lower affinity for colistin, reduced in vivo fitness (competition index, .016), and decreased virulence, both in terms of mortality (0% lethal dose, 6.9 vs 4.9 log colony-forming units) and survival in a mouse model of peritoneal sepsis. These results may explain the low incidence and dissemination of colistin resistance in A. baumannii in clinical settings.
