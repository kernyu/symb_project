Multidrug resistance is a widespread problem among various diseases and cancer is no exception. We had previously described the chemo-sensitizing activity of ecdysteroid derivatives with low polarity on drug susceptible and multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancer cells. We have also shown that these molecules have a marked selectivity towards the MDR cells. Recent studies on the oximation of various steroid derivatives indicated remarkable increase in their antitumor activity, but there is no related bioactivity data on ecdysteroid oximes. In our present study, 13 novel ecdysteroid derivatives (oximes, oxime ethers and a lactam) and one known compound were synthesized from 20-hydroxyecdysone 2,3;20,22-diacetonide and fully characterized by comprehensive NMR techniques revealing their complete (1)H and (13)C signal assignments. The compounds exerted moderate to strong in vitro antiproliferative activity on HeLa, SiHa, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cell lines. Oxime and particularly oxime ether formation strongly increased their inhibitory activity on the efflux of rhodamine 123 by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), while the new ecdysteroid lactam did not interfere with the efflux function. All compounds exerted potent chemo-sensitizing activity towards doxorubicin on a mouse lymphoma cell line and on its MDR counterpart, and, on the latter, the lactam was found the most active. Because of its MDR-selective chemo-sensitizing activity with no functional effect on P-gp, this lactam is of high potential interest as a new lead for further antitumor studies.
