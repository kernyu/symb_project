CLINICAL CASE: The case of a 60 year-old male with a conjunctival lesion diagnosed as conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), who was treated with mitomycin-C for 3 weeks with minimal improvement. The therapy was change to interferon 2B. Six month later, and after a complete remission of the lesion, the treatment was suspended, with no signs of relapse. DISCUSSION: The treatment of these lesions is currently made with chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents, such as mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil, and interferon alfa 2B. The latter, even although is the least used, gives excellent results with fewer secondary effects than mitomycin-C, resulting in an optimal therapy for the non-invasive treatment of CIN lesions.
