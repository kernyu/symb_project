Pathogenic fungi are a major causative group for opportunistic infections (OIs). AIDS patients and other immunocompromised individuals are at risk for OIs, which if not treated appropriately, contribute to the mortality associated with their conditions. Several studies have indicated that the majority of HIV-positive patients contract fungal infections throughout the course of their disease. Similar observations have been made regarding the increased frequency of bone marrow and organ transplants, the use of antineoplastic agents, the excessive use of antibiotics, and the prolonged use of corticosteroids among others. In addition, several pathogenic fungi have developed resistance to current drugs. Together these have conspired to spur a need for developing new treatment options for OIs. To aid this effort, this article reviews the biological targets of current and emerging drugs and agents that act through these targets for the treatment of opportunistic fungal infections.
