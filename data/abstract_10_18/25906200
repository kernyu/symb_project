Malaria continues to be a major global health problem, being particularly devastating in the African population under the age of five. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the first-line treatment recommended by the WHO to treat Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but clinical resistance against them has already been reported. As a consequence, novel chemotypes are urgently needed. Herein we report a novel, in vivo active, fast-acting antimalarial chemotype based on a benzimidazole core. This discovery is the result of a medicinal chemistry plan focused on improving the developability profile of an antichlamydial chemical class previously reported by our group.
