The empiric use of antibiotics is being restricted due to the spread of antimicrobial resistance. However, topical antiseptics are less likely to induce resistance, owing to their unspecific mode of action and the high concentrations in which they can be used. One such antiseptic, octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT), can be used either prophylactically or therapeutically on the skin, mucosa and wounds. Evidence to support its use comes from in-vitro, animal and clinical studies on its safety, tolerability and efficacy. This article summarises the physical, chemical and antimicrobial properties of OCT in the context of wound care.
