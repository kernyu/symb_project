In developing new generations of coatings for medical devices and tissue engineering scaffolds, there is a need for thin coatings that provide controlled sequential release of multiple therapeutics while providing a tunable approach to time dependence and the potential for sequential or staged release. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to develop a self-assembled, polymer-based conformal coating, built by using a water-based layer-by-layer (LbL) approach, as a dual-purpose biomimetic implant surface that provides staggered and/or sustained release of an antibiotic followed by active growth factor for orthopedic implant applications. This multilayered coating consists of two parts: a base osteoinductive component containing bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) beneath an antibacterial component containing gentamicin (GS). For the fabrication of truly stratified composite films with the customized release behavior, we present a new strategy-implementation of laponite clay barriers-that allows for a physical separation of the two components by controlling interlayer diffusion. The clay barriers in a single-component GS system effectively block diffusion-based release, leading to approximately 50% reduction in bolus doses and 10-fold increase in the release timescale. In a dual-therapeutic composite coating, the top GS component itself was found to be an effective physical barrier for the underlying rhBMP-2, leading to an order of magnitude increase in the release timescale compared to the single-component rhBMP-2 system. The introduction of a laponite interlayer barrier further enhanced the temporal separation between release of the two drugs, resulting in a more physiologically appropriate dosing of rhBMP-2. Both therapeutics released from the composite coating retained their efficacy over their established release timeframes. This new platform for multi-drug localized delivery can be easily fabricated, tuned, and translated to a variety of implant applications where control over spatial and temporal release profiles of multiple drugs is desired.
