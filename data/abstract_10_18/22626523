Triclocarban is an antiseptic of the anilide family. Its antibacterial activity was re-assessed in vitro against various susceptible and antibiotic resistant staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus strains. The results of this study show that, in vitro, the effectiveness of triclocarban antibacterial is maintained at very low MICs ranging from 0.5 to 8 mg/L for the various resistant strains studied. Triclocarban remains still very effective for the treatment of either initially bacterial skin and mucosal infections, or skin and mucosal at risk of super infection.
