INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections caused by enterobacteriaceae secreting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (EESBL) is an issue for most family physicians. The aim of our study was to evaluate their practice in case of EESBL discovered after urinalysis and culture (U/C). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This epidemiological and retrospective study was conducted from the January 1, to December 31, 2012, in 5 laboratories of Savoie and Isere. Results of U/C prescribed by family physicians and positive for EESBL were collected. The data collected with questionnaires, concerned characteristics of the infection, antibiotic treatment adequateness, the implementation of specific hygiene measures, and risk factors for EESBL infection. RESULTS: One hundred and three U/C out of 19,494 were considered, and 56 questionnaires were collected. The rate of EESBL positive U/C was 0.60%. The antibiotic treatment was adequate for 35 patients (62.5%). Specific hygiene measures were implemented for 22 patients (32.3%). Both antibiotic treatment and specific hygiene measures were initiated for 13 patients (23.2%). Fourteen cases of community-acquired infections (25%) were reported. Five patients (8.9%) had traveled to an endemic zone in the previous 6 months. CONCLUSION: The concomitant initiation of both antibiotic treatment and specific hygiene measures in case of U/C positive for EESBL is insufficient when managed by family physicians. It could be improved by offering tools for the management of these infections, by developing EESBL networks between hospital and family physicians, and epidemiological surveillance in community settings.
