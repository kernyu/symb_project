Trends in tuberculosis (TB) admissions over 40 years at the Infectious Diseases Clinic of Perugia University Hospital, Perugia, Italy, show that in the last decade non-Italian TB case admissions outweighed those of Italians, with a large number of cases from Eastern Europe (25.2%) and Africa (23.4%). Non-Italians tended to be younger and were generally new pulmonary TB cases, and drug resistance was also more common. Overall, the number of multidrug-resistant cases increased. Only one case occurred in a native-born Italian, and five of seven cases had newly diagnosed TB. In low TB incidence settings such as Perugia, Italy, TB prevention and control programmes for the foreign-born need to be reinforced.
