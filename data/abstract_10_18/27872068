Previously, we showed that mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis panD, involved in coenzyme A biosynthesis, cause resistance against pyrazinoic acid, the bioactive component of the prodrug pyrazinamide. To identify additional resistance mechanisms, we isolated mutants resistant against pyrazinoic acid and subjected panD wild-type strains to whole-genome sequencing. Eight of the nine resistant strains harbored missense mutations in the unfoldase ClpC1 associated with the caseinolytic protease complex.
