Despite permanent confrontation with a potentially harmful environment, its own microbiota and the fact that minor injuries occur frequently in everyday life, skin infections are a rare event. A chemical barrier of antimicrobial peptides (AMP), some of them constitutively expressed, others inducible by various stimuli, contributes to the integument's resistance. AMP are evolutionarily old components of the innate immunity which became the focus of interest due to their broad spectrum of activity against microorganisms and the rare occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. These attributes make them promising alternative candidates for future antibiotics. Furthermore various dermatological diseases are associated with an altered expression of these molecules, which might then play a pathogenetic role. In addition to their antimicrobial activity, some AMP have immunomodulatory effects and can promote wound healing, properties which currently are under intensive research.
