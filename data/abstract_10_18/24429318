OBJECTIVE: To establish breakpoint concentrations for the fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin [MFX] and ofloxacin [OFX]) and injectable second-line drugs (amikacin [AMK], kanamycin [KM] and capreomycin [CPM]) using the microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay. SETTING: A multinational study conducted between February 2011 and August 2012 in Peru, India, Moldova and South Africa. DESIGN: In the first phase, breakpoints for the fluoroquinolones and injectable second-line drugs (n = 58) were determined. In the second phase, MODS second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST) as an indirect test was compared to MGIT DST (n = 89). In the third (n = 30) and fourth (n = 156) phases, we determined the reproducibility and concordance of MODS second-line DST directly from sputum. RESULTS: Breakpoints for MFX (0.5 mug/ml), OFX (1 mug/ml), AMK (2 mug/ml), KM (5 mug/ml) and CPM (2.5 mug/ml) were determined. In all phases, MODS results were highly concordant with MGIT DST. The few discrepancies suggest that the MODS breakpoint concentrations for some drugs may be too low. CONCLUSION: MODS second-line DST yielded comparable results to MGIT second-line DST, and is thus a promising alternative. Further studies are needed to confirm the accuracy of the drug breakpoints and the reliability of MODS second-line DST as a direct test.
