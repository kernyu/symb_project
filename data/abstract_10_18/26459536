SETTING: The Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF assay is endorsed by the World Health Organization for the detection of rifampicin (RMP) resistant tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate Xpert for its diagnostic accuracy in detecting RMP-resistant TB and its impact on treatment outcomes. DESIGN: Patients with available phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) results and those in whom RMP-resistant pulmonary TB was diagnosed using Xpert were evaluated. The accuracy and turnaround time (TAT) of Xpert for determining RMP-resistant TB was calculated. The TATs for treatment between patients diagnosed with RMP-resistant TB using Xpert and those diagnosed without the assay (phenotypic DST group) were compared. RESULTS: In 321 patients, when phenotypic DST was used as the gold standard, Xpert sensitivity and specificity for RMP resistance diagnosis was respectively 100% and 98.7%; the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 86.2% and 100%. The Xpert group had a much shorter interval from initial evaluation to commencing second-line anti-tuberculosis treatment (64 vs. 2 days, P < 0.001), and negative conversion of mycobacterial cultures (197 vs. 62.5 days, P < 0.001) than the phenotypic DST group. CONCLUSION: Xpert was accurate at diagnosing RMP resistance in this setting with an intermediate TB burden and a low level of RMP resistance. Xpert might reduce disease transmission by reducing the sputum culture conversion times for patients with RMP-resistant TB.
