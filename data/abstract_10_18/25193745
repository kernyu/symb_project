Our objective was to compare the antimicrobial resistance trends among clinically relevant anaerobes against 9 different antibiotics over two periods, 2008-2012 and 2002-2007. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by determining the MICs using E test method. The interpretation of results was according to the breakpoints recommended by the Clinical Laboratory and Standard Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). A total of 2240 clinically significant isolates were collected between 2008 and 2012 in four teaching hospitals in Kuwait. The commonest isolates were Bacteroides fragilis (40.4%), Prevotella bivia (18.6%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (13.8%) and Bacteroides ovatus (11.1%). According to CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints used for the 2008-2012 and 2002-2007 isolates, high resistance rates to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, penicillin and piperacillin were noted among the Gram-negative isolates. They ranged between 0 and 0-62.1 and 62.1%, and 0 and 0-59.1 and 62.1%, respectively against clindamycin, 0 and 0-34.5 and 45.3%, and 0 and 0-45 and 57.5%, respectively against piperacillin and 0 and 0-24.2 and 24.2%, and 0 and 0-23.1 and 30.6%, respectively against amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The mean interpretative results by both CLSI and EUCAST during the 2008-2012 and 2002-2007 periods showed that the B. fragilis isolates were highly resistant to penicillin (100 vs 100%), clindamycin (43.7 vs 44.2%), piperacillin (35.8 vs 42.7%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (13.2 vs 14%), respectively. When compared with 2002-2007, the CLSI, but not EUCAST, demonstrated statistically significant decreased resistance to clindamycin (P < 0.03). However, both interpretative criteria showed demonstrable statistically significant decrease in resistance rates to imipenem (P < 0.00097 vs P < 0.00074), meropenem (P < 0.000006 vs P < 0.0407) and piperacillin (P < 0.000017 vs P < 0.0461). Our data shows that there is a need for periodic monitoring of the susceptibility testing for anaerobic bacteria in the face of increasing resistance rates as well as to guide in the empirical therapy of anaerobic infections.
