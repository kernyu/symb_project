Tigecycline (TG) has been shown to be active in vitro against Acinetobacter baumannii, although data on the clinical efficacy of TG alone or in combination for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDRAB) remain limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) caused by MDRAB who were treated with imipenem/cilastatin and sulbactam, and TG alone or in combination with other antibiotics. A total of 386 patients with HAIs caused by MDRAB were retrospectively analyzed and grouped into TG and non-TG groups, depending on whether they received TG treatment. Of the 266 patients in the TG group, 108 were treated with TG alone and 158 were treated with TG in combination with ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a carbapenem. All 120 patients in the non-TG group were treated with imipenem/cilastatin and sulbactam. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality after TG treatment and the secondary outcome was clinical outcome. There were no significant differences in survival rates between the two groups. However, the rate of unfavorable outcome was significantly lower (p < 0.05) among patients in the TG group than among patients in the non-TG group. The most significant predictor of unfavorable outcome was sepsis, whereas TG treatment and microbial eradication were the most significant predictors of favorable outcomes. Our study represents the largest study of patients with MDRAB infection treated with TG and expands our understanding of the role of TG therapy alone or in combination with other agents for the treatment of HAI caused by MDRAB.
