Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma in children is a very rare disease and has a poor prognosis. Unlike malignant mesothelioma in adults, there is no clear causal association between this very rare malignancy in children and asbestos exposure. We report a case of peritoneal mesothelioma in an 11-year-old boy who presented with ascites. He was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma on the basis of histopathological findings. His disease showed resistance to pemetrexed, but was treated successfully with platinum-based therapy with gemcitabine. He has achieved long-term survival in partial remission with stable disease.
