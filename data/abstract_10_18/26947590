Five isolates harboring qepA were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and relevant methods. One was determined to be a novel qepA3 from Enterobacter aerogenes, and four involved three qepA1 and one qepA2 determinants from Escherichia coli; the qepA3 changed five amino acids. These results characterized genetic structures A, B, C, D, and E.
