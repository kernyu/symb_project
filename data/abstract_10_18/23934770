OBJECTIVES: The introduction of two new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the past 5 years and the identification of novel NNRTI-associated mutations have made it necessary to reassess the extent of phenotypic NNRTI cross-resistance. METHODS: We analysed a dataset containing 1975, 1967, 519 and 187 genotype-phenotype correlations for nevirapine, efavirenz, etravirine and rilpivirine, respectively. We used linear regression to estimate the effects of RT mutations on susceptibility to each of these NNRTIs. RESULTS: Sixteen mutations at 10 positions were significantly associated with the greatest contribution to reduced phenotypic susceptibility (>/=10-fold) to one or more NNRTIs, including: 14 mutations at six positions for nevirapine (K101P, K103N/S, V106A/M, Y181C/I/V, Y188C/L and G190A/E/Q/S); 10 mutations at six positions for efavirenz (L100I, K101P, K103N, V106M, Y188C/L and G190A/E/Q/S); 5 mutations at four positions for etravirine (K101P, Y181I/V, G190E and F227C); and 6 mutations at five positions for rilpivirine (L100I, K101P, Y181I/V, G190E and F227C). G190E, a mutation that causes high-level nevirapine and efavirenz resistance, also markedly reduced susceptibility to etravirine and rilpivirine. K101H, E138G, V179F and M230L mutations, associated with reduced susceptibility to etravirine and rilpivirine, were also associated with reduced susceptibility to nevirapine and/or efavirenz. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of novel cross-resistance patterns among approved NNRTIs illustrates the need for a systematic approach for testing novel NNRTIs against clinical virus isolates with major NNRTI-resistance mutations and for testing older NNRTIs against virus isolates with mutations identified during the evaluation of a novel NNRTI.
