Integrons are considered to play a significant role in the evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. A total of 200 uropathogenic (UPEC) and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) isolates from outpatients were investigated for antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of class 1, 2, and 3 integron-associated integrase (intI) genes and gene cassettes. Conjugal transfer and Southern hybridization were performed to determine the genetic localization of class 1 integrons. One hundred ninety-two (96%) isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial resistance among DEC isolates was higher compared with the UPEC. Integrons were highly prevalent in both pathotypes (92.5%). Comparison of integrons among UPEC and DEC showed that DEC isolates harbored integrases (94% for intI1, 8% for intI2) with a slightly higher frequency than in UPEC isolates (87% for intI1, 7% for intI2) (p>0.05). Dihydrofolate reductase (dfrA) and aminoglycoside adenyl transferase (aad) gene cassettes were found most frequently in intI1-positive isolates. All isolates carried their class 1 integrons on conjugative plasmids. These results indicate that class 1 integrons are widespread among E. coli isolates. Therefore, appropriate surveillance and control measures are essential to prevent the further spread of integron-producing isolates.
