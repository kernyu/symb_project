Retapamulin and six other antimicrobial agents were evaluated against 155 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates, including strains resistant to vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, and mupirocin by microdilution tests. Time-kill assays were performed against representative MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolates. Retapamulin and mupirocin demonstrated MIC90s of 0.12 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively, with resistance seen in 2.6% and 10% of isolates, respectively. Retapamulin maintained good activity against 94% (15/16) of mupirocin-resistant isolates.
