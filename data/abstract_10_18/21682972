SETTING: A national tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance survey in Tanzania. OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of the Genotype(R) MTBDRplus line-probe assay (LPA) on smear-positive sputum specimens with conventional culture and isoniazid (INH) plus rifampicin (RMP) drug susceptibility testing (DST). DESIGN: Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates tested at the Tanzanian Central TB Reference Laboratory (CTRL) were submitted for quality assurance of phenotypic DST to its supranational reference laboratory (SRL), together with ethanol-preserved sputum specimens for LPA DST. RESULTS: Only 321 samples could be tested using LPA; of these, three were identified as being non-tuberculous mycobacteria using CTRL DST. Both tests had 269 sets with interpretable results. CTRL DST yielded almost the same number of interpretable results as LPA, with 90% concordance (kappa = 0.612, P < 0.001). Five (1.9%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, 46 (17.1%) resistant to INH only and 0 RMP only, were found by CTRL DST. For the LPA, these results were respectively 5 (1.9%), 26 (9.7%) and 2 (0.7%). With SRL DST as the gold standard, LPA was more accurate than CTRL DST for RMP, but missed almost half the INH-resistant samples. CONCLUSION: LPA applied directly on ethanol-preserved sputum specimens was similar to phenotypic DST in terms of yield of interpretable results. Although probably more accurate for RMP and MDR-TB, it appears to seriously underestimate INH resistance. Considering speed, easy and safe specimen transportation and low infrastructure requirements, LPA DST from sputum can be recommended for surveys in resource-poor settings.
