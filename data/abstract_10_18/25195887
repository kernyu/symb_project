The Rv2416c gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) encodes the enhanced intracellular survival (Eis) protein that enhances intracellular survival of the pathogen in host macrophages during infection. The Mtb Eis protein is released into the cytoplasm of the phagocyte during intracellular infection and modulates the host immune response. It also contributes to drug resistance by acetylating multiple amine groups of aminoglycosides. Interestingly, the nonpathogenic M. smegmatis (Msm) contains a homologous eis gene (MSMEG_3513). The overall structures of Mtb Eis and Msm Eis are highly similar to each other, reflecting the high level (58%) of amino-acid sequence identity between them. Both Mtb Eis and Msm Eis are active as aminoglycoside acetyltransferases, while only Mtb Eis functions as an N()-acetyltransferase to acetylate Lys55 of dual-specificity protein phosphatase 16 (DUSP16)/mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 7 (MKP-7), leading to the suppression of host immune responses. Here, the crystal structure of Msm Eis in the paromomycin-bound form is reported, revealing detailed interactions between an aminoglycoside antibiotic and Msm Eis. The crystal structure of Msm Eis in the paromomycin-bound form has been determined at 3.3 A resolution. This work provides potentially useful information for structure-guided discovery of Eis inhibitors as a novel antituberculosis drug against drug-resistant Mtb.
