Escherichia coli is an important pathogen involved in community-acquired urinary tract infections (CA-UTIs). In this study, we analyzed the prevalence of frequently occurring genes and the distribution of integrons in 51 multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli isolates associated with CA-UTIs. The clonality of these strains was investigated by phylogrouping, multi-locus sequence typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All these strains were found to produce two or more resistance determinants, ceftazidime-hydrolyzing CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were the most prevalent (92.2% and 51.0%, respectively). A sulfhydryl variable-61-producing E. coli strain was identified for the first time in China. The prevalence of class 1 integrons was 54.9%, class 2 integrons were detected in three isolates but no isolate contained a class 3 integron. Phylogenetic group D was the dominant, observed in 70.6% of the isolates. PFGE analysis revealed a high level of diversity. Twenty-four distinctive sequence types (STs) including four major STs (ST648, ST224, ST38, and ST405) were identified. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the characterization of MDR E. coli isolates associated with CA-UTIs in China; our results suggest that an MDR D-ST648 clone producing CTX-M-ESBLs has emerged as a major clone in the community setting.
