We evaluated a three-step algorithm for laboratory diagnosis of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD). First, stool specimens were screened using an EIA test for glutamate dehydrogenase detection. Screen-positive specimens were tested by a rapid cytotoxintoxin A/B assay and subjected to stool culture. All cultures positive for C. difficile underwent toxigenic culture. The results showed that toxigenic culture allowed us to recover 37/156 (24.4%) stool samples harbouring toxigenic C. difficile that would have been missed by using faecal cytotoxin assay alone. This determined an increase in infection prevalence of 4.2% (from 11.4% to 15.6 %). Furthermore, to characterize the clinical Clostridium difficile isolates and the distribution of PCR ribotypes circulating in the San Carlo Borromeo hospital, molecular typing using semi-automated repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep- PCR) and PCR ribotyping, and an evaluation of the antibiotic resistance were also performed. Among them, 71 indistinguishable strains were detected by rep-PCR and 83 by PCR-ribotyping revealing C. difficile outbreaks in our hospital. A total of 6 different ribotypes were obtained by PCR ribotyping. The most frequent ribotype was 018 (88.2%) that also showed resistance to moxifloxacin. In one case, uncommon PCR ribotype 186 was also identified.
