Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the major pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia in children. The prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) is important owing to the limited alternative therapies for children. We analyzed 111 M. pneumoniae obtained from 107 children admitted for lower respiratory tract infection at Jeju National University Hospital between 2010 and 2015. Macrolide resistance of M. pneumoniae was searched for using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Of 107 clinical M. pneumoniae, 11 (10.3%) carried macrolide resistance mutations in the 23S rRNA gene. All macrolide resistance mutations were A2063G transitions. We found an acquired A2063G mutation of M. pneumoniae from a patient during macrolide treatment. Patients' characteristics and clinical severity did not differ between those with MRMP and macrolide-sensitive M. pneumoniae, with the exception of frequent pleural effusion in the MRMP group. The prevalence of MRMP (10.3%) in Jeju Island was relatively lower than those of surrounding countries in East Asia. Previous antimicrobial usage and timing of diagnostic test should be considered when determining of macrolide resistance of M. pneumoniae.
