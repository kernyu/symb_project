In this study, we describe the characterization of an infrequently encountered class A carbapenemase, IMI-1, from a clinical Enterobacter cloacae isolate. The isolate had high levels of resistance to carbapenems but retained susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. The blaIMI-1 gene was chromosomally encoded. Detection of the IMI-1 producer highlights the diversity of carbapenemases in a local clinical setting.
