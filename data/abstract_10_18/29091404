Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attractive antifungal drug candidates because they kill microbes via membrane disruption and are thus unlikely to provoke development of resistance. Low selectivity for fungal vs human cells and instability in physiological environments have limited the development of AMPs as therapeutics, but peptidomimetic AMPs can overcome these obstacles and also provide useful insight into AMP structure-function relationships. Here, we describe antifungal peptidomimetic alpha/beta-peptides templated on the natural alpha-peptidic AMP aurein 1.2. These alpha/beta-aurein analogs fold into i --> i + 4 H-bonded helices that present arrays of side chain functionality in a manner virtually identical to that of aurein 1.2. By varying charge, hydrophobicity, conformational stability, and alpha/beta-amino acid organization, we designed active and selective alpha/beta-peptide aurein analogs that exhibit minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans that are 4-fold lower than that of aurein 1.2 and elicit less than 5% hemolysis at the MIC. These alpha/beta-aurein analogs are promising candidates for development as antifungal therapeutics and as tools to elucidate mechanisms of AMP activity and specificity.
