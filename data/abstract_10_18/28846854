The HIV protease is an important drug target for HIV/AIDS therapy, and its structure and function have been extensively investigated. This enzyme performs an essential role in viral maturation by processing specific cleavage sites in the Gag and Gag-Pol precursor polyproteins so as to release their mature forms. This 99 amino acid aspartic protease works as a homodimer, with the active site localized in a central cavity capped by two flexible flap regions. The dimer presents closed or open conformations, which are involved in the substrate binding and release. Here the results of the analysis of a HIV-1 protease data set containing 552 dimer structures are reported. Different dimensionality reduction methods have been used in order to get information from this multidimensional database. Most of the structures in the data set belong to two conformational clusters. An interesting observation that comes from the analysis of these data is that some protease sequences are localized preferentially in specific areas of the conformational landscape of this protein.
