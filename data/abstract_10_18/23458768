The increase and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species, have become major concerns worldwide. Although the frequent misuse of antibiotic drugs has greatly contributed to worldwide antibiotic resistance by causing a large dispersal of resistance determinants, recent studies demonstrate that these resistance determinants could have emerged from ancient or environmental sources. Moreover, during the last 10 years, we have been witnessing the emergence and development of technologies for high-throughput sequencing, coinciding with an exponential increase in the number of bacterial genomes sequenced. These sequencing technologies allow a complete study of MDR bacterial genomes and are the best way to investigate the genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance. Accordingly, studies using genome sequencing to decipher resistance determinants in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species have demonstrated several advantages including, among others: an exhaustive identification of resistance determinants from any clinical, epidemiological or environmental MDR bacterium; identification of the acquisition mechanisms for resistance determinants exchanged between bacterial species through mobile genetic elements and elucidation and understanding, in record time (less than 1 week), of some critical or epidemic events caused by particular pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, it is clear today that the bacterial genome sequencing approach has revolutionized all fields of scientific research and represents a powerful tool to explore the world of microorganisms.
