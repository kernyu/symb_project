UNLABELLED: IMPORTANCE OF THE FILED: With the worldwide surge of MRSA, skin and skin-structure infection (SSTI) treatment has become a challenge for physicians. Cultures and antibiotic susceptibility tests for SSTIs are the rule due to the implication in morbidity and mortality rates associated with MRSA infections. The need for new antibiotics is evident and the effort to decrease antibiotic resistance is a world priority. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This manuscript accesses the actual treatments and the developing of antibiotics for MRSA SSTIs. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This is a review of the data on the available and emerging treatments for MRSA SSTIs. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: There is an unmet medical need for new antibiotics in the new millennium. As physicians, we must assure all appropriate procedures are completed in order to reduce the bacterial resistance, especially for MRSA.
