Stool specimens and data were obtained from 399 outpatients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) in order to estimate the colonization rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and to determine risk factors for VRE acquisition. The prevalence of VRE colonization in outpatients ranged from 0%-22.2%. Risk factors associated with VRE colonization were high hierarchy of hospital, short duration of HD, recent hospitalization, prior use of antimicrobial products, high platelet count, and low hemoglobin/albumin/blood urea nitrogen/creatinine levels, showing that VRE colonization was more common in patients with prior infections and poor nutritional status. Although pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed that most VRE isolates had diverse patterns, 2 paired cases from separate hospitals presented identical PFGE types.
