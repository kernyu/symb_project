Hospitals in Hong Kong, like many hospitals in the world, are constantly challenged by the increasing rate of non-susceptible and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Accurate and timely surveillance is essential for effective control. The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong has developed a comprehensive antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring system that utilises data obtained from all of its 38 hospitals. In this review, the susceptibility pattern of more than 320000 isolates covering the period 2009-2011 will be discussed. Special attention will be paid to MDROs.
