OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of Fufang Bingpeng irrigant and Bingpeng irrigant on four endodontic pathogen bacteria. METHODS: The agar dilution method was used to observe the antimicrobial activity of Fufang Bingpeng irrigant, Bingpeng irrigant against four selected endodontic pathogen bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Enterococcus faecalis). Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration was examined. RESULTS: Two irrigants had the antimicrobial activity against the anaerobic microorganisms. The antimicrobial efficacy of Fufang Bingpeng irrigant was better than that of Bingpeng irrigant. Compared with others, Enterococcus faecalis had the strongest resistance. CONCLUSION: Fufang Bingpeng irrigant has good antibacterial activity. As a root canal irrigant, Chinese medicine alteratives might be advantageous.
