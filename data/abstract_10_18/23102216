Antibiotic-producing microoganisms are a reservoir of drug resistance genes. Studies of the "antibiotic resistome" can inform antimicrobial drug discovery and explain the emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Westman and colleagues take an alternative look at the resistome and identify genes that could be used to detoxify the anticancer compound, doxorubicin.
