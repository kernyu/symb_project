BACKGROUND: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first detected in hospitals and one of the most common causes of nosocomial infections worldwide. There are reports that 50% of the infectious morbidity in intensive care units (ICUs) was due in part to MRSA. MRSA is also emerging in community. Community-associated MRSA is now the most common pathogen cultured from patients with skin and soft tissue infections in emergency departments. STUDY DESIGN: This study was conducted in otorhino-laryngology department of University of Benin Teaching Hospital, South-South region of Nigeria during the period July to September 2012. It was designed to provide baseline data on the emerging MRSA phenomena in surgical site infections. RESULTS: A total of one hundred and fifty nasal swabs were collected and processed using standard protocols. All the samples showed significant growth and ninety-six (64%) yielded Staphylococcus aureus. Forty-two percent of the S. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin and all the isolates showed resistance to the various classes of antimicrobial agents tested with the least against the aminoglycosides. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide baseline information to clinicians and healthcare workers on the implications of possible spread of multidrug resistant strains of the organisms.
