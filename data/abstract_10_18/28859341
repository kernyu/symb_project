Given the proliferation of cataclysmic predictions about antibiotic resistance, cases of which are estimated to amount to 12500 per year in France, we herein decided to compare the empirical clinical microbiology data from our institution with estimates and predictions from 10 major international scientific articles and reports. The analysis of 7 years of antibiotic resistance data from 10 bacterial species and genera of clinical interest from our institution identified no deaths that were directly attributable to extremely drug-resistant bacteria. By comparing our observations to the 10 articles and reports studied herein, we concluded that their results lack empirical data. Interventions are urgently needed to significantly reduce both mortality and the healthcare costs associated with bacterial infections, including the implementation of local and national laboratory data-based surveillance systems for the routine surveillance of antibiotic resistance that would be helpful for a better understanding of how to manage antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the future.
