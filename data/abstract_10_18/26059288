A fixed-dose tablet comprising ombitasvir (an NS5A replication complex inhibitor), paritaprevir (an NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and ritonavir (a cytochrome P450 inhibitor) taken in combination with dasabuvir (an NS5B polymerase inhibitor) is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection in several countries, including the USA (copackaged as Viekira Pak()) and those of the EU (Viekirax((R)) and Exviera((R))). In phase II and III trials, this interferon-free regimen, taken +/- ribavirin, provided high rates of sustained virological response 12 weeks post-treatment in adults with chronic HCV genotype 1a or 1b infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis, liver transplants or HIV-1 co-infection. The regimen was generally well tolerated, with nausea, insomnia, asthenia, pruritus, other skin reactions and fatigue being among the most common tolerability issues. Thus, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir is an effective interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral regimen for use +/- ribavirin in a broad range of adults chronically infected with HCV genotype 1.
