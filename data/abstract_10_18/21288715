The drug resistant bacteria pose a severe threat to human health. The increasing resistance of those pathogens to traditional antibacterial therapy renders the identification of new antibacterial agents with novel antibacterial mechanisms an urgent need. In this study, a series of (2S)-N-substituted-1-[(formyhydroxyamino)methyl]-1-oxohexyl]-2-oxazolidinecarboxa mides were designed, synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity. Most of these compounds displayed good activities against Gram-positive organisms comparable to reference agent LBM-415.
