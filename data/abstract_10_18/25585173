A stimuli-responsive, controlled release bilayer for the prevention of bacterial infection on biomaterials is presented. Drug release is locally controlled by the pH-responsiveness of the bilayer, comprised of an inner poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) monolayer grafted to a biomaterial and cross-linked with an outer chitosan (CH) brush. Tobramycin (TOB) is loaded in the inner PAA in part to minimize bacteria resistance. Because biofilm formation causes a decrease in local pH, TOB is released from PAA and permeates through the CH, which is in contact with the biofilm. Antibiotic capacity is controlled by the PAA thickness, which depends on PAA brush length and the extent of cross-linking between CH and PAA at the bilayer interface. This TOB-loaded, pH-responsive bilayer exhibits significantly enhanced antibacterial activity relative to controls.
