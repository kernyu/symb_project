INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) are associated with an increased sustained virologic response (SVR) and are the gold standard for treating HCV infection. AREAS COVERED: The new combination of grazoprevir, an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A, and elbasvir, an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, once daily will be available for the treatment of HCV infection. This combination therapy has a high efficacy in HCV genotype 1 and 4 infections, inducing a SVR up to 95%, even in difficult to treat patients such as cirrhotic, HIV co-infected, or dialysis-dependent patients, and patients with stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease or those who failed previous therapy. The safety of grazoprevir combined with elbasvir is very good and without significant adverse effects in phase 2 or 3 studies. For patients who failed prior DAA therapy, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the grazoprevir and elbasvir combination is fully active against resistance to NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Resistance to NS5B inhibitors is least susceptible to grazoprevir or elbasvir. EXPERT OPINION: This new combination of gazoprevir with elbasvir offers an opportunity to cure HCV infection with short interferon-free therapy, even in difficult to treat patients.
