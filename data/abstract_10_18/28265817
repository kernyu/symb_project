Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an emerging nosocomial pathogen associated with high mortality and inherently resistant to many antimicrobial agents. Levofloxacin has been considered as a therapeutic agent based on in vitro susceptibility. We aim to investigate the risk factors and outcomes for levofloxacin-resistant E. meningoseptica bacteraemia. Adult patients with E. meningoseptica bacteraemia were identified retrospectively in a medical centre in Taiwan from January 2011 to July 2015. These strains were identified by the Vitek2 automated system or matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We compared clinical features and outcomes of patients with levofloxacin-resistant (MIC >2 mug/mL) and levofloxacin-susceptible (MIC </=2 mug/mL) E. meningoseptica bacteraemia. A total of 93 patients were identified, including 51 (54.8%) with levofloxacin-resistant E. meningoseptica bacteraemia. The APACHE II score (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14; p = 0.008) was the only independent risk factor for levofloxacin-resistant E. meningoseptica bacteraemia. The 14-day mortality for patients with levofloxacin-resistant E. meningoseptica bacteraemia (attributable mortality: 30.7%) was significantly higher than that for patients with the levofloxacin-susceptible strain (56.9% versus 26.2%, p = 0.003). In the multivariate analysis of risk factors for mortality, appropriate definite antibiotic use was the only factor associated with 14-day survival (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.55, p = 0.007). The levofloxacin-resistant strain was borderline significantly associated with mortality (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 0.88-10.91, p = 0.079). The early identification of levofloxacin resistance in E. meningoseptica isolates is important to tackle this multi-drug resistance pathogen.
