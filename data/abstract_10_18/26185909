BACKGROUND: In a randomized controlled trial, thalidomide has shown to be effective in refractory Crohn's disease in children. This pilot study aimed at evaluating thalidomide in refractory pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial on thalidomide 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg/day in children with active UC despite multiple immunosuppressive treatments. In an open-label extension, nonresponders to placebo received thalidomide for an additional 8 weeks; all responders were followed up for a minimum of 52 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-six children with refractory UC were randomized to thalidomide or placebo. Clinical remission at week 8 was achieved by significantly more children treated with thalidomide {10/12 (83.3%) versus 2/11 (18.8%); risk ratio, 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-16.4); P = 0.005; number needed to treat, 1.5}. Of the nonresponders to placebo who were switched to thalidomide, 8 of 11 (72.7%) subsequently reached remission at week 8 (risk ratio, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.1-14.7]; number needed to treat, 2.45; P = 0.01). Clinical remission in the thalidomide group was 135.0 weeks (95% CI, 32-238), compared with 8.0 weeks (95% CI, 2.4-13.6) in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Cumulative incidence of severe adverse events was 3.1 per 1000 patient-weeks. Peripheral neuropathy and amenorrhea were the most frequent adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot randomized controlled trial on cases of UC refractory to immunosuppressive therapy, thalidomide compared with placebo resulted in improved clinical remission at 8 weeks of treatment and in longer term maintenance of remission. These findings require replication in larger clinical studies evaluating both thalidomide efficacy and safety.
