Tolerance is a poorly understood phenomenon that allows bacteria exposed to a bactericidal antibiotic to stop their growth and withstand drug-induced killing. This survival ability has been implicated in antibiotic treatment failures. Here, we describe a single nucleotide mutation (tol1) in a tolerant Streptococcus gordonii strain (Tol1) that is sufficient to provide tolerance in vitro and in vivo. It induces a proline-to-arginine substitution (P483R) in the homodimerization interface of enzyme I of the sugar phosphotransferase system, resulting in diminished sugar uptake. In vitro, the susceptible wild-type (WT) and Tol1 cultures lost 4.5 and 0.6 log(10) CFU/ml, respectively, after 24 h of penicillin exposure. The introduction of tol1 into the WT (WT P483R) conferred tolerance (a loss of 0.7 log(10) CFU/ml/24 h), whereas restitution of the parent sequence in Tol1 (Tol1 R483P) restored antibiotic susceptibility. Moreover, penicillin treatment of rats in an experimental model of endocarditis showed a complete inversion in the outcome, with a failure of therapy in rats infected with WT P483R and the complete disappearance of bacteria in animals infected with Tol1 R483P.
