To evaluate the effect of ursolic acid on metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 24 patients (30-60 years) with a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome without treatment. They were randomly assigned to two groups of 12 patients, each to receive orally 150 mg of ursolic acid or homologated placebo once a day for 12 weeks. Before and after the intervention, the components of metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), and inflammation profile (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein) were evaluated. After ursolic acid administration, the remission of metabolic syndrome occurred in 50% of patients (P = .005) with significant differences in body weight (75.7 +/- 11.5 vs. 71 +/- 11 kg, P = .002), body mass index (BMI) (29.9 + 3.6 vs. 24.9 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2), P = .049), waist circumference (93 +/- 8.9 vs. 83 + 8.6 cm, P = .008), fasting glucose (6.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/L, P = .002), and insulin sensitivity (3.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 4.2 +/- 1.2, P = .003). Ursolic acid administration leads to transient remission of metabolic syndrome, reducing body weight, BMI, waist circumference and fasting glucose, as well as increasing insulin sensitivity.
