INTRODUCTION: In 2015, 4 new drugs were approved for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who experience drug resistance and relapsing disease, offering potential for improved patient outcomes. Given the mortality, morbidity, and projected rise in the incidence of multiple myeloma, more effective, novel therapies and treatment combinations are needed for patients at each stage of the disease. AREAS COVERED: Here, the authors examine published data regarding the development and clinical investigation of elotuzumab, a SLAMF7-targeted monoclonal antibody, for treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. The clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of elotuzumab treatment are summarized. EXPERT OPINION: Elotuzumab, a first-in-class immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody, is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received 1-3 prior therapies. Elotuzumab has the potential for use in patients in the upfront setting, in combination with other backbone regimens, as well as maintenance therapy. Trials demonstrate clinical benefit of adding elotuzumab to conventional lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy, without additive toxicity. Data suggest that elotuzumab may provide clinical benefit in combination with proteasome inhibitors. Elotuzumab combination therapy is currently under further evaluation in the relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed settings.
