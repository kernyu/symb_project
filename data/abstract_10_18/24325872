Of 75 MDR isolates from Fujian Province, the sensitivity of RIF, INH, EMB, SM, OFLX and KAN resistance by DNA sequencing was 96.0%, 96.0%, 66.7%, 66.0%, 84.2% and 75.0%, respectively. We also identified that minority mutations in the mixed Mycobacterium tuberculosis population may be responsible for two "false-negative" results. In addition, Beijing genotype is still the predominant sublineage in the MDR TB cases from Fujian.
