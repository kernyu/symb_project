The molecular diversity, antibiotic resistance patterns and presence of resistance genes were determined in Staphylococcus aureus isolates from cases of bovine mastitis in a dairy cattle herd in China. Multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis was used for molecular typing. Resistance was determined through minimum inhibitory concentrations and resistance genes were detected by PCR. There was low molecular diversity; one predominant strain (type I) accounted for the majority of cases of S. aureus mastitis in the herd and this strain had a high frequency of resistance to penicillin and tetracycline. The most prevalent resistance genes were blaZ, ermC and tetM.
