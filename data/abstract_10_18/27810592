Currently, three HIV-1 integrase (IN) active site-directed inhibitors are in clinical use for the treatment of HIV infection. However, emergence of drug resistance mutations have limited the promise of a long-term cure. As an alternative, allosteric inhibition of IN activity has drawn great attention and several of such inhibitors are under early stage clinical development. Specifically, inhibitors of IN and the cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75 remarkably diminish proviral integration in cells and deliver a potent reduction in viral replicative capacity. Distinct from the extensively studied 2-(quinolin-3-yl) acetic acid or 1H-indol-3-yl-2-hydroxy-4-oxobut-2-enoic acid chemotypes, this study discloses a new class of selective IN-LEDGF/p75 inhibitors without the carboxylic acid functionality. More significantly, 3-hydroxypicolinamides also show low micromolar inhibition against IN dimerization, providing novel dual IN inhibitors with in vitro therapeutically selective antiviral effect for further development. Finally, our shape-based ROCS pharmacophore model of the 3-hydroxypicolinamide class of compounds provides a new insight into the binding mode of these novel IN-LEDGF/p75 inhibitors.
