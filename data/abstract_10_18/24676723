Bacteriocin B231 produced by Lactobacillus pentosus, isolated from an artisanal raw cow's milk protected designation of origin Portuguese cheese, is a small protein with an apparent relative mass of about 5 kDa and active against a large number of Listeria monocytogenes wild-type strains, Listeria ivanovii and Listeria innocua. Bacteriocin B231 production is highly dependent on the type of the culture media used for growth of Lact. pentosus B231. Replacement of glucose with maltose yielded the highest bacteriocin production from eight different carbon sources. Similar results were recorded in the presence of combination of glucose and maltose or galactose. Production of bacteriocin B231 reached maximal levels of 800 AU/ml during the stationary phase of growth of Lact. pentosus B231 in MRS broth at 30 degrees C. Bacteriocin B231 (in cell-free supernatant) was sensitive to treatment with trypsin and proteinase K, but not affected by the thermal treatment in range of 55-121 degrees C, or freezing (-20 degrees C). Bacteriocin production and inhibitory spectrum were evaluated. Gene encoding plantaricin S has been detected in the genomic DNA. Virulence potential and safety of Lact. pentosus B231 were assessed by PCR targeted the genes gelE, hyl, asa1, esp, cylA, efaA, ace, vanA, vanB, hdc1, hdc2, tdc and odc. The Lact. pentosus B231 strains harbored plantaricin S gene, while the occurrence of virulence, antibiotic resistance and biogenic amine genes was limited to cytolysin, hyaluronidase, aggregation substance, adhesion of collagen protein, gelatinase, tyrosine decarboxylase and vancomycin B genes.
