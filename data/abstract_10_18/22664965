We investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants and examined the association of these determinants with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and/or plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (pAmpCs) in Serratia marcescens isolates in China. In this study, the presence of PMQR determinants was significantly related to the coproduction of ESBLs and/or pAmpCs (CTX-M-14, SHV-5, DHA-1, and ACT-1), among which CTX-M-14 was the most common gene type.
