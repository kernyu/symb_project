BACKGROUND: Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) fruit are susceptible to fungal decay during postharvest storage at ambient temperature. The control of postharvest diseases of loquat is based primarily on the use of synthetic fungicides. To look for an alternative method for disease control, we investigated the effect of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on controlling anthracnose rot caused by Colletotrichum acutatum of loquat fruit. RESULTS: 1-MCP treatment significantly reduced decay incidence of loquat fruit. The treatment markedly inhibited accumulation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide and maintained higher superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase. Meanwhile, 1-MCP treatment induced higher activities of two defense-related enzymes-chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase-during 6 days' storage. Furthermore, the treatment inhibited increases in fruit firmness and internal browning index, and maintained higher extractable juice rate, total soluble solids and titratable acidity contents, thereby delaying the development of senescence. CONCLUSION: 1-MCP was effective in reducing decay and might have enhanced the disease resistance in loquat fruit by increasing chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase, and maintained natural resistance by delaying senescence development.
