Millions of deaths occur every year due to malaria. Growing resistance against existing drugs for treatment of malaria has exaggerated the problem further. There is an intense demand of identifying drug targets in malaria parasite. PfPRL-PTP protein is PRL group of phosphatase, and one of the interesting drug targets being involved in three important pathways of malaria parasite (secretion, phosphorylation, and prenylation). Therefore, in this study, we have modeled three-dimensional structure of PfPRL-PTP followed by validation of 3D structure using RAMPAGE, verify3D, and other structure validation tools. We could identify 12 potential inhibitory compounds using in silico screening of NCI library against PfPRL-PTP with Glide. The molecular dynamics simulation was also performed using GROMACS on PfPRL-PTP model alone and PfPRL-PTP-inhibitor complex. This study of identifying potential drug-like molecules would add up to the process of drug discovery against malaria parasite.
