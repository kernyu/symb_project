To assess 8-year antibiotic consumption and expenditure in all of the hospitals of Emilia Romagna. The analysis was based on the pharmacy records of each hospital. Antibiotic drug consumption was expressed as DDDs per 100 bed-days used (BDU) and data were analyzed according to ATC classification and to single wards. Expenditure was expressed as Euros per 100 BDU. In the 8-years considered, overall consumption increased by 27% and expenditure by only 3%. Consumption was higher in surgical wards than in medical ones. Penicillins and beta-lactamase inhibitors ranked first, followed by fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins. The results of the study strongly suggest that antibiotic use could be improved by educational interventions to improve clinical practice in hospitals, assessments of guidelines and monitoring of the outcomes of the interventions are needed.
