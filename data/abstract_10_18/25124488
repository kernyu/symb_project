The marketing authorization of a new medicinal product is the first step before being placed on the market, and includes the full investigation programme. In order to ensure their quality, safety and efficacy, medicinal products are closely regulated from their initial phases of investigation to their use in clinical practice. For registration purposes, the results of all the clinical and preclinical studies, along with quality data and the description of the manufacturing process should be submitted. All information collected is presented for review by the competent authority. The European Medicines Agency regulates the registration of medicines in Europe, and national agencies in each EU member state are responsible for the assessment of the marketing authorisation application. To facilitate the development of clinical programmes, there is a common framework for the evaluation of an antibacterial, which includes guidelines and an addendum, detailing the specific requirements that must be carried out in clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety for most of the infections.
