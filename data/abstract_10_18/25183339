OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation, underlying diseases, antimicrobial susceptibility, treatment and outcome of Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis patients. METHODS: This retrospective study involved all patients with 15 years of age or older who admitted to Hamad General Hospital with culture proven Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012. RESULTS: A total of ten cases were identified (nine males and one female). Their mean age was (43.3+/-12.8) years. Eight patients (80%) had nosocomial meningitis with neurosurgery being the most frequent associated condition. Fever and altered consciousness were the most frequent symptom. Cerebrospinal fluid showed elevated protein and glucose levels. Gram stain showed Gram-negative rods in 50% of cases, while positive cerebrospinal fluid culture results were found in all patients. Multidrug resistance was observed in two cases, and all patients had received appropriate empirical and definitive antibiotic treatments. The mean duration of intravenous antimicrobial treatment was (19.3+/-7.0) d and all patients with external ventricular drains underwent removal of the device, while in-hospital mortality was 50%. CONCLUSIONS: The number of cases was too small to come up with therapeutic and prognostic conclusions. Further large-scale prospective study is needed.
