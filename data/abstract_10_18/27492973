PURPOSE: Leukemia stem cells (LSC), which are insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), are an important source of TKI resistance and disease relapse in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Obstacles to eradicating LSCs include limited understanding of the regulation network of LSCs. The current study aimed to examine the interplay between NF-kappaB and FOXM1/beta-catenin, and the effect of its chemical intervention on CML LSCs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The interplay between NF-kappaB and FOXM1/beta-catenin was analyzed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in CML cells. The effect of disturbing NF-kappaB and FOXM1/beta-catenin by niclosamide on the self-renewal capacity and survival of LSCs was evaluated in vitro in human primary CML CD34(+) cells and in vivo in CML mice. RESULTS: Reciprocal co-IP experiments showed physical interaction of p65 and FOXM1. p65 promoted transcription of FOXM1 gene. ChIP assay revealed recruitment of p65 on the promoter of FOXM1 gene. Conversely, FOXM1 and beta-catenin positively regulated the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB in CML cells. Niclosamide disrupted the positive feedback loop between NF-kappaB and FOXM1/beta-catenin, thereby impairing the self-renewal capacity and survival of CML LSCs. Niclosamide decreased the long-term engraftment of human CML LSCs in NOD-SCID IL2Rgamma chain-deficient (NOG) mice, and prolonged the survival of CML mice. CONCLUSIONS: Interaction of p65 with FOXM1/beta-catenin is critical in CML and its disruption by niclosamide eradicates LSCs. These findings may improve the understanding of a self-renewal regulatory mechanism of LSCs and offer a rationale-based approach to eliminate LSCs in CML. Clin Cancer Res; 23(3); 789-803.
