Although tigecycline is considered one of the few therapeutic options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) bacteraemia, its role in the treatment of CRAB bacteraemia remains unclear. We describe the clinical outcomes of 9 patients who received tigecycline for CRAB bacteraemia. Although all CRAB blood isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, 5 (56%) deaths were related to CRAB bacteraemia and 1 case of breakthrough CRAB bacteraemia was observed during tigecycline therapy. Clinical outcomes of tigecycline therapy may be poor in patients with tigecycline-susceptible CRAB bacteraemia, although multiple factors including delayed treatment could contribute to the poor outcomes.
