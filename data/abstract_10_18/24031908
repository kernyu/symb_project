The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage among dialysis and kidney transplant patients, to identify the antimicrobial resistance profile of these strains and to verify their genetic profiles with the RW3A primer. The study included 159 individuals, comprising 111 dialysis and 48 kidney transplant patients. Of the 48 transplant patients, 75% were positive for S. aureus, whereas 49% of the 111 dialysis patients were carriers. Two samples yielded conflicting results for oxacillin sensitivity between the disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays: both were sensitive by the disk diffusion assay and resistant by MIC (4 mug/ml). In the antibiogram by disk diffusion, ten samples were resistant to cefoxitin, among which eight were also resistant to oxacillin. The resistance of the ten samples to cefoxitin by the disk diffusion assay was confirmed by MIC. Of the ten oxacillin-resistant samples, eight harbored the mecA gene. All samples were sensitive to vancomycin, and most were resistant to penicillin and demonstrated high rates of resistance to the other antimicrobials tested. The samples from dialysis patients exhibited a more homogenous genetic profile. Among the samples with a high percent similarity, no correlation with sensitivity or resistance to oxacillin was observed. According to the results of this study, the implementation of prevention and control measures, such as increased restrictions on prescriptions for antimicrobial drugs and nasal decontamination prior to high-risk procedures, is recommended.
