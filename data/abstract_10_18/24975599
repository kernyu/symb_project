Novel cationic molecules based on rigid terephthalamide-bisurea cores flanked by imidazolium moieties are described. In aqueous media, these compounds self-assemble into supramolecular nanostructures with distinct morphologies. The compound with optimal hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance displays potent antimicrobial activity and high selectivity towards clinically-isolated MRSA without inducing drug-resistance. These self-assembled cationic antimicrobial nanostructures show promise for the prevention and treatment of multidrug-resistant infections.
