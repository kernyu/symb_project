Acne vulgaris is one of the most prevalent skin conditions. Antibiotics, when considered, are most effective in combination with other therapies, and limited evidence suggests that submicrobial doses of antibiotics may improve acne without increasing the risk for antibiotic resistance. A small but significant risk for inflammatory bowel disease has also been identified in children treated with multiple courses of antibiotics. New topical agents are expanding therapeutic options for acne. Semin Cutan Med Surg 35(supp6):S114-S116.
