Improved understanding of basic mycological, pharmacological, and immunological processes has led to important advances in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. However, the rise of fungi that are resistant to existing antifungal agents poses a substantial threat to human health. Addressing this expanding problem is an urgent priority for the international research community. In this article, we highlight important diagnostic and therapeutic advances that address the rise of resistant fungi as well as new public health initiatives that warrant further investigation to help curb the spread of these potentially lethal organisms.
