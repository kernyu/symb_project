We recently described a novel staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element, designated type VIII. We report here a multiplex PCR assay, capable of identifying SCCmec type VIII. This assay will facilitate identification of this new SCCmec type and provides a useful tool for clinical and epidemiologic studies in this regard.
