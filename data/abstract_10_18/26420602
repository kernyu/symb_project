OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility of 77 mould strains: Aspergillus fumigatus (20), Aspergillus flavus (8), Aspergillus niger (4), Aspergillus ochraceus (2), Penicillium citrinum (15), Penicillium crysogenum (14), Penicillium aurantiogriseum (1), Penicillium roquefortii (4), Penicillium paneum (2), Rhizopus spp. (3), Tricoderma spp. (1) and Mucor spp. (3) to biocides. METHODS: MIC determination was determined based on CLSI methodology. RESULTS: For hospital acquired strains, MIC50 was 0.5mg/L, MIC90 was 1mg/L for chlorhexidine (CHX); MIC50 was 0.5mg/L, and MIC90 was 1mg/L for benzalkonium chloride (BZC); MIC50 was 1mg/L, and MIC90 was 2mg/L for triclosan (TRC); MIC50 was 1024mg/L, and MIC90 was 2048mg/L for sodium hypochloride (SHC). For feed and food isolates MIC50 was 2mg/L, MIC90 was 8mg/L for CHX, MIC50 was 2mg/L, and MIC90 was 4mg/L for BZC, MIC50 was 2mg/L, and MIC90 was 4mg/L for TRC, MIC50 was 256mg/L, and MIC90 was 512mg/L for SHC. CONCLUSION: We can conclude that food isolates presented slightly higher MIC50 and MIC90 values for CHX, BNZ and TRC, but not for SHC.
