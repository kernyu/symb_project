The Enterobacteriaceae is a large family of Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, non-spore forming rod-shaped bacteria that includes harmless and pathogenic organisms. The emergence and development of drug resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is complicating the treatment of serious infections. The aim of this study is to predict and characterize putative drug targets in Enterobacteriaceae family employing a homology-based computational method. The final putative drug targets were qualitatively characterized via cellular function prediction, subcellular localization prediction, broad-spectrum, and druggability analyses. Of 6,327 analyzed proteins, 35 proteins were selected as final putative drug targets in Enterobacteriaceae family. These putative drug targets were involved in different vital pathways like metabolism, biosynthesis of macromolecule, and cell division. Predicted drug targets were also localized in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic membrane of the pathogen that acts as antimicrobial or vaccine targets. Of 35 drug targets, 5 targets were druggable and 30 targets were not druggable and were predicted as novel drug targets, which should be further evaluated to develop new antimicrobial. Thirteen drug targets were considered as broad-spectrum targets. It is expected that results of our study could facilitate the production of novel antibacterial for efficient treatment of infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae pathogens.
