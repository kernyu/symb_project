A total of 473 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp. and Providencia spp., were isolated from patients admitted to intensive care units and surgical units in Russia. About 90% of the isolates carried factors resistant to beta-lactams. The isolation rates of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producer defined in this study among E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. were 45%, 48% and 17%, respectively. In the settings with high prevalence of the ESBL producer, flomoxef, which belongs to the oxacephem subgroup, and carbapenems retain their activity. The MIC(5)(0) of flomoxef, meropenem and imipenem against total isolates were 1 microg/mL, </= 0.063 microg/mL and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Fifty-five carbapenem-resistant strains were isolated in this study. The carbapenem resistant rates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. were 3%, 16% and 29%, respectively
