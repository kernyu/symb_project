BACKGROUND: Literature on the efficacy of phototherapy in steroid-dependent antihistamine-refractory chronic urticaria (CRU) is limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare the efficacy of psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) in steroid-dependent CRU. METHODS: In this randomized, prospective observer-blinded comparative study, 50 patients with steroid-dependent CRU (6 months of spontaneous urticaria with no response after 3 consecutive months of antihistamines and steroid dependence) were administered either PUVA (group A) or NB-UVB (group B) for 90 days, with a post-treatment follow-up of 90 days. The treatment efficacy was assessed using the average urticaria activity score 7 (aUAS7) and outcome scoring scale (OSS) every 2 weeks. RESULTS: The mean values of aUAS7 progressively decreased from 4.9 +/- 0.8 and 5.0 +/- 0.7 at baseline to 1.9 +/- 0.7 and 1.4 +/- 0.7 in groups A and B, respectively, by day 90. This further decreased to 1.5 +/- 0.8 and 1.4 +/- 1.0 at day 180 in both groups. The values of OSS progressively increased from baseline (1.6 +/- 0.5 in group A and 1.3 +/- 0.5 in group B) to 3.9 +/- 0.3 and 4.0 +/- 0.3 in groups A and B, respectively, by day 90, and 3.9 +/- 0.5 and 4.0 +/- 0.6 by day 180. NB-UVB fared statistically better than PUVA at different time points. Adverse events encountered were minimal and did not warrant treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Phototherapy, especially NB-UVB, is an effective, safe and affordable therapeutic modality for steroid-dependent CRU and should be tried prior to third-line treatment options such as omalizumab, ciclosporin and other immunosuppressants.
