BACKGROUND: In aesthetic breast augmentation, especially by the transareolar approach, there is increasing concern regarding the occurrence of capsular contracture and its potential correlation with intraoperative implant contamination from putative endogenous breast flora of the nipple and lactiferous ducts. However, detectable bacteria cannot be considered synonymous with established resident microflora. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to elucidate the existence of endogenous breast flora and assess the microbiologic safety of transareolar breast augmentation. METHODS: In this prospective study (BREAST-MF), the authors collected microbiologic samples from the breast skin, ductal tissue, and parenchyma of 39 consecutive female patients who underwent breast procedures in a plastic surgery clinic. Swabs collected pre-, intra-, and postoperatively were processed for bacterial and fungal growth. Positive cultures underwent identification through VITEK and MALDI-TOF, as well as antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Staphylococcus species accounted for 95 of 106 (89.6%) positive results from native breast skin, 15 of 18 (83.3%) positive results from decontaminated breast skin, and 4 of 4 (100%) positive results from the breast parenchyma. Methicillin resistance was present in 26.4% of S. epidermidis, 25.3% of S. hominis, and 71.4% of S. haemolyticus strains. CONCLUSIONS: During transareolar breast augmentation, in the nipple-areola region it is more likely to find bacteria populating the skin, rather than endogenous breast flora, as previously considered. Appropriate preoperative decontamination is essential for minimizing the risk of postoperative infections. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 3: Risk.
