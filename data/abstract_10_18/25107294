High-dose daptomycin (DAP) therapy failed in a neutropenic patient with bloodstream infection caused by a DAP-susceptible Enterococcus faecium (minimum inhibitory concentration, 3 microg/mL) harboring genetic changes associated with DAP resistance, with persistent bacteremia and selection of additional resistances. Daptomycin monotherapy should be used cautiously against DAP-susceptible E. faecium strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations >2 microg/mL.
