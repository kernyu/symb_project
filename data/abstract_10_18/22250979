HIV/tuberculosis (HIV/TB)-coinfected patients intolerant/resistant to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have limited treatment options. We evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK)/safety/efficacy of an adjusted dose of indinavir/ritonavir (IDV/r) 600/100 mg plus two NRTIs in HIV/TB-coinfected Thais receiving rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment. This was a prospective, open-label study. Eighteen Thai, HIV/TB-coinfected patients between 18 and 60 years were recruited. IDV/r 600 mg/100 mg plus lamivudine and stavudine were administered every 12 h (bid). When rifampicin was stopped, IDV/r was reduced to 400/100 mg BID. Clinical outcomes, adverse events, and concomitant drugs were intensively collected. Intensive 12-h PK was performed after 2 weeks of IDV/r while on rifampicin. Samples were collected: predosing and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after drug intake. The median body weight was 55 kg. The median CD4 was 26 cells/mul. The median HIV RNA was 5.05 log(10) copies/ml. Then 15/18 underwent intensive PK at week 2. The median time between initiating rifampicin and IDV/r was 4.5 months. The median duration of rifampicin during study (rifampicin/IDV/r together) was 15.6 weeks. All received a total of 9 months of antituberculous drugs. The geometric means (GM) of indinavir AUC(0-12) and C(12) were 8.11 mg*h/liter and 0.03 mg/liter, respectively. After stopping rifampicin and reducing IDV/r to 400/100 bid, the GM indinavir C(12) increased to 0.68 mg/liter (p=0.004). In all, 8/18 (44%) had asymptomatic ALT elevation and 2/18 (11%) had symptomatic hepatotoxicity requiring IDV/r discontinuation. All 13 patients who remained on IDV/r treatment had HIV RNA <50 copies/ml at 48 weeks. Concomitant use of rifampicin and IDV/r resulted in subtherapeutic indinavir concentrations. Although 44% of them developed asymptomatic Grade 3/4 transaminitis, the rate of study drug discontinuation due to hepatotoxicity was low. Despite good virological outcome in our cohort, prolonged exposure to subtherapeutic indinavir concentrations may lead to treatment failure.
