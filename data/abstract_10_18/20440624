The only drug available for treating schistosomiasis is praziquantel, however there are already reports of resistance to its use in treatment, making it necessary to search and develop new compounds to combat schistosomiasis. We tested, in vitro, two new products, Laboratorio de Planejamento de Sintese de Farmacos (LPSF)/5-(4-chloro-benzylidene-3-(4-nitrebenzyl)-4-thioxo-imidazolidin-2-one (RZS-2) and LPSF/5-(4-fluoride-benzylidene-3-(4-nitrebenzyl)-4-thioxo-imidazolidin-2-one (RZS-5) imidazolidines, against adult worms of Schistosoma mansoni. Efficacy and safety of these compounds were analyzed through IC50 cytotoxicity, immune response and cell viability tests. At different concentrations ranging from 40-640 microM, the imidazolidines produced motor abnormalities, inhibition of pairing and oviposition and mortality within 24 h at the higher concentrations. Although not triggering changes in IFN-gamma and IL-10, LPSF/RZS-2 and LPSF/RZS-5 induced production of nitric oxide and showed similar behavior to praziquantel in the cell death test.
