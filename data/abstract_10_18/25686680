OBJECTIVE: HIV-infected participants are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a significant predictor of CVD in the general population and is associated with mortality in HIV. DESIGN AND METHODS: The 96-week Stopping Atherosclerosis and Treating Unhealthy Bone with Rosuvastatin in HIV (SATURN-HIV) trial randomized 147 patients on stable antiretroviral therapy with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level lower than 130 mg/dl and without overt heart failure to 10 mg daily rosuvastatin or placebo. We measured NT-proBNP levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Baseline and changes in NT-proBNP were compared between groups. Spearman correlation was used to explore relationships between baseline NT-proBNP, inflammation, and CVD risk markers. Multivariable analyses were conducted to assess associations with NT-proBNP levels. RESULTS: Median age was 46 years, 80% were men, 69% were African American, and 46% were on protease inhibitors. At baseline, median (Q1, Q3) NT-proBNP was higher in the rosuvastatin group than placebo [41 (20, 66.5) versus 25 pg/ml (11, 56), P = 0.012)]. Baseline NT-proBNP correlated with bulb and common carotid artery intima-media thickness, coronary calcium score, interleukin 6, and cystatin C. After 96 weeks, median NT-proBNP decreased significantly in the rosuvastatin group versus placebo (-1.50 versus +4.50 pg/ml, P = 0.041). Within the rosuvastatin group, changes in NT-proBNP were negatively correlated with changes in insulin resistance and total limb fat. CONCLUSION: Rosuvastatin reduces plasma NT-proBNP in HIV-infected participants on antiretroviral therapy. NT-proBNP correlated with several measures of CVD risk, independent of inflammation markers.
