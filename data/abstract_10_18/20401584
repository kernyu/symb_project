The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is an increasingly serious problem world-wide. In addition, to phenotypically resistant bacteria, a threat may also be posed by isolates with silent, but intact, antibiotic resistance genes. Such isolates, which have recently been described, possess wild-type genes that are not expressed, but may convert to resistance by activating expression of the silent genes. They may therefore compromise the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment, particularly if their presence has not been diagnosed. This chapter describes the detection of silent resistance genes by PCR and DNA sequencing. A method to detect five potentially silent acquired resistance genes; aadA, bla (OXA-2), strAB, sul1, and tet(A) is described. First, the susceptibility of the isolates to the relevant antibiotics is determined by an appropriate susceptibility testing method, such as E-test. Then the presence of the genes is investigated by PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplification products. If a resistance gene is detected in a susceptible isolate, the entire open-reading frame and promoter sequence of the gene is amplified by PCR and their DNA sequences obtained. The DNA sequences are then compared to those of known resistant isolates, to detect mutations that may account for susceptibility. If no mutations are detected the expression of the gene is investigated by RT-PCR following RNA extraction. The methods described here can be applied to all acquired resistance genes for which sequence and normal expression data are available.
