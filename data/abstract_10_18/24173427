This study was conducted to analyse the presence of a plasmid-mediated carbapenem resistance mechanism in a clinical Enterobacter aerogenes isolate from a patient from Jiangsu province, People's Republic of China. PCR and sequencing confirmed that the isolate harboured Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2, DHA-1 and TEM-1 beta-lactamase genes. Both the KPC-2 and DHA-1 genes were transferred to Escherichia coli C600 by transconjugation, and Southern blotting confirmed that these two genes were located on the same plasmid, which was of approximately 56 kb in size. The Enterobacter aerogenes isolate was resistant to carbapenems and other tested antimicrobial agents. The Escherichia coli transconjugant showed reduced susceptibility but not resistance to carbapenems and other beta-lactams, indicating the presence of another, possibly permeability-related, resistance mechanism in the clinical isolate.
