Plant virus diseases have seriously damaged global food security. However, current antiviral agents are not efficient enough for the requirement of agriculture production. So, developing new efficient and nontoxic antiviral agents is imperative. GP-1, from Streptomyces kanasensis ZX01, is a new antiviral glycoprotein, of which the antiviral activity and the mode of action against Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were investigated in this study. The results showed that GP-1 could fracture TMV particles, and the infection and accumulation of TMV in host plants were inhibited. Moreover, GP-1 could induce systematic resistance against TMV in the host, according to the results of activities of defensive enzymes increasing, MDA decreasing and overexpression of pathogenesis-related proteins. Furthermore, GP-1 could promote growth of the host plant. In conclusion, GP-1 showed the ability to be developed as an efficient antiviral agent and a fertilizer for agriculture.
