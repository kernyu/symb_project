AIM: To investigate the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility profiles of yeast isolates causing invasive infections across Beijing. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 1201 yeast isolates recovered from blood and other sterile body fluids were correctly identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization TOF MS supplemented by DNA sequencing. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Candida (95.5%) remained the most common yeast species isolated; Candida albicans (38.8%) and Candida parapsilosis (22.6%) were the leading species of candidemia. Azole resistances were mainly observed in Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis isolates. CONCLUSION: This study outlined the epidemiologic data of invasive yeast infections and highlighted the need for continuous monitoring of azole resistances among C. glabrata and C. tropicalis isolates in Beijing.
