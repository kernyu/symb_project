OBJECTIVES: Increasing use of improved culture techniques and sensitive nucleic acid amplification assays have resulted in recognition of Kingella kingae as an important cause of invasive infections in young children, especially in septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, bacteraemia, and endocarditis. In 2016, EUCAST established clinical MIC breakpoints for K. kingae (published in EUCAST Clinical Breakpoint Tables v 7.0, 2017). The present study was carried out to produce MIC-zone diameter correlations for K. kingae on an international collection of isolates, with the aim of suggesting zone diameter breakpoints corresponding to the clinical MIC breakpoints. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for 18 clinically relevant agents on a collection of 159 clinical isolates of K. kingae. Broth microdilution MIC determination and disk diffusion were performed according to EUCAST recommendations for fastidious organisms. RESULTS: The correlation between MICs and zone diameters was good for all agents with EUCAST breakpoints for K. kingae. beta-lactamase was detected in 41 isolates (26%) and these isolates were resistant to aminopenicillins. These isolates were also resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to tetracyclines was detected in 8% of all isolates. All resistant isolates were correctly categorized for these agents with the proposed zone diameter breakpoints. One isolate, resistant to erythromycin but susceptible to other macrolides, was categorized as susceptible with erythromycin disk diffusion. No resistance was detected for the cephalosporins, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones tested. CONCLUSION: Based on the results in this study, zone diameter breakpoints for K. kingae calibrated to EUCAST clinical MIC breakpoints were proposed and approved by EUCAST.
