The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivi are used to treat H5N1 influenza. However, oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 viruses have been isolated from oseltamivir-treated patients. Moreover, reassortment between H5N1 viruses and oseltamvir-resistant human H1N1 viruses currently circulating could create oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 viruses, rendering the oseltamivir stockpile obsolete. Therefore, there is a need for unique and effective antivirals to combat H5N1 influenza viruses. The investigational drug T-705 (favipiravir; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) has antiviral activity against seasonal influenza viruses and a mouse-adapted H5N1 influenza virus derived from a benign duck virus. However, its efficacy against highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, which are substantially more virulent, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that T-705 effectively protects mice from lethal infection with oseltamivir-sensitive or -resistant highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. Furthermore, our biochemical analysis suggests that T-705 ribofuranosyl triphosphate, an active form of T-705, acts like purines or purine nucleosides in human cells and does not inhibit human DNA synthesis. We conclude that T-705 shows promise as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza patients.
