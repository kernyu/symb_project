Pantoea agglomerans strains have been isolated from the surface of different edible plants which are major ingredients of traditional foods of the Black Sea region countries. Bacterial strains did not possess their pathogenic properties when tested routinely in vitro, but evinced the resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Experiments on murine model (BALB/c mice) have demonstrated the ability of P. agglomerans to penetrate into internal organs and provoke the distinct dose-dependent physiological changes in the intestine and gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT).
