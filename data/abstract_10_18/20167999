We report a case of a vertically infected woman treated with darunavir/ritonavir plus a standard backbone before pregnancy. The analysis of darunavir/ritonavir concentrations in peripheral maternal plasma throughout pregnancy, as well as in umbilical cord blood at delivery, showed low levels of darunavir in the mother and limited transfer across the placenta.
