BACKGROUND: The emergence of carbapenem resistance has had a significant impact on both clinical and economic outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was performed in a 433-bed tertiary care medical center. The cohort was established from all inpatients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa-positive cultures over a 3-year period. Two multivariate models were developed: a logistic regression model to evaluate the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality and a linear regression model to evaluate the secondary outcome of total hospital cost. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for in-hospital mortality among patients with meropenem-resistant isolates was 2.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-7.28). There were significantly more deaths in the meropenem-resistant group (28.1% vs 8.9%, P = .003). Patients with meropenem-resistant P aeruginosa experienced a 4-day increase in median length of stay versus those in the meropenem-susceptible group (14 vs 9 days, P = .004). Likewise, the percentage of patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission increased from 42% to 81.3% (P <.001). Meropenem resistance was also associated with a significant increase in total hospital cost by a factor of 1.42 among patients who were not admitted to the ICU (95% CI, 1.03-1.95). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that meropenem resistance was a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality. Carbapenem resistance also resulted in a significant increase in hospital cost, but only among patients who were not admitted to the ICU.
