BACKGROUND: Biofilm occurring on removable prostheses is a reservoir of bacterial flora, consisting of both physiological and pathogenic multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Patients undergoing dialysis and organ transplantation are particularly prone to bacterial infections, which can have its source in denture plaque. This study was a comparison of the composition of staphylococcal flora within the surface of the pharyngeal mucous membrane as well as denture plaque in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: The study included 44 subjects with removable prostheses who reported for a kidney transplant procedure. Swab samples were collected from prostheses and the pharyngeal wall. Isolated strains were identified and investigated for drug resistance. RESULTS: A total of 72 strains of Staphylococcus were isolated from the denture plaque and 53 from the pharynx. In the pharynx, the following species prevailed: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus aureus. The following species prevailed in denture plaque: S epidermidis, S aureus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Among the pharyngeal strains, antibiotic resistance most commonly referred to natural penicillin (77%), constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance (28%), and tetracycline (26.4%). In case of denture plaque, the highest percentage of strains demonstrated resistance to natural penicillin (60%), fosfomycin (32%), and cefoxitin (25%). In 10 subjects (48%), Staphylococcus-induced infections occurred in the first year after transplantation, 5 of which had the same bacterial strain as cultured previously from dentures. CONCLUSIONS: The denture biofilm and surface of the pharynx differ in terms of bacterial composition and bacterial drug resistance profiles. Denture plaque constitutes a considerable reservoir of staphylococcal flora, which can be a potential source of infection in organ transplant recipients.
