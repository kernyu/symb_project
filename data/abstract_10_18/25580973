Complicated infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) represent a therapeutic challenge, since adequate treatment options are limited and antibiotic resistance to the available agents has already been described. The most frequently used antibiotic in VRE treatment is linezolid. Tigecycline is an alternative to linezolid, however, clinical data for severe infections such as sepsis or endocarditis are scarce. Daptomycin on the one hand is an option but has not yet been approved for the treatment of enterococcal infections in Germany on the other hand. The present review critically evaluates the clinical significance of the antibiotics in question for VRE therapy based on existing data.
