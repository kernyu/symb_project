The purpose of the survey was the routine assessment of the MTBDRplus((R)) kit performance in the determination and characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to rifampicin. The survey was carried out on a collection of 144 strains (126 of which were resistant to rifampicin) isolated on patients from 15 countries. Sensitivity to antituberculosis drugs was determined by a liquid culture system and the reference method was the amplification and sequencing of a target region of the rpoB gene whose mutations are responsible for rifampicin resistance (codons 507 to 533). The assessed kit was based on a reverse hybridization technique using eight overlapping probes covering the target region and four probes representing the most-frequently observed mutations. The assay performance was found excellent, specificity: 100%, sensitivity: 99.2%; 17 mutations affecting 10 codons were reported, two of which were newly identified.
