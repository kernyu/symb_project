Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that inhibits the initiation of translation. Although resistance to linezolid is an uncommon event, it has been reported in clinical isolates. The genome sequence of Streptococcus pneumoniae linezolid-resistant mutants recently revealed mutations associated with resistance. A proteomic and transcriptomic screen now reveals a possible increase in the metabolism and transport of carbohydrates in these linezolid-resistant S. pneumoniae mutants. Several glycolytic proteins were shown to be overexpressed in the resistant strains, along with other enzymes and transporters involved in the metabolism of sugars. An increase in energy needs appears to be required to sustain extended levels of resistance to linezolid as the disruption of two ABC transporters putatively involved in the import of carbohydrates leads to a 2-fold sensitization to linezolid. Furthermore, the disruption of the catabolite control protein A, a regulator of the metabolism of sugars whose expression is highly increased in one linezolid-resistant mutant, resulted in a 2-fold increase in linezolid susceptibility. This global scale analysis of gene and protein expression profiling highlights metabolism alterations associated with linezolid resistance in S. pneumoniae.
