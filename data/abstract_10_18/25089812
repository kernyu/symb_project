Guided by crystal structures of HIV-1 RT/DAPY complex and molecular modeling studies, a series of novel [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives were rationally designed via structure-based core refining approach, synthesized through the readily accessible synthetic methods and evaluated for their anti-HIV activities in MT-4 cells. Preliminary biological evaluation indicated that most of the compounds exhibited marked inhibitory activity against the wild-type HIV-1 IIIB. Particularly, compound 7n was the most potent inhibitor against wild-type and K103N/Y181C double resistant mutant strain of HIV-1, possessing EC50 values of 0.02 muM and 7.6 muM, respectively, which were much better than or similar to nevirapine (NVP, EC50 = 0.15 muM, 2.9 muM) and delavirdine (DLV, EC50 = 0.07 muM, >36 muM). Besides, some other compounds, 5b, 7c, 7e, 7f, and 7m, were also endowed with favorable anti-HIV-1 potency (EC50 = 0.07, 0.05, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.05 muM, respectively), which were better than or similar to those of NVP and DLV, suggesting a high potential to further develop this type of bridgehead nitrogen heterocycle as a novel class of NNRTIs with improved antiviral efficacy and resistance profile. The selected compound, 7i, was found moderately inhibitory towards RT (IC50 = 0.39 muM), which was higher than for ETV (IC50 = 0.56 muM). Preliminary structure-activity relationships (SARs) and molecular modeling of these new analogues were detailed in this manuscript.
