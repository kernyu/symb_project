BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents and is characterized by frequent metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Because osteosarcoma cells are not highly susceptible to current chemotherapy drugs, new alternative strategies for the treatment of osteosarcoma are needed. This study was undertaken to investigate the inhibitory effects of a new synthetic ursolic acid derivative IUA on osteosarcoma cells and to explore its molecular mechanism. We also intended to identify new therapeutic candidates. METHODS: We used MTT assay to assess the effect of IUA on the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells. Western-blot analysis was performed to examine downstream molecular events. The Annexin V method was used to evaluate the effect of IUA on apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. The cell cycle of IUA-treated cells was examined by flow cytometry, and the in vivo effects of this new ursolic acid derivative were evaluated in a mouse osteosarcoma model. RESULTS: The results showed that the new synthetic ursolic acid derivative IUA significantly decreased viability of osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo. It could also induce apoptosis and G1 phase arrest of osteosarcoma cells. The JNK signaling pathway was significantly inhibited, and cleaved caspase-3 protein was increased. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the new synthetic ursolic acid derivative IUA induces proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo via the down-regulation of the JNK signaling pathway, making it a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of human osteosarcoma.
