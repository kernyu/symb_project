Four out of 143 phenotypically isoniazid-resistant but rifampin-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains that were isolated from patients in Germany in 2011 had mutations in the rifampin resistance-determining region of rpoB. After performing drug susceptibility testing (DST) with two methods, the proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium and using the Bactec 960 Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube system, we conclude that the two methods are equally reliable for phenotypic DST and MIC determination.
