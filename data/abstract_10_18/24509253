To characterize the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in diarrheagenic Escherichia coli from Korea in 2008-2011, we screened seven enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and one enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) that produce ESBLs from a nationwide survey. All eight isolates produced CTX-M-type ESBLs, including CTX-M-12 (n = 4), CTX-M-14 (n = 2), and CTX-M-15 (n = 2). PCR-based replicon typing indicated that the blaCTX-M-12 genes of four ETEC isolates were carried on a conjugative IncF plasmid, whereas the blaCTX-M-14 of one EAEC was located on an IncK plasmid. This is the first report of the occurrence of blaCTX-M genes in clinical isolates of EAEC in Korea. The ESBL-producing isolates were shown to be different based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing, whereas the four isolates with CTX-M-12 were clonally related. These observations raise an alarm for the spread of plasmid-mediated resistance to ESBL among diarrheagenic E. coli.
