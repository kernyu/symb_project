This study investigated the correlation between antibiotic consumption and resistance among Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci causing healthcare-associated infections at a university hospital in Taiwan from 2000 to 2009. Overall, the trend of total consumption (defined daily dose [DDD] per 1,000 patient-days) of glycopeptides, including vancomycin and teicoplanin, significantly increased during 2000 to 2003 and remained stable during 2004-2009. Vancomycin consumption significantly increased during 2003 and decreased after 2004. A significant decrease in the resistance rate with time was found for oxacillin- and gentamicin-resistant S. aureus. In contrast, the rates of vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant enterocci increased significantly. A significant correlation was found between the increased use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems and the decreased prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In contrast, the increased use of teicoplanin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, and carbapenems was correlated with the increased prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In conclusion, this 10-year study in a single institution identified different correlations between the prescription of antibiotics and the resistance rates of MRSA and VRE. Strict implementation of infection control policy based on these correlates would be helpful in decreasing the presence of these multidrug-resistant pathogens in hospitals.
