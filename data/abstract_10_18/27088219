OBJECTIVES: To assess the epidemiologic and microbiologic profile and in vitro fluconazole susceptibility of yeasts isolated from the oral mucosa colonization/infection of elderly patients. BACKGROUND: It has been reported that in older adults increases the oral colonization by Candida particularly C. non-albicans, showing a decreased response to fluconazole, which increases the risk of recalcitrant local and disseminated candidiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted in 120 elderly patients. Oral samples were obtained of mucosal Candida colonization or infection by swabbing. Each sample was plated on CHROMagar((R))Candida and incubated (36+/-1.5 degrees C) for two days. The yeast species were identified using the API((R))ID32-C-AUX. Fluconazole susceptibility was tested using a broth microdilution assay according to the CLSI methods. RESULTS: The yeast colonization/infection frequency in the total population was 65.8%. The frequency of the highest Candida carriers was 67.4% in the 70-79-year-old-group. Oral candidiasis was present in 20%, with a tendency to increase with age (33.3% of adults aged>80years), it was determined that the use of prosthesis is associated with a higher colonization rate (Chi2, p=0.011). The frequency of colonization/infection cases with more than one species showed a tendency to increase with age; 18.9% in the 60-69 year-old-group, 20.9% in the 70-79-year-old-group and 29.2% in the >/=80 year-old-group. About fluconazole susceptibility: for C. albicans, 20.3%, about Candida non-albicans species 15.3% were dose dependently susceptible (DDS) and 17.9% were resistant. CONCLUSIONS: After 80 years of age, there is a considerable increase in Candida non-albicans species and a reduced susceptibility to fluconazole.
