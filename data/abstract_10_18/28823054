Infectious diseases impose serious public health burdens and continue to be a global public health crisis. The treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens is challenging because only a few viable therapeutic options are clinically available. The emergence and risk of drug-resistant superbugs and the dearth of new classes of antibiotics have drawn increasing awareness that we may return to the pre-antibiotic era. To date, lipopeptides have been received considerable attention because of the following properties: They exhibit potent antimicrobial activities against a broad spectrum of pathogens, rapid bactericidal activity and have a different antimicrobial action compared with most of the conventional antibiotics used today and very slow development of drug resistance tendency. In general, lipopeptides can be structurally classified into two parts: a hydrophilic peptide moiety and a hydrophobic fatty acyl chain. To date, a significant amount of design and synthesis of lipopeptides have been done to improve the therapeutic potential of lipopeptides. This review will present the current knowledge and the recent research in design and synthesis of new lipopeptides and their derivatives in the last 5 years.
