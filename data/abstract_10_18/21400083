Bacterial infections are an important issue in current clinical medicine. The severity of infectious diseases has increased dramatically in recent years, which is also due to increasing numbers of resistant bacteria, including strains producing broad-spectrum beta-lactamases. The study aimed at determining the prevalence of ESBL- and AmpC-positive Enterobacteriaceae at the Department of Neonatology, University Hospital Olomouc. Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from clinical samples from infants hospitalized at the Department of Neonatology, University Hospital Olomouc over a period of 2 years. ESBL- and AmpC-positive isolates were subjected to basic genetic analysis. In the study period, a total of 1,526 isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae family were identified, including 55 (3.6%) cases of the ESBL phenotype and 17 (1.1%) AmpC-positive isolates. Genetic analysis of ESBL-positive isolates revealed a majority of CTX-M enzymes. Among AmpC beta-lactamases, the EBC, CIT, DHA, and MOX types were detected. An Escherichia coli strain was isolated with mutations in the promoter region of the ampC chromosomal gene that are associated with overproduction of the relevant enzyme.
