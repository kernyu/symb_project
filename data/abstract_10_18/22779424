Novel non-fluoroquinolone inhibitors of bacterial type II topoisomerases (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) are of interest for the development of new antibacterial agents that are not impacted by target-mediated cross-resistance with fluoroquinolones. N-Linked amino piperidines, such as 7a, generally show potent antibacterial activity, including against quinolone-resistant isolates, but suffer from hERG inhibition (IC(50) = 44 muM for 7a) and QT prolongation in vivo. We now disclose the finding that new analogues of 7a with reduced pK(a) due to substitution with an electron-withdrawing substituent in the piperidine moiety, such as R,S-7c, retained the Gram-positive activity of 7a but showed significantly less hERG inhibition (IC(50) = 233 muM for R,S-7c). This compound exhibited moderate clearance in dog, promising efficacy against a MRSA strain in a mouse infection model, and an improved in vivo QT profile as measured in a guinea pig in vivo model. As a result of its promising activity, R,S-7c was advanced into phase I clinical studies.
