For the first time in vivo, the model of the viral pneumonia in mice was used to study the antiviral activity against influenza A virus (H1N1) pdm09 synthetic derivatives of adamantane series including the amino acid residues and lipoid acid. It was found that the adamantane derivatives with histidine, serine, and lipoid acid could inhibit the rimantadine-resistant strain of the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09. As a result, the lifespan of the mice infected with the virus has increased by 1.6 times with respect to viral control. Thus, the possibility of restoration of antiviral properties of rimantadine both in vitro and in vivo by introducing into its molecular structure new functionally active groups was tested.
