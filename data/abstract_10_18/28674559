INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli frequently occurs in the hospital environment. This study aims to describe resistant phenotypes of Escherichia coli strains to monitor their occurrence. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive retrospective study of 102 Escherchia coli strains responsible for urinary tract infection in the laboratory of the University Hospital Joseph Raseta Befelatanana, Antananarivo from January 2014 to October 2016. RESULTS: Beta-lactam antibiotic resistance screening identified high-level penicillinases 50% (n=51), Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) 22.5% (n=23), high-level cephalosporinases 14.7% (n=15), penicillinases low level 5.9% (n=6), wild type strains 5.9% (n=6) and a strain ofEscherichia coli emerging strain high-level resistance. Aminoglycosides resistance was identified in 58 (56.9%) wild type phenotype, 29 (28.4%) strains sensitive to amikacin and 15 (14.7%) resistant to all aminoglycosides. Fluoroquinolones resistance was identified in 52 (51%) wild type strains, 9 (8.8%) strains sensitive to ciprofloxacin and 41 (40.2%) resistant to all fluoroquinolones. Women (25, 7%) (p= 0.25, NS), patients more than 60 years (38.7%) (p=0.02), patients hospitalized in the Department of Nephrology (53.8%) (p=0.04), with urinary disorder and kidney disease (29, 7%) (p= 0.2, NS) were the most affected by E-ESBL. CONCLUSION: Based on high multidrug resistance in Escherichia coli strains guidelines for the empirical treatment of urinary tract infections need to be revised.
