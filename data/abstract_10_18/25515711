BACKGROUND: On two farms it was noted that after routine treatment with monepantel, fecal egg counts failed to drop. This was accompanied by lambs mortality due to Haemonchus contortus infection. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of monepantel to control gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) in two sheep farms, in Uruguay. FINDINGS: A Fecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) was subsequently performed at the Experimental Stations Glencoe of INIA Tacuarembo (Farm 1) and Sheep Unit of INIA La Estanzuela (Farm 2) using the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology guidelines. On Farm 1 the FECRT was performed using 6-8 month old Corriedale or Merino Dohne x Corriedale male lambs naturally infected with GIN. On day 0 pre-treatment, three groups of 15 lambs each were selected, blocked by fecal egg count level (FEC) and randomly assigned to one of the following: Group 0 = untreated control, Group 1 = treated with monepantel (Zolvix(R), Novartis Animal Health Inc.) from stock previously purchased; Group 2 = treated with monepantel from stock provided by the supplier, at the recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg of body weight. Fecal samples were collected directly from the rectum from each lamb on day 0 and on day 9 post-treatment. On Farm 2, the FECRT was conducted on a group of 8 month old male lambs Milchschaff x Finn. At this farm, 10 lambs were randomly allocated to be treated with monepantel (Group 1) and 10 lambs were randomly allocated to remain as untreated control (Group 0) using the same protocols as Farm 1. On farm 1 the FECR was 0.0% (95% CI = 0.0-49.0) and 42.0% (95% CI = 0.0-75.0) for Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. For Farm 2, the FECR was 82.1% (95% CI = 36.0-99.0). Haemonchus spp was the resistant genus. CONCLUSIONS: Poor effcicacy of monepantel in treating GIN parasites was demonstrated on both farms.
