Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult malignancies to treat owing to the rapid acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy. Gemcitabine, a first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer, prolongs patient survival by several months, and combination treatment with gemcitabine and other anti-cancer drugs in the clinic do not show any significant effects on overall survival. Thus, identification of a drug that resensitizes gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance are critical to develop new therapeutic options for pancreatic cancer. Here, we report that zidovudine resensitizes gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine as shown by screening a compound library, including clinical medicine, using gemcitabine-resistant cells. In analyzing the molecular mechanisms of zidovudine effects, we found that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype and downregulation of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) are essential for the acquisition of gemcitabine resistance, and zidovudine restored these changes. The chemical biology investigations also revealed that activation of the Akt-GSK3beta-Snail1 pathway in resistant cells is a key signaling event for gemcitabine resistance, and zidovudine resensitized resistant cells to gemcitabine by inhibiting this activated pathway. Moreover, our in vivo study demonstrated that co-administration of zidovudine and gemcitabine strongly suppressed the formation of tumors by gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer and prevented gemcitabine-sensitive pancreatic tumors from acquiring gemcitabine-resistant properties, inducing an EMT-like phenotype and downregulating hENT1 expression. These results suggested that co-treatment with zidovudine and gemcitabine may become a novel therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer by inhibiting chemoresistance-specific signaling.
