Features of phosphate-mobilizing bacteria Bacillus subtilis IMB B-7023 and its streptomycin-resistant strain were investigated. While cultivated in medium with glucose and glycerophosphate, the growth rate of the antibiotic-marked strain was approximately similar to this parameter for Bacillus subtilis IMB B-7023 but cell sizes were 1.3-fold less. Both strains significantly stimulated the germinating of plant seeds, attached to their roots, and insignificantly differed in antagonistic activity toward phytopathogens and quantitative content of cell fatty acids and phosphatase activity. Streptomycin-resistant strain may be used for monitoring of Bacillus subtilis introduced to agroecosystem.
