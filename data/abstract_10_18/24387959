A retrospective study conducted on patients with diarrhea in Shanghai, China from 2004-2011, indicated that of 77,600 samples collected, 1,635 (2.1%) tested positive for Shigella. Species isolated included S. sonnei (1,066, 65.1%), S. flexneri (569, 34.7%), and S. boydii (3, 0.2%). Most of the Shigella isolates were found to be resistant to streptomycin (98.7%), trimethoprim (98.0%), ampicillin (92.1%), and nalidixic acid (91.7%). Additionally, many isolates were resistant to tetracycline (86.9%), trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (80.1%), sulfisoxazole (76.8%) and gentamicin (55.5%). Approximately 80% of the isolates were resistant to at least eight antimicrobial agents, 14% to at least ten antimicrobials tested and 10 isolates to fourteen antimicrobials, including sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and beta-lactamases. Importantly, co-resistance to fluoroquinolones and the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins was also identified. The high levels of resistance to antimicrobial agents commonly used in clinical medicine presents a great challenge to treating patients with shigellosis.
