CONTEXT: Murraya paniculata (Linn) JACK (Rutaceae) is used in traditional medicine in the treatment of diabetes, inflammation, and microbial disorders. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the polyphenol composition and antimicrobial and acute toxicological activity of the hydroethanolic extract of M. paniculata leaves (EEMp). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemical composition was evaluated by the Folin-Ciocalteu and AlCl3 assays and by HPLC-DAD. Antibacterial and modulatory activity was determined by the microdilution method. Toxicity was assessed with a single dose of EEMp administered orally at doses of 2000 and 5000 mg/kg body weight/day in male and female Swiss mice. RESULTS: Total phenolic content of the EEMp samples varied from 66.5 to 396.8 mg gallic acid equivalent/g of extract and flavonoid content varied from 0.3 to 31.1 mg quercetin equivalent/g of extract. The principal component identified by HPLC-DAD assay was ellagic acid. The results of oral acute toxicity showed no mortality, changes in hematological parameters, or CNS and ANS toxicities in rats. Biochemical analysis showed a significant increase in glucose and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase activity and reduction in triglycerides and cholesterol for 5000 and 2000 mg/kg doses, respectively, when compared with the control group. Histopathological evaluation showed no significant microscopic changes. EEMp showed essentially no antimicrobial activity, but when aminoglycosides were combined with EEMp their MIC was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Significant effects were observed in the acute toxicity assay, but they had no clinical relevance. The results suggest that M. paniculata could be used as a source of natural products with antibacterial resistance-modifying activity, with lower toxicity.
