Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are important in cancer, as these cells possess enhanced tumor-forming capabilities and are resistant to current anticancer therapies. Agents with the ability to suppress CSCs are likely to provide novel opportunities for combating tumor proliferation and metastasis. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of bufalin on pancreatic CSCs in vivo and in vitro. Using a serumfree suspension culture, tumor spheres were enriched in a gemcitabineresistant human pancreatic cancer cell line, which had a higher percentage of CSCs, and western blotting, flow cytometry, and colony and tumor formation assays were used to demonstrate that these sphere cells exhibited CSC characteristics. Using these cancer stemlike cells as a model, the present study examined the effect of bufalin on pancreatic CSCs. It was demonstrated that bufalin inhibited the number of tumor spheres, and western blotting and immunohistochemical assays showed that the expression levels of CD24 and epithelial specific antigen (ESA) were downregulated by bufalin. Furthermore, in a subcutaneous xenograft model of implanted gemcitabineresistant MiaPaCa2 cells, bufalin inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the duration of tumor formation. Additionally, the expression levels of CD24 and ESA were inhibited in the bufalintreated mice. Notably, in another cancer model injected with tumor cells via the tail vein, fewer metastatic lesions were detected in the group in which tumor cells were pretreated with bufalin in vitro, compared with those without pretreatment. Of note, the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway was found to be inhibited in the bufalintreated cells. Taken together, these results suggested that bufalin suppressed pancreatic CSCs in gemcitabine-resistant MiaPaCa2 cells, and the Hh signaling pathway may be involved in this process.
