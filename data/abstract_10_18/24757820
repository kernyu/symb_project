The results of microbiological tests of 2382 blood specimens from 698 patients of three ICUs of the N. V. Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Service were analysed for a period of 2009 to 2012. No microbial growth was detected in 1160 specimens (48.7%). In the subsequent tests 816 isolates were used. The quota of grampositive isolates in the pathogen pattern decreased from 51.68 to 35.9% and that of gramnegative isolates increased from 38.26 to 48.1%. The number of the Candida isolates increased from 7.38 to 15.2%. The frequency of the S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. isolates lowered from 26.2 to 13.3% and from 15.4 to 11.5% respectively. The quota of K. pneumoniae isolates and Acinetobacter spp. increased from 8.1 to 18.9% and from 14.1 to 17.4% respectively. Most of the S. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. All the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. All the strains of K. pneumoniae isolated in 2009-2012 produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases. In 2012 7.8% the K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to carbapenems. In 2012 25.5% of the Acinetobacter spp. isolates were susceptible to carbapenems and 70.2% were susceptible to cefoperazon/sulbactam.
