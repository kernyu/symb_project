The phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) pathway is a frequently hyperactivated pathway in cancer and is important for tumor cell growth and survival. The development of targeted therapies against mTOR, a vital substrate along this pathway, led to the approval of allosteric inhibitors, including everolimus and temsirolimus, for the treatment of breast, renal, and pancreatic cancers. However, the suboptimal duration of response in unselected patients remains an unresolved issue. Numerous novel therapies against critical nodes of this pathway are therefore being actively investigated in the clinic in multiple tumor types. In this review, we focus on the progress of these agents in clinical development along with their biological rationale, the need of predictive biomarkers and various combination strategies, which will be useful in counteracting the mechanisms of resistance to this class of drugs.
