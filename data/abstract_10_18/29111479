OBJECTIVES: Bacteria belonging to the genera Ochrobactrum and Achromobacter are bacteria considered opportunistic, causing infections mainly in immunocompromised patients. beta-lactamases are the main cause of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial resistance profile and the presence of beta-lactamases encoding genes in Ochrobactrum sp. and Achromobacter sp. isolated from Brazilian soils. METHODS: Soil samples from the five regions of Brazil were collected for the isolation of bacteria, which were identified molecularly and then, the minimum inhibitory concentration and detection of beta-lactamases encoding genes were performed. RESULTS: High-level of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and different beta-lactamases encoding genes were found (blaCTX-M-Gp1, blaSHV, blaOXA-1-like and blaKPC), including the first report of the presence of blaKPC in bacteria belonging to the genera Ochrobactrum and Achromobacter. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the bacteria from this study, belonging to genera Ochrobactrum and Achromobacter isolated from soil, harbor different beta-lactamases encoding genes and can act as a reservoir of these genes.
