Acinetobacter baumannii can acquire resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic colistin through complete loss of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expression. The activities of the host cationic antimicrobials LL-37 and human lysozyme against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of A. baumannii that acquired colistin resistance through lipopolysaccharide loss were characterized. We demonstrate that LL-37 has activity against strains lacking lipopolysaccharide that is similar to that of their colistin-sensitive parent strains, whereas human lysozyme has increased activity against colistin-resistant strains lacking LPS.
