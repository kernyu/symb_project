D-Amino acid oxidase (DAAO) is a well-known flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxygen-dependent oxidative deamination of amino acid D-isomers with absolute stereospecificity, which results in alpha-keto acids, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. Recently, the extraordinary functional plasticity of DAAO has become evident; in turn, boosting research on this flavoprotein. Protein engineering has allowed for a redesign of DAAO substrate specificity, oxygen affinity, cofactor binding, stability, and oligomeric state. We review recent developments in utilizing DAAO, including as a biocatalyst for resolving racemic amino acid mixtures, as a tool for biosensing, and as a new mechanism of herbicide resistance. Perspectives for future biotechnological applications of this oxidative biocatalyst are also outlined.
