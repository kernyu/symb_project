Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most difficult Gram-negative bacteria to treat and eradicate. In a cell-based screening of pleuromutilin derivatives against a drug sensitive A. baumannii strain, new molecules (2-4) exhibit bacteriostatic activity with 3.13 mug/mL concentration and 1 shows bactericidal activity with an MBC of 6.25 mug/mL. The pleuromutilin derivative 1 displays strong synergistic effects with doxycycline in a wide range of concentrations. A 35/1 ratio of 1 and doxycycline (1-Dox 35/1) kills drug susceptible A. baumannii with the MBC of 2.0 mug/mL and an MDR A. baumannii with the MBC of 3.13 mug/mL. In vitro anti-Acinetobacter activity of 1-Dox 35/1 is superior to that of clinical drugs such as tobramycin, tigecycline, and colistin. The efficacy of 1-Dox 35/1 is evaluated in a mouse septicemia model; treatment of the infected C57BL/6 mice with 1-Dox 35/1 protects from lethal infection of A. baumannii with an ED50 value of <2.0 mg/kg.
