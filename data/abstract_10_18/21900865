In the course of studies on hybrid antibacterials incorporating 2-aryl-5-nitro-1H-indole moieties as potential bacterial NorA efflux pump inhibitors, the compound 1-[2-(5-nitro-1H-indol-2-yl)phenyl]methylpyridinium chloride (2) was synthesized and structurally characterized. This pyridinium chloride salt crystallized in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c with the following unit cell dimensions: a 10.274(3) A, b 13.101(4) A, c 13.439(4) A, b 107.702(7) degrees , V 1723.2(9) A(3), Z (f.u.) = 4; R1 = 0.048, and wR2 = 0.13. Of interest in the single crystal X-ray structure is the (intramolecular) disposition of the pyridinium plane over the indole heterocyclic residue [interplanar dihedral angle 17.91(4) degrees ].
