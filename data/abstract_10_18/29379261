The importance to develop effective alternatives to known antibiotics due to increased microbial resistance is gaining momentum in recent years. Therefore, it is of interest to predict, design and computationally model Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs). AMPs are oligopeptides with varying size (from 5 to over100 residues) having key role in innate immunity. Thus, the potential exploitation of AMPs as novel therapeutic agents is evident. They act by causing cell death either by disrupting the microbial membrane by inhibiting extracellular polymer synthesis or by altering intra cellular polymer functions. AMPs have broad spectrum activity and act as first line of defense against all types of microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi and as well as cancer (uncontrolled celldivision) progression. Large-scale identification and extraction of AMPs is often non-trivial, expensive and time consuming. Hence, there is a need to develop models to predict AMPs as therapeutics. We document recent trends and advancement in the prediction of AMP.
