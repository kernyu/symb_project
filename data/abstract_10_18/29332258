Among non-albicans Candida species, the opportunistic pathogen Candida krusei emerges because of the high mortality related to infections produced by this yeast. The Candida krusei is an opportunistic pathogen presenting an intrinsic resistance to fluconazol. In spite of the reduced number of infections produced by C. krusei, its occurrence is increasing in some groups of patients submitted to the use of fluconazol for prophylaxis. Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) is a potential antimicrobial therapy that combines visible light and a nontoxic dye, known as a photosensitizer, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can kill the treated cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of PACT, using toluidine blue, as a photosensitizer on both growth and biofilm formation by Candida krusei. In this work, we studied the effect of the PACT, using TB on both cell growth and biofilm formation by C. krusei. PACT was performed using a light source with output power of 0.068 W and peak wavelength of 630 nm, resulting in a fluence of 20, 30, or 40 J/cm(2). In addition, ROS production was determined after PACT. The number of samples used in this study varied from 6 to 8. Statistical differences were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc comparison with Tukey-Kramer test. PACT inhibited both growth and biofilm formation by C. krusei. It was also observed that PACT stimulated ROS production. Comparing to cells not irradiated, irradiation was able to increase ROS production in 11.43, 6.27, and 4.37 times, in the presence of TB 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 mg/mL, respectively. These results suggest that the inhibition observed in the cell growth after PACT could be related to the ROS production, promoting cellular damage. Taken together, these results demonstrated the ability of PACT reducing both cell growth and biofilm formation by C. krusei.
