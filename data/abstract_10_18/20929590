BACKGROUND: Declining in clinical efficacy of artesunate-mefloquine combination has been documented in areas along the eastern border (Thai-Cambodian) of Thailand. In the present study, the clinical efficacy of the three-day combination regimen of artesunate-mefloquine as first-line treatment for acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Thailand was monitored in an area along the western border (Thai-Myanmar) of the country. METHODS: A total of 150 Burmese patients (85 males and 65 females) aged between 16 and 50 years who were attending the Mae Tao clinic, Mae-Sot, Tak Province, and presenting with symptomatic acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were included into the study. Patients were treated initially (day 0) with 4 mg/kg body weight artesunate and 15 mg/kg body weight mefloquine. The dose regimen on day 2 was 4 mg/kg body weight artesunate and 10 mg/kg body weight mefloquine. On day 3, artesunate at the dose of 4 mg/kg body weight was given with 0.6 mg/kg body weight primaquine. Whole blood mefloquine and plasma artesunate and dihydroartemisinin (active plasma metabolite of artesunate) concentrations following treatment were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS), respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-four cases had recrudescence during days 7 and 42. Five and 5 cases, respectively had reinfection with P. falciparum and reappearance of Plasmodium vivax in their peripheral blood during follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 42-and 28-day efficacy rates of this combination regimen were 72.58% (95% CI: 63.20-79.07%) and 83.06 (95% CI 76.14-94.40%), respectively. Parasite clearance time (PCT) and fever clearance time (FCT) were significantly prolonged in patients with treatment failure compared with those with sensitive response [median (95% CI) values for PCT 32.0 (20.0-48.0) vs 24.0 (14.0-32.0) hr and FCT 30.0 (22.0-42.0) vs 26.0 (18.0-36.0) hr; p < 0.005]. Whole blood mefloquine concentrations on days 1, 7 and 14 in patients with sensitive and recrudescence response were comparable. Although plasma concentration of dihydroartemisinin at 1 hour of treatment was significantly lower in patients with recrudescence compared with sensitive response [mean (95% CI) 456 (215-875) vs 525 (452-599) ng/ml; p < 0.001], the proportion of patients with recrudescence who had relatively low (compared with the lower limit of 95% CI defined in the sensitive group) was significantly smaller than that of the sensitive group. CONCLUSIONS: Although pharmacokinetic (ethnic-related) factors including resistance of P. falciparum to mefloquine contribute to some treatment failure following treatment with a three-day combination regimen of artesunate-mefloquine, results suggest that artesunate resistance may be emerging at the Thai-Myanmar border.
