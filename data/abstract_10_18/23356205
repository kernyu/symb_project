In the present work, the problem of Helicobacter pylori infection in the world and its increasing antibiotic resistance are analyzed. The authors discuss the efficacy of treatment, noting that the clarithromycin--and metronidazole-resistance of H. pylori is the main cause of this treatment failure. Because of this phenomenon, a quadruple therapy is being introduced and clarithromycin is being replaced by new antibiotics. The authors also present various schemes of triple and quadruple therapy as well as sequential therapy. Attention is directed to the fact that, in order to obtain better results of the eradication, the treatment should be prolonged from 7 to 10 or even 14 days, and that the doses of the drugs should be increased.
