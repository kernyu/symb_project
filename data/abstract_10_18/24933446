Prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are becoming a growing public health concern in developed countries as more people undergo arthroplasty for bone fixation or joint replacement. Because a wide range of bacterial strains responsible for PJIs can produce biofilms on prosthetic implants and because the biofilm structure confers elevated bacterial resistance to antibiotic therapy, new drugs and therapies are needed to improve the clinical outcome of treatment of PJIs. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT), a non-antibiotic broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment, is also active against multidrug-resistant micro-organisms such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. APDT uses a photosensitiser that targets bacterial cells following exposure to visible light. APDT with RLP068/Cl, a novel photosensitiser, was studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to evaluate the disruption of MRSA and P. aeruginosa biofilms on prosthetic material. Quantitative CLSM studies showed a reduction in biofilm biomass (biofilm disruption) and a decrease in viable cell numbers, as determined by standard plate counting, in the S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms exposed to APDT with the photosensitiser RLP068/Cl. APDT with RLP068/Cl may be a useful approach to the treatment of PJI-associated biofilms.
