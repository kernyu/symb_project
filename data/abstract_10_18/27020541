Acinetobacter baumannii, although representing a small percentage of Gram-negative bacilli isolates in intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs), is frequently multidrug-resistant (MDR) and can pose difficult therapeutic challenges. From 2011 to 2014, 2337 A. baumannii were collected from IAIs and UTIs at 453 hospital sites in 48 countries as part of the SMART ongoing surveillance initiative. Current susceptibility and multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least three of the tested drug classes, were determined in a subset of 1011 isolates from 2013 to 2014. A. baumannii comprised 0.7-4.6% of all aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli isolated in six global regions. MDR rates were lowest in North America (47%) and highest in Europe and the Middle East (>93%), with higher rates in ICUs than in non-ICU wards in almost all regions. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles varied by region but resistance was high everywhere, with no drug inhibiting >70% of A. baumannii isolates in any region. Susceptibility to imipenem was highest in North America (64%) and lowest in Europe and the Middle East (</=11%). Amikacin overall was the most active of the studied agents, including against MDR isolates (of which 11-38% were susceptible). Trend analysis of only those countries that contributed isolates in each study year (2011-2014) demonstrated an increasing trend in MDR rates in the Middle East as well as decreasing susceptibility to several single antimicrobial agents in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. These patterns and trends can help direct antimicrobial therapy and infection control efforts.
