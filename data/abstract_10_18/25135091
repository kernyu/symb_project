Whilst improvements in patient care have reduced the risk of infection in patients undergoing prosthetic joint surgery, the substantial and growing number of hip and knee arthroplasty procedures undertaken translates into a continued and potentially increasing burden on patients, healthcare providers and the wider economy. Increases in patient obesity will raise further challenges to prevention efforts given the associated elevated risk of infection. Ongoing monitoring of infection rates remains a critical means to identify and address local and national changes in the epidemiology of prosthetic joint infection and to assess the impact of interventions.
