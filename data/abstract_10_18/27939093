As part of the multicentre Antibiotic Therapy Optimisation Study (ATHOS), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for cephalosporins alone and in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitors tazobactam, clavulanic acid and avibactam against third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. isolates collected in German hospitals. MIC50/90 values were 0.25-4 mg/L for cefepime/tazobactam, 0.25-2 mg/L for ceftazidime/avibactam, 0.125-0.5 mg/L for ceftaroline/avibactam, 0.5-4 mg/L for cefpodoxime/clavulanic acid and 0.25-1 mg/L for aztreonam/avibactam, depending on the underlying resistance mechanism and organism. Based on in vitro testing, beta-lactam antibiotics play an important role in the treatment of infections due to beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
