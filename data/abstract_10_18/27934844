A 5-year-old female child presented with fever of 1-week duration after visiting a malaria endemic zone without antimalarial prophylaxis. The patient presented with respiratory distress, decreased level of consciousness and high-grade fever. An elevated parasitaemia reaching 800,000/mul was observed. Antimalarial therapy was initiated with artesunate being administered intravenous (IV) along with IV clindamycin. Contrary to the expectations, there was no resolution of fever. Following a week of unresolved fever, the drug therapy was revised and altered to IV quinine dihydrochloride and IV clindamycin. Emergence of non-responsiveness to artesunate in Saudi Arabia is an alarming sign and requires revision of management protocols.
