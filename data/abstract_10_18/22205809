Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Zunyi were found more diversified but clustered less frequently to the Beijing family compared to isolates from other areas of China. These observations, on top of the fact that the Zunyi area has a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), support the notion that Beijing family isolates may not be linked to MDR-TB.
