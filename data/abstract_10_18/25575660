The bacterium responsible for tuberculosis is increasing its resistance to antibiotics resulting in new multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). In this study, several analytical techniques including NMR, FT-ICR, MALDI-MS, LC-MS and UV/Vis are used to study the copper-Rifampicin-Polyethylene glycol (PEG-3350) complex. The copper (II) cation is a carrier for the antibiotic Rifampicin as well as nutrients for the bacterium. The NIH-NIAID cell line containing several Tb strains (including antibiotic resistant strains) is tested against seven copper-PEG-RIF complex variations.
