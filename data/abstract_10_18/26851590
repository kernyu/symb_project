The aim of the study was molecular analysis of coagulase-positive isolates of Staphylococcus bacteria obtained from wild animals and evaluation of their resistance to antimicrobial agents. A total of 76 rectal swabs were taken from wild animals. The species of the Staphylococcus isolates was determined by MALDI TOF MS, susceptibility to antimicrobials was evaluated by phenotypic and molecular methods, epidemiological analysis (ADSRRS-fingerprinting) was also carried out. MRSA isolate was typed by MLST and spa-typing. The animals tested, were carriers (n=38) of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (S. aureus, S. pseudintermedius and S. delphini B). Analyzed isolates were resistant to 1 or 2 antimicrobials, which was confirmed by the presence of genes (blaZ, ermA, ermB, msrA, tetK and tetM). A multi-drug resistant and methicillin-resistant isolate of S. aureus was obtained as well (MRSA, ST8, t1635, PVL-positive and ACME-negative). The ADSRRS-fingerprinting method enabled interspecific and intraspecific differentiation of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus isolates, revealing a certain degree of correlation between the species of the isolate, and the degree of similarity between the isolates. The presence of resistance genes in 13% (5/38) of the isolates obtained from wild animals, including one methicillin-resistant isolate, is relatively small in comparison to the degree of colonization by resistant strains in humans, livestock or pets. Nevertheless, due to the possibility of contact between wild animals, domestic animals and humans, transmission of resistant strains is possible, as suggested by our isolation of a MRSA strain typed as ST8 and specific spa type t1635, which had previously been isolated exclusively from humans.
