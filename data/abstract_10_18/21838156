OBJECTIVE: The resistance of S. agalactiae strains to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics in newborns and their mothers. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology and Antibiotic Centre, Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, General Teaching Hospital, Prague. SUBJECT AND METHOD: In newborns in General Teaching Hospital in Prague between the years 2007 and 2009 we found 79 patients with S. agalactiae. Erythromycin and clindamycin were used in disk diffusion testing. RESULTS: In the collection of the children with early and late S. agalactiae infection was proved the same level of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin - 39% (resp. 40%). CONCLUSION: Macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics cannot be used for antibiotic prophylaxis during delivery without knowledge of the antibiotic susceptibility testing result due to the high level of the antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus agalactiae strains.
