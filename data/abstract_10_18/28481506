Biofilms' tolerance has become a serious clinical concern due to their formidable resistance to conventional antibiotics and prevalent virulence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternative antimicrobial agents to eradicate biofilms but avoid using antibiotics. Herein, we successfully developed polymer functional silver nanocomposites by reduction of silver nitrate in the presence of a biocompatible carbohydrate polymer and a membrane-disrupting cationic polymer. The nanocomposites presented effective antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens). Confocal laser scanning macroscopy imaging demonstrated that the nanocomposites could efficiently disperse and eradicate the mature biofilms formed by the above four bacterial strains. The introduction of carbohydrate polymers onto nanocomposites effectively improved the biocompatibility, and these nanocomposites induced no significant red blood cell hemolysis and cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. More importantly, the nanocomposites were able to well eradicate the bacterial biofilms formed on the silicone implants in vivo. In conclusion, the nanocomposites as the broad-spectrum biofilm-disrupting agent are significant in the design of new strategies to eradicate biofilms on indwelling medical devices.
