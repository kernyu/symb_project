Determination of the attributable hospital cost and length of stay (LOS) are of critical importance for patients, providers, and payers who must make rational and informed decisions about patient care and the allocation of resources. The objective of the present study was to determine the additional total hospital cost and LOS attributable to health care-associated infections (HAIs) caused by antibiotic-resistant, gram-negative (GN) pathogens. A single-center, retrospective, observational comparative cohort study was performed. The study involved 662 patients admitted from 2000 to 2008 who developed HAIs caused by one of following pathogens: Acinetobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., or Pseudomonas spp. The attributable total hospital cost and LOS for HAIs caused by antibiotic-resistant GN pathogens were determined by comparison with the hospital costs and LOS for a control group with HAIs due to antibiotic-susceptible GN pathogens. Statistical analyses were conducted by using univariate and multivariate analyses. Twenty-nine percent of the HAIs were caused by resistant GN pathogens, and almost 16% involved a multidrug-resistant GN pathogen. The additional total hospital cost and LOS attributable to antibiotic-resistant HAIs caused by GN pathogens were 29.3% (P < 0.0001; 95% confidence interval, 16.23 to 42.35) and 23.8% (P = 0.0003; 95% confidence interval, 11.01 to 36.56) higher than those attributable to HAIs caused by antibiotic-susceptible GN pathogens, respectively. Significant covariates in the multivariate analysis were age >or=12 years, pneumonia, intensive care unit stay, and neutropenia. HAIs caused by antibiotic-resistant GN pathogens were associated with significantly higher total hospital costs and increased LOSs compared to those caused by their susceptible counterparts. This information should be used to assess the potential cost-efficacy of interventions aimed at the prevention of such infections.
