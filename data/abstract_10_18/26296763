Livestock-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, clonal complex (CC) 398, has been reported in Europe, whereas CC9 MRSA has mostly been found in Asia. Therefore, we aimed to detect MRSA on pig farms in north-eastern Thailand. A total of 257 nasal swabs (159 samples from pigs and 98 from pig-farm workers) were collected from three pig farms in north-eastern Thailand from 2010 to 2011. MRSA isolates were confirmed for femA and mecA genes by PCR. The MICs of eight antimicrobials, namely vancomycin (VA), cefazolin (CZ), ofloxacin (OF), tetracycline (TET), erythromycin (ER), oxacillin (OX), cefoxitin (FOX) and gentamicin (GN), were tested by agar dilution method. The virulence genes for Panton-Valentine leukocidin toxin (lukSF-PV), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tst) and alpha-haemolysin (hla) were detected by PCR. Strain typing was performed by staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec, agr, spa and multilocus sequence typing. Four MRSA were isolated: three from workers and one from a pig. All the MRSA isolates were resistant to OX, GN, ER, TET and CZ, and they all carried hla only. Two MRSA from humans carried SCCmec II-sequence type (ST)764-agrII, whereas the two remaining MRSA (one each from a human and a pig) contained SCCmec IX-ST9-agrII. Interestingly, meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates carrying SCCmec IX were also obtained from five workers and three pigs. This study suggests that the SCCmec IX element is distributed among the Staphylococcus found in pigs and pig-farm workers, and pigs may be a reservoir for MRSA in the community.
