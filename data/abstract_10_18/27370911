A systematic analysis of antibacterial activity of individual nanoderivatives, e.g. GO nanosheets, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), as well as combinations of Cu-Ag NPs, and GO-Cu-Ag nanocomposites against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was performed. Chemical properties of the GO, Cu and Ag NPs were determined employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-Ray-excited Auger electron spectroscopy. Morphology of corresponding nanoderivatives was studied employing transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It was shown that combination of Cu and Ag NPs, as well as GO-Cu-Ag nanocomposite material possess enhanced antibacterial activity through a possible synergy between multiple toxicity mechanisms. MRSA showed highest resistance in all cases.
