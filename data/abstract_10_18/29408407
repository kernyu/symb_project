OBJECTIVES: This work characterizes the antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens isolated from empirically treated dogs and cats. Within-household transmission of uropathogens can involve humans and companion animals. Knowledge on the prevalence and susceptibility pattern of isolates from canine and feline urine samples and the impact of prior antimicrobial treatment is important to prevent the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted selecting antibiotically treated companion animals. Urinary samples were collected by cystocentesis and submitted to an Italian diagnostic laboratory over a two years' period (2013-2015). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was analyzed using both the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and the formula to help select rational antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria were clearly prevalent. Gentamicin had the highest impact factors. Amoxicillin/clavulanic and doxycycline appear to be the most effective compounds against Gram positive infections, while marbofloxacin may be an useful option against Gram negative UTIs as well as doxycycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cats and dogs, respectively. Consulting published studies, it seems likely a comparable overall trend concerning bacterial species incriminated in canine and felice UTIs and their susceptibilities, in spite of different circumstances where studies were conducted. CONCLUSIONS: Companion animals are potential reservoirs of drug resistant uropathogens. The judicious use of antibiotics is necessary for maintaining the efficacy of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine. For this reason, antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring programs are essential to facilitate the choice of antimicrobial agent that is most likely to be effective, particularly in case of prior antimicrobial treatment.
