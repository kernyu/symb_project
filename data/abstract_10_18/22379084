Resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors is conferred on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 through thymidine analogue resistance mutations (TAMs) that increase the ability of RT to excise chain-terminating nucleotides after they have been incorporated. The RT mutation M184V is a potent suppressor of TAMs. In RT containing TAMs, the addition of M184V suppressed the excision of 3'-deoxy-3'-azidothymidine monophosphate (AZTMP) to a greater extent on an RNA template than on a DNA template with the same sequence. The catalytically inactive RNase H mutation E478Q abolished this difference. The reduction in excision activity was similar with either ATP or pyrophosphate as the acceptor substrate. Decreased excision of AZTMP was associated with increased cleavage of the RNA template at position -7 relative to the primer terminus, which led to increased primer-template dissociation. Whether M184V was present or not, RT did not initially bind at the -7 cleavage site. Cleavage at the initial site was followed by RT dissociation and rebinding at the -7 cleavage site, and the dissociation and rebinding were enhanced when the M184V mutation was present. In contrast to the effect of M184V, the K65R mutation suppressed the excision activity of RT to the same extent on either an RNA or a DNA template and did not alter the RNase H cleavage pattern. Based on these results, we propose that enhanced RNase H cleavage near the primer terminus plays a role in M184V suppression of AZT resistance, while K65R suppression occurs through a different mechanism.
