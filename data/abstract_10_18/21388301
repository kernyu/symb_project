In this study, the fitness cost of fluoroquinolone resistance was evaluated in vitro, on food matrices, and in vivo, using Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni in vitro selected mutants. In vitro, the growth rate of the susceptible (wild type) and resistant (mutant) strains did not differ when cultured separately. However, by conducting sequential passages of mixed cultures, the ratio of the resistant mutant to the susceptible strain decreased for C. coli but not for C. jejuni. When the wild type and the mutant were co-inoculated on food matrices, mutants were no longer detectable 3 to 5 days after artificial contamination, but the wild-type strains remained detectable for over 13 days. In mono-inoculated animals, no difference was observed between wild-type and mutant fecal titers. When co-inoculated into chickens, the susceptible strain outcompeted the resistant mutant for C. coli and for C. jejuni. However, for C. coli, if the resistant strain was already present in animals, it could persist at high titers in the digestive tract even in the presence of the wild-type strain. Together, these findings suggest that, depending on strain and study conditions, fluoroquinolone resistance can impose a fitness cost on Campylobacter.
