The paper gives the results of monitoring the circulation of influenza viruses in the 2010-2011 season, that covers the second year of circulation of pandemic A(H1N1)v virus strains, and their interaction with seasonal A (H3N2) and B strains. Unlike the previous season, the beginning of an increase in morbidity was recorded in January 2011; its peak in the most of contiguous areas was noted at 5-7 weeks of 2011, with its further decline to threshold levels at week 11 of 2011. Preschool and school children were most involved in the epidemic process. Three influenza virus strains (A(H1N1)v, A(H3N2), and B) were found to circulate. Differences were found in the level of participation of the isolated strains in individual areas of the Russian Federation. Detailed typing of the isolated strains determined the compliance of the vast majority of them with vaccine viruses. The pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v virus strains retained their susceptibility to oseltamivir and were resistant to rimantadine. The participation of non-influenza acute respiratory viral infection pathogens was estimated as follows: 11.9% for parainfluenza viruses, 5.9% for adenoviruses, and 3.5% for PC viruses, and 0.7% for pneumonia Mycoplasma, which was comparable with the previous epidemic seasons.
