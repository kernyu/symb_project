BACKGROUND: A lack of vaccine and rampant drug resistance demands new anti-malarials. METHODS: In vitro blood stage anti-plasmodial properties of several de novo-designed, chemically synthesized, cationic, amphipathic, helical, antibiotic peptides were examined against Plasmodium falciparum using SYBR Green assay. Mechanistic details of anti-plasmodial action were examined by optical/fluorescence microscopy and FACS analysis. RESULTS: Unlike the monomeric decapeptides {(Ac-GXRKXHKXWA-NH2) (X = F,DeltaF) (Fm, DeltaFm IC50 >100 muM)}, the lysine-branched,dimeric versions showed far greater potency {IC50 (muM) Fd 1.5 , DeltaFd 1.39}. The more helical and proteolytically stable DeltaFd was studied for mechanistic details. DeltaFq, a K-K2 dendrimer of DeltaFm and (DeltaFm)2 a linear dimer of DeltaFm showed IC50 (muM) of 0.25 and 2.4 respectively. The healthy/infected red cell selectivity indices were >35 (DeltaFd), >20 (DeltaFm)2 and 10 (DeltaFq). FITC-DeltaFd showed rapid and selective accumulation in parasitized red cells. Overlaying DAPI and FITC florescence suggested that DeltaFd binds DNA. Trophozoites and schizonts incubated with DeltaFd (2.5 muM) egressed anomalously and Band-3 immunostaining revealed them not to be associated with RBC membrane. Prematurely egressed merozoites from peptide-treated cultures were found to be invasion incompetent. CONCLUSION: Good selectivity (>35), good resistance index (1.1) and low cytotoxicity indicate the promise of DeltaFd against malaria.
