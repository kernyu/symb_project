Nosocomial infection is most commonly registered in the traumatology and surgery units, primarily in the intensive care unit (ICU) that is considered to be an increased risk unit owing to a large number of performed manipulations and the extensive empirical use of antibiotics. In ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonias at the Traumatology Center, nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria were isolated more frequently (51%), including P. aeruginosa (35.1%), from both patients' pathological material and environmental objects. All the cultures had typical properties; the majority of isolates belonged to serovar 02. P. aeruginosa strains were found to be polyresistant to test antibiotics.
