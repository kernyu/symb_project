The study was conducted from March 2008 to February 2010 in Microbiology Department, Citi Lab, Rawalpindi, to determine the causative microorganisms and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media. One hundred and eighty-three samples received at Citi Lab were included in the study. Pus samples were cultured aerobically. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was done with standard antibiotic discs using modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Out of 183 patients, microbiological culture was yielded from 154 specimens (84%). There were 148 bacterial isolates (96%) and 06 fungi (4%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=59, 38%) was the most common isolate followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n=34, 22%). Susceptibility pattern of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that 100% isolates were sensitive to Piperacillin/Tazobactam, whereas 98% isolates were sensitive to Imipenem and 76% to Ciprofloxacin. Continuous surveillance of susceptibility pattern is suggestive for effective therapy of chronic suppurative otitis media.
