The NS5A replication complex inhibitor daclatasvir (DCV; BMS-790052) inhibits hybrid replicons containing hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3a (HCV3a) NS5A genes with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) ranging from 120 to 870 pM. Selection studies with a hybrid HCV3a replicon identified NS5A residues 31 and 93 as sites for DCV-selected resistance. Our results support the potential use of DCV as a component in combination therapies for HCV3a chronic infection.
