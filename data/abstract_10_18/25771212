Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are rapidly evolving plasmid transferrable enzymes that confer unique patterns of antibiotic resistance on various bacterial species. Such organisms pose special challenges to laboratory identification, as well as antibiotic selection, administration, and follow-up. Although such infections are increasingly common in the obstetric population, issues surrounding ESBLs are not widely recognized by practicing obstetricians, and controversies exist regarding diagnosis and management. This article provides the practitioner with a summary of clinically pertinent information that will assist in the proper care of pregnant patients with ESBL infection.
