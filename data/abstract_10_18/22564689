We report a case of a 55 year-old male who was transferred to a Danish hospital from Central America. A routine screening revealed a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolate sensitive to mupirocin (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 0.094 mg/L) and eradication treatment was initiated. Three weeks later the patient developed MRSA bacteraemia with the same strain, though now resistant to mupirocin (MIC 8 mg/l). The incidence of mupirocin resistance is low in Denmark compared to other countries with a heavier burden of MRSA, but there is reason to be concerned due to the increasing reliance on this drug for treatment of MRSA carriage.
