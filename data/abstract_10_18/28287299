AIM: The effect of KEX2 mutations on C. albicans virulence and resistance to halogenated methyl sulfones was assessed. MATERIALS & METHODS: The mechanism of action of sulfones was studied using flow cytometry and microscopy. Expression of KEX2 and SAP5 was assessed using quantitative Real-Time-PCR. 2,3-Bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide and lactate dehydrogenase assays were elaborated to study, respectively, metabolism of Candida treated with sulfones and their cytotoxicity against tissues. Inflammatory response was detected by ELISA. RESULTS: Lysosome permeabilization and dose-dependent programmed cell death under sulfones were noted. KEX2 induction depended on halogenomethylsulfonyl groups, which affected cell wall biosynthesis and adhesion. CONCLUSION: Sulfones treatment reduced Candida pathogenicity in Galleria mellonella. Sulfones are an alternative for antifungal therapies due to their safety profile and antibiofilm activity.
