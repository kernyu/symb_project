AIM: The aim of this study was to characterize beta-lactamase antimicrobial resistance in Klebsiella and Enterobacter species isolated from healthy and diarrheic dogs in Andhra Pradesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 136 rectal swabs were collected from healthy (92) and diarrheic (44) dogs, bacteriological cultured for Klebsiella and Enterobacter growth and screened for beta-lactamase antimicrobial resistance phenotypically by disc diffusion method and genotypically by polymerase chain reaction targeting blaTEM, blaSHV, blaOXA, blaCTX-M Group 1, 2, blaAmpC, blaACC, and blaMOX genes. RESULTS: A total of 33 Klebsiella and 29 Enterobacter isolates were recovered. Phenotypic beta-lactamase resistance was detected in 66.6% and 25% of Klebsiella and Enterobacter isolates, respectively, from healthy dogs and 66.6% and 60% of Klebsiella and Enterobacter isolates, respectively, from diarrheic dogs. Overall, incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype was found to be 21.2% (7/33) in Klebsiella isolates, whereas none of the Enterobacter isolates exhibited ESBL phenotype. Predominant beta-lactamase genes detected in Klebsiella species include blaSHV (84.8%), followed by blaTEM (33.3%), blaCTX-M Group 1 (15.1%), and blaOXA (6.1%) gene. Predominant beta-lactamase genes detected in Enterobacter species include blaSHV (48.2%), followed by blaTEM (24.1%), blaAmpC (13.7%), and blaOXA (10.3%) gene. CONCLUSION: The present study highlighted alarming beta-lactamase resistance in Klebsiella and Enterobacter species of canine origin in India with due emphasis as indicators of antimicrobial resistance.
