In this work, we demonstrate that the fosI gene encodes a predicted small protein with 134 amino acids and determines reduced susceptibility to fosfomycin. It raised the MIC from 0.125 to 6 mug/ml when the pBRA100 plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli TOP10 and to 16 mug/ml when the gene was cloned into the pBC_SK(-) vector and expressed in E. coli TOP10.
