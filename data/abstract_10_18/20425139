Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTpSP) is one of the major strategies of malaria control in most African countries where malaria is endemic. The use of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy was adopted when proof of its superiority to weekly prophylactic dosing with either chloroquine or pyrimethamine became evident from studies in different malaria endemic countries. The administration of 2 and 3 treatment doses of SP for HIV-negative and HIV-positive pregnant women respectively, given after quickening and at an interval not less than 4 weeks was recommended. The prospects of this control strategy lies on the efficacy of SP, convenient treatment dose and high compliance rate. However, the implementation of this strategy and the efficacy of SP are faced with challenges such as: timing of SP administration, rising levels of parasite resistance to SP in the general population, effect of folate supplementation, adequacy of the recommended doses with regards to malaria endemicity and HIV status, interactions between SP and antiretroviral drugs and low coverage in the bid to scale-up its use. This review highlights the prospects and challenges of scaling up IPTp-SP.
