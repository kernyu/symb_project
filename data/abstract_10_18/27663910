OBJECTIVES: To investigate the molecular epidemiology of Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from different hospitals in Lebanon. METHODS: A total of 119 non-duplicate Acinetobacter strains were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and partial rpoB gene sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion method and all identified carbapenem-resistant isolates were investigated by PCR assays for the presence of the carbapenemase-encoding genes. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used for molecular typing. RESULTS: Of the 119 A. baumannii isolates, 76.5% were resistant to carbapenems. The most common carbapenemase was the OXA-23-type, found in 82 isolates. The study of population structure using MLST revealed the presence of 30 sequence types (STs) including 18 new ones, with ST2 being the most commonly detected, accounting for 61% of the isolates typed. PFGE performed on all strains of ST2 identified a major cluster of 53 isolates, in addition to three other minor clusters and ten unique profiles. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the wide dissemination of highly related OXA-23-producing carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii belonging to the international clone II in Lebanon. Thus, appropriate infection control measures are recommended in order to control the geographical spread of this clone in this country.
