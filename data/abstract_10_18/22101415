The mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance were characterized in 90 Salmonella enterica isolates either resistant or with intermediate resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMC(R/I)) or resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (C3G(R)). These isolates were recovered in three Spanish hospitals during 2007-2009. The C3G(R) phenotype was expressed by three isolates that carried the following extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes: phage-associated bla(CTX M-10) in S. Virchow, bla(CTX-M-14a) surrounded by ISEcp1 and IS903 in S. Enteritidis, and bla(CTX-M-15) linked to ISEcp1 and orf477 in S. Gnesta (first description in this serotype). The AMC(R/I) phenotype was found in 87 isolates (79 S. Typhimurim, 7 S. Enteritidis, and one S. Thompson). The bla(PSE-1) gene, followed by bla(OXA-1) was mostly found among S. Typhimurim, and the bla(TEM-1) gene among S. Enteritidis. Three different gene combinations [bla(PSE-1) +floR+aadA2+sul+tet(G); bla(OXA-1) +catA+aadA1/strA-strB+sul+tet(B) and bla(TEM-1) + cmlA1+aadA/strA-strB+sul+tet(A)/tet(B) genes] were associated with the ampicillin-chloramphenicol-streptomycin-sulfonamides-tetracycline phenotype in 68 AMC(R/I) S. enterica isolates. Class 1 integrons were observed in 79% of the isolates and in most of them (45 isolates) two integrons including the aadA2 and bla(PSE-1) gene cassettes, respectively, were detected. The bla(OXA-1) +aadA1 arrangement was detected in 23 isolates, and the aac(6')-Ib-cr+bla(OXA-1) +catB3+arr3 in another one. Non-classic class 1 integrons were found in three isolates: dfrA12+orfF+aadA2+cmlA1+aadA1 (1 isolate), dfrA12+orfF+aadA2+ cmlA1+aadA1+qacH+IS440+sul3 (1 isolate) and dfrA12+orfF+aadA2+cmlA1+aadA1+qacH+IS440+ sul3+orf1+mef(B)Delta-IS26 (1 isolate). Taken together, these results underline the need for clinical concern regarding beta-lactam resistance in Salmonella and thus for continuous monitoring.
