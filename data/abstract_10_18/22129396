Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), encoded by the Ace gene, is the primary target of organophosphates (OPs) and carbamates (CBs) in insects. Ace mutations have been identified in OP and CB resistant strains of Musca domestica. In this study, the Ace gene was partially amplified and sequenced at amino acid positions 260, 342, and 407 to determine the frequencies of these mutations in housefly samples collected from farms and garbage disposal sites of 16 provinces in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions of Turkey. In addition, the percent remaining AChE activities in these samples were assayed by using three OPs (malaoxon, paraoxon, and dichlorvos) and one CB (carbaryl) compound as inhibitors. In all the analyzed samples, 13 different combinations at the three amino acid positions were identified and the L/V260-A/G342-F/Y407 combination was found in the highest frequency. No susceptible individual was detected. The highest mean percent remaining AChE activities were detected in the individuals having the L260-A/G342-F/Y407 genotype when malaoxon and paraoxon were used as inhibitors and in the individuals with the L260-A342-F/Y407 combination when dichlorvos and carbaryl were used as inhibitors. The obtained data were heterogeneous and there was no exact correlation between the molecular genetic background and the resistance phenotypes of the flies. The findings of this study at the molecular and biochemical levels indicate the presence of significant control problems in the field.
