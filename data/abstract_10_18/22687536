The appropriate use of carbapenems is essential in order to prevent resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We investigated the correlation between the consumption of meropenem or doripenem and the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to meropenem in a Japanese university hospital from 2004 to 2009. The susceptibility data of P. aeruginosa and the annual consumption of meropenem or doripenem were analyzed. The consumption of meropenem or doripenem was calculated using the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical classification and defined daily doses methodology. Meropenem consumption decreased and doripenem consumption increased and throughout the entire investigation period, total consumption of meropenem plus doripenem was stable. Although the annual number of isolated P. aeruginosa has not changed, the annual number of isolated multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa decreased by measures against nosocomial infection. The rate of meropenem resistant P. aeruginosa decreased in a time-dependent manner. Meropenem consumption was positively correlated with the meropenem resistance rate among P. aeruginosa (r = 0.9455, p<0.01). The total consumption of meropenem and doripenem was not correlated with the meropenem resistance rate (r = -0.6601, p>0.1). These results suggested that even if the total consumption of meropenem plus doripenem was not changed, meropenem susceptibility among P. aeruginosa improved by the decrease of meropenem consumption. Although meropenem and doripenem have been suggested to show cross-resistance with each other, the reduction of meropenem consumption might be effective for preventing an increase of meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa.
