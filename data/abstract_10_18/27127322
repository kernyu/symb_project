BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Bedaquiline is the first drug approved for treating MDR-TB. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the totality of all available evidence on the efficacy of bedaquiline for the management of MDR-TB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the following PubMed and Cochrane Registry of Clinical Trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel design comparing bedaquiline versus any treatment for the management of MDR-TB in adults were eligible for inclusion. Data were pooled under a random effects model. RESULTS: Two trials published as three manuscripts with a total of 207 patients were included. As per the Cochrane risk of bias tool, majority of parameter were labeled as high or unclear risk of bias. Bedaquiline compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant decrease in time to conversion of positive sputum culture to negative at 8 and 24 weeks with a significant increase in mortality on long-term follow-up. There was no difference in completion rates between bedaquiline and placebo. CONCLUSION: Bedaquiline is an effective treatment modality for MDR-TB but needs to be balanced against significant mortality. Future Phase 3 RCTs are needed to make a conclusive recommendation.
