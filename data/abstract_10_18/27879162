AIM: Efficacy of antibiotics in cystic fibrosis (CF) is compromised by the poor penetration through mucus barrier. This work proposes a new 'nano-into-micro' approach, used to obtain a combinatorial effect: achieve a sustained delivery of tobramycin and overcome mucus barrier. METHODS: Mannitol microparticles (MPs) were loaded with a tobramycin polymeric nanocomplex and characterized in presence of CF artificial mucus. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: MPs are able to alter the rheological properties of CF artificial mucus, enhancing drug penetration into it and allowing a prolonged drug release. MPs resulted to be effective in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections if compared with free tobramycin. CONCLUSION: MPs resulted to be a formulation of higher efficacy, with potential positive implications, as lower required dose, administration frequency, side effects and antibiotic resistance problems.
