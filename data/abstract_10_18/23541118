This report summarizes data from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends 2005-2010 to identify trends in susceptibility from intra-abdominal infections in North America. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates (%) in 2005/2010 for E. coli and K. pneumoniae were 1.7/7.3 and 3.2/13.1, respectively. Ertapenem, imipenem, amikacin, and cefoxitin showed stable susceptibility.
