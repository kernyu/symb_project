The marine snail Aplysia californica produces escapin, an L-amino acid oxidase, in its defensive ink. Escapin uses L-lysine to produce diverse products called escapin intermediate products of L-lysine (EIP-K), including alpha-amino-epsilon-caproic acid, Delta(1)-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid, and Delta(2)-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid. EIP-K and H(2)O(2) together, but neither alone, is a powerful bactericide. Here, we report bactericidal mechanisms of escapin products on Escherichia coli. We show that EIP-K and H(2)O(2) together cause rapid and long-lasting DNA condensation: 2-min treatment causes significant DNA condensation and killing, and 10-min treatment causes maximal effect, lasting at least 70 h. We isolated two mutants resistant to EIP-K plus H(2)O(2), both having a single missense mutation in the oxidation regulatory gene, oxyR. A complementation assay showed that the mutated gene, oxyR(A233V), renders resistance to EIP-K plus H(2)O(2), and a gene dosage effect leads to reduction of resistance for strains carrying wild-type oxyR. Temperature stress with EIP-K does not produce the bactericidal effect, suggesting the effect is due to a specific response to oxidative stress. The null mutant for any single DNA-binding protein--Dps, H-NS, Hup, Him, or MukB--was not resistant to EIP-K plus H(2)O(2), suggesting that no single DNA-binding protein is necessary to mediate this bactericidal effect, but allowing for the possibility that EIP-K plus H(2)O(2) could function through a combination of DNA-binding proteins. The bactericidal effect of EIP-K plus H(2)O(2) was eliminated by the ferrous ion chelator 1,10-phenanthroline, and it was reduced by the hydroxyl radical scavenger thiourea, suggesting hydroxyl radicals mediate the effects of EIP-K plus H(2)O(2).
