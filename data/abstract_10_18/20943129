Resistance to amphotericin B is an emerging phenomenon in Candida albicans. Amphotericin B-resistant strain of C. albicans was developed under laboratory conditions and the stability of acquired resistance was confirmed in vitro as well as in vivo. This AMB-resistant strain exhibited reduced germ tube formation as compared to parent strain of C. albicans (ATCC10231). Enzymatic activity of virulence factors like secreted aspartyl proteinase and phospholipase were found to be significantly high in AMB-R as compared to parent strain whereas ergosterol content of AMB-R was drastically reduced. The behavior of AMB-R strain is an interesting phenomenon and opens up a wide area of research regarding pathways and mechanisms.
