Sepsis and septic shock are serious conditions associated with high morbidity and mortality. Rapid molecular methods for detection of microorganisms and antimicrobial resistance genes from positive blood cultures or whole blood have evolved over the past 10 years. Such diagnostic methods coupled with therapeutic interventional programs are desirable to improve the overall clinical outcome and mortality. This article discusses the usefulness of current molecular test methods for the diagnosis of sepsis and their potential to enhance the success of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Clinicians and laboratories alike must appreciate key factors influencing the appropriate use and potential impact of these methods.
