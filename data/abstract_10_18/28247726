PURPOSE: This study was aimed to the evaluation of the features of diagnosis and treatment of various urination disorders by physicians of the Republic of Dagestan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A anonymous questionnaire survey of 32 urologists of the Republic of Dagestan was performed. In addition to urologists, survey was performed among 104 doctors of other specialties, who also treat patients with various urination disorders in their practice: neurologists (9), obstetricians (22), therapists (38), and surgeons (35). Together with the doctors of the Republic of Dagestan, 323 specialists working in different areas of the Southern Federal District, and 144 specialists of the North Caucasus region participated in the survey. RESULTS: The findings suggest the confusion in determining the manifestations of overactive bladder, as well as various forms of urinary incontinence, incomplete knowledge on the issues of differential diagnosis of various forms of urinary incontinence and treatment policy in respect of each of these forms. Unfortunately, there is still unjustified use of M-anticholinergics in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in terms of the its pathogenesis. In addition, there is misunderstanding of the importance of the correct and rational use of antimicrobial drugs according to Russian clinical guidelines in the light of the worldwide problem of antibiotic resistance, as well as lack of knowledge of both Russian and European recommendations for the treatment of LUTS in men with BPH, and the indications and the need for combination therapy. Interestingly, a small number of urologists use M-anticholinergics in the treatment of men with symptomatic BPH. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study revealed inadequate degree of training of medical specialists of the Republic of Dagestan and the North Caucasus and Southern federal districts in this interdisciplinary field of medicine, which dictates the need for educational programs for urologists, as well as for specialists in related specialties.
