BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infection (BSI) is the most frequent infection in critically ill patients. As BSI's among patients in intensive care units (ICU's) are usually secondary to intravascular catheters, they can be caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms as well as fungi. Infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms is becoming more common, making the choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy challenging. The objective of this study is to evaluate the spectrum of microorganisms causing BSI's in a Medical-Surgical Intensive Care Unit (MSICU) and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. METHODS: A prospective observational study among all adult patients with clinical signs of sepsis was conducted in a MSICU of an inner-city hospital in New York City between May 1, 2010 and May 30, 2011. RESULTS: A total of 722 adult patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and/or sepsis were admitted to the MSICU between May 1, 2010 and May 30, 2011. From those patients, 91 (12.6%) had one or more positive blood culture. A 122 isolates were identified: 72 (59%) were Gram-positive bacteria, 38 (31.1%) were Gram-negative organisms, and 12 (9.8%) were fungi. Thirteen (34.2%) Gram-negative organisms and 14 (19.4%) Gram-positive bacteria were classified as MDR. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance, particularly among Gram-negative organisms, continues to increase at a rapid rate, especially in the ICU's. Coordinated infection control interventions and antimicrobial stewardship policies are warranted in order to slow the emergence of resistance.
