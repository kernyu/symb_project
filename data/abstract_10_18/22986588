This study was investigated to examine the effects of dietary inosine monophosphate (IMP) supplementation on growth performance, feed utilization, innate immunity, hematological parameters and disease resistance of juvenile olive flounder. Five experimental diets were formulated to contain IMP at levels of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 1.0%. All diets were maintained isonitrogenous (48% crude protein) and isocaloric (20.7 MJ/kg diet). Triplicate groups of olive flounder (initial body weight, 7.5 +/- 0.02 g) were fed one of the experimental diets to apparent satiation (twice a day) for 14 weeks. Final body weight of fish fed 0.1-0.2% IMP were significantly higher than that of fish fed the 1.0% IMP. Groups of fish fed 0.2 or 0.4% IMP diet had significantly higher myeloperoxidase and lysozyme activities than fish fed the control diet. However, nitro-blue-tetrazolium and superoxide dismutase activities were not significantly different among all treatments. In the challenge test against Streptococcus iniae, cumulative mortality of fish fed IMP supplemented diets was significantly lower (15%, 4%, 4% and 9% for 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4% and 1.0% IMP, respectively) than that of fish fed the control group (87%). The results suggest that IMP supplementation of 0.46-1.84 g into a kg of fish meal based diet (0.1-0.4% IMP product) can enhance innate immunity and disease resistance of olive flounder.
