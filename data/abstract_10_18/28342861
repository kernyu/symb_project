Type I IFNs play crucial roles in antiviral immune responses. By inducing cellular resistance to viral infection and apoptosis of virus-infected cells, they impair virus replication and eliminate the invading pathogens. However, in CHB patients, generation of type I IFN was significantly impaired and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. MicroRNA-548 family has been implicated in regulating antiviral response upon various infections. Here we explored the potential role of miR-548j in modulating type I IFN production in CHB. We found that miR-548j expression increased in MoDCs from CHB patients than that from healthy volunteers and transient transfection of miR-548j mimic led to a marked decrease of IFN-alpha/beta production in MoDCs from healthy volunteers while blockade of miR-548j by anti-miR-548j significantly restored IFN-alpha/beta secretion in MoDCs from CHB patients. In addition, Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 11 (ZBTB11) was predicted and finally confirmed to be a target of miR-548j. Forced expression of ZBTB11 also restored IFN-alpha/beta secretion in MoDCs from CHB patients. These results indicate the involvement of miR-548j in aberrant production of type I IFN in CHB patients, and provide a potential target for developing anti-HBV therapies.
