BACKGROUND: Influenza causes excessive hospitalizations and deaths. The study assessed the efficacy and safety of a clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination for treatment of serious influenza. METHODS: From February to April 2015, we conducted a prospective open-label, randomized, controlled trial. Adult patients hospitalized for A(H3N2) influenza were randomly assigned to a 2-day combination of clarithromycin 500 mg, naproxen 200 mg, and oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily, followed by 3 days of oseltamivir or to oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily without placebo for 5 days as a control method (1:1). The primary end point was 30-day mortality. The secondary end points were 90-day mortality, serial nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) virus titer, percentage of neuraminidase-inhibitor-resistant A(H3N2) virus (NIRV) quasispecies, pneumonia severity index (PSI), and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Among the 217 patients with influenza A(H3N2) enrolled, 107 were randomly assigned to the combination treatment. The median age was 80 years, and 53.5% were men. Adverse events were uncommon. Ten patients died during the 30-day follow-up. The combination treatment was associated with lower 30-day mortality (P = .01), less frequent high dependency unit admission (P = .009), and shorter hospital stay (P < .0001). The virus titer and PSI (days 1-3; P < .01) and the NPA specimens with NIRV quasispecies >/= 5% (days 1-2; P < .01) were significantly lower in the combination treatment group. Multivariate analysis showed that combination treatment was the only independent factor associated with lower 30-day mortality (OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.004-0.94; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Combination treatment reduced both 30- and 90-day mortality and length of hospital stay. Further study of the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of this combination treatment of severe influenza is warranted.
