There has never been a more important time to promote efforts to improve the use of antibiotics in hospitals. The growing challenges of C. difficile infections and antimicrobial resistance can both be addressed, at least in part, through so called "antimicrobial stewardship" efforts. Data suggest that when the right antibiotics are prescribed at the right dose for the right durations patient outcomes are improved and healthcare dollars are saved. That improving antibiotic use is a win-win-win is not in question; what remains to be determined is how best to ensure that these efforts are implemented in all hospitals. I believe that hospitalists must play an important role in advancing antimicrobial stewardship.
