Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) can help improve antimicrobial use in hospitals and, therefore, reduce resistance. Our hospital implemented an ASP in 2004, with interventions based on Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations. We aimed to assess the perceived effectiveness of ASP interventions on antimicrobial prescribing behavior by surveying hospital-based providers at a pediatric tertiary care center. We surveyed providers via an online survey utilizing questions with a Likert scale response format. Our ASP was perceived to be useful in improving antimicrobial use and was well received by prescribers. Hospitals considering creation of an ASP can anticipate that these interventions may affect prescribing behaviors in positive ways.
