Here, we report a case of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) presenting as a solitary splenic mass in a 60-year-old immunocompetent patient. Splenic TB is unusual and, when present, is usually associated with disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients. A high level of suspicion is required for diagnosis, and, as occurred in our case, it may be an unexpected finding following surgery. Diagnosis was made by polymerase chain reaction, which showed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA. Interestingly, rifampicin- and isoniazid-resistant genes were detected in our analysis. Splenic TB diagnosis and treatment are reviewed.
