Gargantulide A (1), an extremely complex 52-membered macrolactone, was isolated from Streptomyces sp. A42983 and displayed moderate activity against MRSA. The planar structure of 1 was determined using 2D NMR, and its stereochemistry was partially established on the basis of NOESY correlations, J-based configuration analysis, and Kishi's universal NMR database.
