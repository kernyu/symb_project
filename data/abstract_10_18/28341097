Eleven carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were recovered from the military hospital of Tunis, Tunisia. Three of these isolates carried the carbapenemase blaOXA-232 gene recently identified in France. These isolates were clonally related and co-expressed the extended-spectrum ss-lactamase, CTX-M-15. This work identified the occurrence of OXA-232 producers in North-African countries.
