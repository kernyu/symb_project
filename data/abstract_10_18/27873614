The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of polymicrobial bloodstream infections (pBSIs) on the outcome of sepsis in an area where antimicrobial resistance is of concern. This was a retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively from patients developing BSI outside of an intensive care unit (non-ICU patients) or after ICU admission. Demographics and clinical characteristics were compared for patients with pBSI versus monomicrobial BSI (mBSI) and following stratification by ICU or non-ICU and severity of sepsis status. Possible risk factors for adverse outcome were explored by multivariate analysis, and outcomes were measured by Cox regression analysis. Among 412 patients with BSI, 47 patients (11.4%) with pBSI were recorded; compared with patients with mBSI, they had significantly higher APACHE II scores and presented more frequently with severe sepsis/septic shock. The all-cause 28-day mortality was significantly higher for pBSI versus mBSI (38.3% vs. 24.7%; P=0.033), whereas appropriateness of treatment was comparable (78.7% vs. 86.6%). Primary bacteraemia by combinations of Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii was predominant among pBSIs; in mBSIs, urinary tract infections by Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominated. Multivariate analysis demonstrated pBSI as a significant contributor to 28-day mortality (HR=1.86; P=0.039), along with presence of two or more co-morbidities (HR=2.35; P=0.004). In conclusion, pBSIs differed epidemiologically from mBSIs, with the emergence of enterococcal species, and portended an almost two-fold increased risk of 28-day mortality. Prospective studies are warranted to elucidate possibly modifiable factors.
