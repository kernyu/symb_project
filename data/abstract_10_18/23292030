The combined effect of terpinen-4-ol, the main component of tea tree oil, and capric acid against mycelial growth of Candida albicans and murine oral candidiasis was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Mycelial growth of C. albicans was estimated by the Cristal violet method. Combination of these compounds revealed a potent synergistic inhibition of growth. Therapeutic efficacy of the combination was evaluated microbiologically in murine oral candidiasis, and its application of the compounds clearly demonstrated therapeutic activity. Based on these results, the combined agent of terpinen-4-ol and capric acid was discussed as a possible candidate for oral candidiasis therapy.
