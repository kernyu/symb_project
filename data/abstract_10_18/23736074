The epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in the United States has changed tremendously in the past 20 years. Since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine in 1988, the incidence of H. influenzae type b meningitis has declined by at least 97%, and Streptococcus pneumoniae has emerged as the most common etiologic agent. The PCV7 (7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [Prevnar]; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) vaccine, which targets 7 pneumococcal serotypes, was introduced in 2000 and has had an enormous impact on both the incidence and epidemiology of bacterial meningitis. This article reviews the impact of the PCV7 vaccine and the most up-to-date evidence on diagnosis and empiric therapy of suspected bacterial meningitis in the current day.
