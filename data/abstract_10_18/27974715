BACKGROUND: Increasing the accessibility of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has caused the emergence of drug resistance in patients receiving ART and in naive patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate HIV subtype and drug resistance between naive patients and ART-experienced patients. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 78 antiretroviral and naive HIV-1 patients; antiretroviral-resistant mutations and subtyping were then determined by sequencing pol regions. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 96.1% of sequences belong to the CRF35-AD subtype. Transmitted drug resistance was determined in 14% of drug-naive patients and 40% of ART-experienced patients. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study illustrated the importance of resistance testing before and during ART treatment. This study can be used to set up a best medicine strategy in Iranian guidelines.
