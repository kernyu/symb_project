Rates of resistance to first- and second-line drugs in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases in the United Kingdom were studied during 2010-2012. The highest rates for ethambutol, pyrazinamide and aminoglycosides occurred among patients originating in Eastern Europe, of whom 47% were Lithuanian. Rates of resistance to kanamycin were significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in the Lithuanian National TB Register than among Lithuanian patients resident in the United Kingdom (5% vs. 78%). In 2010, the majority of UK patients of Eastern European origin were located within the London region, whereas in 2011 the majority were located outside this region, a significant change (P = 0.01).
