BACKGROUND: Despite increasing reports of the linkage between diabetes and tuberculosis (TB), there is limited information regarding diabetes and TB drug resistance. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, sputum and blood samples were collected from 304 adult patients in rural Andhra Pradesh. Rifampin resistance was assessed by Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), and diabetes status was based on self-report. Additionally, samples were assayed by acid-fast bacilli sputum smear microscopy (AFB) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-G), in order to compare relative diagnostic performances. RESULTS: Among patients with confirmed TB (n = 194), diabetes was associated with 3.0-fold higher risk of rifampin resistance (95 % CI 1.3-6.7). Considering Xpert MTB/RIF the gold standard, AFB had lower sensitivity (72.2 vs. 82.5 %) and higher specificity (96.4 vs. 37.0 %) compared to QFT-G for diagnosing TB. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of rifampin resistance in patients with diabetes highlights the need for integrated diabetes surveillance in TB programs, particularly in settings undergoing the epidemiological transition.
