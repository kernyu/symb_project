Alarin, a regulatory peptide, belongs to the galanin family and plays the same regulatory roles as galanin in orexigenic activity and energy metabolism. Our previous studies had found that galanin might facilitate insulin sensitivity via activation of its central receptors. To date, little is known about whether central alarin may exert similar effects on insulin sensitivity. In order to investigate this, alarin and its specific antagonist, alarin 6-25Cys, were administered into the cerebral ventricles of type 2 diabetic rats (T2DR) to evaluate the changes in insulin resistance. The results indicated that central treatment with alarin significantly increased the body weight of animals, the 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose uptake, the plasma adiponectin levels, the glucose infusion rates in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp tests, the vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 as well as glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4 (SLC2A4)) protein and mRNA levels, and the ratios of GLUT4 contents in plasma membranes to total cell membranes in adipocytes, but reduced blood glucose and plasma retinol-binding protein 4 levels. These effects of alarin may be inhibited by pretreatment with alarin 6-25Cys. The above-mentioned results suggest that the central alarin projective system may facilitate insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake via the increase in GLUT4 content and GLUT4 translocation from intracellular pools to plasma membranes in T2DR.
