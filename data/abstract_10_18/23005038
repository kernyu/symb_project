The emergence of fluconazole-resistant Candida (FRC) is worrisome, but little is known about susceptibility patterns in different nosocomial settings. We prospectively analysed Candida bloodstream isolates in 18 medical centres in Israel (six tertiary-care and 12 community hospitals). The study included 444 episodes of candidaemia (450 patient-specific isolates, 8.5% fluconazole-resistant). Institutional FRC bloodstream infection rates correlated with annual inpatient days, and were strongly associated with the presence and activity of haematology/oncology services. Infection with Candida krusei and fluconazole-resistant Candida glabrata occurred exclusively in hospitals with >600 beds. These findings suggest that empirical antifungal strategies should be tailored to the nosocomial setting.
