The emergence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in the United States represents a serious danger to people who are hospitalized and is associated with case mortality rates as high as 50 percent. CRE infections have limited treatment options and the potential to spread widely if prevention and transmission measures are not employed. Decreasing the impact of CRE requires coordinated efforts between nurses and other clinicians, as well as administrators, to improve patient outcomes.
