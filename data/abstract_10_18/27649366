BACKGROUND: A new vaccine candidate against pneumococcus is being developed in Cuba, and it is a priority of the national health system. There is limited information on nasopharyngeal colonization burden, though it is essential for monitoring the impact of the vaccine. The study aims to estimate the prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization in children 2-18 months of age and identify circulating serotypes, antimicrobial resistance and its association with selected risk factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October and December 2013 in Cienfuegos municipality. Inclusion criteria were evaluated, and informed consent was obtained from the parents. Clinical and epidemiologic data were collected through a semistructured questionnaire. Nasopharyngeal swabs according to established protocols were taken. Data analysis included frequency distributions and comparison of proportions. The association between colonization and selected risk factors was assessed by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 984 children (87.2% living in urban areas) were included. The overall prevalence of colonization was 21.6%. The most frequent serotypes isolated were 6A (23.1%), 23F (10.8%), 6B (10.3%), 19F (8.5%) and 14 (3.3%). We found no resistance to beta-lactamases in circulating serotypes. Living with sibling younger than 5 years, previous respiratory infections, previous hospitalization and day-care attendance were determinants of nasopharyngeal carriage. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the burden of pneumococcal disease and colonization in Cuba could be significantly affected after vaccine introduction.
