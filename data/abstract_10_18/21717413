Without treatment, Cushing's disease has significant morbidity and mortality. Where a surgical approach may not be feasible, or is refused by the patient, medical therapy becomes the only option. In this case report, we discuss the effects of two years of ketoconazole treatment on diabetes regulation and insulin resistance in a patient reluctant to agree to surgery. A 62 year-old female patient with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus was investigated. Cushing's disease was confirmed by the results of high urine free cortisol level and dexamethasone suppression tests. We discuss the effects of two years of 600 mg/day ketoconazole treatment on diabetes regulation and insulin resistance in a patient with Cushing's disease reluctant to agree to surgery. This case report illustrates the beneficial long-term effects of 24 months of ketoconazole treatment on the clinical and laboratory findings and also on steroid and glucose metabolism.
