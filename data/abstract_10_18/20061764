PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing of rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) isolated from various clinically suspected cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, from January 2007 to April 2008, at a tertiary care centre in Mumbai. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The specimens were processed for microscopy and culture using the standard procedures. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by broth microdilution, using Sensititre CA MHBT. Susceptibility testing was also carried out on Mueller Hinton agar by the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 1062 specimens received for mycobacterial cultures, 104 (9.79%) grew mycobacteria. Of the mycobacterial isolates, six (5.76%) were rapid growers. M. abscessus and M. chelonae appeared to be resistant organisms, with M. chelonae showing intermediate resistance to amikacin and minocycline. However, all the six isolates showed sensitivity to vancomycin and gentamicin by the disc diffusion test. Also all three isolates of M. abscessus were sensitive to piperacillin and erythromycin. Further studies are required to test their sensitivity to these four antimicrobials by using the microbroth dilution test, before they can be prescribed to patients. CONCLUSIONS: We wish to emphasize that reporting of rapidly growing mycobacteria from clinical settings, along with their sensitivity patterns, is an absolute need of the hour.
