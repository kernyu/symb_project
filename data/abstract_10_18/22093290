Most cases of donor-derived infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa reported in the literature are associated with vascular dehiscence, all of which resulted either in death or graft failure requiring graft removal. We report the successful treatment of donor-derived infection due to multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa in a 64-year-old male who presented with bacteremia and peritransplant renal fluid collection after undergoing deceased-donor renal transplantation. As a result of the report of positive donor cultures by the host Organ Procurement Organization, the infection was promptly identified by blood cultures drawn before appearance of symptoms. Surveillance blood cultures in recipients are not usually recommended. However, they should be done if donor cultures turn positive. Therefore, it is crucial to perform cultures in donors and to closely follow them up for early identification and prompt treatment of donor-transmitted infections due to organisms like P. aeruginosa that can be graft and/or life threatening.
