BACKGROUND: Malaria prevention has remained a critical area in the absence of efficacious vaccines against malaria. Drugs currently used as chemotherapeutics are also used in chemoprophylaxis increasing possible drug resistance. Asiatic acid is a natural phytochemical with oxidant, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties with emerging anti-malarial potential. The influence of asiatic acid administration prior to Plasmodium berghei infection of Sprague-Dawley rats on parasitaemia induction is here reported. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats (90-120 g) were administered with asiatic acid (10 mg/kg) 48 h before intraperitoneal infection with P. berghei. Parasitaemia induction and progression, food and water intake as well as weight were compared to 30 mg/kg chloroquine-treated and infected control rats during sub-chronic studies (21 days). RESULTS: Asiatic acid pre-infection administration preserved food and water intake as well as increase in percentage weight gain of infected animals. In pre-infection treated animals, the pre-patent period was extended to day 6 from 72 h. Asiatic acid suppressed parasitaemia while oral chloroquine (30 mg/kg) did not influence malaria induction. CONCLUSIONS: Per-oral, pre-infection, asiatic acid administration influenced parasitaemia patency and parasitaemia progression, food, water, and weight gain percentage. This may suggest possible chemoprophylaxis effects of asiatic acid in malaria.
