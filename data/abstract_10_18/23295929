We evaluated the efficacy of voriconazole against nine strains of Aspergillus terreus with different MICs (0.12 to 4 mug/ml) by using a murine model. Markers of efficacy included survival, tissue burden, galactomannan antigenemia, and drug serum levels. Voriconazole was especially effective in prolonging survival and reducing the fungal load in infections by strains that showed MICs that were less than or equal to the epidemiological cutoff value (1 mug/ml). In vitro data might be useful for predicting the outcome of A. terreus infections.
