The aim of this work was to evaluate the evolution of Enterobacteriaceae resistance to third generation cephalosporin (3CG) from 2000 to 2008 at Perpignan hospital. Were observed: the percentage of strains isolated from short stay wards, intensive care unit and medium and long-term care facility. The percentage of strains isolated from: urine, suppuration, tracheal aspiration, and blood have been evaluated. The proportion of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains among the Enterobacteriaceae strains intermediate (I) or resistant (R) to 3GC was also evaluated.The number of Enterobacteriaceae intermediated (I) or resistant (R) to 3GC increased (402 %).The distribution of species I or R to 3GC has changed, decrease of Klebsielle pneumoniae and Enterobacter aeorogenes species, Escherichia.coli and Enterobacter cloacae became dominant in 2008. We noted the change of isolated species distribution, urines represent the main source of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae (MRE), 72 % of strains. The profile of patients colonised or infected by MRE has changed. Patients mainly infected with hospital acquirred MRE changed to MRE colonised patients carrying the strain into the hospital. The association of fluorinated quinolone resistance and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Enterobacteriaceae represented 51 % in 2000, became stable at 73 % from 2002. The association of fluorinated quinolone resistance and high-level Enterobacteriaceae cephalosporinase has increased from 21 % in 2000 to be stable at 50 % since 2006. The mesures to contain the spread of MRE strains remained inefficient because of outpatients circulation, multiresistant E. coli being community species.
