This issue of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics focuses on emerging infections. The outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., measles) and the emerging pathogens (e.g., Ebola) show us how small the world has become. These outbreaks also show the pressing need for effective public education and development of novel therapies. This issue covers various aspects of relevant therapeutic topics ranging from preclinical models, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics, and clinical trial results, to education efforts in this area. Pharmacokinetic/dynamic modeling had an appreciable role in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, recent emerging infections. However, these gains could be lessened by poor adherence to therapies, which has contributed to the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. We must not forget lessons from previous infections, or they may reemerge.
