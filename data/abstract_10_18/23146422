We determined the ability of some phytochemicals, including alkaloids (glaucine, harmine, and sanguinarine), phenolics (EGCG and thymol), and terpenoids (menthol, aromadendrene, beta-sitosterol-O-glucoside, and beta-carotene), alone or in combination with the saponin digitonin to reverse the relative multi-drug resistance of Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 cells to the chemotherapeutical agent doxorubicin. The IC(50) of doxorubicin in Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 was 4.22 and 44.08muM, respectively. Combination of non-toxic concentrations of individual secondary metabolite with doxorubicin synergistically sensitized Caco-2 and CEM/ADR5000 cells, and significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. Furthermore, three-drug combinations (secondary metabolite+digitonin+doxorubicin) were even more powerful. The best synergist was the benzophenanthridine alkaloid sanguinarine. It reduced the IC(50) value of doxorubicin 17.58-fold in two-drug combinations (sanguinarine+doxorubicin) and even 35.17-fold in three-drug combinations (sanguinarine+digitonin+doxorubicin) in Caco-2 cells. Thus synergistic drug combinations offer the possibility to enhance doxorubicin efficacy in chemotherapy.
