There is a lack of surveillance data on resistance to fusidic acid (FA) in Asia, and no reviews of FA usage for the treatment of orthopaedic infections have been conducted since the year 2000. In this study, we present a systemic literature review of FA resistance in Asia and the clinical use of FA for the treatment of bone and joint infections (BJIs). The in vitro activity of FA against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates remains good, with low (<10%) resistance rates in most Asian countries. FA in Asia appears to be a better oral anti-MRSA agent than trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin. More than 80 cases of FA use for BJI have been reported since 2000 and the recurrence or failure rate is <10%. There is much evidence supporting the use of FA in combination with other antibiotics (e.g. rifampicin) as an oral treatment following intravenous glycopeptide treatment for BJIs.
