We evaluated antimalarial and/or chloroquine-resistance reversing effects of five opioid receptor antagonists. Although none of the evaluated compounds showed antimalarial effects, some of them, especially the delta(1) receptor antagonist, 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX) exhibited potent chloroquine-resistance reversing effects in Plasmodium chabaudi.
