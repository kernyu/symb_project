Analysis of the genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. KCB13F003 showed the presence of a cryptic gene cluster encoding flavin-dependent halogenase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Pleiotropic approaches using multiple culture media followed by LC-MS-guided isolation and spectroscopic analysis enabled the identification of two new chlorinated cyclic hexapeptides, ulleungmycins A and B (1 and 2). Their structures, including absolute configurations, were determined by 1D and 2D NMR techniques, advanced Marfey's analysis, and GITC derivatization. The new peptides, featuring unusual amino acids 5-chloro-l-tryptophan and d-homoleucine, exhibited moderate antibacterial activities against Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria including methicillin-resistant and quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
