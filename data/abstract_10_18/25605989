AIM: To observe the effect of response-guided add-on therapy with adefovir (ADV) and lamivudine (LAM) in cirrhotic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with CHB and cirrhosis were divided into three arms according to hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level after 24 wk LAM monotherapy: Arm A (complete response, HBV DNA </= 60 IU/mL, n = 49), Arm B (partial response, HBV DNA: 60-2000 IU/mL, n = 31) and Arm C (inadequate response, HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL, n = 20). ADV was added to LAM at week 48 in Arms A and B, but at week 24 in Arm C. Virological response, YMDD mutations, biochemical response, and liver function were evaluated. RESULTS: Comparison of the three arms demonstrated that early complete virologic response at week 24 was associated with maintained viral suppression (undetectable rate of HBV DNA at week 144 was 95.96%, 66.67% and 35.29%, respectively, P = 0.000) and reduced YMDD mutations (mutation rate at week 144 was 0%, 3.23% and 15%, respectively, P = 0.015) after 144 wk treatment. For patients who failed to achieve complete virological response at week 24, switching to combination therapy further decreased HBV DNA level by 1 log10 IU/mL. All three arms obtained biochemical benefits including decline of alanine aminotransferase and elevation of albumin. In patients who developed HBV DNA breakthrough for YMDD mutations, ADV add-on therapy did not induce further multiple drug resistance to LAM or ADV. CONCLUSION: Optimized response-guided add-on therapy of ADV and LAM maintains long-term suppression of HBV DNA and improves liver function in CHB patients with compensated liver cirrhosis.
