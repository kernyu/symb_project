BACKGROUND: Candida species are the main cause of hospital acquired fungal bloodstream infections. The main risk factors for candidemia include parenteral nutrition, long-term intensive care, neutropenia, diabetes, abdominal surgery and the use of central venous catheters. The antifungal drugs used to treat candidemia are mainly the echinocandins, however some isolates may be resistant to these drugs. AIMS: This work aims to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility patterns of various Candida species isolated from blood samples and provide their identification by molecular characterization. METHODS: Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using the broth microdilution method. The sequencing of the ITS and D1/D2 regions of rDNA was used for molecular characterization. RESULTS: Seventy-four of the 80 isolates were susceptible to anidulafungin, 5 were intermediate, and 1 was resistant. For micafungin 67 were susceptible, 8 were intermediate and 5 were resistant. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B. Lastly, 65 isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, 8 were dose-dependent and 4 were resistant. The molecular identification corroborated the phenotypic data in 91.3% of the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Antifungal susceptibility data has an important role in the treatment of candidemia episodes. It was also concluded that the molecular analysis of isolates provides an accurate identification and identifies genetic variability within Candida species isolated from patients with candidemia.
