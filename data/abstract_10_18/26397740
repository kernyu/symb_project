Mitogenic actions of estrogens are mediated by two distinct estrogen receptors (ERs), which are critical in the progression and therapeutic response of breast cancer. ER expression is a dynamic phenomenon that is regulated by numerous factors, including cytokines, in the tumor microenvironment. Recently, studies have shown that autocrine production of IL-4 promotes cancer cell growth and there is negative correlation between tumor IL-4 and hormone receptor levels, suggesting that there is crosstalk between cytokine receptors and ER. Thus, we evaluated for interaction between the two ERs and the cytokines IL-4 and IFN-gamma, and if this interaction modulates malignant behavior. We identified that ERbeta exerts protective activity in the progression of breast cancer cell line MCF-7, which co-expresses ERalpha and ERbeta. IFN-gamma and IL-4 have the opposite effects on malignant biological behavior. Furthermore, we found positive correlation between IFN-gamma and ERbeta expression in MCF-7. We also determined that autocrine IFN-gamma in MCF-7 increases mRNA expression of ERbeta resulting in enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen (TAM). These results indicate that ERbeta and autocrine IFN-gamma represent two putative targets for breast cancer therapy.
