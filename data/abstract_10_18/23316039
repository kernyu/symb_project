The orthologous penR and pntR genes from the pentalenolactone biosynthetic gene clusters of Streptomyces exfoliatus UC5319 and S. arenae TU469, respectively, were predicted to encode MarR/SlyA family transcriptional regulators, responsible for regulation of the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic pentalenolactone. The intrinsic target DNA sequences and small molecule ligands of purified recombinant PenR and PntR were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. PenR bound to DNA from both the penR-gapN and penM-penH intergenic regions, while PntR bound only the corresponding pntR-gapR intergenic region. The targets of PenR and PntR were shown to be limited to conserved 37-bp DNA segments. Pentalenolactone and two late-stage biosynthetic intermediates, pentalenolactones D and F, act as ligands of both PenR and PntR, resulting in release of these proteins from their target DNA. The production of pentalenolactones was significantly decreased in the penR deletion mutant S. exfoliatus DeltapenR ZD27 but could be restored by complementation with either penR or pntR. Reverse transcription-PCR established that transcription of pentalenolactone biosynthetic and resistance genes decreased, while that of the penR gene itself increased in the penR deletion mutant S. exfoliatus ZD27 compared to the wild-type strain. The PenR protein thus serves as a positive regulator of pentalenolactone biosynthesis and self-resistance while acting as an autorepressor of penR.
