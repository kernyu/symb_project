Summer mortalities of Crassostreagigas are a major concern in oyster aquaculture. They are the result of a complex interaction between the host, pathogens and environmental factors. Oyster genetics have been identified as an essential determinant of oyster susceptibility to summer mortalities. As the capability of oysters to circumvent diseases depends in part on their immune defenses, we aimed to analyze the gene expression and sequence polymorphism of 42 immune related genes in two oyster lines selected for their "High" (H) and "Low" (L) survival to summer mortalities. Results showed that the variability of gene expression and the sequence polymorphism acting on particular genes could enable the discrimination between H and L oyster lines. Besides, a higher sequence polymorphism was observed on the L line affecting 11 of the 42 analyzed genes. By analyzing gene expression, sequence polymorphism and gene copy number of two antimicrobial peptide families (Cg-Defs and Cg-Prp), and an antimicrobial protein (Cg-BPI) on individual oysters, we showed that gene expression and/or sequence polymorphism could also discriminate H and L oyster lines. Finally, we observed a positive correlation between the gene expression and the gene copy number of antimicrobials and that sequence polymorphism could be encoded in the genome. Overall, this study gives new insights in the relationship between oyster immunity and divergent phenotypes, and discusses the potential implication of antimicrobial diversity in oyster survival to summer mortalities.
