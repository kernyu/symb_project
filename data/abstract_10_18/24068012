For decades, third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) have been major drugs used to treat infections due to Enterobacteriaceae; growing resistance to these antibiotics makes the rapid detection of such resistance important. The betaLacta test is a chromogenic test developed for detecting 3GC-resistant isolates from cultures on solid media within 15 min. A multicenter prospective study conducted in 5 French and Belgian hospitals evaluated the performance of this test on clinical isolates. Based on antibiotic susceptibility testing, strains resistant or intermediate to cefotaxime or ceftazidime were classified as 3GC resistant, and molecular characterization of this resistance was performed. The rates of 3GC resistance were 13.9% (332/2,387) globally, 9.4% in Escherichia coli (132/1,403), 25.6% in Klebsiella pneumoniae (84/328), 30.3% in species naturally producing inducible AmpC beta-lactamases (109/360), and 5.6% in Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter koseri (7/124). The sensitivities and specificities of the betaLacta test were, respectively, 87.7% and 99.6% overall, 96% and 100% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and 67.4% and 99.6% for species naturally producing inducible AmpC beta-lactamase. False-negative results were mainly related to 3GC-resistant strains producing AmpC beta-lactamase. Interestingly, the test was positive for all 3GC-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates (n = 241). The positive predictive value was 97% and remained at >/=96% for prevalences of 3GC resistance ranging between 10 and 30%. The negative predictive values were 99% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae and 89% for the species producing inducible AmpC beta-lactamase. In conclusion, the betaLacta test was found to be easy to use and efficient for the prediction of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, particularly in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains.
