The study was undertaken to evaluate the antibiotic sensitivity of microorganisms that were used in biotechnological production and belonged to different taxons: gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus thuringiensis) and gram-negative (Alcaligenes denitrificans and Pseudomonas caryophylii) bacteria and noncardioform actinomycetes (Rhodococcus erythropolis and Rhodococcus corallinus). The sensitivity of the strains to a range of antibiotics was determined by the agar diffuse method. Industrial strains responded differently to test antibiotics. Gram-positive spore-forming bacteria of the genus Bacillus are most sensitive to antibiotics; the representatives of the genus Rhodococcus are moderately sensitive and the gram-negative bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas and Alcaligenes are resistant to a large number of basic antibiotics and new-generation ones. The findings were made to serve as the basis for developing selective microbiological assays for environment quality control (the air of populated areas or a working zone), which were legally adopted.
