Cases of invasive fungal infections are increasing globally due to an increase in the immunosuppressed population, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the invasive instrumentation of patients in intensive care units. Ongoing emergence of resistance and problems with toxicity have resulted in the need for the development of new antifungal agents. Anidulafungin, the most recently developed echinocandin, is approved by the US FDA for treatment of candidemia, other forms of Candida infection and esophageal candidiasis in non-neutropenic adult patients, but it is not currently licensed for pediatric usage. The drug is projected to be distinctive owing to its unique pharmacokinetics and is already listed in adult antifungal treatment guidelines. In this article, anidulafungin will be reviewed with a focus on pediatric patients.
