Susceptibilities to antifungal drugs of 1083 Candida isolates collected in Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts in 2010 were determined. There were 422 (39%) C. albicans, 270 (24.9%) C. tropicalis, 258 (23.8%) C. glabrata, 87 (8%) C. parapsilosis, 18 (1.7%) C. krusei, and 28 (2.6%) of 13 other species. In the present study, we have applied species-specific clinical breakpoints for common species and epidemiological cutoff values for rare species. We found that majority of isolates were susceptible to tested drugs. A total of 15, 3, 2, and 0 isolates were not susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B, and anidulafungin, respectively. We found that three of the four fluconazole non-susceptible C. albicans isolates were resistant to voriconazole. Hence, there is an issue of cross-resistance among azole-type drugs.
