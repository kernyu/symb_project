BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While selective, bitter tasting, TAS2R agonists can relax agonist-contracted airway smooth muscle (ASM), their mechanism of action is unclear. However, ASM contraction is regulated by Ca(2)(+) signalling and Ca(2)(+) sensitivity. We have therefore investigated how the TAS2R10 agonists chloroquine, quinine and denotonium regulate contractile agonist-induced Ca(2)(+) signalling and sensitivity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Airways in mouse lung slices were contracted with either methacholine (MCh) or 5HT and bronchodilation assessed using phase-contrast microscopy. Ca(2)(+) signalling was measured with 2-photon fluorescence microscopy of ASM cells loaded with Oregon Green, a Ca(2)(+)-sensitive indicator (with or without caged-IP(3)). Effects on Ca(2)(+) sensitivity were assessed on lung slices treated with caffeine and ryanodine to permeabilize ASM cells to Ca(2)(+) . KEY RESULTS: The TAS2R10 agonists dilated airways constricted by either MCh or 5HT, accompanied by inhibition of agonist-induced Ca(2)(+) oscillations. However, in non-contracted airways, TAS2R10 agonists, at concentrations that maximally dilated constricted airways, did not evoke Ca(2)(+) signals in ASM cells. Ca(2)(+) increases mediated by the photolysis of caged-IP(3) were also attenuated by chloroquine, quinine and denotonium. In Ca(2)(+)-permeabilized ASM cells, the TAS2R10 agonists dilated MCh- and 5HT-constricted airways. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: TAS2R10 agonists reversed bronchoconstriction by inhibiting agonist-induced Ca(2)(+) oscillations while simultaneously reducing the Ca(2)(+) sensitivity of ASM cells. Reduction of Ca(2)(+) oscillations may be due to inhibition of Ca(2)(+) release through IP(3) receptors. Further characterization of bronchodilatory TAS2R agonists may lead to the development of novel therapies for the treatment of bronchoconstrictive conditions.
