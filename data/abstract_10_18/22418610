BACKGROUND: Device associated infections (DAIs) have major impact on patient morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This study involved active prospective surveillance to measure the incidence of DAIs, evaluate microbiological profiles, and investigate excessive mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) in 3 hospitals of Cairo University applying the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network case definitions for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Data were collected between March 2009 and May 2010. RESULTS: A total of 1,101 patients were hospitalized for a total of 10,869 days, had 4,734 device-days, and acquired 97 DAIs, with an overall rate of 20.5/1,000 ICU days. VAP was the most commonly identified infection (88.7%); followed by CLABSI (8.2%) and CAUTI (3.1%). Excess mortality was 48% (relative risk, 1.9; P < .001) for CAUTI, 12.9% (relative risk, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.4; P < .05) for VAP, and 45.7% for CLABSI. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most frequently isolated pathogen (36.1%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (29.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%). High antimicrobial resistance was identified, with 85% of A baumannii isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin and imipenem, 76% of K pneumoniae isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and 56.3% P aeruginosa isolates resistant to imipenem (56.3%). CONCLUSION: High rates of DAI and antimicrobial resistance require strengthening infection control, instituting surveillance systems, and implementing evidence-based preventive strategies.
