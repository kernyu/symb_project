Over the past several years, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the mprF open reading frame (ORF) have been proposed to be associated with a gain-of-function phenotype in terms of daptomycin (DAP) nonsusceptibility (referred to as daptomycin resistance [DAP-R] herein for ease of presentation) in Staphylococcus aureus. We investigated the frequencies of SNPs within the mprF ORF and the relationships of such SNPs to cross-resistance between DAP and cationic host defense peptides (HDPs). Thirty-five well-characterized, unique DAP-susceptible (DAP-S) and DAP-R methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates of the clonal complex 5 genotype were used. In addition to mprF SNPs and DAP-HDP cross-resistance, several other key genotypic and phenotypic metrics often associated with DAP-R were delineated, as follows: (i) mprF expression, (ii) membrane phospholipid content, (iii) positive surface charge, (iv) DAP binding, and (v) cell wall thickness profiles. A number of DAP-S strains (MICs of </= 1 mug/ml) exhibited mprF SNPs, occasionally with high-level mprF sequence variation from the genotype reference strain. However, none of these SNPs were localized to well-chronicled mprF hot spot locations associated with DAP-R in S. aureus. In contrast, all 8 DAP-R isolates demonstrated SNPs within such known mprF hot spots. Moreover, only the DAP-R strains showed MprF gain-of-function phenotypes, enhanced mprF expression, higher survival against two prototypical HDPs, and reduced DAP binding. Although a heterogenous array of mprF SNPs were often found in DAP-S strains, only selected hot spot SNPs, combined with concurrent mprF dysregulation, were associated with the DAP-R phenotype.
