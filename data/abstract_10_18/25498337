We collected nasal, axilla, and groin swabs from 252 adult patients from 2 nephrology centers in Hong Kong. Staphylococcus lugdunensis carriage was detected in 51.6% patients (groin, 39.3%; axilla, 19.8%; nose, 17.9%). The carriage rates of methicillin-sensitive S. lugdunensis and methicillin-resistant S. lugdunensis (MRSL) were 46.0% and 8.3%, respectively. Independent risk factors for S. lugdunensis carriage included male sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.4), hemodialysis (OR, 2.2), and aged 18-50years (OR, 2.4). The isolates belonged to 10 pulsotype clusters (n=129) and 8 singletons (n=8). All MRSL and most gentamicin- and tetracycline-resistant strains were found in a predominating sequence type 3 clone, designated HKU1, which accounted for 51.8% of all colonizing S. lugdunensis strains. The 21 MRSL isolates had SCCmec type V (n=18), type IV (n=2), and type I (n=1). The finding highlights the potential for dissemination of multidrug resistance through successful S. lugdunensis clones.
