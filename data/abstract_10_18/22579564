The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms and patterns of antimicrobial resistance among the isolates obtained from burned patients with wound infections at a teaching hospital in Tehran, Iran. A total of 23 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were collected from patients with burn wound infections between August 2009 and July 2010 from a hospital in Tehran. The susceptibility of these strains against 11 antimicrobial agents was determined by E-test according to the CLSI guidelines. All the resistant strains were then subjected to PCR assay for 28 distinct resistance genes. The most active antimicrobial agent was colistin with 100% sensitivity followed by gentamicin, amikacin and imipenem with 69.5%, 52.1% and 51.1% sensitivity, respectively. The most frequent resistance genes detected were bla(OXA-51-like) genes (n=23; 100%) that was intrinsic to A. baumannii isolates, gyrA (n=23; 100%), carO (n=23; 100%), tetA (n=22; 95.5%), tetB (n=15; 65.2%), intI (n=13; 56.5%) and PER (n=12; 52.1%), respectively. In order to make a proper choice of antibiotic for burn patients, it would be beneficial to physicians to identify drug resistance patterns in A. baumannii isolates.
