Linezolid (LZD) is an important antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci. And until now, LZD resistance in clinical is still rare. Here we reported the first case of LZD resistance Staphylococcus capitis in Jiangsu, China. This strain was isolated from a 92-year old female who received long-term and repeatedly antibiotics treatment because of recurrent pulmonary infections in August 2012. Isolated from blood, the Staphylococcus capitis showed a resistance to LZD with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 64 microg/mL, and the followed gene detection showed that the isolates existed C2190T and C2561Y point mutations in the 23S rRNA. Moreover, the isolation was also found carrying the cfr gene.
