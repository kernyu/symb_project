Eight new triterpenoids, prototiamins A-G (1-6, 9) and seco-tiaminic acid A (10), were isolated along with four known compounds from the bark of Entandrophragma congoense. Their structures were elucidated by means of HRMS and different NMR techniques and chemical transformations. Assignments of relative and absolute configurations for the new compounds were achieved using NOESY experiments and by chemical modification including the advanced Mosher's method. Additionally, the structure and relative configuration of compound 3 were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Compounds 1, 3, and 5 displayed significant in vitro antiplasmodial activity against the erythrocytic stages of chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum strain NF54. Prototiamin C (3) was the most potent of the compounds isolated, with an IC50 value of 0.44 muM. All compounds tested showed low cytotoxicity for the L6 rat skeletal myoblast cell line.
