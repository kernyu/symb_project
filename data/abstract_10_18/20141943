The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of the association of Listeria and Salmonella with shrimp surfaces on the effects of temperature, chlorine and acids on their survival. Planktonic, attached and colonized cells of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, L. monocytogenes V7, Salmonella Senftenberg 1734b and S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 were challenged with high (50 degrees , 60 degrees and 70 degrees C) and low (4 degrees C) temperature, 100 ppm sodium hypochlorite solution, and acetic, hydrochloric and lactic acids (pH 4.0). Attached and colonized Listeria and Salmonella showed significantly greater (p < 0.05) resistance to heat ( approximately 1.3-2.6 fold increase in D-values), hypochlorite ( approximately 6.6 >or= 40.0 fold) and acids ( approximately 4.0-9.0 fold) than their planktonic counterparts. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the survival of planktonic, attached or colonized cells of Listeria and Salmonella stored under refrigerated conditions. The association of Listeria and Salmonella with shrimp surfaces enhances their resistance to heat, chlorine and acids. Both attachment to, and subsequent colonization of, shrimp surfaces by pathogens may reduce the efficacy of methods used in their control. Strategies to reduce attachment of these pathogens to shrimp are required to assure safety of this product.
