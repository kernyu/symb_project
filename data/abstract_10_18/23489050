The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of O1, O139, and non-O1 and non-O139 Vibrio cholerae, which were associated with fresh and raw seafood samples harvested from Cochin, India waters during 2009-2011. Results from V. cholerae-specific biochemical, molecular, and serological assays identified five El Tor V. cholerae O1 Ogawa strains and 377 non-O1, non-O139 V. cholerae strains from 265 seafood samples. V. cholerae O139 strains were not isolated. Polymerase chain reaction assays confirmed the presence of V. cholerae O1 El Tor biotype in seafood. Antibiotic susceptibility analysis revealed that the V. cholerae O1 strains were pansusceptible to 20 test antibiotics, whereas 26%, 40%, 62%, and 84% of the non-O1, non-O139 V. cholerae strains were resistant to cefpodoxime, ticarcillin, augmentin, and colistin, respectively. Detection of virulence and regulatory genes in V. cholerae associated with seafood revealed the presence of virulence and regulatory genes (i.e., ctx, zot, ace, toxR genes) in V. cholerae O1 strains, nevertheless, presence of ace and toxR genes were detected in non-O1, non-O139 in 9.8 and 91% strains, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of pathogenic V. cholerae in seafood harvested from local Cochin waters warrants the introduction of a postharvest seafood monitoring program, which will lead to a greater understanding of the distribution, abundance, and virulence of diverse pathogenic Vibrio populations that inhabit these different coastal regions so that a risk management program can be established.
