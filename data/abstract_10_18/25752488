Tuberculosis is one of the main causes of mortality with 1.5 million deaths a year worldwide. The growing emergence of multi- and extremely resistant strains highlights the urgent need of novel antibiotic strategies. Ethionamide, interfering with the mycobacterial membrane biosynthesis, is used in second-line treatment. This molecule is a prodrug, which requires activation by EthA. The patent described in this evaluation (WO2014049107A1) claimed a new family of molecules and their use as antibiotic treatment against mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. leprae and atypical mycobacteria, either as a single active agent or in combination with antibiotics activable by EthA pathway.
