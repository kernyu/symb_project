The highly stable innocuous niosomes composed of four components (Triton X 100, polyethylene glycol 2000, water, Span 80) have been prepared successfully and characterized using particle size analyzer, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The mean size has been found to be in the range 200-300 nm. The optimization of niosomes has been carried out using fluorescence spectroscopy. An attempt has been made to incorporate anti-tuberculosis drugs (ATD's) in the prepared niosomes. The stability and encapsulation efficiency of these drugs in the niosome have also been assessed and high encapsulation efficiency is observed. Such high encapsulation efficiency will serve as an advantage to solve the problem of multi-drug resistance in case of tuberculosis. Release studies and kinetics have been carried out to investigate the release behavior of drugs from the prepared niosomes. Fickian or diffusional release has been observed for rifampicin and isoniazid and a non-Fickian release mechanism for pyrazinamide. Fluorescence probe quenching technique has been used to determine the location and distribution coefficient of the ATD's in niosome/water system.
