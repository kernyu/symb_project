OBJECTIVE: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) take part of the human skin and mucous membranes, but they are also involving in infections with the increasing use of prosthetic, indwelling devices or intravascular catheter-related bacteraemia. They are more resistance than Staphylococcus aureus against a wide range of antimicrobial agents, and it have been observed an increase in morbidity and mortality of patients with incorrect treatment. METHODS: To analyze the results obtained by different commercial techniques: two automatic microdilution systems (MicroScan and Vitek2 Compact), PBP2a agglutiation test, with and without 1 mug oxacillin disk induction, and detection of mecA gene by nucleic acids amplification techniques, for the diagnosis of methicillin resistance staphylococci in 170 strains of CoNS isolated from blood cultures. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy methicillin resistance staphylococci were detected by MicroScan, 167 strains by Vitek 2 Compact, 115 strains were PBP2a positive without oxacillin induction and 168 after oxacillin induction. Finally, 167 strains were mecA gene positive detected by nucleic acids amplification techniques. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to do oxacillin induction before PBP2a test to avoid false negatives. There are a great variability in the phenotypic expression of methicillin resistance in CoNS.
