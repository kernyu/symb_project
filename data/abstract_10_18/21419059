Although old techniques remain important, new techniques offer new possibilities. Mutations conferring resistance to rifampin and isoniazid can be detected in primary specimens from infectious pulmonary cases. Infections can be detected with interferon-gamma release assays, and chains of transmission can be detected by mycobacteria interspersed repetitive units. Centralized diagnostics makes it possible to apply results of routine analyses in national and international surveillance.
