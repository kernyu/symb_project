OBJECTIVES: The increasing incidence of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa along with the discovery of novel metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) is of concern. In this study, the isolation of Malaysian MBL-producing P. aeruginosa clinical strains was investigated. METHODS: Fifty-three P. aeruginosa clinical strains were isolated from different patients in Sultanah Aminah Hospital, Johor Bahru, Malaysia in 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was conducted. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem and meropenem were determined by Etest. The carbapenem-resistant strains were screened for MBL production by IMP-EDTA double disk synergy test (DDST), MBL imipenem/imipenem-inhibitor (IP/IPI) Etest and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genotyping was performed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. RESULTS: Three (5.7%) clinical strains were identified as MBL producers. Multidrug resistance was observed in the three strains, and two were resistant to all the antimicrobials tested. Sequencing analysis confirmed the three strains to harbour carbapenemase genes: one with blaIMP-1, one with blaVIM-2 and the other with blaNDM-1 genes. These multidrug resistant strains were identified as sequence type (ST) 235 and ST308. CONCLUSIONS: None of the blaIMP-1 and blaNDM-1 genes have been reported in Malaysian P. aeruginosa. The emergence of imipenemase 1 (IMP-1)- and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing P. aeruginosa in Malaysia maybe travel-associated.
