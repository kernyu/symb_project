We report here a series of five chemically diverse scaffolds that have in vitro activities on replicating and hypoxic nonreplicating bacilli by targeting the respiratory bc1 complex in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a strain-dependent manner. Deletion of the cytochrome bd oxidase generated a hypersusceptible mutant in which resistance was acquired by a mutation in qcrB. These results highlight the promiscuity of the bc1 complex and the risk of targeting energy metabolism with new drugs.
