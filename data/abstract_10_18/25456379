Drug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are now increasingly identified as a cause of infections in immunocompromised hosts. Bacteria identified include the multidrug-resistant (MDR) and even pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae spp. The threat from MDR pathogens has been well-documented in the past decade with warnings about the consequences of inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs. Resistant bacteria can substantially complicate the treatment of infections in critically ill patients and can have a substantial effect on mortality. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment can affect morbidity, mortality, and overall health-care costs. Evidence-based data for prevention and control of MDR pathogen infections in haematology are scarce. Although not yet established a bundle of infection control and prevention measures with an anti-infective stewardship programme is an important strategy in infection control, diagnosis, and antibiotic selection with optimum regimens to ensure a successful outcome for patients.
