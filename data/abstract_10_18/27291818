With the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in our public hospitals, territory-wide implementation of directly observed hand hygiene before meals and medications for all conscious hospitalized patients reverted the rising VRE incidence of 16.5% per month (P < .001) to a reduction of -9.8% per month (P < .001). The outbreak rate reverted from an increasing trend of 10.5% per month (P < .001) to a decreasing trend of -13.3% per month (P < .001) between January 2011 and October 2015.
