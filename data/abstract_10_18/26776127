Diagnosis of drug resistance tuberculosis (TB) by the gold standard method is labour intensive and time consuming. Hence, there is an urgent need for introduction of rapid diagnostic techniques. Line probe assay (LPA) and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) have been introduced in India under Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program. Spot and morning sputum samples of previously treated patients by anti-TB drugs were subjected to LPA or CBNAAT. Total 682/1253 (54.4%) were diagnosed as rifampicin-resistant. The patients could be diagnosed early by molecular methods and put on second line treatment.
