INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) remains an entity of high prevalence and mortality worldwide. The rising drug resistance is a public health problem. Besides, non-tuberculosis mycobacterial (NTM) infections are described with increasing frequency in areas of high prevalence of TB. OBJECTIVES: To determine epidemiological, clinical and microbiological characteristics of mycobacterial infections documented by culture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, descriptive study in hospitalized patients. RESULTS: M. tuberculosis complex was identified in 90,9% of 187 patients; 9,1% had NTM, 64% were male and the mean age was 40 years (range 1-88 years). The main co-morbidities were HIV / AIDS (23.5%), use of corticosteroids (13.3%) and chronic kidney disease (9.6%). Clinical forms were pulmonary (56.6%), extra-pulmonary (23.9%) and disseminated (19.2 The most common extra-pulmonary compromise was nodal (7.4%) and gastrointestinal (7%). 10.6% of M. tuberculosis were multi-drug resistant (MDR) and 2.12% had extended drug resistance (XDR). Mycobacterium avium andM. abscessus were the most frequent NTM. Overall mortality was 10%. CONCLUSIONS: In our study immune suppression is the main risk factor for extrapulmonary and disseminated disease. Resistance, MDR and XDR is higher in inpatients with TB. MNT infections are not uncommon in our country.
