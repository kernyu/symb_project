A total of 209 Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bbr) strains isolated from pigs were examined. Phenotypic study included: biochemical characterization (motility, catalase, oxidase, urease activity, nitrate reduction and growth on MacConkey agar) and antimicrobial susceptibility (disc diffusion method). Genotypic studies based on detection of three genes encoded virulence factors, such as: flagella (fla), dermonecrotoxin (dnt), and exogenous ferric siderophore receptor (bfrZ), using PCR. Most of the Bbr strains tested had a homogeneous biochemical profile. 97.6% of them provided suitable results in biochemical tests. All Bbr isolates tested showed high resistance to penicillin (100%), linco-spectin (100%) and ceftiofur (97.9%). Over 57% and 43% of Bbr strains were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin, respectively. All Bbr isolates showed high sensitivity to most chemotherapeutics used such as enrofloxacin (97.9%), tetracycline (97.9%), oxytetracycline (97.9%), amoxicillin with clavulonic acid (95.8%), florfenicol (90.4%), and gentamicine (77.6%). Over of 94% of Bbr strains were moderately susceptible to norfloxacine. Molecular analysis confirmed that almost all evaluated Bbr strains (94.7%) possessed the fla gene. A lower percentage of isolates had the dnt gene (72.7%) and the lowest percentage of strains (51.7%), had the bfrZ gene.
