The introduction of potent combination therapies in the mid-90s had a tremendous effect on AIDS mortality. However, drug resistance has been a major factor contributing to antiretroviral therapy failure. Currently, there are 26 drugs approved for treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, although some of them are no longer prescribed. Most of the available antiretroviral drugs target HIV genome replication (i.e. reverse transcriptase inhibitors) and viral maturation (i.e. viral protease inhibitors). Other drugs in clinical use include a viral coreceptor antagonist (maraviroc), a fusion inhibitor (enfuvirtide) and two viral integrase inhibitors (raltegravir and elvitegravir). Elvitegravir and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor rilpivirine have been the most recent additions to the antiretroviral drug armamentarium. An overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in antiretroviral drug resistance and the role of drug resistance-associated mutations was previously presented (Menendez-Arias, L., 2010. Molecular basis of human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance: an update. Antiviral Res. 85, 210-231). This article provides now an updated review that covers currently approved drugs, new experimental agents (e.g. neutralizing antibodies) and selected drugs in preclinical or early clinical development (e.g. experimental integrase inhibitors). Special attention is dedicated to recent research on resistance to reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors. In addition, recently discovered interactions between HIV and host proteins and novel strategies to block HIV assembly or viral entry emerge as promising alternatives for the development of effective antiretroviral treatments.
