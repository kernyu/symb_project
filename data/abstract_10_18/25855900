OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of sepsis classification and multidrug-resistance status on outcome in patients receiving appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1,250-bed teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Individuals with Enterobacteriaceae sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock who received appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy between June 2009 and December 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical outcomes were compared according to multidrug-resistance status, sepsis classification, demographics, severity of illness, comorbidities, and antimicrobial treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 510 patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia and sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. Sixty-seven patients (13.1%) were nonsurvivors. Mortality increased significantly with increasing severity of sepsis (3.5%, 9.9%, and 28.6%, for sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, respectively; p < 0.05). Time to antimicrobial therapy was not significantly associated with outcome. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II was more predictive of mortality than age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index. Multidrug-resistance status did not result in excess mortality. Length of ICU and hospital stay increased with more severe sepsis. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, African-American race, sepsis severity, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, solid-organ cancer, cirrhosis, and transfer from an outside hospital were all predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support sepsis severity, but not multidrug-resistance status as being an important predictor of death when all patients receive appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Future sepsis trials should attempt to provide appropriate antimicrobial therapy and take sepsis severity into careful account when determining outcomes.
