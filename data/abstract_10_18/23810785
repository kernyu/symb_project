BACKGROUND: Urinary Candida infections in the hospital environment are frequent and need to be better understood. AIMS: To compare the results of antifungal susceptibility profiles of yeasts isolated from patients with urinary infections obtained by broth microdilution method (BM) and by disk diffusion (DD), and also evaluate the capacity of these yeasts to form biofilms. METHODS: Only yeasts obtained from pure urine cultures with counts higher than 10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter, without bacteria development, of symptomatic patients were included. The isolates were identified by classical methods and the antifungal susceptibility tests were performed with the following drugs: amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and caspofungin. The biofilm studies were carried out in polystyrene microtitration plates. RESULTS: Ninety-five yeasts isolates were analyzed, including 40 Candida albicans, 31 Candida glabrata, 24 Candida tropicalis. In general, the majority of the isolates were susceptible to the tested drugs but some resistance was observed, especially against fluconazole. Great variability in the antifungal susceptibility results was observed with the different tested drugs and a few discrepancies were observed between both methods. We suggest that in case of DD resistance this result should be confirmed by BM, the standard method. C. tropicalis isolates showed high biofilm production (91.7%) compared to C. albicans (82.5%) and C. glabrata (61.3%), with statistical significance (p=0.0129). CONCLUSIONS: Candiduria in critical patients requires major attention and a better control. The different susceptibility results obtained in this study showed the need to identify yeasts up to the species level, especially in patients with urinary tract infection. The development of techniques of antifungal susceptibility tests can help the clinicians in the empiric treatment of candiduria.
