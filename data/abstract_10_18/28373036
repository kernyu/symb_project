The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs continues to challenge malaria control. We assessed the therapeutic efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the first-line treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, in children under five years of age in Mozambique. We conducted a prospective one-arm study to evaluate the clinical and parasitological efficacy of AL over 28days at four sentinel sites, using the WHO protocol for assessing the efficacy of antimalarial treatment. msp1, msp2 and glurp genes were analysed by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to differentiate recrudescence from re-infection with malaria parasites. Haemoglobin concentration was recorded at baseline and on days 7, 14 and 28. A total of 349 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were recruited at the four sentinel sites. Adequate clinical and parasitological response to AL on day 28 follow-up varied from 96.3% to 100% after correction by PCR. The drug was well tolerated, and no adverse event related to the drug was reported. AL, the current first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Mozambique, remains highly efficacious at the study sites. Monitoring of the efficacy of the recommended antimalarial drugs should be continued in order to detect any emerging threat to their efficacy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12616001680459.
