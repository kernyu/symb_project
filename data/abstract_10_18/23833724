The biological approach to synthesize metal nanoparticles is an important aspect of current nanotechnology research. Silver nanoparticles have been well-known for their inhibitory and antimicrobial effects. The ever-increasing antibiotic resistance in pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms is a major threat to the health care industry. In the present investigation, silver nanoparticles have been successfully biosynthesized by Streptomyces sp JAR1. Biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by means of several analytical techniques including a UV-Visible spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction pattern analysis, and atomic force microscopy. An evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was carried out against clinically important pathogenic microorganisms. The metal nanoparticles were also evaluated for their combined effects with antibiotics against the clinical pathogens. The antibacterial activities of the antibiotics increased in the presence of the biologically synthesized AgNPs against the clinically important pathogens. The highest enhancing effect was observed for erythromycin against the test pathogens.
