Effective monitoring of the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against IFN-beta in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients on IFN-beta therapy is important for clinical decision making and disease management. To date, antiviral assays have been the favored approach for NAb determination, but variations in assay conditions between laboratories and the increasing use of novel assays have contributed to the reporting of inconsistent antibody data between laboratories and between products. This study, undertaken at the request of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is a joint effort by manufacturers of IFN-beta products (approved in Europe) towards harmonization of a NAb assay that facilitates generation of comparable NAb data, which, in conjunction with clinical outcomes, should prove useful for clinicians treating MS patients with IFN-beta products. This article describes the standardized cellular myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) protein measurement-based assay for detection of IFN-beta NAbs and its use for the validation of assays used for the quantitative determination of such antibodies. Although titers varied between laboratories and the products used, utilization of IFN-beta1a rather than IFN-beta1b as the challenge antigen produced more consistent results in the NAb assay. Adoption of the standardized assay improves comparability between laboratories circumventing problems that arise when different, nonstandardized assays are employed for immunogenicity assessment. Based on the data, the EMA recommended for standardization purposes, the use of IFN-beta1a in NAb assays, independent of the therapeutic product used for therapy and validation of new NAb procedures against the standardized assay described.
