Despite effective prevention strategies paediatric HIV infection remains an important condition in Ireland. To characterise presentation and identify barriers to optimal management a retrospective chart review of HIV-infected children presenting in Ireland, 2004-2011 was undertaken. Forty-two HIV-infected children were identified; (25 male). Median age at presentation was 6 years (range 0-16 years). 38 children (90%) were born to African mothers. Eleven (26%) were born in Ireland. Twenty-five (59%) were late diagnoses; 11 were symptomatic. Ten of 12 foreign born HIV-infected children had antiretroviral exposure with frequent resistance associated mutations. Seven of 8 children with stage C disease had previously been admitted to hospital in Ireland before diagnosis. Maternal non-adherence to recommendations and seroconversion in pregnancy challenge the goal of paediatric HIV eradication. Targeted strategies for women at risk of infection in pregnancy are required. Late HIV diagnosis remains common, highlighting the need for a more proactive approach to HIV testing.
