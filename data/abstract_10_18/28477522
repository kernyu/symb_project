Campylobacter is an important zoonotic pathogen found in livestock and can cause illness in humans following consumption of raw and undercooked meat products. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in retail meat (poultry, turkey, pork and beef) purchased in Alberta, Canada and to assess antimicrobial resistance and genetic relatedness of recovered Campylobacter strains with previously isolated strains from clinical and environmental sources. A Comparative Genomic Fingerprinting (CGF) method was used for assessing genetic relatedness of isolates. A total of 606 samples comprising 204, 110, 145 and 147 samples of retail chicken, turkey, ground beef and pork, respectively, were obtained. Campylobacter was isolated from 23.5% (48/204) of chicken samples and 14.2% (8/110) of turkey samples. Pork and beef samples were negative for Campylobacter. Campylobacter jejuni was the most common (94.6%) spp. found followed by C. coli (5.4%). Resistance to tetracycline was found in 48.1% of isolates, followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (5.5%), nalidixic acid (5.5%), azithromycin (1.78%), and erythromycin (1.78%). All isolates were susceptible to clindamycin, florfenicol, gentamicin and telithromycin. Tetracycline resistance was attributable to the presence of the tetO gene. CGF analysis showed that Campylobacter isolated from poultry meat in this study were genetically related to clinical isolates recovered from human infections and to those isolated from animals and the environment.
