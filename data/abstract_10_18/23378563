Bacteraemia and endocarditis are the most frequently reported clinical infections due to Abiotrophia defectiva species. This species has been rarely implicated in infections in neutropenic patients. We report a rare case of long-term venous catheter-related infection caused by A. defectiva that occurred in a febrile child who had neutropenia and Langerhans' cell histiocytosis.
