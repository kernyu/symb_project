Despite the incontestable benefits of telaprevir and boceprevir-based triple therapy in patients infected with genotype 1, the practitioner faces a number of new challenges. In daily clinical practice, a checklist approach may facilitate the management of triple therapy. Before initiation, several specific issues should be reviewed with the patient in order to optimize adherence and treatment outcome: potential drug to drug interaction, treatment duration and stopping rules, possible treatment outcomes, side effects, dose and administration with food advice, management of side effects. Because treatment failure is associated with the emergence of resistance-associated variants with reduced sensitivity to protease inhibitors, adherence is of major importance. In this setting, the role of educational nurse should be emphasized for the management of triple therapy in daily clinical practice.
