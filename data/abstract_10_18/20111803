Over the last decade, it has become clear that antimicrobial drugs are losing their effectiveness due to the evolution of pathogen resistance. There is therefore a continuing need to search for new antibiotics, especially as new drugs only rarely reach the market. Natural products are both fundamental sources of new chemical diversity and integral components of today's pharmaceutical compendium, and the aim of this review is to explore and highlight the diverse natural products that have potential to lead to more effective and less toxic antimicrobial drugs. Although more than 300 natural metabolites with antimicrobial activity have been reported in the period 2000-2008, this review will describe only those with potentially useful antimicrobial activity, viz. with MICs in the range 0.02-10 microg mL(-1). A total of 145 compounds from 13 structural classes are discussed, and over 100 references are cited.
