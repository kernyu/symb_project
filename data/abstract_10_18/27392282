This study investigated bacteria from soil samples to (i) determine the main bacterial genera and species having resistance to carbapenem and other beta-lactams and (ii) establish if the mechanism of resistance was due to the production of metallo-beta-lactamases. The isolates were characterized by PCR for metallo-beta-lactamases and integrons, by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and by sequencing. The antimicrobial profile of 40 imipenem-resistant Gram-positive soil isolates from all Brazilian regions demonstrated that 31 (77.5%) of them were multidrug resistant. Among the 40 isolates, 19 presented the blaVIM gene and class 1 integrons by PCR. Six of the 19 isolates were identified as Paenibacillus sp., 12 as Bacillus sp., and just 1 was classified as Staphylococcus sp., by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. These results suggest that bacteria from soil can act as a source of blaVIM-1 genes, representing a threat to public health.
