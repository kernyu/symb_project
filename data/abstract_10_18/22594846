INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is increasing on a global basis, making treatment options more limited. The development of new agents to meet this threat is a matter of urgency. Ceftaroline fosamil , a member of an advanced cephalosporin class of antimicrobials, is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Ceftaroline displays activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including both methicillin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant strains), respiratory pathogens (such as Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains) and limited coverage against Enterobacteriaceae. AREAS COVERED: Chemistry, mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, resistance, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, indications for use, safety and special populations are covered in this review. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline's unique activity against MRSA and penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant S. pneumoniae strains is due to its high affinity for penicillin binding protein (PBP)-2a and PBP-2x, respectively. In randomized, double-blinded, clinical trials, ceftaroline fosamil was found to be non-inferior to ceftriaxone for the treatment CABP and to vancomycin plus aztreonam for ABSSSI. Substantial differences between the cephalosporins exist. Ceftaroline has unique characteristics that may make it useful in specific clinical circumstances, especially against multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms.
