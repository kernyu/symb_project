Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be a novel approach to eliminate multidrug-resistant bacteria from the gut and to prevent future infections. Using whole metagenome sequencing data from 8 FMT donor-recipient pairs, we identified 37 and 95 antimicrobial resistance genes that were acquired by or removed from FMT recipients, respectively.
