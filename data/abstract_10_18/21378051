Lactobacillus salivarius 1077 (NRRL B-50053) was isolated from poultry intestinal materials, and in vitro anti-Campylobacter jejuni activity was demonstrated. The isolate was then used for bacteriocin production and its enrichment. The protein content of the cell-free supernatant from the spent medium was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and dialyzed to produce the crude antimicrobial preparation. A typical bacteriocin-like response of sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes and resistance to lysozyme, lipase, and 100 degrees C was observed with this preparation. The polypeptide was further purified by gel filtration, ion-exchange, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), Edman degradation, and isoelectrofocusing were used to characterize its 3,454-Da molecular mass, the amino acid sequence of its 37 residue components, and the isoelectric point of pI 9.1 of the bacteriocin. Bacteriocin L-1077 contained the class IIa bacteriocin signature N-terminal sequence YGNGV. MICs of bacteriocin L-1077 against 33 bacterial isolates (both Gram negative and Gram positive) ranged from 0.09 to 1.5 mug/ml. Subsequently, the therapeutic benefit of bacteriocin L-1077 was demonstrated in market-age (40- to 43-day-old) broiler chickens colonized with both C. jejuni and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. Compared with untreated control birds, both C. jejuni and S. Enteritidis counts in colonized ceca were diminished by >4 log(10) and S. Enteritidis counts in both the liver and the spleen of treated birds were reduced by 6 to 8 log(10)/g compared with those in the nontreated control birds. Bacteriocin L-1077 appears to hold promise in controlling C. jejuni/S. Enteritidis among commercial broiler chickens.
