BACKGROUND: As with any other infectious disease, we should aim for treatments offering >/=90% Helicobacter pylori eradication rates in clinical practice. AIM: To summarize optimization strategies aimed to increase the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapies. METHODS: A systematic bibliographic search (in PubMed up to August 2016) was designed to identify studies investigating optimization strategies aimed to increase the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapies. RESULTS: The most direct way to optimize a treatment is using higher doses of drugs unless it has been shown that lower doses are equally effective. Similarly, prescriptions should use 14-day duration unless a shorter scheme has been shown locally to be equally effective. Double-dose proton-pump inhibitor therapy is recommended for triple therapy and may probably increase the efficacy of nonbismuth concomitant regimen as well. The efficacy of triple therapies in the presence of resistance can be significantly improved by the addition of bismuth salts, which offer an additive effect in combination with antibiotics. Overall, probiotics seem to reduce antibiotic side effects, but the increase in eradication rates is not so evident; therefore, they cannot be generally recommended for clinical practice yet. CONCLUSIONS: Using potent acid inhibition and/or higher antibiotic doses-especially by increasing the number of daily intakes-and lengthening treatments up to 14 days improves efficacy in most regimens and should be generally recommended. Triple therapies can be efficiently improved by the addition of bismuth salts, turning them into quadruple therapies. Finally, some treatments will require a combination of optimization strategies to significantly improve results.
