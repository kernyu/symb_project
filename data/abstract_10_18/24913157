Stable resistance to metronidazole in a nontoxigenic Clostridium difficile strain was investigated at both the genomic and proteomic levels. Alterations in the metabolic pathway involving the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase were found, suggesting that reduction of metronidazole, required for its activity, may be less efficient in this strain. Proteomic studies also showed a cellular response to oxidative stress.
