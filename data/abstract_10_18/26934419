INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic options for patients with HCV-related liver disease have increased over the last two decades. In fact, the old standard of care based on the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin did not result in satisfactory eradication rates, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis. With the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), higher rates of viral clearance became possible and, patients with contraindications to interferon obtained access to treatment. However, several concerns have been raised regarding first-generation DAAs, namely their high costs, and the emergence of resistant-associated variants with low susceptibility to these drugs. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors discuss the data about the efficacy and safety of the main anti-HCV direct-acting antivirals currently in the pipeline. Furthermore, they evaluate the impact of these drugs on the therapeutic options currently available for HCV patients. EXPERT OPINION: The results of trials evaluating the effectiveness of new DAAs are encouraging. These new antivirals lead to high rates of viral eradication without relevant adverse reactions and seem to be effective regardless of viral genotypes, presence of resistant-associated variants or advanced liver disease. Consequently, with the advent of this new family of drugs, chronic HCV-related hepatitis may become a curable disease.
