A 61-year-old man living in rural Rwanda presented with a 2-month history of fevers, headaches, dry cough, weight loss and confusion. A cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed neutrophilic pleocytosis, yeast and a positive cryptococcal antigen (CrAg). An HIV antibody test was negative. The patient's cough worsened while on antifungal induction therapy with intravenous conventional amphotericin B and high-dose oral fluconazole. Computerised tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed extensive miliary infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed acid-fast bacilli on smear and a positive GeneXpert test without rifampicin resistance. The patient improved with the addition of antitubercular therapy. In this case report, we describe an unusual presentation of two opportunistic infections occurring together in an HIV-negative man with no other known immunocompromising conditions. The case highlights the fact that, in disease endemic areas, multiple disseminated infections can occur in individuals without obvious immunocompromise.
