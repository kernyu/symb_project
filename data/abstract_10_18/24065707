The emergence of multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a growing public health problem. The objective of this retrospective study was to identify risk factors associated with MDR Escherichia coli infection of the urinary tract in cats. All cats presenting with an E coli urinary infection between March 2010 and December 2012 were included and divided into two groups: an MDR group and a non-MDR group. The effects of different variables on the occurrence of an MDR E coli infection were evaluated: age, sex, additional diseases, number of antibiotics and number of days of hospitalisation. Fifty-two cats were identified (10 MDR and 42 non-MDR). The number of antibiotic groups used within the last 3 months was associated with an increased risk of MDR E coli urinary infection (P = 0.007). The association of the number of days of hospitalisation within the last 3 months and the increased risk of MDR E coli urinary infection did not reach significance (P = 0.090). This study provides evidence that systematic urinary culture with antibiotic sensitivity testing should be recommended when treating urinary tract infections if antibiotics have been prescribed within the past 3 months. Moreover, the selection of MDR bacteria through antibiotic use should be considered as a potential risk associated with treatment.
