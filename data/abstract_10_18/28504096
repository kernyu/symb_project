All the Salmonella enterica ser. Infantis strains isolated under official control programs in Greece during a four year period were studied, 23 of human origin, 16 from food animals and one from food. Molecular analyses (PFGE) in combination with antimicrobial susceptibility testing were used to study whether the occurrence S. Infantis in Greece resulted from different biotypes or a successful spread of one clone. Low rates of antimicrobial resistance were observed, except for streptomycin among human isolates (48%), indicating that selective pressure due to consumption of antimicrobials has not resulted the spread of dominant clones. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis revealed 31 XbaI distinct pulsotypes among the 40 strains with 60% overall similarity reflecting diversity. Four main clusters were constructed, using an 85% cut off value, clusters A, B, C and D consisting of 14, 6, 8 and 8 isolates respectively. Point source of transmission was not hypothesized as multiple reservoirs of the serovar seem to be present in Greece during the study period.
