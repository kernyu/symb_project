Abstract We analyzed subtype C HIV-1 isolates from patients at failure of a regimen including nevirapine or efavirenz for their susceptibility or resistance to etravirine according to the ANRS and STANFORD algorithms. Statistical analysis showed a consensus that more than 45% of these viral strains are potentially resistant to etravirine.
