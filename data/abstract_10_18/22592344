Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is a common health-care issue for the general practitioner and the ophthalmologist. Signs and symptoms usually allow a correct diagnosis without conjunctival swab. Primary microbiological investigations are recommended in newborns, immunocompromised patients and cases of hyperacute conjunctivitis. Of concern are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains which have been isolated with increasing frequency in the last few years. Studies have demonstrated the faster clinical and microbiological cure of acute bacterial conjunctivitis with topical antibiotics. However, the development of resistance of the typical germs to all of the antibiotic groups is alarming and should influence therapeutic behaviour. Fluoroquinolones show good activity in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis but should be saved for severe infections due to its broad spectrum of activity. Antibiotics such as gentamycin, tobramycin, and azithromycin should be preferred. Considering the high spontaneous healing rate of acute conjunctivitis, delayed topical antibiotics in case of persistence after 3-4 days, or treatment without antibiotics using artificial tears and eye bathings may be considered. Additive anti-inflammatory drugs are generally not recommended. Chronic-recurrent follicular conjunctivitis necessitates testing for Chlamydia, and in case of a positive result, systemic antibiotic treatment of patient and sexual partner.
