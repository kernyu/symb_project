A systematic chemical modification in the triazine moiety covalently attached via suitable linkers to 4-amino-7-chloroquinolines yielded a series of new 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline-triazine hybrids exhibiting high in vitro activity against W2 (chloroquine-resistant) and D6 (chloroquine-sensitive) strains of Plasmodium falciparum without any toxicity against mammalian cell lines (Vero, LLC-PK11, HepG2). Many of the compounds (6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 27, 29 and 33) showed excellent potency against chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains. In particular, compounds 6, 8, 14, 16 and 29 were found to be significantly more active than chloroquine against the chloroquine-resistant strains (W2 clone) of P. falciparum.
