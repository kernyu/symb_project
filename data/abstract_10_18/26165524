The present study aimed to investigate the effects of ethanol treatment on the induction of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) levels and the inhibition of the activation of the insulin signaling pathway in human hepatocytes. L02 cells were treated with various concentrations of ethanol for different periods of time. Cell viability and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) leakage in the culture supernatant were evaluated. Changes in [Ca(2+)](i) levels were detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Total RNA and protein were extracted to examine the mRNA and protein levels of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1, IRS2, phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. Furthermore, insulin was added to the ethanoltreated L02 cells, and the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and protein kinase B (PKB) were determined by western blot analysis before and after Ca(2+) blockage. No significant changes were observed in cell viability, [Ca(2+)](i) levels and in the expression and phosphorylation levels of insulin signal transduction molecules when the L02 cells were treated with 0.5 or 1% ethanol. However, treatment with 2 or 4% ethanol resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability and in the mRNA levels of IRS1, IRS2, PI3K (p85alpha) and GLUT2, as well as in an increase in ALT/AST leakage and in the [Ca(2+)](i) levels (P<0.05). The expression and phosphorylation levels of PI3K (p85alpha) and PKB were also inhibited by treatment with 2 or 4% ethanol. These cytological effects induced by ethanol treatment were partially reversed by Ca(2+) blockage. These results suggest that ethanol treatment inhibits the activation of the insulin signal transduction pathway in a dose, time and Ca(2+)dependent manner. The inhibition of IRS1/2, PI3K (p85alpha), PKB and GLUT2 expression and of PI3K (p85alpha) and PKB phosphorylation by the high concentrations of ethanol may be the core molecular mechanism of ethanol-induced insulin resistance, and may be related to the induction of [Ca(2+)](i) levels.
