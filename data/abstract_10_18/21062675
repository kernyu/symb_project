Secondary resistance may be a major problem in the management of autoimmune diseases. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-function has been described as a mechanism of drug resistance in autoimmune patients. P-gp function can in vitro be inhibited by cyclosporine A (CSA) and verapamil; moreover, P-gp reduction by CSA in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis has been demonstrated. Here, P-gp function before and after CSA administration in three psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients, who developed a resistance to MTX/SSA, has been evaluated. P-gp function on patient cells was analyzed by measuring the changes in rhodamine-123 (Rh-123) fluorescence after verapamil incubation. CSA treatment resulted in good clinical outcome that was related with a significant P-gp function reduction at CD3+ and CD8+ levels. In addition to its immunosuppressive activity, CSA results may also be related to MTX/SSA effect restoration through P-gp inhibition. This is the first time that CSA has been demonstrated as being able to revert MTX/SSA resistance in PsA.
