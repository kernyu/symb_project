Given current challenges in antimicrobial resistance and drug development, infectious diseases clinicians must rely on their own ingenuity to effectively treat infections while preserving the current antimicrobial armamentarium. An understanding of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), and how these concepts relate, is essential to this task. In this review, we discuss how and why PK-PD impacts AST and the way infectious diseases are being treated, with a particular focus on vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and an update on cephalosporins for Enterobacteriaceae. Finally, we address how new ideas to exploit PK-PD can promote innovative study design and bring about more rapid regulatory review of new antimicrobials.
