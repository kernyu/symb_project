The occurance and prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis poses a serious threat to the global tuberculosis control. Ethambutol (EMB) is one of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, which is usually used in combination with isoniazid and rifampicin for treating pan-sensitive tuberculosis, and it can also be used in drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, the situation of EMB resistance is alarmingly high, especially in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. In China, EMB resistance rate in the previously treated cases was up to 17.2% and showed an increased tendency. What was worse, 51.3%-66.7% of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases were resistant to EMB. Thus, it is important to understand the drug resistance mechanism of EMB, which will help to slow down the drug resistance rate of EMB. In this review, we focus on the current status of EMB resistance, the effects of EMB and the mechanisms of EMB resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
