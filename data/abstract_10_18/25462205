OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of vinorelbine and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy in patients with primary refractory or recurrent platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian and primary peritoneal cancers. METHODS: Patients with platinum-resistant or primary refractory disease were eligible. Patients were allowed one prior chemotherapy for the treatment of platinum-resistant or refractory disease. Vinorelbine 25mg/m(2), followed by gemcitabine 1000mg/m(2), was administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3weeks. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 and cancer antigen 125 test (CA-125 criteria) were adopted to classify responses. RESULTS: 44 patients received the median of 4 (range, 1-24) treatments with fifteen (34.1%) receiving six or more cycles. The overall objective response rate was 22.7%. One patient (2.3%) had complete while 9 patients (20.4%) had partial responses with median duration of response of 5.9months. 17 patients (38.6%) had stable disease for a median of 3.3months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.4months and overall survival (OS) was 14.5months. Four (9.1%) patients were not assessable. Neutropenia was the most frequently encountered toxicity, with grade 3 or 4 observed in 22 patients (50.0%). Fifteen patients (34.1%) needed immediate dose reduction. No treatment related death was reported. CONCLUSIONS: The combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and vinorelbine achieved the primary end point of our clinical trial in management of platinum resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. However, further sophisticated dosing and scheduling of combination chemotherapy are needed because of a significant proportion of dose reduction.
