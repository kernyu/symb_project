Methionine (Met) is a nutritionally essential sulfur-containing amino acid (SAA) known for its preponderant role as initiator in protein synthesis. However, other functions for Met in plants are not well described. The implication of this SAA in oxidative stress tolerance has been recently reported, however the mode of action of Met is still poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the elicitor activity of Met in grapevine as well as its effect on Plasmopara viticola resistance. The results show that Met induces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, a key element in plant defense signaling, and upregulates the expression of a battery of defense-related genes. Transcript levels of these genes were not further modulated by P. viticola inoculation of Met-pretreated plants, suggesting an elicitor role rather than a priming role for Met in grapevine. Met treatment also reduces P. viticola development in grapevine plants grown under glasshouse controlled-conditions. Fungitoxicity assays revealed that Met possesses a moderate antifungal activity compared with cysteine (Cys), another SAA known for its toxic effect to a large spectrum of fungi.
