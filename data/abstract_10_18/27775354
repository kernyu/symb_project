In order to overcome one of the greatest challenges in malaria treatment, drug resistance, new drug candidates are urgently needed, which should preferably act via novel mechanisms. Successful optimization of a phenotypic screening hit based on a quinoline-4-carboxamide derivative resulted in the highly promising lead structure 4, which according to the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) met the efficacy and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) requirements for a malaria drug target candidate and consequently was selected for preclinical development.
