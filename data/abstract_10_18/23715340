The antimicrobial susceptibility of 80 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolates from surgical wound, pus from infected skin lesions, burn exudates and diabetic ulcer exudates of patients in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh, was evaluated in order to see their pattern of antimicrobial resistance. The study was carried out in the department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College during the period from July 2009 to May 2011. The 80 CoNS isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility to relevant antibiotics including oxacillin by disk diffusion method. Out of 80 CoNS isolates, the highest number were resistant to oxacillin 36(45%), followed by gentamicin 32(40%), cefuroxime 25(31%), ceftriaxone 24(30%) and ciprofloxacin 18(22%). All isolates of CoNS were sensitive to imipenem and vancomycin. As MRCoNS were found multidrug resistant, therefore, antibiotic sensitivity must be done prior to treatment in infections caused by these species.
