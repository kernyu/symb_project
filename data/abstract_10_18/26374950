PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite the availability of new antifungals and improved antifungal formulations, there is a continued need for the development of new drugs to treat invasive fungal infections. In high-risk populations, including heavily immunocompromised patients, those with multiple comorbidities, and patients in intensive care settings, invasive fungal infections remain a significant problem, and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. In addition, concerns of increasing antifungal resistance to available agents further highlight the need for new drugs to treat these infections. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have reported potent in-vitro activity for several investigational agents, including both yeasts and moulds. This in-vitro activity has also translated into in-vivo efficacy in animal models of various invasive fungal infections, including those caused by isolates that are resistant to clinically available agents. These agents include those with mechanisms of action similar to available agents and those that target fungi by novel means. SUMMARY: Several new antifungal agents are currently in various stages of development. This is promising, as there is a continued need for new agents to treat invasive fungal infections. Which ones will receive approval for clinical use and their impact in patients with these infections remain unknown.
