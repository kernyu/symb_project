We have developed a single tube TaqMan((R)) real-time PCR assay that differentiates the full-length and truncated erm(41) gene to predict inducible resistance to clarithromycin in Mycobacterium abscessus. A study of 87 clinical isolates found this assay to be 90.8% concordant to conventional drug susceptibility testing results for the prediction of inducible clarithromycin drug resistance.
