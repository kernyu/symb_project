OBJECTIVE: The lack of patient adherence to medical treatment has become a major concern for healthcare professionals. The World Health Organization estimated patient adherence to treatment at 50% only. The inadequate use of antibiotics can cause bacterial resistance the progression of which reduces therapeutic alternatives. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the patient's adherence to anti-infective agents prescribed for acute infection, after returning home. METHOD: Thirty-seven patients hospitalized in the Infectious and Tropical Diseases unit were included. Their adherence to anti-infective drugs was assessed indirectly through data collected by calling the pharmacy and the patient in the week following discontinuation of anti-infective treatment. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were identified as non-adherent (43.2%). A single patient could have several behaviors: extension of treatment (50%), dose modification (6.3%), voluntary omission (12.5%), and involuntary (6.3%). One patient (6.3%) did not take his anti-infective treatment. There was no major cause of non-adherence; every patient had his own reasons. The comparison of several criteria between adherent and non-adherent patients did not reveal any predictive risk factors. CONCLUSION: Our study results revealed for the first time that 50% of patients were adherent to anti-infective agents, after returning home. They confirm the need to implement preventive actions such as a discharge pharmaceutical consultation.
