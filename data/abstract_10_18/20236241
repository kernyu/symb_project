Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is a common infection among the immuno-compromised population. Treatments include both systemic azoles, most commonly fluconazole (FLU), and topical agents such as miconazole (MICON). However, resistance to FLU has been reported with a greater frequency. The aim of this study was to determine the potential for development of resistance following repeated exposure of Candida spp. to MICON. Two clinical isolates each of Candida albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis were tested. Fifteen passages of each strain were performed in concentrations of MICON at 0.5 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), 1 MIC, 2 MIC and 4 MIC, with MIC determinations performed on growth obtained following each passage. There was no increase in the MIC of four of the six strains following fifteen passages in MICON. One C. albicans strain demonstrated a four-five dilution increase in MICON MIC at all concentrations and one C. glabrata strain showed a fivefold MICON MIC increase when exposed to 4 MIC. Although an increase in MIC was noted in these two isolates, the MICON MIC was still very low (0.5 mug ml(-1)). In general, there was no increase in MIC demonstrated by repeated exposure to MICON in this study.
