Staphylococcus aureus remains a major opportunistic human pathogen, and while in many individuals it is associated with asymptomatic colonization, it is also capable of causing a range of clinical syndromes from minor skin infections to life-threatening septicemia. Staphylococcus aureus has also demonstrated a remarkable capacity to acquire antimicrobial resistance. Recent technological advances in genomics have led to an avalanche of studies providing deep insights into how S. aureus is evolving globally and within the human host. However, there are still significant experimental barriers in using these insights to try and better understand the biology of S. aureus. Here, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of S. aureus through the use of genomic approaches, and contemplate what the near future holds for truly functional genomics that will allow us to better understand the biology of this pathogen.
