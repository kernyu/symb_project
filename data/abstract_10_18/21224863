Monensin A phenylurethane sodium salt (MON-UR1-Na) crystals were studied by the X-ray, NMR, FT-IR and PM5 semi-empirical methods. The X-ray data show that the compound forms a pseudocyclic structure, stabilized by three intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and the sodium cation coordinated by five oxygen atoms in the hydrophilic sphere. The NMR and FT-IR data demonstrate that this pseudocyclic structure is also conserved in CH(2)Cl(2) solution. This structure of MON-UR1-Na is significantly different than the ones previously proposed by Westley et al. and Tanaka et al. The semi-empirical calculations of the MON-UR1-Na structures indicate that the one of the crystal is the most energetically favorable one. Other parameters, such as the size, chemical and biological nature of the urethane substituent, and especially the free carbonyl urethane group, may have a role in the biological activity of MON-UR1-Na. The in vitro microbiological tests provide evidence that MON-UR1-Na shows higher antibacterial activity against human pathogenic bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis than the parent unmodified antibiotic-Monensin A.
