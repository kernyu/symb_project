Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermodimorphic fungus associated with paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most common systemic mycosis in Latin America. PCM treatment involves a long-term chemotherapeutic approach and relapses occur at an alarming frequency. Moreover, the emergence of strains with increased drug-resistance phenotypes puts constant pressure on the necessity to develop new alternatives to treat systemic mycoses. In this work, we show that the phenothiazine (PTZ) derivative thioridazine (TR) inhibits in vitro growth of P. brasiliensis yeasts at micromolar concentrations. We employed microarray hybridization to examine how TR affects gene expression in this fungus, identifying ~1800 genes that were modulated in response to this drug. Dataset evaluation showed that TR inhibits the expression of genes that control the onset of the cell wall integrity (CWI) response, hampering production of all major structural polysaccharides of the fungal cell wall (chitin, alpha-glucan and beta-glucan). Although TR and other PTZs have been shown to display antimicrobial activity by various mechanisms, inhibition of CWI signaling has not yet been reported for these drugs. Thus, TR may provide a novel approach to treat fungal infections by targeting cell wall biogenesis.
