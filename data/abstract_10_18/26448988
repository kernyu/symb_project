Analysis of the antibioticograms of 22 strains of Vibrio cholerae non O1/non O139 serogroups (ctxA- tepA-) isolated from the environment in the Rostov Region in 2011 showed that all the cultures were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, aminoglycosides, ceftriaxone, trimetoprime/sulfamethoxazole and resistant to levomycetin and furazolidone. 32%, 18% and 9% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, rifampicin and nalidixic acid respectively. No strains of V. cholerae susceptible to all the tested antimicrobials were detected. 37% of the V. cholerae isolates was resistant to two antibacterials and the others showed multiple resistance and contained 3-6 r-determinants of antibiotic resistance. Since the antibiotic resistance genes in Vibrio cholerae non O1/non O139 serogroups are often located on mobile genetic elements (plasmids, interferons, SXT elements), many strains of such organisms, the same as the natural environment, could serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. The presence of antibiotic resistance r-determinants in the investigated strains in various combinations, the antibiotic resistance variability in the isolates collected on the same territory within a relatively short period of time require monitoring of antibiotic susceptibility in them and the use of the antibiotic for the etiotropic therapy only in strict accordance with the antibioticogram of the culture isolated from the concrete patient.
