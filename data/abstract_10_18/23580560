OBJECTIVES: 16S rRNA methyltransferases are an emerging mechanism conferring high-level resistance to clinically relevant aminoglycosides and have been associated with important mechanisms such as NDM-1. We sought genes encoding these enzymes in isolates highly resistant (MIC >200 mg/L) to gentamicin and amikacin from an Indian hospital and we additionally screened for the novel RmtF enzyme in 132 UK isolates containing NDM. METHODS: All highly aminoglycoside-resistant isolates were screened for armA and rmtA-E by PCR, with cloning experiments performed for isolates negative for these genes. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry was used to determine the methylation target of the novel RmtF methyltransferase. RmtF-bearing strains were characterized further, including susceptibility testing, PFGE, electroporation, PCR-based replicon typing and multilocus sequence typing of rmtF-bearing plasmids. RESULTS: High-level aminoglycoside resistance was detected in 140/1000 (14%) consecutive isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from India. ArmA, RmtB and RmtC were identified among 46%, 20% and 27% of these isolates, respectively. The novel rmtF gene was detected in 34 aminoglycoside-resistant isolates (overall prevalence 3.4%), most (59%) of which also possessed a bla(NDM) gene; rmtF was detected in 6 NDM producers from the UK. It was found on different plasmid backbones. Four and two isolates showed resistance to tigecycline and colistin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RmtF was often found in association with NDM in members of the Enterobacteriaceae and on diverse plasmids. It is of clinical concern that the RmtF- and NDM-positive strains identified here show additional resistance to tigecycline and colistin, current drugs of last resort for the treatment of serious bacterial infections.
