Antimicrobials have unquestionable importance in the control of many diseases; however the constant concern with evolution of resistant microorganisms is increasing. Ertapenem sodium is a beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbapenem class that has a broader activity spectrum than most other beta-lactam antimicrobials and is more resistant to the enzyme beta-lactamase, which is the main mechanism of resistance of many bacteria. The progress of microbial resistance to existing antibiotics is alarming. Thus we need to preserve antimicrobials that still have activity against these pathogens. In this context, quality control has a key role to ensure the correct dosage, by contributing preventively to minimize the development of resistant microorganisms. Study of the physico-chemical characteristics of the drug and quantification of the content of the active substance are of fundamental importance for the pharmaceutical industry to ensure the quality of the product sold. This work presents the results of a literature survey of existing methods for ertapenem sodium quantification. Ertapenem sodium can be analyzed by many types of assays; however, HPLC is the most used method. This review will examine the published analytical methods reported for determination of ertapenem sodium in biological fluids and formulations.
