Campylobacter is a leading cause of foodborne diarrheal illness worldwide, and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains is a major global public health concern. The goal of this study was to compare the activity of different fluoroquinolone antibiotics against ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Isolates from retail meats collected between 2002 and 2009 were selected based on their in vitro susceptibility testing results against ciprofloxacin. In total, 289 C. jejuni and 165 C. coli were collected and analyzed. All ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates had a single mutation (Thr86Ile) in their gyrase A (gyrA) gene and exhibited decreased susceptibility to all eight fluoroquinolones tested. Gatifloxacin, enrofloxacin, and levofloxacin showed greater activity than the other fluoroquinolone drugs in both ciprofloxacin-sensitive and -resistant strains.
