BACKGROUND: The infected root canal system harbors one of the highest accumulations of polymicrobial infections. Since the eradication of endopathogenic microbiota is a major goal in endodontic infection therapy, photo-activated disinfection (PAD) can be used as an alternative therapeutic method in endodontic treatment. Compared to cultivation-based approaches, molecular techniques are more reliable for identifying microbial agents associated with endodontic infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of designed multiplex real-time PCR protocol for the rapid detection and quantification of six common microorganisms involved in endodontic infection before and after the PAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were taken from the root canals of 50 patients with primary and secondary/persistent endodontic infections using sterile paper points. PAD with toluidine blue O (TBO) plus diode laser was performed on root canals. Resampling was then performed, and the samples were transferred to transport medium. Then, six target microorganisms were detected using multiplex real-time PCR before and after the PAD. RESULTS: Veillonella parvula was found using multiplex real-time PCR to have the highest frequency among samples collected before the PAD (29.4%), followed by Porphyromonas. gingivalis (23.1%), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (13.6%), Actinomyces naeslundii (13.0%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.5%), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (9.4%). After TBO-mediated PAD, P. gingivalis strains, the most resistance microorganisms, were recovered in 41.7% of the samples using molecular approach (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: As the results shown, multiplex real-time PCR as an accurate detection approach with high-throughput and TBO-mediated PAD as an efficient antimicrobial strategy due to the significant reduction of the endopathogenic count can be used for detection and treatment of microbiota involved in infected root canals, respectively.
