BACKGROUND: Salmonella enteritidis infection is a frequently encountered zoonotic problem, occurring with concerning regularity in recent years on a worldwide basis. The study that we undertook for the first time detected S. enteritidis and associated antimicrobial resistance pattern in broiler chickens. METHODS: A total of 150 different poultry samples were first enriched and grown on selective media, and then processed for molecular detection of S. enteritidis by amplification of the spvb gene. RESULTS: The overall detection rate of S. enteritidis was 23.3% (n=35), while an increased detection rate of S. enteritidis was found in the chicken breast tissue (n=9; 30%). When antibiogram was tested for S. enteritidis against common antibiotics, increased resistance to ampicillin (n=29; 82.2%), tetracycline (n=28; 80%), augmentin (n=27; 77.14%), and chloramphenicol (n=19; 54.2%) was observed. Multidrug resistance was reported in 54.8% (n=19) of the S. enteritidis isolates, while 20% (n=07) of isolates were extensively drug resistant. CONCLUSION: The present study for the first time reports S. enteritidis on the basis of spvb gene detection. The increased drug resistance in S. enteritidis is an emerging problem that could negatively impact efforts to prevent and treat broiler-transmitted S. enteritidis.
