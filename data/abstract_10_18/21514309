The present study was carried out to investigate the presence of polymorphism in the N-acetyltransferase gene of 41 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that were resistant to isoniazid (INH) with no mutations in the hot spots of the genes previously described to be involved in INH resistance (katG, inhA and ahpC). We observed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ten of these, including the G619A SNP in five isolates and an additional four so far un-described mutations in another five isolates. Among the latter SNPs, two were synonymous (C276T, n=1 and C375G, n=3), while two more non-synonymous SNPs were composed of C373A (Leu-->Met) and T503G (Met-->Arg) were observed in respectively one and two isolates. Molecular modeling and structural analysis based in a constructed full length 3D models of wild type TBNAT (TBNAT_H37Rv) and the isoforms (TBNAT_L125M and TBNAT_M168R) were also performed. The refined models show that, just as observed in human NATs, the carboxyl terminus extends deep within the folded enzyme, into close proximity to the buried catalytic triad. Analysis of tbnat that present non-synonymous mutations indicates that both substitutions are plausible to affect enzyme specificity or acetyl-CoA binding capacity. The results contribute to a better understanding of structure-function relationships of NATs. However, further investigation including INH-sensitive strains as a control group is needed to get better understanding of the possible role of these new mutations on tuberculosis control.
