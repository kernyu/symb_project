Probiotic bacteria are administered as live micro-organisms to provide a health benefit to the host. Knowledge on adaptation factors that promote the survival and persistence of probiotics in the intestine is key to understand and improve their ecological and probiotic performance. Adaptation factors include adhesins, molecules conferring stress tolerance and nutritional versatility, antimicrobial products against competing microbes, and factors promoting resistance against the host immune system. Here, we present an overview of the current knowledge on adaptation factors of probiotic lactobacilli, with focus on the prototypical and widely documented probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.
