The development of resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to available first-line antibiotics, including penicillins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, has led to the circulation of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea at a global scale. Advancements in high-throughput whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provide useful tools that can be used to enhance gonococcal detection, treatment and management capabilities, which will ultimately aid in the control of antimicrobial resistant gonorrhea worldwide. In this minireview, we discuss the application of WGS of N. gonorrhoeae to strain typing, phylogenomic, molecular surveillance and transmission studies. We also examine the application of WGS analyses to the public health sector as well as the potential usage of WGS-based transcriptomic and epigenetic methods to identify novel gonococcal resistance mechanisms.
