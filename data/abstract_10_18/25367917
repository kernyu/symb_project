A salmonella genomic island, designated SGI11, was found in 18 of 26 multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolates from Bangladesh. SGI11 was an IS1 composite transposon and carried 7 resistance genes that conferred resistance to 5 first-line antimicrobials. Eleven of the 18 SGI11-carrying S. Typhi isolates had developed resistance to high levels of ciprofloxacin.
