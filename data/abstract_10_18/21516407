Ovarian carcinomas show considerable heterogeneity of origin, both in terms of site and tissue. The most important and also most frequent of these tumors arise from the coelomic epithelium and are therefore characterized as epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOC). EOC is often large and advanced at the time of presentation, so that cells are readily obtainable from surgical specimens or effusions. While the primary tumor may be chemosensitive, they often develop resistance and may do so rapidly. Due to the easy access to tumor cells and its biological behavior, EOC is considered to be an ideal model to investigate principal mechanisms of both antineoplastic drug sensitivity and resistance. Although studies on primary EOC cells are now preferred for many of these investigations, EOC cell line studies remain important too. This chapter gives an overview over major techniques required to establish and maintain primary EOC cell cultures and to initiate and cultivate permanently growing EOC cell lines.
