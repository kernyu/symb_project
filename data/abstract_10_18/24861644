OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the association of the hlyD, papC and cnf-1 virulence genes with drug resistance in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) isolated from cases of urinary tract infection (UTI). METHOD: A total of 193 E. coli strains isolated from symptomatic cases of UTI in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Raichur, Northern Karnataka, India were included in the study. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern was determined by Kirby-Bauer's Disk Diffusion method, and the strains resistant to any of the third generation cephalosporins tested were further confirmed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-production by an E-strip test. Genotypic virulence markers, namely, hlyD, papC and cnf-1, were detected by the uniplex PCR method and the phylogenetic characterization was performed by a multiplex PCR assay. RESULTS: The majority of the E. coli isolates belonged to the B2 phylogenetic group were significantly associated with ciprofloxacin-sensitivity and non-ESBL production (p<0.05). An increased prevalence of ciprofloxacin-sensitive strains over ciprofloxacin-resistant strains were observed among the UPEC isolates harboring the papC (72.9% vs. 40.2%; p<0.001), hlyD (43.7% vs. 21.6%; p<0.001) and cnf-1 (30.2% vs. 12.3%; p<0.05) genes. The presence of a multivirulent gene in the non-ESBL E. coli strains (44.5%) was significantly higher (p<0.05) than in the ESBL-producing strains (21%). CONCLUSIONS: Among the UPEC isolates, the predominant B2 phylogenetic group was significantly associated with the ciprofloxacin-sensitive strains, as well as with the non-ESBL E. coli strains. The genotypic virulence markers of UPEC were associated with ciprofloxacin-sensitivity, and a significant number of the non-ESBL strains harbored multivirulent genes. The relationship between the presence of the virulence genes and ESBL production was complex and warrants further intensive studies.
