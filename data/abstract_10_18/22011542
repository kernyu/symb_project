Data from a case-control study were used to derive and internally validate a prediction rule for identifying fluoroquinolone resistance in healthcare-acquired gram-negative urinary tract infection. This prediction rule has an excellent sensitivity and specificity (C-statistic, 0.816). External validation is necessary before implementing this rule to optimize empirical antibiotic use in clinical practice.
