OBJECTIVE: To observe the curative effect and side effect of tigecycline in the treatment of patients with infection caused by granulocytopenia. METHODS: The clinical data of 107 patients who were treated with tigecycline for infection due to granulocytopenia were retrospectively reviewed. The tigecycline was administered by intravenously (30-60 min drip infusion)as the initial dose of 100 mg and maintenance does of 50 mg, every 12h. The whole treatment course kept for 5-7 d when the body temperature was normal and then the step-down treatment or discontinuation of the drug was adopted. RESULTS: A total of 104 strains of bacteria were isolated from 107 cases of hospitalized patient, including 60 multi-drug resistant strains (MDR) and 2 extensively-drug resistant strains (XDR). The total effective rate of tigecycline treatment was 62.6%, including 30 cases with tigecycline alone (63.3% of the effective rate), 21 cases with tigecycline as initial treatment followed by combination with other antibiotics (61.9% of the effective rate), and 56 cases with tigecycline in combination with other antibiotics from the beginning of the treatment (62.5% of the effective rate). There was no statistical significant difference between the 3 treatment groups (P=0.994). Among the 39 patients with MDR strains, 22 patients' temperature was controlled , 9 patients died, and 8 patients' temperature remained uncontrolled. The clinical effective rate of these patients was 56.4%. The median onset time of tigecycline treatment was 3 days. The adverse drug reactions of nausea (11.2% ) and vomiting (8.4% )were tolerable. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline is effective in treatment of resistant bacteria infection in patients with granulocytopenia. The side effects of tigecycline were few, safe and generally well tolerated.
