The TEM-107 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detected in a Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate had a Gly238Ser substitution compared to the TEM-43 beta-lactamase. The MIC of ceftazidime was higher (64 mug/ml) than that of cefotaxime (2 mug/ml) for the isolate. Clavulanic acid reduced the MIC of ceftazidime 64-fold.
