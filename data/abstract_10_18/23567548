Viral infections of the ovary can cause pathological conditions. However, innate antiviral responses in the ovary are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) are constitutively expressed in the mouse ovary and predominantly located in granulosa cells. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a common agonist of TLR3, MDA5 and RIG-I, induced innate antiviral responses in ovarian granulosa cells. Poly(I:C) up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha and IL-6, and type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta). Moreover, poly(I:C) induced the expression of antiviral proteins, including 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, Mx GTPase 1 and IFN-stimulating gene 15, in granulosa cells. In contrast, P450 aromatase expression was inhibited by poly(I:C). The poly(I:C)-induced antiviral responses in TLR3 knockout (TLR3(-/-)) ovarian granulosa cells were reduced, and completely abolished by blocking of MDA5/RIG-I signaling. Further, the poly(I:C)-induced cytokine expression in TLR3(-/-) cells was reduced by knockdown of MDA5 or RIG-I. Data suggest that TLR3, MDA5 and RIG-I cooperate in mediating innate antiviral responses in granulosa cells, which may contribute to the defense of the ovary against viral infections.
