Antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health security. While the global community has made recent advances to mitigate the threat of antimicrobial resistance, we continue to face challenges in creating solutions and concrete actions that will yield the greatest immediate impact. To examine the critical areas in human, animal and environmental health that contribute to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance, the Forum on Microbial Threats of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine hosted a public workshop on June 20-21, 2017 in Washington, DC. This article summarizes the final synthesis discussion that took place at the workshop on suggestions for immediate actions and implementation that are feasible and cost-effective for combating antimicrobial resistance across the One Health domains. The priorities that emerged from the participants' discussions addressed the following topics: (1) Surveillance; (2) Stewardship, Infection Prevention and Behavior Modification; (3) Basic and Applied Research and Development; and (4) Global Policy and Coordination.
