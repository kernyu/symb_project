Atypical tuberculous tenosynovitis of the foot and ankle is extremely rare. The determination of the Mycobacterium species is essential because resistance of atypical mycobacterial strains to antituberculous drugs is often encountered. We report a case of Mycobacterium chelonae paratendinous and intratendinous infection involving the Achilles tendon. Repeat aggressive irrigation and debridement procedures, coupled with removal of foreign materials and the appropriate use of prolonged antibiotic therapy, can result in a successful long-term outcome.
