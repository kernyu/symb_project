This is a retrospective study of 15 difficult-to-treat (i.e., exhibiting previous failure, patient side effects, or resistance to ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole) chronic bacterial prostatitis infections (5 patients with multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [MDRE]) receiving fosfomycin-tromethamine at a dose of 3 g per 48 to 72 h for 6 weeks. After a median follow-up of 20 months, 7 patients (47%) had a clinical response, and 8 patients (53%) had persistent microbiological eradication; 4/5 patients with MDRE isolates achieved eradication. There were no side effects. Fosfomycin-tromethamine is a possible alternative therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis.
