In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Zhang et al. (2017) show that translational repression through eIF2alpha phosphorylation mediated by PK4 kinase activity plays a key role in artemisinin resistance in recrudescent malaria infections. Targeting this druggable process could extend the lifespan of current frontline treatments.
