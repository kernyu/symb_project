A total of 216 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from a general hospital in Henan, China, and screened for the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants. The presence of beta-lactamase genes and mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions were investigated among the PMQR-positive isolates.
