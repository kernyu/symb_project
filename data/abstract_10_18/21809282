Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. In Taiwan, numerous news reports on threats from super-bacteria have caused intermittent public panics since 2010. Improving the adherence of medical team members to infection control precaution policies is the most effective and immediate way to prevent antimicrobial resistance. In line with the infection chain concept, the modern clinical practice faces increases in susceptible hosts in the form of various immune-compromised patients, aging populations, rising numbers of chronically ill patients, various medical interventions, and increased antimicrobial agent use. Such has significantly increased opportunities for hospital-acquired infections. Medical staffs have also widely failed to comply with infection control measures. The compliance rate for hand hygiene, for example, has been reported as only 30-70 %. Many reports have been published on hospital-acquired multidrug-resistant bacteria outbreaks traced to the hospital environment and medical staff cross-contamination. This article provides insight into the problem and facilitates clinical staff decision-making regarding the prevention and control of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
