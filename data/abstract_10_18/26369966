The vanM gene was first found in a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREm) isolate in Shanghai in 2006. In this study, we found that, in 70 VREm strains isolated in nine Shanghai hospitals from 2006 to 2014, vanM was more prevalent than the vanA gene (64.3% [45/70] versus 35.7% [25/70]). The vanM-type isolates showed similar antimicrobial susceptibility patterns with the vanA types. The vanM-type VREm emerged and disseminated in Shanghai.
