Polymorphisms and the overexpression of transporter genes, especially of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, have been involved in antimalarial drug resistance. The objective of this study was to use 77 Senegalese Plasmodium falciparum isolates to evaluate the association between the number of Asn residues in the polymorphic microsatellite region of the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 6 gene (Pfmdr6) and the ex vivo susceptibility to antimalarials. A significant association was observed between the presence of 7 or 9 Asn repeats and reduced susceptibility to quinine.
