OBJECTIVE: To study the serotypes, antimicrobial resistance, virulence genes and molecular characteristics of Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated from outbreaks and sporadic cases in Guangdong, 2013. METHODS: 36 Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains isolated from outbreaks and 43 strains from sporadic cases were sero-typed and tested for antimicrobial resistance. PCR was used to detect for tdh(thermostable direct hemolysin gene), trh (tdh(-) related hemolysin gene), GS-PCR and orf8 genes. All the samples were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: 36 isolates from outbreaks were all identified as O3 : K6, and among the 43 sporadic isolates, O3 : K6 (23, 53.49%) was the dominant serotype. Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates showed high resistance rate to ampicillin (96.20%) and cefalotin (40.50%), but were high sensitive to cotrimoxazole (100%) and chloramphenicol (100%). 83.33% (30/36) outbreak isolates were resistant to multi-drugs but only 37.21% (16/43) of the sporadic isolates showed so. Results from virulence gene detection suggested that all the 36 outbreak isolates belonged to tdh(+) trh(-) strains, while 86.05% (37/43) of the sporadic isolates were tdh(+)trh(-) and 11.63% (5/43)were tdh(-)trh(+) . Only one tdh(+)trh(+) strain was found. All the outbreak isolates contained GS-PCR and/or orf8 genes, whereas among the sporadic isolates only 51.16% (22/43) of them carrying the similar genes. Results from PFGE analysis suggested that 79 isolates were discriminated into 3 clusters and 32 different PFGE patterns with the similarity value between 59.8% and 100.0%. Outbreak isolates seemed to gather in the same cluster, while the sporadic isolates spreading in all the three clusters. CONCLUSION: O3 : K6 was the dominant serotype in Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains isolated in Guangdong, 2013. These strains showed high sensitivity to most antibiotics, but with multi-drug resistance. Positive rate of tdh gene was high, and most O3 : K6 strains contained GS-PCR and/or orf8 genes. PFGE analysis revealed genetic diversity was within the Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains in Guangdong.
