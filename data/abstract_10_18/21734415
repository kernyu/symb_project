OBJECTIVE: The outcome of advanced ovarian cancer patients has not significantly improved since the introduction of platinum. One of the major reasons for this failure is the lack of an effective second-line treatment. In this phase II trial we tested the combination of gemcitabine and etoposide in 2 different groups of patients. Group 1 consisted of patients showing disease progression or relapse within 6 months of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Group 2 comprised heavily pretreated patients showing progression during the last chemotherapy attempt. METHODS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled. Gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and etoposide was administered orally at 100 mg/day on days 8-12 for 6 courses. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (52.9%) had an objective response and the median duration of the response was 10.3 months. Our chemotherapy regimen showed a low toxicity and good patient compliance. In 5 patients the treatment had to be delayed and in only 2 patients it was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of gemcitabine and oral etoposide seems to be a safe and effective second-line treatment for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. Additional data on larger series are warranted to better define the activity of this combination regimen.
