INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance has become a global problem. Many pathogens are becoming multidrug-resistant with the attendant increased risk of failure of standard therapies and the under-recognised outcomes such as increased morbidity, mortality, length of hospitalization and costs of treatment. Areas covered: We undertook a review of the literature using standard search engines including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and internet sources. Key search terms included antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic resistance, bacterial resistance, clinical outcomes, economic consequences, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Expert commentary: Antimicrobial resistance among the five-species presented demonstrates a major, and increasing, deleterious impact seen in each of the key outcomes measured. These negative changes, at a personal, health system and Societal levels, further emphasise the growing problem of increasing antimicrobial resistance at a global level and the vital need for new antimicrobials.
