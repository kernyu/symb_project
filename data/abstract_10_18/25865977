CONTEXT: Antimicrobial use has been associated with increasing antimicrobial resistance. There is an urgent need for judicious use of antimicrobials. Informational feedback has been shown to result in changes in behavioural practices of physicians in certain healthcare settings. We conducted this study to see if the passive informational feedback can reduce in antimicrobial usage in a tertiary care centre. AIMS: The study was undertaken to evaluate if the feedback to clinicians on their own antibiotic prescription results in any change in their antibiotic prescription habits. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was conducted at a tertiary care setting involving 33 units of different specialties. These units were split into 10 groups based on specialty and were allocated randomly to the control (16 units) and intervention (17 units) arms of the study. This study was a prospective intervention to assess the effect of prescribing feedback on clinical prescribing practices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the intervention arm, information on resistance rates and antibiotic-prescribing patterns was provided to all doctors. Behavioural change was assessed by comparing baseline prescribing rates of each unit with prescribing rates after the intervention. In the control arm, only information on monthly resistance rates was provided. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Change in the antimicrobial prescribing rates in the treatment group was assessed by using a Student's t-test. RESULTS: The mean antibiotic use for all the specialties was 189 DDDs/100BDs. The prospective intervention did not elicit any effect on the antibiotic prescribing practices of the physicians. Low prescribers continued to prescribe antibiotics at a low rate, and high prescribers continued to prescribe at a high rate. CONCLUSIONS: In view of unfavourable results of passive intervention in the above study, active intervention may be more effective.
