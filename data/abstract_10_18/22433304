OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of entecavir (ETV) 1.0 mg/d or ETV plus adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) in adults with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection who had previously resisted lamivudine (LAM) and failed with rescue treatment of LAM + ADV. METHODS: 40 patients were enrolled. 14 patients were treated with ETV 1.0 mg/d monotherapy while 26 patients were treated with ETV 1.0 mg/d + ADV 10 mg/d. The HBV DNA level, liver function, HBV serology and renal function were observed. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference with baseline situation between group ETV 1.0 mg and group ETV + ADV. HBV DNA level in group ETV 1.0 mg was (5.768 +/- 0.709) log10 copies/ml on baseline, and it declined to (4.712 +/- 0.846) log10 copies/ml, (3.914 +/- 0.996) log10 copies/ml, (3.702 +/- 0.934) log10 copies/ml, (3.879 +/- 0.913) log10 copies/ml and (3.855 +/- 1.070) log10 copies/ml at 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 weeks. HBV DNA level in group ETV + ADV was (5.703 +/- 0.845) log10 copies/ml on baseline, and it declined to (4.476 +/- 0.905) log10 copies/ml, (3.590 +/- 0.884) log10 copies/ml, (2.987 +/- 0.673) log10 copies/ml and (2.933 +/- 0.535) log10 copies/ml at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, there were 28.6% patients achieved HBV DNA < 500 copies/ml in group ETV 1.0 mg, but there were 80.8% patients in group ETV + ADV achieved this level. Statistically significant difference existed between (x(2) = 8.469, P = 0.004 ). At 48 weeks, there were still 4 patients achieved HBV DNA < 500 copies/ml in group ETV 1.0 mg, but patients in group ETV + ADV all achieved it. At 24 weeks, ALT levels of 42.9% patients in group ETV 1.0 mg were back to normal, but there were 92.3% patients' ALT levels back to normal in group ETV + ADV. There was statistically significant difference (x(2) = 9.337, P = 0.002). At 48 weeks, ALT levels of 57.1% patients in group ETV 1.0 mg were back to normal, but all patients' ALT levels were back to normal in group ETV + ADV. At 48 weeks, there was 1 patient with HBeAg seroconversion in group ETV 1.0 mg while there were 4 patients in group ETV + ADV. CONCLUSION: As rescue treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis B who had previously resisted LAM and failed with treatment of LAM + ADV, ETV + ADV was more efficient than ETV 1.0 mg monotherapy, and it can achieve better virological and biochemical response.
