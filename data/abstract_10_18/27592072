A multi-drug resistant (MDR) Listeria monocytogenes isolate (serotype 1/2c) was recovered from a quick-frozen rice flour product collected from Langfang city in northern China. PCR screening identified the presence of cat, ermB and tetS genes. The plasmid profile of the strain showed the presence of an approximately 22.4-kb plasmid. Curing of this plasmid resulted in the loss of cat, ermB and tetS genes and increased susceptibility to several antibiotics, suggesting the involvement of the plasmid in multiple antibiotic resistances. Moreover, the plasmid was able to be uptaken by human oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans by natural transformation and resulted in the acquiring of multiple resistances in the transconjugants. This study contributes to our knowledge on acquired multi-drug resistance in foodborne pathogenic L.monocytogenes, which will add to a better understanding of effective clinical management of listeriosis.
