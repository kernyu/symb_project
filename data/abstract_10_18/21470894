Cytokinins are plant growth promoting hormones involved in the specification of embryonic cells, maintenance of meristematic cells, shoot formation and development of vasculature. Cytokinins have also emerged as a major factor in plant-microbe interactions during nodule organogenesis and pathogenesis. Microbe-originated cytokinins confer abnormal hypersensitivity of cytokinins to plants, augmenting the sink activity of infected regions. However, recent findings have shed light on a distinct role of cytokinins in plant immune responses. Plant-borne cytokinins systemically induce resistance against pathogen infection. This resistance is orchestrated by endogenous cytokinin and salicylic acid signaling. Here, we discuss how plant- and pathogen-derived cytokinins inversely affect the plant defense response. In addition, we consider the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-derived cytokinin action in plant immunity.
