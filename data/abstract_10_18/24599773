BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows that the eradication rate of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy for the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has decreased. AIMS: To clarify the trend of eradication rate of PPI-based triple therapy and to assess the related factors in Korea during the past decade. METHODS: We prospectively prescribed the triple regimen for seven days (PPI + amoxicillin 1.0 g + clarithromycin 500 mg, twice a day) from March 2003 to May 2013 in 2,202 H. pylori-positive patients. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by the agar dilution method, and the CYP2C19 genotype was determined by the PCR method. RESULTS: In the past decade, the annual eradication rate showed a decreasing trend in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses (P = 0.001, both). The antibiotic resistance was increased to amoxicillin (7.2-17.2%, P = 0.003) and clarithromycin (23.2-37.3%, P = 0.010) during the study period. The poor metabolizer genotype of CYP2C19 showed a high eradication rate compared to the extensive metabolizer (86.8 vs. 78.2%, P = 0.035). In addition, age >/= 50 years, female gender, BMI < 25 kg/m(2), amoxicillin and/or clarithromycin resistance were associated with treatment failure on univariate analysis. However, on multivariate analysis, clarithromycin resistance was the only significant factor for treatment failure (OR, 12.76; 95% CI, 5.58-29.18; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in clarithromycin resistance has led to decreased eradication rate of first-line triple therapy, and; hence, a new strategy is needed to improve the eradication rate of H. pylori.
