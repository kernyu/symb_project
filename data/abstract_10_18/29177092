The need for novel antibiotics in an era where antimicrobial resistance is on the rise, and the number of new approved antimicrobial drugs reaching the market is declining, is evident. The underused potential of post-translationally modified peptides for clinical use makes this class of peptides interesting candidates. In this study, we made use of the vast amounts of available genomic data and screened all publicly available prokaryotic genomes (~3000) to identify 394 novel head-to-tail cyclized antimicrobial peptides. To verify these in silico results, we isolated and characterized a novel antimicrobial peptide from Bacillus pumilus that we named pumilarin. Pumilarin was demonstrated to have a circular structure and showed antimicrobial activity against several indicator strains, including pathogens.
