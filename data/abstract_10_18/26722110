Respiratory infection with Burkholderia cenocepacia is associated with accelerated decline in lung function and increased mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (A. M. Jones, M. E. Dodd, J. R. W. Govan, V. Barcus, C. J. Doherty, J. Morris, and A. K. Webb, Thorax 59:948-951, 2004, http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thx.2003.017210). B. cenocepacia often possesses innate resistance to multiple antimicrobial classes, making eradication uncommon in established infection (P. B. Davis, Am J Respir Crit Care Med 173:475-482, 2006, http://dx.doi.org/10.1164/rccm.200505-840OE). We report the use of clinafloxacin in a CF patient with advanced B. cenocepacia infection, present pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and discuss the potential therapeutic role of clinafloxacin in patients with this condition.
