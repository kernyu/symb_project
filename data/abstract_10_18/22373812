The capsule and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Pasteurella multocida constitute the major components of the bacterial cell surface. As well as forming the basis for the most widely used classification systems, they play key roles in a range of interactions between the bacteria and the hosts they colonize or infect. Both polysaccharides are involved in the avoidance of host innate immune mechanisms, such as resistance to phagocytosis, complement-mediated killing, and the bactericidal activity of antimicrobial peptides; they are therefore essential for virulence. In addition, LPS is a major antigen in the stimulation of adaptive immune responses to infection.
