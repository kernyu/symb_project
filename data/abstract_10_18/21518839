We have examined the effect of continuous perfusion with antifungals on Candida albicans biofilms under conditions of flow, closely mimicking physiological conditions encountered within patients. Biofilms displayed high levels of resistance to fluconazole, and this antifungal exerted minor effects on dispersion levels. Amphotericin B proved effective in reducing viability of cells within the biofilms and dispersion, but only at high concentrations. Under flow conditions, caspofungin exhibited potent activity against biofilms and drastically reduced biofilm dispersion.
