The aims of this study were to analyze carbapenem-resistance Acinetobacter baumannii isolates (CRAB) and their molecular epidemiology in an ICU of Southern Italy. Clinical outcomes and therapeutic management of patients are also described. The study was performed from January 2007 to October 2010. The presence of carbapenemases was determined by PCR. Strains were typed by PFGE. All A. baumannii isolates were carbapenem-resistant with imipenem MIC>/=16 mug/mL. Molecular characterization showed the occurrence of a predominant clone. The most frequent infection by CRAB was ventilator-associated pneumonia; colistin was the drug of choice for this infection. The therapy was safe in all cases except in one where therapy was suspended due to the onset of acute renal failure. We documented the presence of CRAB in this ICU, besides the occurrence of a predominant clone, over all the study period. Despite the infection control procedures used, intra-facility A. baumannii transmission is evident as well as the significant capacity for long-term survival in the hospital environment.
