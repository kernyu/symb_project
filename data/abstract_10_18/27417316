Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) that do not respond to, at least, isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful, first-line (or standard) anti-TB drugs. Novel intervention strategies for eliminating this disease were based on finding proteins that can be used for designing new drugs or new and reliable kits for diagnosis. The aim of this study was to compare the protein profiles of MDR-TB with sensitive isolates. Proteomic analysis of M. tuberculosis MDR-TB and sensitive isolates was obtained with ion exchange chromatography coupled with MALDI-TOF-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) in order to identify individual proteins that have different expression in MDR-TB to be used as a drug target or diagnostic marker for designing valuable TB vaccines or TB rapid tests. We identified eight proteins in MDR-TB isolates, and analyses showed that these proteins are absent in M. tuberculosis-sensitive isolates: (Rv2140c, Rv0009, Rv1932, Rv0251c, Rv2558, Rv1284, Rv3699 and MMP major membrane proteins). These data will provide valuable clues in further investigation for suitable TB rapid tests or drug targets against drug-resistant and sensitive M. tuberculosis isolates.
