Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can be a commensal or pathogen in humans. Pathogenicity and disease are related to the acquisition of mobile genetic elements encoding virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes. Here, we report draft genome sequences for 50 clinical MRSA isolates from humans with MRSA-related disease.
