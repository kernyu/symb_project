A study was performed to assess differences in the clinical presentation of tuberculosis between two groups of immigrants. Ninety-four patients seen in the emergency room for newly diagnosed tuberculosis between 2006 and 2012 were included. Forty-nine patients were from Asian countries and 45 from Latin America. Mean age [years (SD)] was 35.3 (13) in Asian patients and 33.9 (10) in Latin American patients. Asian subjects were predominantly male (40/49 vs 25/45; P=0.006). Patients from Latin American countries had a higher rate of pulmonary tuberculosis. A higher percentage of Asian patients lived in overcrowded conditions, whereas HIV infection was more frequent among Latin Americans. Most patients were treated with a quadruple regimen. Resistance to isoniazid was documented in two patients from Latin America.
