UNLABELLED: Evaluating the spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms from a multi-profile hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were analyzed 3940 strains of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms from patients with septic-purulent infections. RESULTS: From the total, 51.44% samples of isolated strains showed resistance to antibiotics, including Gram negative (61.66%), and Gram positive ones (40.25%). A higher degree of resistance showed strains of Acinetobacter spp. (86.87%), P. rettegeri (83.40%) and K. pneumoniae (73.35%). Etiological structure of septic-purulent infections, as well as the degree of resistance, has proved to be varied, depending on the hospital profile unit. Isolated strains showed a higher resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins. CONCLUSION: Microorganisms isolated from patients with nosocomial septic-purulent infections have showed a higher resistance to antibiotics.
