More than 30 million pounds of antibiotics are used in the United States per year, more than 90% for nontherapeutic purposes in animals. Environmental contamination by trace amounts of antibiotics and highly resistant bacteria can lead to resistant infections in humans. Oral and maxillofacial infections are largely mediated by biofilms, which are resistant to antibiotics. Primary treatment is surgical debridement, removal of the cause of the infection, and drainage of pus. Current best practices indicate the use of antibiotics as adjunctive therapy to surgery only when regional, distant, or systemic spread of the infection is a significant risk.
