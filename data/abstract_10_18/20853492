Plasmacytoid DC (pDC) secrete type I IFN in response to viruses and RNA/DNA/immunocomplexes. Type I IFN confer resistance to viral infections and promote innate and adaptive immune responses. pDC also produce cytokines and chemokines that influence recruitment and function of T cells and differentiation of B cells. Thus, pDC have been implicated both in protective immune responses and in induction of tolerance. In this Viewpoint, we discuss how the recruitment and accumulation of pDC may impact pathogenesis of several diseases and how pDC can be targeted for therapeutic interventions.
