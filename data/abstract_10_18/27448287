This study reports a two-step method to synthesize spermidine-capped fluorescent carbon quantum dots (Spd-CQDs) and their potential application as an antibacterial agent. Fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are synthesized by pyrolysis of ammonium citrate in the solid state and then modified with spermidine by a simple heating treatment without a coupling agent. Spermidine, a naturally occurring polyamine, binds with DNA, lipids, and proteins involved in many important processes within organisms such as DNA stability, and cell growth, proliferation, and death. The antimicrobial activity of the as-synthesized Spd-CQDs (size approximately 4.6 nm) has been tested against non-multidrug-resistant E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, and P. aeruginosa bacteria and also multidrug-resistant bacteria, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The minimal inhibitory concentration value of Spd-CQDs is much lower (>25 000-fold) than that of spermidine, indicating their promising antibacterial characteristics. The mechanism of antibacterial activity is investigated, and the results indicate that Spd-CQDs cause significant damage to the bacterial membrane. In vitro cytotoxicity and hemolysis analyses reveal the high biocompatibility of Spd-CQDs. To demonstrate its practical application, in vitro MRSA-infected wound healing studies in rats have been conducted, which show faster healing, better epithelialization, and formation of collagen fibers when Spd-CQDs are used as a dressing material.
