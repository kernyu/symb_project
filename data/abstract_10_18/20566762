Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are highly effective for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, yet their sustained efficacy is threatened by the potential spread of parasite resistance. Recent studies have provided evidence that artemisinins can inhibit the function of PfATP6, the P. falciparum ortholog of the ER calcium pump SERCA, when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Inhibition was significantly reduced in an L263E variant, which introduced the mammalian residue into a putative drug-binding pocket. To test the hypothesis that this single mutation could decrease P. falciparum susceptibility to artemisinins, we implemented an allelic-exchange strategy to replace the wild-type pfatp6 allele by a variant allele encoding L263E. Transfected P. falciparum clones were screened by PCR analysis for disruption of the endogenous locus and introduction of the mutant L263E allele under the transcriptional control of a calmodulin promoter. Expression of the mutant allele was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR and verified by sequence analysis. Parasite clones expressing wild-type or L263E variant PfATP6 showed no significant difference in 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) for artemisinin or its derivatives dihydroartemisinin and artesunate. Nonetheless, hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a trend toward reduced susceptibility that neared significance (artemisinin, P approximately = 0.1; dihydroartemisinin, P = 0.053 and P = 0.085; and artesunate, P = 0.082 and P = 0.162 for the D10 and 7G8 lines, respectively). Notable differences in the distribution of normalized IC(50)s provided evidence of decreased responsiveness to artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin (P = 0.02 for the D10 and 7G8 lines), but not to artesunate in parasites expressing mutant PfATP6.
