The pathogenicity of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) depends on production of Shiga toxins, which are encoded by stx genes located in the genomes of lambdoid prophages. Efficient expression of these genes requires prophage induction and lytic development of phages. Treatment of EHEC infections is problematic due to not only the resistance of various strains to antibiotics but also the fact that many antibiotics cause prophage induction, thus resulting in high-level expression of stx genes. Here we report that E. coli growth, Shiga toxin-converting phage development, and production of the toxin by EHEC are strongly inhibited by phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC). We demonstrate that PEITC induces the stringent response in E. coli that is mediated by massive production of a global regulator, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp). The stringent response induction arises most probably from interactions of PEITC with amino acids and from amino acid deprivation-mediated activation of ppGpp synthesis. In mutants unable to synthesize ppGpp, development of Shiga toxin-converting phages and production of Shiga toxin are significantly enhanced. Therefore, ppGpp, which appears at high levels in bacterial cells after stimulation of its production by PEITC, is a negative regulator of EHEC virulence and at the same time efficiently inhibits bacterial growth. This is in contrast to stimulation of virulence of different bacteria by this nucleotide reported previously by others.
