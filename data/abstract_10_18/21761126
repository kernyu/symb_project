The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical risk factors for quinolone resistance (QR) in E. coli strains from males with febrile urinary tract infection (FUTI). An ambispective cross-sectional study was performed in which we evaluated 153 males with a community FUTI caused by E. coli. Among the 153 FUTI episodes, 101 (66%) were due to quinolone susceptible E. coli strains while 52 (34%) were caused by QR E. coli strains. In the univariate analysis QR was associated with older age, higher Charlson scores, dementia, past UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, previous antibiotic use, particularly with fluoroquinolones (FQ), a healthcare-associated (HA)-UTI (HA-UTI) and to four of the components included in the definition of HA-UTI: hospital admission, nursing home residence, indwelling urethral catheter and invasive urinary instrumentation. In the multivariate analysis, HA-UTI (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.3-11.24; P 0.015) and use of antimicrobials in the previous month (OR 5.82, 95% CI 2.3-14.88; P < 0.001) mainly with FQ (OR 13.97, 95% CI 2.73-71.53; P 0.002) were associated with QR. To have a HA-UTI and a previous use of FQ in the preceding month were strong risk factors for QR E. coli, and thus empirical antimicrobial treatment with quinolones should be avoided in these patients.
