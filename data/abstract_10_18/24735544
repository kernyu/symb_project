Exposure of cells to type I interferon (IFN) induces an antiviral state that prevents viral infection, but viruses can utilize multiple tactics to antagonize the host immune system. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are two major pathogens that cause hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which is prevalent among children. We found that both EV71 and CA16 have different reactions to type I IFN pretreatment and induction patterns of type I IFN on Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. Further, a human-alpha and beta IFN PCR array was employed to analyze the expressions of 84 genes related to the type I IFN pathway. We found significant up-regulation of multiple genes in the presence of type I IFN and differential regulation patterns during EV71 or CA16 infection in RD cells. For instance, EV71 infection repressed the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, whereas CA16 infection normally triggers the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the expression of ISGs. Taken together, this study provides a comprehensive view of the differential impacts of EV71 and CA16 infection on 84 genes in the IFN pathway, shedding light on the different resistances of these viruses to type I IFN treatment and cytotoxic effects in RD cells.
