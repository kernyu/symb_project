Anti-bacterial drug resistance is one of the most critical concerns among the scientist worldwide. The novel antimicrobial decapeptide SD-8 is designed and its minimal inhibitory concentration and therapeutic index (TI) was found in the range of 1-8 mug/ml and 45-360, respectively, against major group of Gram positive pathogens (GPP). The peptide was also found to be least hemolytic at a concentration of 180 mug/ml, i.e., nearly 77 times higher than its average effective concentration. The kinetics assay showed that the killing time is 120 min for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and 90 min for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Membrane permeabilization is the cause of peptide antimicrobial activity as shown by the transmission electron microscopy studies. The peptide showed the anti-inflammatory property by inhibiting COX-2 with a KD and Ki values of 2.36x10(-9) and 4.8x10(-8) M, respectively. The peptide was also found to be effective in vivo as derived from histopathological observations in a Staphylococcal skin infection rat model with MRSA as causative organism.
