We present a rare case of intraorbital abscess caused by Candida allociferrii, which was described as a new species of Stephanoascus ciferrii complex in 2002, in a patient after enucleation of choroidal melanoma. This strain showed resistance to itraconazole, and fluconazole. After debridement and topical use of amphotericin B, his wound abscess was disappeared. To our knowledge, this is the first C. allociferrii infection case in human.
