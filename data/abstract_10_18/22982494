In an earlier study, we determined that HP(2-20) (residues 2-20 of parental HP derived from the N-terminus of the Helicobacter pylori ribosomal protein L1) and its analog, HPA3NT3, had potent antimicrobial effects. However, HPA3NT3 also showed undesirable cytotoxicity against HaCaT cells. In the present study, we designed peptide analogs including HPA3NT3-F1A (-F1A), HPA3NT3-F8A (-F8A), HPA3NT3-F1AF8A (-F1AF8A), HPA3NT3-A1 (-A1) and HPA3NT3-A2 (-A2) in an effort to investigate the effects of amino acid substitutions in reducing their hydrophobicity or increasing their cationicity, and any resulting effects on their selectivity in their interactions with human cells and pathogens, as well as their mechanism of antimicrobial action. With the exception of HPA3NT3-A1, all of these peptides showed potent antimicrobial activity. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Phe at positions 1 and/or 8 of the HPA3NT3 peptides (-F1A, -F8A and -F1AF8A) dramatically reduced their cytotoxicity. Thus the cytotoxicity of HPA3NT3 appears to be related to its Phe residues (positions 1 and 8), which strongly interact with sphingomyelin in the mammalian cell membrane. HPA3NT3 exerted its bactericidal effects through membrane permeabilization mediated by pore formation. In contrast, fluorescent dye leakage and nucleic acid gel retardation assays showed that -A2 acted by penetrating into the cytoplasm, where it bound to nucleic acids and inhibited protein synthesis. Notably, Staphylococcus aureus did not develop resistance to -A2 as it did with rifampin. These results suggest that the -A2 peptide could potentially serve as an effective antibiotic agent against multidrug-resistant bacterial strains.
