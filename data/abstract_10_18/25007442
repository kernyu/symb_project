The authors have investigated etiological structure, antibiotic resistance and adhesive properties of the agents of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) isolated from patients kept in the Department of Resuscitation and Intensive Care. It has been found that bacteria pathogens of CAUTI genus Enterococcus and their associations with other microorganisms dominated in species composition. Strains of enterococci had a high level of resistance to antimicrobial drugs studied except vancomycin and teicoplanin, which proved to be 100% sensitive strains. The vast majority of the investigated strains were characterized by medium to high adhesiveness.
