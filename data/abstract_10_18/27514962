In this study, we evaluated the coexistence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), AmpC and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) genes among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) recovered prospectively from patients at multiple sites. The study included 285 CRE strains from 2782 Gram-negative Bacilli collected from multiple centres during 2007-2010, of which 87 were characterised. Standard and reference laboratory methods were used for resistance determination. Detection of blaNDM-1 , blaAmpC , blaTEM , blaSHV and blaCTX-M was done by polymerase chain reaction. High levels of antimicrobial resistance observed among study isolates. Co-carriage of ESBLs, AmpC and NDM-1 was 26.3%. Nosocomial origin among the co-carriage isolates was 64.3%, with 9.2% associated mortality.
