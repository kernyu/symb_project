Cathelicidins are a major family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), an important component of innate immune system, playing a critical role in host defense and disease resistance in virtually all living species. Polymorphism and functional studies on cathelicidin of Tianzhu white yak contribute to understanding the specific innate immune mechanism in animals living at high altitudes in comparison to cattle and domesticated white yak. Thirty-six individuals of Tianzhu white yak, originating from the area of three ecotypes (Gansu in China), were investigated. The total length of the aligned Yak cathelicidin 6 (CATHL-6) sequences was 1923 bp, including six single nucleotide polymorphisms and one indel. Ten haplotypes were identified, and phylogenetic analyses resolved those 10 haplotypes in two clusters. The results indicate that the white yak originated from two domestication sites. In addition, lack of significant pairwise difference between sequences (Tajima's D = 0.92865, P > 0.10) in the CATHL-6 region indicates absence of population size expansion in current white yak population.
