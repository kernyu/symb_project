The growth of certain methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates could be inhibited by NaCl higher than 2.5%. The objective of this study was to develop an enrichment method to recover NaCl-susceptible MRSA isolates from meat samples. The growth of 12 MRSA and 10 non-MRSA strains was measured in Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth supplemented with 2.5%, 4%, 6.5%, and 7.5% NaCl. Selective agents, including aztreonam, polymyxin B, NaCl, nalidixic acid, and NaN3, were determined for their inhibitory effect to MRSA and non-MRSA strains in MH broth. Based on these data, a two-step enrichment method was developed to recover both NaCl-susceptible and -resistant MRSA isolates in meat products. Comparing to the enrichment method that only used MH broth supplemented with 6.5% NaCl, five additional NaCl-susceptible MRSA isolates were recovered from 92 retail ground pork samples by this newly developed two-step enrichment method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that considers NaCl-susceptible MRSA recovery from ground pork samples. The application of this new enrichment method might expand the diversity of MRSA isolates recovered from various samples.
