The antimicrobial consumption in primary health care has increased notably during the latest decade. The increase has predominantly been among broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Denmark is no longer among the European countries with the lowest consumption. The reasons for these changes are not fully explained, but increased dosage for each treated patient and more patients treated have played an important role. To some extent, the consumption meets with relevant quality indicators for antibiotic prescribing, but the use of resistance inducing antibiotics needs to be limited according to guidelines.
