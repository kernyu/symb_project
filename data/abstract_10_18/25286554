The review presents the results of trials of the clinical efficacy of a test antimalarial drug for each malarial parasite species, which were published in 2000-2013 and supplemented by the data of in vitro studies or investigations using the molecular markers of resistance. There are data on the resistance of each medicament since many of the drugs are used in combination with artermisinin derivatives.
