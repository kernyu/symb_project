A series of N-alkylated derivatives of nitroimidazolyl oxazolidinones 6a-i with various substituent at N-1 position of the nitroimidazole were synthesized and their in-vitro antibacterial activities were evaluated against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The 6a was found to be most potent compound in the series with MIC at 0.097 microg/mL against Bacillus cereus MTCC 430.). Both 6a and 6f did not exhibit any toxicity towards mammalian cell L929.
