We studied the macrolide resistance and serotypes of 585 group A streptococcus (GAS) isolates collected from French children with pharyngitis. Nineteen isolates (3.2%) were erythromycin-resistant and harbored the following resistance genes: 31.6% mef(A), 15.8% erm(A), and 52.6% erm(B). The 19 isolates included 7 different emm types (4, 1, 11, 2, 28, 12, and 77) and 7 corresponding multilocus sequence types. The current fall in macrolide consumption has led to a very low rate of GAS macrolide resistance.
