UNLABELLED: Silver nanoparticles are well known potent antimicrobial agents. Although significant progresses have been achieved on the elucidation of antimicrobial mechanism of silver nanoparticles, the exact mechanism of action is still not completely known. This overview incorporates a retrospective of previous reviews published and recent original contributions on the progress of research on antimicrobial mechanisms of silver nanoparticles. The main topics discussed include release of silver nanoparticles and silver ions, cell membrane damage, DNA interaction, free radical generation, bacterial resistance and the relationship of resistance to silver ions versus resistance to silver nanoparticles. The focus of the overview is to summarize the current knowledge in the field of antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles. The possibility that pathogenic microbes may develop resistance to silver nanoparticles is also discussed. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Antibacterial effect of nanoscopic silver generated a lot of interest both in research projects and in practical applications. However, the exact mechanism is still will have to be elucidated. This overview incorporates a retrospective of previous reviews published from 2007 to 2013 and recent original contributions on the progress of research on antimicrobial mechanisms to summarize our current knowledge in the field of antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles.
