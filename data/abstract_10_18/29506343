Antimicrobial resistance is becoming one of the greatest challenges to public health worldwide. Infections by antimicrobial-resistant organisms could result in the failure of treatment, increased medical costs, prolonged hospital stays, and an increased socioeconomic burden. Antimicrobial usage in Korea remains heavy, even after much effort to reduce their use. According to the Korean antimicrobial resistance surveillance system, the resistance rates of many bacteria are increasing. The resistance rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to imipenem in Korea increased to 85% in 2015, representing a major public threat. The reports of increased carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae are worrisome. More importantly, some carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae may result from the production of carbapenemases, which break down carbapenems. There are relatively few treatment options for extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Most reports are retrospective observational studies. Because there are little published data from randomized controlled trials, more data assessing antimicrobial treatment for extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are needed to make treatment recommendations.
