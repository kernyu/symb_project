In recent years, Staphylococcus aureus, the most commonly identified infectious agent causing skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), has shown an increase in methicillin resistance and decreased susceptibility to vancomycin. Because of its spectrum, microbiological activity, pharmacokinetics, and safety, as well as clinical experience in its use, daptomycin seems to be a highly appropriate antibiotic in the treatment of SSTIs, especially those produced by methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
