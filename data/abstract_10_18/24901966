Tetracyclines are antibiotics commonly used in swine farms to treat disease and promote growth. However, there are growing concerns regarding the discharge of animal feces into the environment owing to the potential for development and dissemination of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs). In this study, farming wastewater from one Chinese swine farm as well as river water from seven locations downstream of the farm was sampled. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that 12 TRGs, including six efflux pump genes (tet(B), tet(C), tet(D), tet(E), tet(G) and tet(L)), five ribosomal protection proteins (RPPs) genes (tet(O), tet(M), tet(Q), tet(W) and tet(S)), and one enzymatic modification gene (tet(X)), were present in all wastewater and river water samples. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) showed that the abundance of tet(C), tet(X), tet(O), tet(M), tet(Q) and tet(W) decreased with downstream flow. Among the detected TRGs, tet(C) had the highest abundance, ranging from 459.5 copies/16S rRNA gene copies in wastewater to 33.8 copies/16S rRNA gene copies in river water samples collected from the last location. Furthermore, pig-specific Bacteroidales 16S rRNA genetic marker was quantified by qPCR to determine the level of fecal pollution in the river water. Bivariate correlation analysis confirmed that the total relative abundance of the six TRGs was significantly correlated with the level of swine feces in the aquatic environment (R(2) = 0.63, P < 0.05), suggesting that swine feces mainly contributed to the spread of TRGs in the river water.
