OBJECTIVES: To address the public health threat of antibiotic resistance, there has been an enhanced call for antibiotic stewardship programs throughout the health care continuum. SUMMARY: While antibiotic stewardship programs have been well described in the inpatient setting, data on effectiveness and guidance on implementing outpatient programs is scarce. Establishing stewardship practices in the outpatient setting is necessary because more than 60% of human antibiotic use occurs in this setting. CONCLUSION: In this article, we highlight the importance and need for stewardship in the outpatient setting, discuss strategies for the development of stewardship teams, and discuss potential metrics that can be used to assess effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship interventions.
