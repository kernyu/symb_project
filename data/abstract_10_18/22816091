New adamantane derivatives with amino acid residues and other bifunctional compounds were synthesized and their antiviral activity towards influenza A(H1N1)pdm and A(H3N2) viruses was studied. Some of these adamantane derivatives completely suppressed replication of remantadine-resistant influenza A virus strains.
