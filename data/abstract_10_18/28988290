The colonization of the neonatal digestive tract provides a microbial stimulus required for an adequate maturation towards the physiological homeostasis of the host. This colonization, which is affected by several factors, begins with facultative anaerobes and continues with anaerobic genera. Accumulating evidence underlines the key role of the early neonatal period for this microbiota-induced maturation, being a key determinant factor for later health. Therefore, understanding the factors that determine the establishment of the microbiota in the infant is of critical importance. Exposure to antibiotics, either prenatally or postnatally, is common in early life mainly due to the use of intrapartum prophylaxis or to the administration of antibiotics in C-section deliveries. However, we are still far from understanding the impact of early antibiotics and their long-term effects. Increased risk of non-communicable diseases, such as allergies or obesity, has been observed in individuals exposed to antibiotics during early infancy. Moreover, the impact of antibiotics on the establishment of the infant gut resistome, and on the role of the microbiota as a reservoir of resistance genes, should be evaluated in the context of the problems associated with the increasing number of antibiotic resistant pathogenic strains. In this article, we review and discuss the above-mentioned issues with the aim of encouraging debate on the actions needed for understanding the impact of early life antibiotics upon human microbiota and health and for developing strategies aimed at minimizing this impact.
