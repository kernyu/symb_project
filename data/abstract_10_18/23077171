Endometritis caused by uterine infection after calving reduces fertility and causes major economic losses to the dairy industry. This study investigated the time course of an inflammatory response in bovine endometrium triggered by exposure to bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mixed endometrial epithelial and stromal cells (9:1 ratio) were grown to confluence as a model system and treated with an optimized dose of 100 ng/ml LPS in vitro. Gene expression responses were measured using quantitative PCR, and gene products were investigated using assays of culture medium and Western blotting. Of 17 candidate genes tested initially, LPS treatment for 24 h up-regulated mRNA expression of TLR4 signaling (TLR4, CD14), cytokines (IL1B, TNF), chemokines (IL8, CXCL5), antimicrobial peptides (LAP, S100A8, S100A9, S100A12), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP13). A 48 h, LPS time course study showed that TNF increased first at 1 h, followed by peak expression of IL1B at 6 h, and those of S100A8, S100A12, and LAP at 12 h. The intracellular S100A8 protein content doubled at 12-24 h but with little excretion into the medium. Regarding prostaglandin biosynthesis, PTGES mRNA was slightly higher after LPS exposure, whereas expression of the PGF synthase AKR1B1 was inhibited. Despite this, LPS treatment stimulated the secretion of both PGE(2) and PGF(2)(alpha) to a similar extent. These results suggest that the family of S100 Ca(2)(+) binding proteins are released from damaged endometrial cells and may play a major antimicrobial role. Prostaglandin synthesis increased during the uterine infection, but we found no evidence that this was associated with a change in the PGE:PGF ratio.
