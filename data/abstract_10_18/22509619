The frequent development of acquired antibiotics resistance in bacteria represents a challenge for Public Health in terms of healthcare associated infections control. Apart from the appropriate use of drugs, in particular the choice of proper antimicrobial therapy, increasing interest is, therefore, given to the non-pharmacological prevention of these infections. Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii is a micoorganism that commonly causes infections for patients hospitalized in critical hospital wards (intensive care units, burn centers, surgery, neonatology, etc) potentially severe and difficult to treat, because A. baumannii is resistant to many or sometimes all, available antibiotics (PDR - pan drug resistant). The aim of the present paper was to review the available measures for preventing and controlling the contamination and the spread of these types of bacterial infections in health care scenarios, with particular attention to two methods that stand out for efficiency and safety: hand hygiene and environmental disinfection.
