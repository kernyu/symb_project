OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the additive action of ginger starch on the antifungal activity of honey against Candida albicans (C. albicans). METHODS: C. albicans was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of four varieties of Algerian honey. Lower concentrations of honey than the MIC were incubated with a set of concentrations of starch and then added to media to determine the minimum additive inhibitory concentration (MAIC). RESULTS: The MIC for the four varieties of honey without starch against C. albicans ranged between 38% and 42% (v/v). When starch was incubated with honey and then added to media, a MIC drop was noticed with each variety. MAIC of the four varieties ranged between 32% honey (v/v) with 4% starch and 36% honey (v/v) with 2% starch. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ginger starch allows honey benefit and will constitute an alternative way against the resistance to antifungal agents.
