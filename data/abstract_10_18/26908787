BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-nonsusceptible invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) decreased substantially after the US introduction of the pediatric 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in 2000. However, rates of antibiotic-nonsusceptible non-PCV7-type IPD increased during 2004-2009. In 2010, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7. We assessed the impact of PCV13 on antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD rates. METHODS: We defined IPD as pneumococcal isolation from a normally sterile site in a resident from 10 US surveillance sites. Antibiotic-nonsusceptible isolates were those intermediate or resistant to >/=1 antibiotic classes according to 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. We examined rates of antibiotic nonsusceptibility and estimated cases prevented between observed cases of antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD and cases that would have occurred if PCV13 had not been introduced. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2013, rates of antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD caused by serotypes included in PCV13 but not in PCV7 decreased from 6.5 to 0.5 per 100 000 in children aged <5 years and from 4.4 to 1.4 per 100 000 in adults aged >/=65 years. During 2010-2013, we estimated that 1636 and 1327 cases of antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD caused by serotypes included in PCV13 but not PCV7 were prevented among children aged <5 years (-97% difference) and among adults aged >/=65 years (-64% difference), respectively. Although we observed small increases in antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD caused by non-PCV13 serotypes, no non-PCV13 serotype dominated among antibiotic-nonsusceptible strains. CONCLUSIONS: After PCV13 introduction, antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD decreased in multiple age groups. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor trends of nonvaccine serotypes. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are important tools in the approach to combat antibiotic resistance.
