Because of the rise in antimicrobial resistance there has been a significant increase in interest in phages for therapeutic use. Furthermore, the cost of sequencing phage genomes has decreased to the point where it is being used as a teaching tool for genomics. Unfortunately, the quality of the descriptions of the phage and its annotation frequently are substandard. The following chapter is designed to help people working on phages, particularly those new to the field, to accurately describe their newly isolated viruses.
