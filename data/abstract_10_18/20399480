We measured the effects of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor-resistant mutations K101E+G190S, on replication fitness and EFV-resistance of HIV(NL4-3). K101E+G190S reduced fitness in the absence of EFV and increased EFV resistance, compared to either single mutant. Unexpectedly, K101E+G190S also replicated more efficiently in the presence of EFV than in its absence. Addition of the nucleoside resistance mutations L74V or M41L+T215Y to K101E+G190S improved fitness and abolished EFV-dependent stimulation of replication. D10, a clinical RT backbone containing M41L+T215Y and K101E+G190S, also demonstrated EFV-dependent stimulation that was dependent on the presence of K101E. These studies demonstrate that non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can stimulate replication of NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 and that nucleoside-resistant mutants can abolish this stimulation. The ability of EFV to stimulate NNRTI-resistant mutants may contribute to the selection of HIV-1 mutants in vivo. These studies have important implications regarding the treatment of HIV-1 with combination nucleoside and non-nucleoside therapies.
