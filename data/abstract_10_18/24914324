Standard triple therapy, consisting of a proton pump inhibitor, plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin, has been the most commonly used first-line treatment regimen for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication for many years worldwide. However, as a result of increased resistance to antibiotics, H. pylori eradication rates with use of standard triple therapy have been declining and recently reached < 80% in many countries. Several new strategies to enhance the eradication rate of H. pylori have been studied. Currently, among the alternative first-line eradication regimens, concomitant and hybrid regimens have shown excellent results and could be the optimal treatment option. Although clinical usefulness of rescue therapy for patients in whom eradication of H. pylori with non-bismuth quadruple regimen has failed is unclear, levofloxacin-based quadruple therapy has shown promise as a rescue treatment. The choice of third-line therapy depends on factors such as the local pattern of antibiotic resistance, drug availability, and previous treatment. We hope that a simple method for detection of antibiotic susceptibility using polymerase chain reaction would be a possible alternative to administration of "tailored treatment" in the era of increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.
