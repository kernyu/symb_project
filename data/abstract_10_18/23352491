Mycobacterium septicum is a rapidly growing Mycobacterium (RGM) that rarely causes pulmonary disease globally. We describe a case of M. septicum pulmonary disease, which to our knowledge is the first reported in China. The isolates were identified as M. septicum and were susceptible in vitro to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole.
