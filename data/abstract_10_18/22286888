We present an HIV-1-infected male (who is now 52 years old) with a multi-drug-resistant virus and discuss the considerations finally leading to an antiretroviral regimen resulting in long-term viral suppression and excellent immunological response in a deep salvage situation. Even in a desperate situation with high-level multi-class resistance, highly individual, personalized antiretroviral regimes can be tailor-made to achieve unexpected improvements in the health status of a patient.
