In the therapeutic field, analysis of antibiotics consumption and use is of great importance: it is considered a necessary prerequisite for initiating measures to rationalize the use of antibiotics, but also to limit bacterial resistance. In this light, we conducted an observational study on antibiotics consumption at the Policlinico University Hospital in Naples to evaluate the prescription of antibiotics in the hospital's four main divisions. We used the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) as a measure of antibiotics consumption, and collected data retrospectively from 2006 to 2007. Our findings clearly show a 23.3% increase in antibiotics consumption in 2007 vs 2006. The classes of antibiotics experiencing the greatest percentage increases were penicillins and other beta-lactams, quinolones and glycopeptides. In particular, among other beta-lactams (J01D) in 2007 was the consumption of third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems. The surgical division showed the largest increase in use of antibiotics, while in intensive care we found a reduction. Our data suggest consumption data should be compared with information on prescriptions and costs so as to monitor more closely the consumption of antibiotics and thus rationalize their use with a view to reducing the phenomenon of bacterial resistance. Finally, it would be useful to launch a training program for the proper use of antibiotics in our University Hospital.
