BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniaeis a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia and septicemia in adults. The global drug-susceptible capsular serotype 12F, clonal complex 218 caused several outbreaks in the United States between 1989 and 2008, as well as a recent large outbreak in Manitoba, Canada, that resulted in 36 cases of septicemia and 3 deaths. The evolutionary origin of the Canadian outbreak strain and its relationship to the historical US outbreak strains are not known. METHODS: Whole-genome deep sequencing was performed on isolates from the Canadian outbreak (n = 36), the US outbreaks (n = 9), and nonoutbreak surveys (n = 21). Phylogenomic analysis and comparative genomics were used to assess evolutionary relationships and to detect gene content differences between the isolates. RESULTS: The Canadian outbreak was closely related to sporadic cases that occurred preoutbreak in cross-border geographic regions in Manitoba, North Dakota, and Iowa. The emerging Canadian strain differed from US strains by acquisition of a cell-surface protein and macrolide resistance determinants via incorporation of a 5.3-kb mega cassette harboringmsrDandmefE Furthermore, during 11 months of transmission, this clone evolved rapidly and acquired fluoroquinolone resistance through precise stepwise mutations in bothparCandgyrA, and putative compensatory mutations inuraAorIMPDHunder drug selection. Alarmingly, this drug-resistant clone appears to have spread quickly to other regions of Canada and the United States, and replaced drug-susceptible strains. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-genome sequencing revealed an independent emergence and secondary adaptation of a new virulent and drug-resistant pneumococcal epidemic clone. Ongoing molecular surveillance is required, and measures to prevent its spread should be developed.
