There is no agreement about the frequency of nosocomial infections and infections caused by multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO) in Germany. The aim of this review is to generate updated estimates of the national burden of these infections and to discuss them in an international context. The most important sources of this analysis are the data of the national prevalence studies conducted in various European countries and in the U.S. It can be assumed that there are between 400,000 and 600,000 patients with nosocomial infections each year in Germany. The mortality attributable to them is between 6000 and 15,000 patients. About 30,000 to 35,000 patients develop nosocomial infections caused by MDRO. Currently there are no robust data how many patients die each year because of MDRO infections. According to the best available estimate, the annual number may be between 1000 and 4000 cases. The problems of nosocomial infections and the increase of antimicrobial resistance are highly relevant and should not be belittled. However, an overestimation of this dangerous trend may lead to inappropriate use of limited resources.
