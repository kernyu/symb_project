PURPOSE: The risk factors for acquiring an infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in patients with anastomotic leakage after colorectal cancer surgery are poorly understood. We evaluated the risk factors associated with the initial acquisition of MDR pathogens in patients with anastomotic leakage after colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data at a university affiliated-tertiary referral hospital in South Korea. From January 2009 to April 2013, a total of 6767 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery were registered. Of these patients, 190 (2.8%) were diagnosed with anastomotic leakage. Finally, 143 (2.1%) patients with culture test results were included in this study. RESULTS: Of the 143 enrolled patients, 46 (32.2%) were classified in the MDR group. The use of antibiotics for more than 5 days before diagnosis of anastomosis site leakage (p = 0.016) and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.028) was identified as independent risk factors for MDR acquisition by multivariate analysis. The rate of adequate initial empirical antibiotic therapy in the MDR group was lower than in the non-MDR group (35 vs. 75%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the duration of antibiotic administration after the leak was longer in the MDR group (p = 0.013). Patients in the MDR group also had a longer hospital stay (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The length of antibiotic administration before the diagnosis of anastomotic leakage and diabetes mellitus were risk factors associated with the acquisition of MDR bacteria in patients with anastomotic leakage after colorectal cancer surgery.
