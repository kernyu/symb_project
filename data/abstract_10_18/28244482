BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of blood stream infections in patients with cancer is crucial to design empirical therapy regimes. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study at a tertiary care private hospital in Mumbai, India from Nov 2009 - Dec 2014. RESULTS: A total of 62 episodes of blood stream infections in 57 patients with cancer were recorded during the study period. Analysis was limited to 52 isolates from 49 episodes in 45 patients. Gram negative pathogens caused 77% of these infections; commonest pathogens were E. coli and Klebsiella. High prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was noted. Susceptibility in E. coli, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas to 3rd generation cephalosporins, beta lactam beta lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems and amikacin was 4%, 56.5%, 70% and 86% respectively. CONCLUSION: The high rates of antimicrobial resistance in gram negative isolates is alarming.
