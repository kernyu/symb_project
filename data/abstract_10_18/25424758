OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide an indication of the prevalence and severity of anthelmintic resistance (AR) in the Australian sheep industry by compiling the results of faecal worm egg count reduction tests (FECRTs). METHODS: Government and private parasitology laboratories, pharmaceutical companies and veterinarians known to have conducted FECRTs were asked to provide results that conformed to Australian and New Zealand standard diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: Data were available from a total of 390 tests, with larval differentiation conducted in 222 cases. Pooled results from all states for the macrocyclic lactone (ML) class showed a lower prevalence of AR against combined species for moxidectin (54%) compared with abamectin (77%) and ivermectin (87%). Analysis by state revealed higher levels of ML-resistant Teladorsagia sp. in Tasmania and Western Australia than in other states and ML-resistant Haemonchus sp. was more frequently detected in New South Wales. CONCLUSION: This compilation of results of FECRTs conducted by Australian parasitology laboratories in 2009-12 showed widespread AR of the common sheep nematodes (Teladorsagia, Trichostrongylus and Haemonchus) to all broad-spectrum anthelmintics, with the exception of monepantel, whether used singly or in combination.
