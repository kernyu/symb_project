Rationally designed amphiphilic small molecules selectively kill drug-sensitive and drug-resistant bacteria over mammalian cells. The small molecules disperse preformed biofilms and reduce viable bacterial count in the biofilms. Moreover, this class of membrane-active molecules disarms the development of bacterial resistance.
