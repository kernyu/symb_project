Candidaemia is one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections. There is a rise in the incidence of non-albicans candidaemia and emergence of anti-fungal resistance. We performed a retrospective laboratory-based study over a period of 2 years (January 2009 to December 2010) at our quaternary care multi super-specialty hospital in Southern India. There had been 68 Candida isolates detected from the bloodstream of 55 patients during the study period. Overall, 74% of cases were due to non-albicans Candida. C. tropicalis was most commonly isolated (39.7%), followed by C. albicans (26.4%). All Candida isolates remain susceptible to voriconazole, whereas highest degree of resistance was observed for fluconazole.
