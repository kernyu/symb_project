We report a nosocomial outbreak of urinary tract infection caused by Myroides odoratimimus, previously called Flavobacterium odoratum, in the urology unit of a Tunisian hospital. From May to November 2010, seven isolates of M. odoratimimus were recovered from urine. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis clearly differentiated these isolates into two possibly related clones from two different periods. All patients but one had urinary calculi and underwent endourological surgery. All Myroides isolates were resistant to all antibiotics tested. Three patients were successfully treated with ciprofloxacin and rifampicin. Clinicians should be aware that M. odoratimimus may induce serious and prolonged nosocomial outbreaks of urinary tract infections.
