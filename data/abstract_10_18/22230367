In this study, we explored the role of Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) on the expression of P450 2E1 and related ROS production. P450 2E1 protein, not mRNA, was expressed at relatively low levels in BI-1 plasmid-transfected cells (BI-1 cells) compared with neomycin-resistant vector-transfected cells (Neo cells). When exposed to ER stress, P450 2E1 expression and activity and ER membrane lipid peroxidation increased in both Neo cells and BI-1 cells, but to a lesser degree in BI-1 cells. This observation correlated with the lower level of ER stress in BI-1 cells than Neo cells. To examine the BI-1-associated P450 2E1 degradation mechanism, cells were treated with the lysosome inhibitor, bafilomycin and the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Bafilomycin recovered the reduced P450 2E1 expression in BI-1 cells, but did not affect P450 2E1 expression in Neo cells. Next, proteosomal and lysosomal activities in Neo cells were compared to those in BI-1 cells. Although proteosomal activity was similar between Neo and BI-1 cells, LysoTracker and acridine orange labeling, lysosomal V-ATPase activity, and lysosomal cathepsin B expression were higher in BI-1 cells than in Neo cells. In the presence of ER stress, lysosomal activities decreased in Neo cells but did not change in BI-1 cells. P450 2E1 expression and ER membrane lipid peroxidation were greater in the hepatocytes and livers of BI-1 knock-out mice than in BI-1 wild-type cells and mice. Our results suggest that the BI-1-mediated enhancement of lysosomal activity regulates P450 2E1 expression and resultant ROS accumulation.
