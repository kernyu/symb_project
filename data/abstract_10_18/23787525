BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli is potential source of transmission of resistance to other water borne pathogens where plasmid borne resistance is most significant. METHODS: Drinking water samples were collected from different water sources: that is to say- tap, well and spring from different places of Kathmandu where E. coli and thermotolerant E. coli were isolated using membrane filtration technique. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using a modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method and thermotolerant E. coli isolates from tap water were subjected for plasmid profiling. RESULTS: Type of water sources were not associated with the presence of coliform (P=0.155) and thermotolerant coliform (P=0.235) but the significant association was observed in thermotolerant coliform and thermotolerant E. coli for all sources tap (P=0.029), well (P=0.028), spring (P=0.05) but total coliform and E. coli association was found for well (P=0.01). All E. coli and thermotolerant E. coli isolates were susceptible to Ofloxacin, Chloramphenicol and Cotrimixazole. Resistance to Cefexime, Amikacin, Nalidixic acid, Amoxicillin, Tetracycline were 17 (54.8%), 9 (29%), 11 (35.5%), 25 (80.6%), 29 (93.5%) and 19 (57.6%), 12 (36.4%), 13 (39.4%), 31 (94%), 33 (100%) was observed in E. coli and thermotolerant E. coli respectively where 25 (75.8%) thermotolerant E. coli and 22 (70.9%) E. coli were observed with multiple drug resistance patterns. Single band of plasmid were observed in three MDRs and one non-MDR isolates and size varied from 2kb to >10kb. All Nalidixic acid resistant thermotolerant E. coli were found to harbor a plasmid. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of plasmid in Nalidixic acid resistant thermotolerant E. coli heightens public health issue and the need of monitoring Quinolone resistance bacteria in environment.
