Global dissemination of imipenem-resistant (IR) clones of Acinetobacter baumannii - A. calcoaceticus complex (ABC) have been frequently reported but the molecular epidemiological features of IR-ABC in military treatment facilities (MTFs) have not been described. We characterized 46 IR-ABC strains from a dataset of 298 ABC isolates collected from US service members hospitalized in different US MTFs domestically and overseas during 2003-2008. All IR strains carried the bla(OXA-51) gene and 40 also carried bla(OXA-23) on plasmids and/or chromosome; one carried bla(OXA-58) and four contained ISAbal located upstream of bla(OXA-51). Strains tended to cluster by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles in time and location. Strains from two major clusters were identified as international clone I by multilocus sequence typing.
