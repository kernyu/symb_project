We report a case of a 78 year old patient with primary septic arthritis who was treated with knee arthrodesis using computer navigation. Use of computer navigation avoided violating the medullary canal and its associated risks. Also, it offered the advantage of making precise bone cuts in all the three planes, thus minimizing the risk of malalignment. At 3 months, our patient showed good appositional contact of the bone ends, stable fusion, with no sign of infection and was mobilized with a simple brace. At 6 months review, the patient was walking painlessly without support. We achieved a mechanical axis alignment of 0 degrees and 11 degrees flexion as planned.
