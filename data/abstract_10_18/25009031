OBJECTIVE: To understand HIV rival suppression and drug resistance (HIVDR) among AIDS patients who were receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Dehong prefecture, Yunnan province. METHODS: All AIDS patients who were aged over 15 years and with experience more than six months on ART by the end of 2012 in Dehong prefecture, were enrolled to receive testing for HIV viral load in plasma and genetic mutations associated with HIVDR. RESULTS: A total of 4 390 AIDS patients were qualified for the study according to the selection criteria, of whom 3 964 (90.3%) finally participated in the study. Among them, 2 307(58.2%) had CD(4)(+) cell counts more than 350 cells/mm(3). 3 169 (79.9%) patients showed undetectable plasma HIV viral load which was lower than the detection threshold. Those who had the following factors as:resided in Ruili city, being female, older than 45 years of age, married, heterosexually infected with HIV, having received ART more than 5 years, and CD(4)(+) cell counts >500 cells/mm(3), were more likely to have undetectable plasma virus load, with the differences statistically significant. 402 (10.1%) patients had plasma viral load >/= 1 000 copies/ml, of whom 353 (87.8%) were successfully amplified and examined for HIVDR. Among them, 198 (56.1% ) were identified to bear genetic mutations associated with HIVDR. Most mutations were related to the resistance to nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), with M184V and K103N most frequently seen. 12 patients (3.4%) were found to have mutations resistant to protease inhibitors (PI). Data from multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the period of receiving ART and the initial ART regimen could both significantly predict the occurrence of HIV resistance. CONCLUSION: Viral suppression was highly achieved among ART-prescribed AIDS patients in Dehong prefecture,Yunnan province. However, among those who did not show effective viral suppression, the proportion of HIVDR was high, underscoring the needs for health education so as to improve the adherence to drugs as well as for improving testing for viral load and HIVDR among AIDS patients.
