There are 350,000 hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers all over the world. Chronic HBV infection is at a high risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC), and heavily threatened people's health. Two kinds of drugs approved by FDA for anti-HBV therapy are immunomodulators (interferon alpha, pegylated-interferon alpha) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). These drugs have been proved to be far from being satisfactory due to their low specificity, side effects, and high rate of drug resistance. There is an urgent need to discover and develop novel effective anti-HBV drugs. With vast resources, various structures, diverse biological activities and action mechanisms, as well as abundant clinical experiences, botanical agents become a promising source of finding new anti-HBV drugs. This review summarizes the recent research and development of anti-HBV agents derived from botanical origin on their sources and active components, inhibitory effects and possible toxicities, as well as action targets and mechanisms, and also addresses the advantages and the existing shortcomings in the development of botanical inhibitors. This information may not only broaden the knowledge of anti-HBV therapy, and offer possible alternative or substitutive drugs for CHB patients, but also provides considerable information for developing new safe and effective anti-HBV drugs.
