BACKGROUND: Hepatic abscess secondary to Salmonella is extremely rare in the United States and other Western countries. METHODS: A 43-year-old Caucasian man, with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, was admitted to the hospital for intermittent abdominal pain, fever and diarrhea. Clinical, radiological and laboratory results were analyzed. Medical literature in PubMed pertaining to similar cases was reviewed. RESULTS: Stool culture was positive for Salmonella serotype B and a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast was consistent with a solitary hepatic abscess. Appropriate intravenous antibiotics followed by oral maintenance therapy for six weeks resulted in a complete clinical recovery and radiographic resolution. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of Salmonella hepatic abscess in our patient was most likely associated with decreased mucosal resistance to the bacteria, seeding of infection via transient portal bacteremia and loss of host immunity. Our case highlights the fact that appropriate antibiotic alone is sufficient in the management of a solitary hepatic abscess less than 3-5 cm.
