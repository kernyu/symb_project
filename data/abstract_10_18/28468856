Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is a fundamental mission of the clinical microbiology laboratory. Reference AST methods are based on bacterial growth in antibiotic doubling dilution series, which means that any error in the reference method inherently represents at least a 2-fold difference. We describe the origins of current AST reference methodology, highlight the sources of AST variability, and propose ideas for improving AST predictive power.
