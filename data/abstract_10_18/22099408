Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has spread to most regions of the world and represents a serious threat to the success of the struggle against tuberculosis. It can result from errors in management that favour the selection of drug resistant organisms and can in the worst case lead to the development of extremely resistant organisms (XDR-TB) which are practically untreatable. The current strategies for combating this problem are, on the one hand, the rapid identification and tracking of resistant strains using molecular genetic techniques and, on the other hand, careful drug management in individual cases using second line agents. At the level of public health, the most important measures are those which prevent or correct the processes which can drive the creation of new cases of MDR-TB. This can have implications for the modification and development of national strategies. The future of the fight against tuberculosis depends in part on the success of strategies to combat the development and spread of MDR-TB.
