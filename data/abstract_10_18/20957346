The antiviral drug Tamiflu has received particular attention because of its recommended use against the influenza A H5N1 and H1N1 viruses. Given its resistance to degradation and its hydrophilicity the active metabolite, Oseltamivir Carboxylate (OC), is expected to enter the aquatic ecosystem from sewage treatment plants. In the present paper the bacterial community of surface water samples, treated with OC (1.5 mg L(-)(1)), was characterized by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in microcosm experiments. The alpha-, beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria increased in OC-treated versus non-treated water samples during the incubation period, suggesting these bacterial groups had an active role in OC degradation.
