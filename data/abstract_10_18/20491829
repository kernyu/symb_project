The emergence of multidrug-resistance Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an increasing threat to tuberculosis control programmes. Susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates by traditional methods requires a minimum of 14 days. This can be reduced significantly if molecular analysis is used. DNA sequencing is a good method for detecting mutation, but cannot be used routinely because of its relatively high cost. A sensitive and specific microarray has been designed to detect mutations in the rifampin resistance determining region of rpoB and loci in katG and inhA associated with isoniazid (INH) resistance. A panel of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates containing 13 different rpoB genotypes, two mutation genotypes within codon 315 of katG and one mutation genotypes at inhA was used to validate the microarray. The results obtained indicate that 100% of rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis strains isolated in Chongqing had rpoB mutations, with 531-Ser and 526-His being the most common positions substituted. Of the total 50 INH resistant isolates, 82% had a katG315 mutation and 18% had an inhA mutation. All the mutations detected by the microarray method were also confirmed by conventional DNA sequencing. It is demonstrated that the microarray is an efficient, specialized technique and can be used as a rapid method for detecting rifampin and isoniazid resistance.
