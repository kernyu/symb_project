Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological treatments are often applied in cases of pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Especially in combination both methods are particularly efficacious; nonetheless, 40 % of all patients treated remain symptomatic. Exposure with response prevention, based on the principle of habituation, is the intervention with the best evidence. More recent cognitive and metacognitive treatments focus on modifying expectations and may have the potential to improve treatment efficacy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first line of treatment in severe cases of OCD. With treatment resistance, the SSRI should be changed, or alternatively clomipramine can be employed. Augmentation strategies suggest the combination of two SSRIs, SSRI und clomipramin, or SSRI and (atypical) neuroleptics. Following successful treatment, medication should be reduced very slowly. Novel treatments in children and adolescent have been reported for antiglutamatergic agents as riluzole or D-cycloserine, a partial agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA).
