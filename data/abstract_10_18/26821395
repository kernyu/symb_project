OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical effects of treatment for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection for 1 year in our specialized hospital in 2011. Two hundred and ninety-six (296) patients were admitted and received treatment. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-six patients (86.5%) were started on the standard treatment with 3 drugs (isoniazid [INH, rifampicin [RFP], and ethambutol [EB] or streptomycin [SM]) or 4 drugs (INH, RFP, EB or SM, and pyrazinamide [PZA]). One hundred and seventy-one patients (66.8%) continued receiving the standard treatment during the admission period. Of 160 cases who could continue 4 drugs, under 80 year-old patients were 127 cases (76.0%), but over 80 year-old patients were 33 cases (49.3%). The mean duration for negative conversion of sputum culture was 40.6 days. Liver dysfunction due to 4 drugs (INH, RFP, EB, and PZA) was noted in 8.5% of patients. Eighteen of the 296 patients had multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Each MDR-TB patient received individualized treatment. Moreover, 7 of the MDR-TB cases were treated surgically. DISCUSSION: Treatment of TB had taken long time, and some patients could not continue the treatment owing to the adverse effects of drugs. Hence, it is important to monitor adverse effects of drugs in each patient.
