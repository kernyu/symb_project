beta-lactam antibiotics are utilised to treat bacterial infection. beta-lactamase enzymes (EC 3.5.2.6) are produced by several bacteria and are responsible for their resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillin, cephamycins and carbapenems. New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) is a gene that makes bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Preparing a compound against NDM-1 will require additional investment and development by drug manufacturers as the current antibiotics will not treat patients with NDM-1 resistance. NDM-1 of Kolkata showed convergent-type evolution with other NDM-1 producing strains. The modelled structure exhibited alpha-beta-alpha barrel-type domain along with Zn metallo-beta-lactamase N-terminal domain. Compounds belonging to cephalosporins (relatively resistant to beta-lactamase) and other antibiotics ceftaroline, ceftobiprole, piperacillin, penamecillin, azidocillin, cefonicid, tigecycline and colistin have exhibited better binding affinity with the modelled NDM-1.
