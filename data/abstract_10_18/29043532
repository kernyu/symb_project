AIMS: Bacteria adherent to long-term urinary catheters (LTUC) may give misleading urine culture results. Guidelines in the USA recommend changing LTUC before urine collection to diagnose UTI and before commencing appropriate antimicrobial treatment. However, in the UK there is no such guidance. In this study, we evaluated differences in urine cultures before and after changing LTUC. METHODS: In a prospective study in a UK urology department, we made a quantitative and qualitative comparison between paired urines collected before and after catheter change in patients with LTUC. We measured culture growth on a four-point ordinal scale as nil, scanty (< 10(7) cfu/L), moderate (10(7)-10(8) cfu/L) or heavy (> 10(8) cfu/L) and recorded the range of bacterial species isolated. Statistical analysis was by Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (55 males, 11 females) took part in the study. Urines with no growth increased from 7/66 (11%) before change of catheter to 21/66(32%) after change of catheter. Cultures reported as heavy growth (> 10(8) cfu/L) reduced from 48/66 (73%) to 25/66 (38%) after catheter change (p < 0.001). Except for Pseudomonas spp., other organisms were isolated less frequently after catheter change. No Proteus spp. was isolated after catheter change. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that failure to change long-term catheters before collecting urine for culture may give misleading results. In the interest of accurate diagnosis and antimicrobial stewardship, UK guidelines should recommend changing long-term urinary catheters before collection of urine for culture.
