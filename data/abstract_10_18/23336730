BACKGROUND: To evaluate the impact of an antibiotic restriction policy on antibiotic consumption and Gram-negative resistance rates, in an environment of antibiotic overconsumption and increasing resistance rates for nosocomial pathogens. METHODS: The study was a 'before and after' trial of 18-month duration; the antibiotic restriction policy program was implemented in 1998-2000 and was based on a government program addressed by the Ministry of Health to public hospitals on a national basis. This included prescribing of all newer antibiotics on an order form, auditing of the order forms and consultation with infectious diseases (ID) specialists, dispensing of treatment and prophylaxis guidelines, feedback, and face-to-face education. Antibiotic consumption and Gram-negative resistance rates were recorded before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Despite the addition of a new 40-bed ID department in the hospital during the 'after' period, the consumption of restricted antibiotics was significantly reduced by 42% (and their cost by 31%). Gram-negative resistance rates for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter, serving as index microorganisms for Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens, were significantly reduced during the 'after' period, even against antibiotics for which there was an increase in consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary restriction programs can reduce antibiotic consumption and Gram-negative resistance rates in the hospital setting.
