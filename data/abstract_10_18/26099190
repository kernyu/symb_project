The use of fluoroquinolones (FQ), antibiotics, which have excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and a broad spectrum of action, has increased dramatically in recent years, both in adults and children. Numerous safety and efficacy data are now available on FQ use in children, particularly regarding the treatment of complicated infections of the urinary tract, typhoid fever, pneumonia, acute external otitis, acute media otitis, meningoencephalitis, sepsis in neutropenic children and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), though sometimes studies have the limitations that they were conducted in selected populations, such as children with cystic fibrosis. Despite available safety data are encouraging, there is still an open debate on the toxicity of this class of antibiotics on weight-bearing joints in children. Not being able to exclude the possibility that, in rare cases, this event is likely to occur, their use in children should be limited to cases where the cost-benefit has been carefully examined, for example, in the case of sepsis or other severe infections from multi-resistant bacteria and not responsive to other classes of drugs. Furthermore, considering the increased use of FQ in children, it is possible that there is an increase in the incidence of infections from resistant germs (such as Escherichia coli, and pneumococci), as occurred in adults. In order to limit the diffusion of resistance, a judicious and appropriate use of this class of drugs is recommended.
