The probiotic properties of Enterococcus (E.) faecalis PSCT3-7, a new strain isolated from the intestines of pigs fed dietary fiber containing 50% sawdust, were investigated. E. faecalis PSCT3-7 tolerated a pH range of 3 to 8 and 0.3% bile salts, and it inhibited the growth of Salmonella Typhimurium in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, E. faecalis showed resistance to several antibacterial agents. Vermiculite, a nutrient and microbial carrier, increased the bile tolerance of the strain. Scanning electron microscope images revealed good adsorption of E. faecalis PSCT3-7 onto vermiculite. E. faecalis PSCT3-7 represents a potential probiotic candidate to administer with vermiculite to swine.
