The increasing number of multidrug resistant gram negative bacteria, particularly in patients with risk factors, but in those who suffer community infections as well, is doing more and more difficult to choose the appropriate treatment. The most challenging cases are due to the production of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases. This mini-review will discuss the adequacy of administering carbapenems when suspecting infections due to ESBL that could be modified after knowing the MIC of the isolated bacteria and the combined therapy in cases of carbapenemases, being particularly important to include a carbapenem and/or colistine at high dosages in this combination.
