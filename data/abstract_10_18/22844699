Prevalence of mecA, blaZ, tetO/K/M, ermA/B/C, aph, and vanA/B/C/D genes conferring resistance to oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, and vancomycin was investigated in 65 staphylococcal isolates belonging to twelve species obtained from ready-to-eat porcine, bovine, and chicken products. All coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) and S. aureus isolates harbored at least one antibiotic resistance gene. None of the S. aureus possessed more than three genes, while 25% of the CNS isolates harbored at least four genes encoding resistance to clinically used antibiotics. In 15 CNS isolates the mecA gene was detected, while all S. aureus isolates were mecA-negative. We demonstrate that in ready-to-eat food the frequency of CNS harboring multiple antibiotic resistance genes is higher than that of multiple resistant S. aureus, meaning that food can be considered a reservoir of bacteria containing genes potentially contributing to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in staphylococci.
