Antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis poses a global threat, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people annually. While whole-genome sequencing (WGS), with its unprecedented level of detail, promises to play an increasingly important role in diagnosis, data analysis is a daunting challenge. Here, we present a simple-to-use web service (free for academic use at http://phyresse.org). Delineating both lineage and resistance, it provides state-of-the-art methodology to life scientists and physicians untrained in bioinformatics. It combines elaborate data processing and quality control, as befits human diagnostics, with a treasure trove of validated resistance data collected from well-characterized samples in-house and worldwide.
