The emergence of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) with multidrug resistance (MDR) profile is a worrisome public health issue. We report the first draft genome sequence of a hypermucoviscous (positive string test) and MDR K. pneumoniae serotype K19, belonging to ST29, isolated from human infection. This strain harboured multiple antimicrobial resistance genes, including blaCTX-M-15, besides yersiniabactin and type 3 fimbriae virulence genes. In vivo experiments carried out with the Galleria mellonella infection model revealed that K. pneumoniae K19/ST29 killed 100% of the larvae at 24 h post-infection, in a similar way to the known hypermucoviscous hvKP K1/ST23 lineage.
