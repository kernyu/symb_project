The developmental stage has an influence on the overall responses of plants under biotic or abiotic stress conditions. However, there is a lack of data about the effects of ionizing radiation in plants at different developmental stages. We examined radiation sensitivity of Arabidopsis plants in terms of photosynthetic ability and oxidative stress resistance at two distinct vegetative and reproductive stages, which correspond to 23 and 43 d after seeding (DAS), respectively. When plants were exposed to gamma rays at a dose rate 50 Gy h(-1) for 4 h, they were characterized as various common or differential cellular responses depending on the developmental stage. Radial expansion of leaves, inhibition of non-photochemical quenching, and production of *O(2)(-) and H(2)O(2) under methyl viologen-induced photooxidative stress were commonly more conspicuous in the irradiated leaves of both plants than in the respective control. In contrast, the 23 and 43-DAS plants were explicitly discriminated in growth, chloroplast number & ultrastructure, photosynthetic pigment content & activity, and protein damage after gamma irradiation. Natural leaf senescence was thereby enhanced in the irradiated leaves of the 23-DAS plants, while it was reversely alleviated in those of the 43-DAS ones. These results suggest that photosynthetic machineries of Arabidopsis plants at the reproductive stage can be relatively tolerant to gamma rays of 200 Gy.
