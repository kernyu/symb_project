PURPOSE: Resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer (PC) may account for the failure of conventional treatments. Recently, salinomycin (SAL) has been identified as selective inhibitor of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In our study, we aimed to deliver SAL to gemcitabine-resistant PC by the aid of poly ethylene glycol-b-poly lactic acid (PEG-b-PLA) polymeric micelles (PMs). METHODS: SAL-loaded PMs were prepared and investigated in terms of pharmaceutical properties. MTT and Annexin V/PI assays were used to study cell proliferation and apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells in response to treatment with SAL micellar formulations. Alterations in CSC phenotype, invasion strength, and mRNA expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were also determined in the treated cells. In vivo antitumor study was performed in Balb/c AsPC-1 xenograft mice. RESULTS: PM formulations of SAL were prepared in suitable size and loading traits. In gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells, SAL was found to significantly increase cell mortality and apoptosis. It was also observed that SAL micellar formulations inhibited invasion and harnessed EMT in spite of induced expression of Snail. The in vivo antitumor experiment showed significant tumor eradication and the highest survival probability in mice treated with SAL PMs. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results showed the efficacy of SAL nano-formulation against PC tumor cells.
