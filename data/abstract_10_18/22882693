BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a pathogen that emerged in the late twentieth century and was associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We report for the first time the outcomes of lung transplant recipients infected with CRKP or extended spectrum-beta lactamases K. pneumoniae (ESBL-KP). METHODS: Retrospective review of 136 lung transplant recipients who underwent transplantation between 2004 and 2007 in Rabin Medical Center, Israel. MAIN RESULTS: There were 52 episodes of positive cultures for K. pneumoniae (KP) in 136 recipients - of them 11 (8.1%) with CRKP, 12 (8.8%) with ESBL-KP, and 29 (21.3%) with carbapenem-sensitive ESBL-negative KP. Isolation of CRKP/ESBL-KP was associated with death in the cohort (p < 0.0001) as well as recipients' age at transplantation (p < 0.005). Time-dependent age-adjusted CRKP or ESBL-KP acquisition was an independent factor for death in patients after lung transplant, compared to patients without KP isolation or carbapenem-sensitive ESBL-negative KP (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: CRKP and KP-ESBL acquisition was associated with reduced survival among lung transplant recipients.
