Pneumococcal infections continue to pose a serious medical problem. A broad range of serotypes, increasing resistance to antibiotics and high pathogenic potential of pneumococci are associated with development of various clinical forms of diseases. Some chronic diseases are an important predisposing factor for development of pneumococcal infections. The most common noninvasive forms of the disease are otitis, sinusitis, conjunctivitis; pneumonia is on the borderline between the invasive and noninvasive forms. Meningitis, sepsis, endocarditis and arthritis all belong to invasive pneumococcal diseases. The diagnosis is based on the so-called classic microbiological and molecular biology methods aimed at determining the pneumococcal serotype. The treatment recommendations are varied, depending on the resistance status in particular geographic regions. Prevention of the infections is primarily based on vaccination. In the past, only polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) was available; currently, there are conjugate vaccines (PCVs), either 10-valent (PCV10) or 13-valent (PCV13). Initially, PCVs were used exclusively in children; later, PCV13 was approved for selected indications in the adult population. Since 2013, it has been indicated for both children and adults of all ages. These facts have been incorporated into updated guidelines in various specialties. The future of pneumococcal infection prevention rests with the development of protein vaccines.
