Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults and is associated with high relapse rates. It is known that leukemia stem cells (LSCs), a very small subpopulation of the total number of leukemic cells, maintain the leukemia phenotype ( approximately 80-90% of AML remain the same as at first diagnosis), display chemotherapy resistance, and contribute to disease regeneration. Therefore, targeting LSCs could control the relapse of AML. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), an effector of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, can selectively downregulate any gene implicated in the pathology of disease, presenting great potential for treatment of AML. In this study an antibody targeted cyclodextrin-based nanoparticle (NP) (CD.DSPE-PEG-Fab) was developed for siRNA delivery specifically to AML LSCs. The targeted CD.siRNA.DSPE-PEG-Fab formulation, where Fab specifically targets the IL-3 receptor alpha-chain (IL-3Ralpha, also known as CD123, a cell surface antigen for human AML LSCs), achieved antigen-mediated cellular uptake in KG1 cells (an AML leukemia stem and progenitor cell line). Efficient delivery of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) siRNA using the targeted formulation resulted in downregulation of the corresponding mRNA and protein in KG1 cells and in ex vivo primary AML patient derived samples. The resulting silencing of BRD4 induced myeloid differentiation and triggered leukemia apoptosis. In addition, a synergistic therapeutic effect was detected when administered in combination with the chemotherapeutic, cytarabine (Ara-C). These results indicate the clinical potential of the antibody-tagged cyclodextrin NP for targeted delivery of therapeutic siRNA in the treatment of AML.
