The Aerococcus viridans isolates from bovine mastitis in Slovakia were isolated and characterized by classical microbiological and biochemical, and molecular techniques including IGS-PCR and rep-PCR, ARDRA and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The substantial variability of antibiotic resistance patterns was observed. The majority of strains were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, the resistance to tetracycline was observed in 3 tested strains, resistance to lincomycin was found in 4 strains and practically all tested strains were sensitive to neomycin and ciprofloxacin. While variable at a phenotypic level, no significant genetic variability among A. viridans isolates was detected by molecular DNA based methods. The data obtained suggest that a few A. viridans strains spread among cow's population in Slovak farms.
