Antibiotic combinations are often used for treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections but their efficacy toward intracellular bacteria has not been investigated so far. We have studied combinations of representatives of the main antipseudomonal classes (ciprofloxacin, meropenem, tobramycin, and colistin) against intracellular P. aeruginosa in a model of THP-1 monocytes in comparison with bacteria growing in broth, using the reference strain PAO1 and two clinical isolates (resistant to ciprofloxacin and meropenem, respectively). Interaction between drugs was assessed by checkerboard titration (extracellular model only), by kill curves, and by using the fractional maximal effect (FME) method, which allows studying the effects of combinations when dose-effect relationships are not linear. For drugs used alone, simple sigmoidal functions could be fitted to all concentration-effect relationships (extracellular and intracellular bacteria), with static concentrations close to (ciprofloxacin, colistin, and meropenem) or slightly higher than (tobramycin) the MIC and with maximal efficacy reaching the limit of detection in broth but only a 1 to 1.5 (colistin, meropenem, and tobramycin) to 2 to 3 (ciprofloxacin) log10 CFU decrease intracellularly. Extracellularly, all combinations proved additive by checkerboard titration but synergistic using the FME method and more bactericidal in kill curve assays. Intracellularly, all combinations proved additive only based on both FME and kill curve assays. Thus, although combinations appeared to modestly improve antibiotic activity against intracellular P. aeruginosa, they do not allow eradication of these persistent forms of infections. Combinations including ciprofloxacin were the most active (even against the ciprofloxacin-resistant strain), which is probably related to the fact this drug was the most effective alone intracellularly.
