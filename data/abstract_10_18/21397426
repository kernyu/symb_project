Among the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, 3.9% of K. pneumoniae showed nonsusceptibility to imipenem or meropenem; and their mechanism was the combination of ESBL and/or plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase production and porin loss. The presence of bla(CTX-M-14) and loss of OmpK36 were associated with higher carbapenem MICs.
