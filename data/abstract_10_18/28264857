Antimalarial drug resistance exacerbates the global disease burden and complicates eradication efforts. To facilitate the surveillance of resistance markers in countries of malaria endemicity, we developed a suite of TaqMan assays for known resistance markers and compartmentalized them into a single array card (TaqMan array card, TAC). We included 87 assays for species identification, for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum mutations associated with chloroquine, atovaquone, pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine, and artemisinin resistance, and for neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Assay performance was first optimized using DNA from common laboratory parasite lines and plasmid controls. The limit of detection was 0.1 to 10 pg of DNA and yielded 100% accuracy compared to sequencing. The tool was then evaluated on 87 clinical blood samples from around the world, and the malaria TAC once again achieved 100% accuracy compared to sequencing and in addition detected the presence of mixed infections in clinical samples. With its streamlined protocol and high accuracy, this malaria TAC should be a useful tool for large-scale antimalarial resistance surveillance.
