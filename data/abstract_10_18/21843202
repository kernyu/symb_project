The occurrence of staphylococci and enterococci expressing increased resistance to erythromycin (ERY) and, in particular, to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B) ) antibiotics was investigated in dairy cattle, pigs and turkeys. Three hundred rectal (cloacal) swabs of each animal species were examined. A total of 120 and 71 staphylococci and enterococci, respectively, with increased resistance to ERY were identified. These were most frequent in turkeys (42.3% of positive animals), followed by pigs and dairy cattle (6.7% and 6.0% of positive animals, respectively). Similarly, MLS(B) -resistant isolates colonized predominantly turkeys (29.7% of animals), while their occurrence in pigs and dairy cattle was only sporadic (0.8% of animals). At least one of the erm genes encoding for MLS(B) resistance was found in 56.7% and 69.0% of staphylococci and enterococci, respectively. The erm(C) gene prevailed in staphylococci while the erm(B) gene was predominant in enterococci. Macrolide efflux genes msr(A) and msr(C) were also frequent in staphylococci and enterococci, respectively. Macrolide inactivation gene mph(C) occurred mainly in staphylococci. In staphylococci, methicillin resistance was rarely detected (7.5% of isolates), but resistance to telithromycin (ketolides) was frequent in both staphylococci and enterococci (89.2% and 47.9% of isolates, respectively). This study showed that turkeys represent an important source of ERY (MLS(B) )-resistant cocci. In addition, resistance to ketolides was also frequent.
