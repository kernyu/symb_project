Carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) are isolated with increasing frequency, especially from immunocompromized patients. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) types of CPKP were not determined. Investigation of two CRKP isolates from a 2011 outbreak at the Clinical Center, the National Institutes of Health, identified a new capsular type shared by the two isolates, similar to K. pneumonia K19 and K34 but structurally different than any published K. pneumoniae CPS repeating unit: The LPS of the two isolates was found to have no O-specific polysaccharide and the chemical structure of the core oligosaccharides agreed with the published data. If this structure type will be prevalent among CPKP isolates, our findings could facilitate rapid diagnosis and help to develop new therapeutic solutions to this antibiotic resistant pathogen.
