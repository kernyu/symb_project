To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Klebsiella, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC) among burn infants in Iran. The objective of this study was to determine the phenotypic detection of these KPC among isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella spp. A cross-sectional study was performed (February to September 2011) at a tertiary burn hospital in Tehran, Iran. Sixty-four strains were isolated from 20 patients. Strain and genus of isolates were confirmed, antibiotic susceptibility testing was implemented, and KPC determined by Modified Hodge Test. Fifteen of 36 strains (six Pseudomonas aeruginosa, six Acinetobacter baumannii, and three Klebsiella pneumoniae) were resistant to imipenem. Ten strains of 36 Gram negative isolates were resistant to all tested antibiotics except for Colistin. Thirteen of 15 resistant imipenem strains were confirmed as KPC-producer bacteria that isolated from nine patients. Six of 36 isolated strains were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, of which four strains were both KPC and ESBL. A high percentage of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains in our centre with positive KPC have created a major challenge in terms of mortality and morbidity. The findings of this study highlight the importance of implementing an effective infection control strategy to prevent and decrease the prevalence of KPC-producing organisms.
