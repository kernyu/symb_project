Fifteen flavobacterium strains were isolated from raw chicken meat, raw goat meat and poultry soil in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Most of the isolates developed yellow pigmented colonies with mucoid-spreading edges on food flavobacterium medium. The flavobacteria were Gram-negative rods and failed to produce indole and were non-fermentative. Moreover, they produced a rich array of enzymes such as amylase, lipase, catalase, urease, gelatinase, DNase, and oxidase. Phylogenetic analyses of the strain SKS05-GRD based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed the bacterium as Myroides odoratimimus (nucleotide sequence accession number JQ178355). Antimicrobial susceptibility test for M. odoratimimus SKS05-GRD and other strains were assessed by disc diffusion method. M. odoratimimus SKS05-GRD showed wide resistance to the antibiotics such as amikacin, ampicillin, cefadroxil, cefoperazone, ceftazidine, ceftriaxone, netillin and gentamicin. M. odoratimimus was subjected to plasmid isolation and plasmid curing to seek the relationship between plasmid and antibiotic resistance. Plasmid curing was done by using ethidium bromide and was found to be effective at 300 and 500 mug/ml. Assessment of antibiotic sensitivity of M. odoratimimus SKS05-GRD showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin confirming that resistance to these three antibiotics is plasmid mediated and other antibiotic resistance are chromosomal mediated.
