The purpose of this study was to determine the carriage rate of Escherichia coli isolates in seafood, to analyze the phenotype and genotype of antimicrobial resistance in the recovered isolates, and to characterize extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli producers. E. coli isolates were recovered from 24 (34.3%) of the 70 seafood samples analyzed, and one isolate per sample was further characterized. Antibiotic resistance was determined by the disk diffusion method in the 24 isolates, with the following results (number of resistant isolates): tetracycline (8), streptomycin (7), ampicillin (6), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (4), chloramphenicol (4), ciprofloxacin (3), cefotaxime (2), and ceftazidime (2). Six isolates showed a multiresistant phenotype (including at least three families of antibiotics). Among tetracycline-resistant E. coli isolates, tet(A) was detected in five isolates and tet(B) in two isolates. The qnr(A) or aac(6')-1b-cr genes were detected in two ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates, and the sul2 gene in two trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant isolates. ESBL-containing E. coli isolates, carrying the blaCTX-M-1 gene, were detected in 2 of the 70 seafood samples, obtained from gilt-head bream aquaculture. The ESBL isolates were typed phylogenetically and by multilocus sequence typing, and they were ascribed to lineage ST48/A and to the new ST3497/B1; these isolates carried the fimA, aer, and papGIII virulence genes. One of the ESBL-producing E. coli isolates carried an unusual class 1 integron (with the array dfr32-ereA-aadA1). Seafood could be a source of multiresistant E. coli isolates for the aquatic environment, and these could enter the food chain.
