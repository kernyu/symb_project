OBJECTIVES: Scorpion venoms are a rich source of bioactive peptides with promising clinical value that may lead to the discovery and development of new drugs. The present study was designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activities of the venoms extracted from three medically important Saudi scorpions (Androctonus crassicauda, Androctonus bicolor and Leiurus quinquestriatus). METHODS: Antimicrobial assays were performed using a microplate growth inhibition assay against 10 multidrug-resistant (MDR) micro-organisms (4 Gram-negative bacteria, 2 Gram-positive bacteria and 4 fungi and yeasts) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 20mg/mL of each venom. Following qualitative analysis, dose-response assays were performed for bacterial and fungal killing curves using the MTT colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Among the three tested scorpion venoms, only L. quinquestriatus venom showed significant broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in a dose-dependent manner from 5 to 20mg/mL. Leiurus quinquestriatus venom inhibited the growth and survival of MDR Escherichia coli (55.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (50.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (35.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (36.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (47.6%), Candida albicans (31.2%) and Candida glabrata (39.0%), whereas no significant activity against Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus flavus was observed. In contrast, the venoms of A. crassicauda and A. bicolor did not show noticeable antimicrobial activity against any of the tested organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study demonstrate that L. quinquestriatus venom possesses antimicrobial activity and thus can be used as a template for designing and development of novel antimicrobial drugs.
