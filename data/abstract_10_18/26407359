We described 1035 pediatric hospitalizations with daptomycin use in 794 patients since 2004. Daptomycin use was uncommon but increased over time. A minority of hospitals accounted for the majority of use. This variability of daptomycin use highlights the need for future studies to assess the efficacy and safety of daptomycin in children.
