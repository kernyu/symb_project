We developed "spoligoriftyping," a 53-plex assay based on two preexisting methods, the spoligotyping and "rifoligotyping" assays, by combining them into a single assay. Spoligoriftyping allows simultaneous spoligotyping (i.e., clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat [CRISPR]-based genotyping) and characterization of the main rifampin drug resistance mutations on the rpoB hot spot region in a few hours. This test partly uses the dual-priming-oligonucleotide (DPO) principle, which allows simultaneous efficient amplifications of rpoB and the CRISPR locus in the same sample. We tested this method on a set of 114 previously phenotypically and genotypically characterized multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis or drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis DNA extracted from clinical isolates obtained from patients from Bulgaria, Nigeria, and Germany. We showed that our method is 100% concordant with rpoB sequencing results and 99.95% (3,911/3,913 spoligotype data points) correlated with classical spoligotyping results. The sensitivity and specificity of our assay were 99 and 100%, respectively, compared to those of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. Such assays pave the way to the implementation of locally and specifically adapted methods of performing in a single tube both drug resistance mutation detection and genotyping in a few hours.
