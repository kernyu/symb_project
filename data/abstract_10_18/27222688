INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization has estimated that the global incidence of neonatal deaths was 2,8 million in 2015, of which 47,6% were due to infections. These infections can affect newborns babies ages 0-1 month through 3 months. METHODS: This is a prospective study conducted from 1 March to 30 June 2015 in the Neonatology service of the Laquintinie Hospital at Douala. All symptomatic newborns with or without anamnestic criteria and all asymptomatic newborns, with at least an infectious risk and a positive blood culture or an abnormal blood count or positive C-reactive protein were included in the study. RESULTS: Of the 310 newborns enrolled in the study, 300 were retained for neonatal infection, corresponding to a total incidence of 96.8%. We performed 104 cultures, of which 25 were positive, corresponding to an incidence of confirmed neonatal infection of 24%. The factors associated with infection were unexplained preterm birth < 35 weeks of amenorrhea (45,1%) and neonatal resuscitation (34,8%). Fever (56%) and neurological disorders (48.8%) were the most frequent clinical symptoms. Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequent germs (56%). Imipenem (95%) and amikacin (66.7%) were the most effective antibiotics. Outcome was favorable in 66,4% of cases and the overall mortality rate was 33,6%. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial infection in this Hospital. Bacterial ecology was dominated by Gram-negative bacteria. It was recorded a significant resistance to the most widely used antibiotics and a fairly high mortality.
