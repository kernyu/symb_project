Rahnella aquatilis is an environmental Gram-negative bacillus that is rarely reported as human pathogen, being mainly associated with infections in immunocompromised patients. Herein we describe two cases of R. aquatilis isolates recovered from endotracheal aspirate cultures of different patients in a tertiary hospital located in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and 16S rDNA gene sequencing were performed to confirm bacterial identification after the isolates being erroneously identified as Pantoea spp. by automated system. Both isolates showed the same PFGE pattern and presented the beta-lactamase encoding gene blaRAHN-1, responsible for resistance to cephalothin. The isolates were susceptible to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and polymyxin B. This report shows the presence and transmission of uncommon bacteria in the nosocomial environment and alerts us about the need for new tools of correct microbiologic diagnosis.
