BACKGROUND: Screening of the natural HCV NS3 polymorphism Q80K is required prior to simeprevir administration due to the reduced susceptibility of genotype 1 viruses carrying this amino acid variant. A simple, rapid and robust test for Q80K screening would be advisable in routine diagnostic laboratories. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate a commercial NS3 Q80K real-time PCR kit (Q80K Polymorphism Kit, Clonit srl, Milan, Italy). STUDY DESIGN: Forty-three plasma samples obtained from untreated HCV genotype 1a-infected patients and previously sequenced at a reference laboratory, were sent to two public clinical virology laboratories for blinded Q80K screening with the kit under evaluation. The sample panel included 25 cases with the wild type 80Q, 17 with the mutant 80K and 1 with the mutant 80L. RESULTS: Laboratory 1 identified 22/25 (88.0%) 80Q and 17/17 (100.0%) 80K cases. Laboratory 2 identified 23/25 (92.0%) 80Q and 16/17 (94.2%) 80K cases. All of the unidentified cases were scored as negative, with no mutant/wild type miscalling. The 80L variant was scored as indeterminate by Laboratory 1 and as negative by Laboratory 2. Overall, sensitivity and specificity for detection of 80K were 97.1% (95% C.I., 82.9-99.8%) and 100.0% (90.2-100.0%), respectively. However, the system did not provide any result for 6/84 cases (7.1% failure rate), not including the 80L variant which is not expected to be detected as stated in the kit package insert. Global inter-laboratory concordance was 93.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite good specificity, this Q80K detection system needs improvements in amplification success rate and robustness.
