Escherichia coli mediated urinary tract infection has been reported to be most prevalent among patients of different class, gender and ages. Currently, multidrug resistant E. coli harboring several virulence factors are most perilous threats for patients especially for elders. The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern, co-resistance and phenotypic virulence factors present in uropathogenic E. coli isolated from aged patients. Thirty-nine E. coli isolates were collected during May-June 2014 from patients between 50 to 80 years of age. Experiments have been carried out to determine the antibiotic resistance, co-resistances and phenotypic adherent factors present in each isolate. Clonal relatedness was also determined in the AmpC positive uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC). 97.43% isolates were found to be multidrug resistant and 41.02% of them were AmpC producer. AmpC producer group showed higher multiple antibiotic resistance index than AmpC non-producer (p value < 0.01) group. Interestingly, adherence factor Type 1 fimbriae were found among 84.61% of total isolates which were more prevalent in elderly female patients than males. Biofilm production studies revealed that 84.61% of total isolates are more common in elderly males. This study adds value for the proper empiric selection of antibiotic therapy as well as calls for continuous monitoring of the incidence of drug resistance virulent uropathogenic E. coli mediated urinary tract infection in elderly patients.
