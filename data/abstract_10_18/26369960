Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is ever changing and adapting, as once-novel beta-lactam antibiotics are losing their efficacy, primarily due to the production of beta-lactamases. Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) efficiently inactivate a broad range of beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems, and are often coexpressed with other antibacterial resistance factors. The rapid dissemination of MBLs and lack of novel antibacterials pose an imminent threat to global health. In an effort to better counter these resistance-conferring beta-lactamases, an investigation of their natural evolution and resulting substrate specificity was employed. In this study, we elucidated the effects of different amino acid substitutions at position 67 in IMP-type MBLs on the ability to hydrolyze and confer resistance to a range of beta-lactam antibiotics. Wild-type beta-lactamases IMP-1 and IMP-10 and mutants IMP-1-V67A and IMP-1-V67I were characterized biophysically and biochemically, and MICs for Escherichia coli cells expressing these enzymes were determined. We found that all variants exhibited catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) equal to or higher than that of IMP-1 against all tested beta-lactams except penicillins, against which IMP-1 and IMP-1-V67I showed the highest kcat/Km values. The substrate-specific effects of the different amino acid substitutions at position 67 are discussed in light of their side chain structures and possible interactions with the substrates. Docking calculations were employed to investigate interactions between different side chains and an inhibitor used as a beta-lactam surrogate. The differences in binding affinities determined experimentally and computationally seem to be governed by hydrophobic interactions between residue 67 and the inhibitor and, by inference, the beta-lactam substrates.
