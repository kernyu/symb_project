Artemisinin (ART)-based combination therapies are the most efficacious treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Alarmingly, P. falciparum strains have acquired resistance to ART across much of Southeast Asia. ART creates widespread protein and lipid damage inside intraerythrocytic parasites, necessitating macromolecule degradation. The proteasome is the main engine of Plasmodium protein degradation. Indeed, proteasome inhibition and ART have shown synergy in ART-resistant parasites. Moreover, ubiquitin modification is associated with altered parasite susceptibility to multiple antimalarials. Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), therefore, is an attractive avenue to combat drug resistance. Here, we review recent advances leading to specific targeting of the Plasmodium proteasome. We also highlight the potential for targeting other nonproteasomal protein degradation systems as an additional strategy to disrupt protein homeostasis.
