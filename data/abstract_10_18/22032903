The present study investigated the effect of Eriobotrya japonica extracts at 0%, 0.1%, 1.0%, and 2.0% doses supplementation with feed on non-specific immune response, hematological and biochemical profile, and disease resistance against Vibrio carchariae in kelp grouper Epinephelus bruneus at weeks 1, 2, and 4. The white blood cell (WBC) significantly increased in fish fed with 0.1%, 1.0%, and 2.0% diets on weeks 1 and 2 when compared to the control. However, the glucose always decreased from the control except on week 2 against pathogen. The serum total protein, albumin, and globulin significantly increased at week 2 but they did not changed significantly at weeks 1 and 4. The superoxide anion, lymphokines production index, and phogocytosis did not significantly increased in any diet on the first week whereas it was significantly enhanced in 1.0% and 2.0% supplementation diets on weeks 2 and 4 against V. carchariae when compared to control. All diets significantly enhanced the serum lysozyme activity, bactericidal activity, and haemolytic complement activity from weeks 1-4 as compared to control. The serum agglutinating antibody titre did not significantly enhance on the first week whereas it was significantly enhanced on weeks 2 and 4. Fish fed with 1.0% and 2.0% doses diets was found lower mortality than 0.1% diet. Thus, this study suggested that 1.0% and 2.0% doses supplementation diets could be advocated to enhance the immune response and production disease from V. carchariae in E. bruneus.
