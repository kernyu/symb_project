Global eradication of tuberculosis (TB) depends on identification and treatment of all active TB cases and of the two billion people who are estimated to be latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The past decade has seen a renaissance of scientific activities and funder investment into development of new TB drugs, diagnostics, biomarkers and vaccines. This viewpoint critically summarises the promising portfolio of more accurate TB diagnostics, new TB drugs and vaccines that have been endorsed by the STOP TB Partnership. Increasing numbers of Phase 2 and 3 drug, vaccine and diagnostic clinical trials in high-TB endemic areas reflect substantial progress towards attaining Global STOP-TB Partnership targets. Achievement of STOP-TB Partnership goals will crucially depend on political will and serious investment by funders and developing country governments into improving delivery of better health services and living conditions for their people. Long-term sustainability of any newer tools implemented at point of care is essential.
