BACKGROUND: Post-neurosurgical ventriculitis is mainly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. The rate of linezolid resistant S. epidermidis (LRSE) is increasing worldwide. AIMS: To report clinical and microbiological data from a series of ventriculitis cases caused by LRSE in a Spanish hospital between 2013 and 2016. METHODS: LRSE ventriculitis cases were retrospectively reviewed in a Spanish hospital during a four-year period. Clinical/epidemiological data of the infected patients were reviewed, the isolates involved were typed by PFGE and MLST, and the molecular basis of linezolid resistance was determined. FINDINGS: Five cases of ventriculitis by LRSE were detected. The patients suffered from cerebral haemorrhage or head trauma that required the placement of an external ventricular drain; spent a relatively long time in the ICU (10 to 26 days); and three out of the five had previously been treated with linezolid. All LRSE had the same PFGE-pattern, belonged to ST2, and shared an identical mechanism of linezolid resistance. Specifically, all had the G2576T mutation in the V domain of each of the six copies of the 23S rRNA gene, together with the Q136L and M156T mutations and the 71GGR72 insertion in the L3 and L4 ribosomal protein, respectively. CONCLUSION: The high ratio of linezolid consumption in the ICU (7.72-8.10 DDDs/100 patients-days) could have selected this resistant clone, which has probably become endemic in the ICU, where it could have colonized admitted patients. Infection control and antimicrobial stewardship interventions are essential to prevent the dissemination of this difficult to treat pathogen and to preserve the therapeutic efficacy of linezolid.
