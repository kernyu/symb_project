BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has proven to be one of the most chemo-resistant among all solid organ malignancies. Several mechanisms of resistance have been described, though few reports of strategies to overcome this chemo-resistance have been successful in restoring sensitivity to the primary chemotherapy (gemcitabine) and enter the clinical treatment arena. METHODS: We examined the ability of cellular arginine depletion through treatment with PEG-ADI to alter in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity of gemcitabine. The effect on levels of key regulators of gemcitabine efficacy (e.g. RRM2, hENT1, and dCK) were examined. RESULTS: Combination of PEG-ADI and gemcitabine substantially increases growth arrest, leading to increased tumor response in vivo. PEG-ADI is a strong inhibitor of the gemcitabine-induced overexpression of ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) levels both in vivo and in vitro, which is associated with gemcitabine resistance. This mechanism is through the abrogation of the gemcitabine-mediated inhibitory effect on E2F-1 function, a transcriptional repressor of RRM2. CONCLUSION: The ability to alter gemcitabine resistance in a targeted manner by inducing metabolic stress holds great promise in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.
