BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) disproportionately affects the Asian-American population in the USA. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has demonstrated potent antiviral activity in clinical trials, but data in Asian-Americans from community studies are lacking. METHODS: Adult Asian-American patients with CHB from private medical and community-based practices were prospectively enrolled and treated with open-label TDF 300 mg once daily in a single-arm study for 48 weeks. After Week 48, patients had the option to transition to commercially available CHB therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA <400 copies/mL at Week 48. Secondary endpoints were safety and tolerability, serologic and biochemical responses, liver fibrosis by FibroTest, and the development of drug-resistant mutations. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients enrolled, 53 (58%) were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive at baseline. At Week 48, 74 patients (82% overall; 70% HBeAg-positive and 100% HBeAg-negative) had HBV DNA <400 copies/mL. Six (12%) HBeAg-positive patients achieved HBeAg loss/seroconversion. The percentage of patients with alanine aminotransferase in the normal range increased from 26% at baseline to 66% at Week 48. The percentage of patients with F0 (no or minimal) fibrosis by FibroTest increased from 48% to 51%, and those with F4 (severe) fibrosis decreased from 4% to 1%. No resistance to TDF developed. Treatment was well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild in severity and considered unrelated to study drug. CONCLUSIONS: TDF is effective and well tolerated in Asian-American CHB patients in community clinic-based settings, consistent with larger registration trials. Improvement in liver fibrosis was seen in a proportion of patients. No resistance to TDF developed through 48 weeks of treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrial.gov identifier NCT00736190.
