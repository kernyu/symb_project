BACKGROUND: Successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced mortality among HIV-infected children. However, there is growing concern about long-term effects associated to ART. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities in a cohort of perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and young adults and to identify associated factors. METHODS: We present results from a cross-sectional analysis including individuals 12 to 20 years of age, from a prospective, longitudinal cohort of perinatally-acquired HIV-infected children, adolescents and young adults in Madrid. Clinical and immunological data were recorded and complete lipid and glycemic profiles were determined. RESULTS: Ninety-nine adolescents were included, with a median age of 15.3 years [13.6-16.7]. Patients with abnormal levels of lipids were as follows: 27.2% total cholesterol >/=200 mg/dl, 25.9% LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) >/= 130 mg/dl, 14.1% HDL-C < 35 mg/dl and 39.8% triglycerides >/= 150 mg/dl. Current use of protease inhibitors (PI) was associated with higher triglyceride values (p = 0.022). Four (4.6%) patients showed fasting glucose >/= 100 mg/dl and 30.6% presented with insulin resistance (IR) (HOMA-IR over the 90th centile). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, weight, Tanner stage, protease inhibitors (PI) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) treatment length and CD4 nadir, IR was associated with higher waist circumference Z score; OR: 3.92(CI95%: 1.15-13.4) (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: There was a high prevalence of insulin resistance and lipid abnormalities in this cohort of perinatally-acquired HIV-infected adolescents. A simple clinical measurement like waist circumference Z score might be a reliable marker and predictor of insulin resistance in these patients.
