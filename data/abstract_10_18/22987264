INTRODUCTION: Tigecycline may be a therapeutic alternative for the control of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, although there is no consensus on the cutoffs or susceptibility to the variability of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) according to the culture medium and strips for the antibiogram against this microorganism by quantitative diffusion method. Therefore, the objective was to verify this variability and propose epsilometer test strip that more closely resemble to the standard method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 38 strains of A. baumannii were selected and evaluated their susceptibility to tigecycline with two different commercial strips (E-TEST and Liofilchem). MICs were compared with those obtained by the standard technique of microdilution broth. RESULTS: MICs obtained by the Liofilchem strip were more similar to standard method than those obtained by E-TEST strips. CONCLUSION: In the two studied strips, higher MICs to those obtained by the standard method were observed leading to false-positive tigecicline resistance in many cases. However, the Liofilchem strip showed the results more closely resemble to the standard method.
