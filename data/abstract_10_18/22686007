The antimicrobial activity of 18 antimicrobial agents were measured for the 500 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that had been isolated from various clinical specimens in 17 medical institutions in the Kinki district from April to July of 2008. The antimicrobial activity was excellent in the order of tobramycin (TOB), arbekacin (ABK), doripenem (DRPM), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK). Susceptible rate that was interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) was high in the order of AMK, TOB, tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), DRPM, ABK. Also, the difference in susceptible rate was observed between departments, materials and institutions. Multidrug resistant strains were only 12 (2.4%) but strains that had resistance to 2 agents were 48 (9.6%), therefore, implementation of further surveillance should be continued.
