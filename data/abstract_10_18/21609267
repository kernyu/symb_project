Antimicrobial resistance in hospital and community-onset bacterial infections is a significant source of patient morbidity and mortality. In the past decade, we have witnessed the increasing recovery of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. For many isolates, carbapenem resistance is due to the production of carbapenemases, beta-lactamases that can inactivate carbapenems and frequently other beta-lactam antibiotics. Currently, these enzymes are mainly found in three different beta-lactamase classes (class A, B and D). Regardless of the molecular classification, there are few antimicrobials available to treat infections with these organisms and data regarding agents in development are limited to in vitro studies. This article focuses on the epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. We also review available agents and those in development with potential activity against this evolving threat.
