Acute renal failure is frequent in critically ill patients. In those patients who need renal replacement therapy, continuous techniques are an alternative to intermittent haemodialysis. Critically ill patients often have an infection, which can lead to sepsis and renal failure. An early and adequate antibiotic treatment at correct dosage is extremely important. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a frequent nosocomial pathogen that causes a high rate of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Many antibiotics are easily removed by continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) leading to a high risk of under dosing and therapeutic failure or resistance breakthrough. The objective of this review is to assess the clinical evidence on the pharmacokinetics and dosage recommendations of the main antibiotic groups used in MRSA treatment in patients treated with CRRT.
