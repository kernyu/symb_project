The Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) performs regular period-prevalence studies to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance in selected enteric Gram-negative pathogens. The 2010 survey focussed on community-onset infections, examining isolates from urinary tract infections from patients presenting to outpatient clinics, emergency departments or to community practitioners. Two thousand and ninety-two Escherichia coli, 578 Klebsiella species and 268 Enterobacter species were tested using a commercial automated method (Vitek 2, BioMerieux) and results were analysed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints from January 2012. Of the key resistances, non-susceptibility to the third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was found in 3.2% of E. coli and 3.2%-4.0% of Klebsiella spp. Non-susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were 5.4% for E. coli, 1.0%-2.3% for Klebsiella spp., and 2.5%-6.6% in Enterobacter spp, and resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 2.8%, 3.2%-6.9%, and 16.8%-18.0% for the same 3 groups respectively. Only 3 strains, 2 Klebsiella spp. and 1 Enterobacter spp, were shown to harbour a carbapenemase (IMP-4).
