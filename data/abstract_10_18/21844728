Gonococcal isolates (n = 4336) were collected from men with urethritis at the Fulton County STD Clinic between 1988 and 2006. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed by agar dilution. Increasing numbers of isolates from men who have sex with men and with fluoroquinolone resistance were noted. New antimicrobials effective against gonorrhea are urgently needed.
