Ertapenem plus doripenem or meropenem were given in three patients suffering from pandrug-resistant, KPC-2-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia (2 patients) and urinary tract infection (1 patient), respectively. All responded successfully, without relapse at follow-up. The results obtained should probably be attributed to ertapenem's increased affinity for the carbapenemases hindering doripenem/meropenem degradation in the environment of the microorganism.
