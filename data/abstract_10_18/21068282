Antifungal testing results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2008 to 2009) were analyzed for regional variations of invasive Candida species infections. Among 2,085 cases from the Asian-Pacific (APAC) (51 cases), Latin American (LAM) (348 cases), European (EU) (750 cases), and North American (NAM) (936 cases) regions, Candida albicans predominated (48.4%), followed by C. glabrata (18.0%), C. parapsilosis (17.2%), C. tropicalis (10.5%), and C. krusei (1.9%). Resistance to echinocandins (anidulafungin [2.4%] and micafungin [1.9%]) and azoles (3.5 to 5.6%) was most prevalent among C. glabrata isolates, as determined using recently established CLSI breakpoint criteria. C. glabrata isolates were more common in NAM (23.5%), and C. albicans isolates were more common in APAC (56.9%), with C. parapsilosis (25.6%) and C. tropicalis (17.0%) being more prominent in LAM. Emerging resistance patterns among C. glabrata cases in NAM require focused surveillance.
