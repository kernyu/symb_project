In this paper, we report on a novel strategy for the preparation of silver nanoparticle-doped SiO(2) microspheres (Ag-SMSs) with an interesting strawberry-like morphology using a simple and efficient electrospraying method. SEM (scanning electron microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscopy), XRD (x-ray diffraction), EDS (energy-dispersive spectroscopy) and UV-vis spectra (ultraviolet-visible spectra) were applied to investigate the morphology, structure, composition and optical properties of the hybrid microspheres, and E. coli (Escherichia coli) was used as a model microbe to evaluate their antibacterial ability. The results showed that the Ag-SMSs were environmentally stable and washing resistant. The Ag-SMSs exhibited effective inhibition against proliferation of E. coli, and their antibacterial ability could be well preserved for a long time. The environmental stability, washing resistance, efficient antibacterial ability and simple but productive preparation method endowed the Ag-SMSs with great potential for practical biomedical applications.
