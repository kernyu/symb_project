AIM: Analyze the diversity and prevalence of mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome emerging in response to antiretroviral therapy isolated from HIV-infected individuals of Novosibirsk region in 2010, 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detection of mutations in HIV-1 genome responsible for the resistance to. antiretroviral preparations (ARVP) was carried out by determination of pol gene nucleotide sequence and subsequent analysis ofthe data obtained by program HIVdb: Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm. RESULTS: HIV-1 resistance mutations to antiretroviral preparations were detected in 23.6% of the total number of the studied samples. The most prevalent mutations are those conditioning resistance to nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (M184V, Y181C and K103N). In studies of HIV-1 isolated from 4 patients who had not received antiretroviral therapy (ARVT) transmission of HIV-1 resistant to various groups of preparations was detected. CONCLUSION: The detected facts of ARVP resistant HIV-1 circulation among patients who had not received ARVT and the data obtained on the mutations emerging in response to therapy underline the relevance of administration of HIV-1 resistance profile study during both decrease of ARVT effectiveness and primary administration of therapy to HIV infected patients.
