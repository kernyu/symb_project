BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic respiratory pathogen, often causes pulmonary infection in patients with chronic inflammatory airway diseases and forms drug-resistant biofilm. Elafin, a natural antibiotic, has antimicrobial properties against Gram-negative bacteria. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effects of elafin on the resistance of epithelial cells against P.aeruginosa biofilm. METHODS: A549 epithelial cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-elafin or pEGFP-N1 were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), P.aeruginosa supernatant and Escherichia coli supernatant followed by co-incubation for 24 h to form P.aeruginosa biofilms. RESULTS: We found structural changes in the biofilms of all groups, especially the P.aeruginosa group. Bacterial counts in the TNF (3.238 +/- 0.356 x 10(6) CFU/cm(2)) and P.aeruginosa (3.317 +/- 0.247 x 10(6) CFU/cm(2)) groups were lower than in the control group (5.946 +/- 0.453 x 10(6) CFU/cm(2); p < 0.01). In the P.aeruginosa group, the bacterial count was lower than that of the E. coli group (5.138 +/- 0.391x 10(6) CFU/cm(2); p < 0.05). Bacterial clearance rates were higher in P.aeruginosa (44.2%) and TNF groups (45.6%) than in the E. coli group (13.6%). Cell intactness rates in pEGFP-N1-elafin-transfected groups were consistently higher than those of the control group (p < 0.01); the P.aeruginosa group rate at 24 h was the highest. Compared to the control group, the TNF, P.aeruginosa and E. coli groups showed increased elafin mRNA and protein in cells (p < 0.05), and contents in the TNF and P.aeruginosa group were higher than in the E. coli group (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Overexpression of elafin in epithelial cells attenuated the damage of P.aeruginosa biofilm on epithelia. P.aeruginosa has the potential to induce elafin expression.
