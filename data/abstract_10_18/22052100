BACKGROUND: This prospective study aimed at determining etiologic agents causing nosocomial pneumonia in a precisely defined group of patients and resistance of bacterial pathogens to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised patients hospitalized at the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University and University Hospital Olomouc who developed pneumonia. From those patients, secretion samples were collected for microbiological analysis. RESULTS: A total of 77 secretion samples from 51 patients were analyzed. Of 90 isolates, 71 were classified as etiologic agents, with the most frequently isolated strains being those of Klebsiella pneumoniae (32 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 %), Burkholderia cepacia complex (10 %) and Escherichia coli (8 %). The highest proportions of multiresistant strains were found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (56 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (52 %), Escherichia coli (25 %) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (100 %). Pairs of identical strains were detected in five cases (3x Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2x Pseudomonas aeruginosa). In Burkholderia cepacia complex, the same strain was identified in four out of five cases. Eighteen patients died during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Most isolates were single strains and hospital-acquired pneumonia may be characterized as endogenous. Four identical cultures of Burkholderia cepacia complex were classified as Burkholderia multivorans by the MALDI-TOF system and clonal spread of this strain may be assumed.
