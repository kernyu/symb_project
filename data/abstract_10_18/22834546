Red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) are a significant part of the culture, diet and income for many people in central and southern Spain. Due to declining populations in the wild, intensive farming is common and 4 million juvenile partridges are released each autumn. Intensive management and high densities result in high prevalence of enteric disease and the use of antimicrobials as preventive measures on partridge farms and prior to restocking in the wild. We determined the occurrence of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), and screened phenotypic resistance of E. coli against enrofloxacin, gentamicin and cefotaxim in farmed, restocked and wild partridges. Prevalence of APEC in farmed and restocked red-legged partridges was significantly higher than in natural populations. Phenotypic resistance against both gentamicin and enrofloxacin was significantly more frequent in farmed (75%) and restocked (43%) partridges than in wild partridges, while most E. coli isolated from natural populations were susceptible to all three antimicrobials tested (65%). This indicates that farmed and restocked partridges carry APEC that could be a reason for disease outbreaks on farms, and that E. coli carried by farmed and restocked partridges can acquire resistance to frequently used antimicrobials, thus being a concern for the environment, wild birds and consumers. Management in farms and restocking procedures may create a hazard not only for spreading APEC, but also as a potential source of resistant E. coli in the environment.
