PURPOSE: Aim of this study was to show the emergence of the qnr genes among fluoroquinolone-resistant, AMPC and ESBL (extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase) co-producing Morganella morganii isolate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi resistant Morganella morganii SM12012 isolate was recovered from pus from a patient hospitalized in the intensive care unit at the Military hospital, Tunisia. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested with the agar disk diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. ESBLs were detected using a standard double-disk synergy test. The characterization of beta-lactamases and associated resistance genes were performed by isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: The antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed the high resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins (MICs: 64-512 mug/ml) and fluoroquinolones (MICs: 32-512 mug/ml). But M. morganii SM12012 isolate remained susceptible to carbapenems (MICs: 4-<0.25 mug/ml). The double-disk synergy test confirmed the phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Three identical beta-lactamases with pI values of 6.5, 7.8 and superior to 8.6 were detected after isoelectric focusing analysis. These beta-lactamases genes can be successfully transferred by the conjugative plasmid. Molecular analysis demonstrated the co-production of bla (DHA-1), bla (CTX-M-15) and qnrS1 genes on the same plasmid. The detection of an associated chromosomal quinolone resistance revealed the presence of a parC mutation at codon 80 (Ser80-lle80). CONCLUSION: This is the first report in Tunisia of nosocomial infection due to the production of CTX-M-15 and DHA-1 beta-lactamases in M. morganii isolate with the association of quinolone plasmid resistance. The incidence of these strains invites continuous monitoring of such multidrug-resistant strains and the further study of their epidemiologic evolution.
