Tropical theileriosis is a disease caused by infection with an apicomplexan parasite, Theileria annulata, and giving rise to huge economic losses. In recent years, parasite resistance has been reported against the most effective antitheilerial drug used for the treatment of this disease. This emphasizes the need for alternative methods of treatment. Enolase is a key glycolytic enzyme and can be selected as a macromolecular target of therapy of tropical theileriosis. In this study, an intron sequence present in T. annulata enolase gene was removed by PCR-directed mutagenesis, and the gene was first cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and then subcloned into pLATE31 vector, and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. The enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose column. Steady-state kinetic parameters of the enzyme were determined using GraFit 3.0. High quantities (~65 mg/l of culture) of pure recombinant T. annulata enolase have been obtained in a higly purified form (>95 %). Homodimer form of purified protein was determined from the molecular weights obtained from a single band on SDS-PAGE (48 kDa) and from size exclusion chromatography (93 kDa). Enzyme kinetic measurements using 2-PGA as substrate gave a specific activity of ~40 U/mg, K m: 106 muM, kcat: 37 s(-1), and k cat/K m: 3.5 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1). These values have been determined for the first time from this parasite enzyme, and availability of large quantities of enolase enzyme will facilitate further kinetic and structural characterization toward design of new antitheilerial drugs.
