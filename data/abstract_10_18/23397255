Preventing the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance depends on appropriate antibiotic stewardship and accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). We report the international dissemination of Escherichia coli strains, showing discrepancies between reference methods when phenotypically tested for susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP). We demonstrate that these related strains are predisposed to problematic TZP AST interpretations.
