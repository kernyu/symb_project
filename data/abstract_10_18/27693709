Given the impact of biofilms in health care environment and the increasing antibiotic resistance and/or tolerance, new strategies for preventing that occurrence in medical devices are obligatory. Thus, biomaterials surface functionalization with active compounds can be a valuable approach. In the present study the ability of the biosurfactants sophorolipids to prevent biofilms formation on silicone rubber aimed for medical catheters was investigated. Sophorolipids produced by Starmerella bombicola, identified by HPLC-MS/MS were used to cover silicone and surface characterization was evaluated through contact angle measurements and FTIR-ATR. Results revealed that sophorolipids presence on silicone surface decreased the hydrophobicity of the material and biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Antibiofilm activity was evaluated through different methods and was more pronounced against S. aureus. Furthermore, biocompatibility of silicone specimens with HaCaT cells was also obtained. From this study it was possible to conclude that sophorolipids seem to be a favourable approach for coating silicone catheters. Such compounds may represent a novel source of antibiofilm agents for technological development passing through strategies of permanent functionalization of surfaces.
