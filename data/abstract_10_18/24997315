OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance of Helicobacter pylori endangers the successful eradication of the bacteria. The aim of this prospective surveillance study (ResiNet) is to continuously keep antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori in Germany under surveillance and to identify risk factors for its development. METHODS: From July 2001 until December 2012, we tested the antimicrobial susceptibility of H. pylori strains isolated from 1651 prospectively enrolled patients. We analysed clinical and epidemiological data and identified risk factors for the development of resistance. RESULTS: Average primary resistances were 29.4% for metronidazole, 6.7% for clarithromycin and 3.1% for both antimicrobials. Prior unsuccessful eradication treatments, female sex and country or continent of origin were identified as independent risk factors for development of resistance. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori-positive patients without prior eradication therapy can be treated empirically; antimicrobial susceptibility testing is recommended in previously unsuccessfully treated patients and in patients who have received antimicrobial chemotherapies due to unrelated bacterial infections.
