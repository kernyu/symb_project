A novel mcr colistin resistance gene was identified in a strain of Salmonella enterica, monophasic variant of serovar Typhimurium (4,5,12:i:-), isolated from a pig at slaughter in Italy in 2013, and in Escherichia coli strains collected during routine diagnostic of post-weaning diarrhoea in pigs from Spain and Belgium in 2015 and 2016. Immediate implementation of mcr-screening including this novel gene variant is required for Salmonella and E. coli from humans and food-producing animals in Europe.
