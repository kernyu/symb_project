Antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori is the major cause of eradication failure. Primary H. pylori susceptibility patterns, however, are becoming less predictable. Currently, high (> or =20%) clarithromycin resistance rates have been observed in the USA and in developed countries in Europe and Asia, while the highest (> or =80%) metronidazole-resistance rates have been reported in Africa, Asia and South America. Primary quinolone-resistance rates of 10% or more have already been reported in developed countries in Europe and Asia. Primary amoxicillin resistance has been low (0 to <2%) in Europe but higher (6-59%) in Africa, Asia and South America. Similarly, tetracycline resistance has been absent or low (<5%) in most countries and higher (9-27%) in Asia and South America. The increasing clarithromycin and quinolone resistance, and multidrug resistance detected in 0 to less than 5% in Europe and more often (14.2%) in Brazil are worrying. Growing resistance often parallels national antibiotic consumption and may vary within patient groups according to the geographic region, patient's age and sex, type of disease, birthplace, other infections and other factors. The geographic map and evolution of primary H. pylori resistance are clinically important, should be considered when choosing eradication regimens, and should be monitored constantly at national and global levels in an attempt to reach the recently recommended goal of eradication of more than 95%.
