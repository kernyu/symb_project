The ring-stage susceptibility assay was modified to quantify the susceptibilities of multiple strains of control and delayed-clearance phenotype (DCP) Plasmodium falciparum strains to seven endoperoxide antimalarial drugs. The susceptibility of all of the DCP lines to six of the drugs was lower than that of the controls. In contrast, DCP parasites did not show reduced susceptibility to the synthetic endoperoxide drug OZ439. These data show that it is possible to circumvent emerging artemisinin resistance with a modified endoperoxide drug.
