INTRODUCTION: The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains has become a worldwide health care problem, making treatment of tuberculosis difficult. The aim of this study was to determine phenotypic resistance and gene mutations associated with MDR of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Guadalajara, Mexico. METHODS: One hundred and five isolates were subjected to drug susceptibility testing to first line drugs using the proportion and Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) methods. Genes associated with isoniazid (inhA, katG, ahpC) and rifampicin (rpoB) resistance were analyzed by either pyrosequencing or PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Resistance to any drug was detected in 48.6% of isolates, of which 40% were isoniazid-resistant, 20% were rifampicin-resistant and 19% were MDR. Drug-resistant isolates had the following frequency of mutations in rpoB (48%), katG (14%), inhA (26%), ahpC (26%). Susceptible isolates also had a mutation in ahpC (29%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis of mutations associated with MDR of M. tuberculosis in Guadalajara. Commonly reported mutations worldwide were found in rpoB, katG and inhA genes. Substitution C to T in position -15 of the ahpC gene may possibly be a polymorphism.
