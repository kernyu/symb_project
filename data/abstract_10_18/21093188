INTRODUCTION: Typhoid fever is a food- and water-borne disease, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Typhoid is also a public health problem in Algeria. Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance must be applied to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the incidence of S. enterica serovar Typhi isolated from blood cultures in the Ain M'lila public hospital (Algeria), between 2005 and 2008. Blood cultures were performed in the febrile stage of infection and positive samples were identified by biochemical and antigenic tests. Susceptibility to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid was tested by antibiogram. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-eight strains were isolated from blood cultures between 2005 and 2008. They were all susceptible to the antibiotics tested. DISCUSSION: Typhoid fever incidence has decreased in Algeria. In our region, it comes by outbreaks during the summer season, with no sporadic cases between the peaks. In our study, S. enterica serovar Typhi was still susceptible to antimicrobials despite the worldwide emergence of multidrug resistant strains. CONCLUSION: A regular surveillance of Salmonella typhi antibiotic susceptibility is mandatory.
