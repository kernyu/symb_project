Antitumor immunity is augmented by cytotoxic lymphodepletion therapies. Adoptively transferred naive and effector T cells proliferate extensively and show enhanced antitumor effects in lymphopenic recipients. Although the impact of lymphodepletion on transferred donor T cells has been well evaluated, its influence on recipient T cells is largely unknown. The current study demonstrates that both regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector CD8(+) T cells from lymphopenic recipients play critical roles in the development of antitumor immunity after lymphodepletion. Cyclophosphamide (CPA) treatment depleted lymphocytes more efficiently than other cytotoxic agents; however, the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs was significantly increased in CPA-treated lymphopenic mice. Depletion of these chemoresistant Tregs following CPA treatment and transfer of naive CD4(+) T cells augmented the antitumor immunity and significantly suppressed tumor progression. Further analyses revealed that recipient CD8(+) T cells were responsible for this augmentation. Using Rag2(-/-) mice or depletion of recipient CD8(+) T cells after CPA treatment abrogated the augmentation of antitumor effects in CPA-treated reconstituted mice. The transfer of donor CD4(+) T cells enhanced the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells and the priming of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells originating from the lymphopenic recipients. These results highlight the importance of the recipient cells surviving cytotoxic regimens in cancer immunotherapies.
