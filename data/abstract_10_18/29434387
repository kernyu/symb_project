Background: Antimicrobials are among the most frequently prescribed medications for pediatric patients. However, inappropriate use of them can increase morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs, and largely antimicrobial resistance. This study aims to assess the antimicrobial utilization pattern in the pediatric ward of Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital. Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the antimicrobial utilization. In this study, 403 pediatric medical records selected by systematic random sampling were reviewed. Data were collected using structured data abstraction format. Results: Ceftriaxone (n = 176, 26.5%), gentamicin (n = 125, 18.82%), and ampicillin (n = 119, 17.9%) were the most frequently prescribed antimicrobials, whereas ampicillin and gentamicin combination took the largest percentage share (n = 91, 43.3%). The most common reasons for which antimicrobials prescribed were severe pneumonia (n = 93, 18.82%), severe acute malnutrition (n = 69, 13.97%), and meningitis (n = 67, 13.56%). On average, the highest number of antimicrobials per card was observed in neonates. The percentage of antimicrobials administered by parenteral route was found to be 84.33%. Less than half of antimicrobials (46.98%) were prescribed with dosage form. Besides, strength and duration were recorded in 20.03% and 4.21% of antimicrobial agents, respectively. Conclusion: Generally, there was an overuse of injectables despite the fact that oral formulations are safer alternatives. This result is too far from World Health Organization (WHO) standard (13.4%-21.1%). The degree of polypharmacy of antimicrobials falls within the WHO cutoff point (<2). There are no antibiogram tests conducted in the hospital. By and large, this study provides an impetus towards the establishment of antimicrobial stewardship programs.
