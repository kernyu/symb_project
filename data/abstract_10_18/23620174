CaIPF19998, a functionally unknown gene in Candida albicans, was identified by its homology to Saccharomyces cerevisiae AIF1 gene, which is involved in cell apoptosis. In this study, ipf19998 null mutant was generated with the URA-blaster method and the construction of overexpression of CaIPF19998 was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Minimal inhibitory concentrations determination showed that the ipf19998 overexpressed strains was more resistant to the antifungals tested than the wildtype (strain CAI4). The 2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfo-phenyl)-2Htetrazolium-5-carboxanilide reduction assay showed that CaIPF19998 could enhance the capacity of C. albicans biofilms formation. On Candida biofilms mode, intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species were significantly decreased and real-time RT-PCR showed that some important redox-related genes, including ALD5, CIT1, PIL1, AHP1, TRX1 and TSA1, were up-regulated in the CaIPF19998 overexpressed strains. These results demonstrate that CaIPF19998 played an important role in C. albicans biofilms formation and intracellular redox homeostasis, therefore led to a close relationship between CaIPF19998 and drug susceptibility in C. albicans.
