Vancomycin is used in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. It is also used in the treatment ofenterococci, although this use has been limited due to resistance. The authors report the clinical and pathological presentations of 5 different vancomycin hypersensitivity reactions, including morbilliform eruption, erythroderma, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. With the increased prevalence of beta-lactam-resistant bacteria, reliance on vancomycin continues to increase; thus, the recognition of reactions to this drug will be helpful in caring for patients who require this medication in the future.
