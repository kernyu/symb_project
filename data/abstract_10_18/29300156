PURPOSE: Glycopeptides are widely used for the treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Although difficult to detect, isolates with reduced (GISA), hetero (hGISA) or complete (GRSA) resistance to glycopeptides are increasingly reported. Optimal therapy for such strains is unknown. We compared the in vitro and in vivo activity of tedizolid (TED), a recently licensed oxazolidonone, with vancomycin (VAN) and teicoplanin (TEIC) combined with fusidic acid (FD) or rifampicin (RIF) against S. aureus (SA) with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. METHODS: Susceptibility was determined for six (GISA, hGISA and GRSA) reference strains and 72 clinical MRSA isolates screened for hGISA/GISA-like phenotypes. Synergy and bactericidal activity were assessed using chequerboard and time-kill assays. The G. mellonella wax moth caterpillar model was used to measure the activity of TED and the combinations in vivo. RESULTS: Glycopeptide MICs (VAN/TEIC) ranged from 0.5-8/4 and 0.125-1 for TED. No significant synergy was noted when VAN/TEIC were combined with either RIF or FD. Time-kill assays confirmed that TED was bacteriostatic but superior to VAN and TEIC against GISA strains. In G. mellonella TED was more effective than TEIC monotherapy versus GISA strains. The combination of TEIC with RIF was the most effective combination overall, both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: TED had good in vitro activity versus MRSA including those with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. Although bacteriostatic, it was effective in the G. mellonella model and superior to TEIC in the treatment of GISA. Although this supports the use of TED for MRSA and GISA, the TEIC/RIF combination also warrants further study.
