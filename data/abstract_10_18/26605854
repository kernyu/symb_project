Viridicatumtoxins, which belong to a rare class of fungal tetracycline-like mycotoxins, were subjected to comprehensive spectroscopic and chemical analysis, leading to reassignment/assignment of absolute configurations and characterization of a remarkably acid-stable antibiotic scaffold. Structure activity relationship studies revealed exceptional growth inhibitory activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (IC50 40 nM), >270-fold more potent than the commercial antibiotic oxytetracycline.
