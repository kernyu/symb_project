Sulfiredoxin (Srx) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of cysteine sulfinic acid of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Having high affinity toward H2O2, 2-Cys Prxs can efficiently reduce H2O2 at low concentration. We previously showed that Prx I is hyperoxidized at a rate of 0.072% per turnover even in the presence of low steady-state levels of H2O2. Here we examine the novel role of Srx in cells exposed to low steady-state levels of H2O2, which can be achieved by using glucose oxidase. Exposure of low steady-state levels of H2O2 (10-20 mum) to A549 or wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells does not lead to any significant change in oxidative injury because of the maintenance of balance between H2O2 production and elimination. In contrast, loss-of-function studies using Srx-depleted A549 and Srx-/- MEF cells demonstrate a dramatic increase in extra- and intracellular H2O2, sulfinic 2-Cys Prxs, and apoptosis. Concomitant with hyperoxidation of mitochondrial Prx III, Srx-depleted cells show an activation of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways including mitochondria membrane potential collapse, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. Furthermore, adenoviral re-expression of Srx in Srx-depleted A549 or Srx-/- MEF cells promotes the reactivation of sulfinic 2-Cys Prxs and results in cellular resistance to apoptosis, with enhanced removal of H2O2. These results indicate that Srx functions as a novel component to maintain the balance between H2O2 production and elimination and then protects cells from apoptosis even in the presence of low steady-state levels of H2O2.
