OBJECTIVES: Several direct-acting agents against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease and NS5b polymerase have been developed in recent years to improve treatment of this viral infection. Of these, simeprevir is currently recommended for HCV genotype 1 and 4 infections, but genotypic assessment for the presence of 80K is required prior to simeprevir administration due to the reduced susceptibility of genotype 1 viruses carrying that polymorphism. Because the prevalence of 80K at baseline in genotype 1 viruses varies between reports, we wanted to assess its worldwide prevalence. METHODS: Over 3000 HCV genotype 1 sequences reported from drug-naive subjects distributed around the world were retrieved from the HCV Los Alamos and GenBank databases. These were categorized into subtypes and geographical provenance (continent and country), and the presence of the 80K and 80R polymorphisms was visually inspected and counted. RESULTS: Disparate prevalence of 80K was observed depending on the country/continent analysed. While in resource-rich areas (USA, Western Europe and Australia) a high prevalence of 80K was seen in HCV subtype 1a, in emerging countries, such as Brazil, this prevalence was very low (<1%). HCV subtype 1b sequences from France also displayed a significant occurrence of 80K (6.1%). 80R, on the other hand, was negligible worldwide. CONCLUSIONS: The genotypic assessment of 80K in HCV subtype 1a prior to simeprevir administration in emerging countries with significant numbers of HCV infection is questionable, while it should be performed for subtype 1b in certain developed countries.
