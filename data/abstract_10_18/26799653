Despite effective preventive primary prevention with vaccination, many people remain infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and suffer from its complications. Effective treatments such as interferon-based regimens and oral nucleoside/nucleotides have been developed over the last 30 years, but they are not perfect. Each of the treatments has its own merits, but none can eradicate HBV from the host. As a result, regular monitoring of the response during treatment and after treatment is required. The choice and monitoring of selected treatments, new potential therapeutic agents, and treatment options for drug resistance are discussed in this review.
