Clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of two regimes of dosages of ceftazidime and amikacine in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups. 1A group--19 patients recieving antibacterial treatment for VAP where we used combination of ceftazidime 2 g i.v. 3 times a day and amikacine 500 mg i.v. 2 times a day. 1B group--21 patients who have had a combination therapy of ceftazidime and amikacine in changed regimes of dosages. The loaded dose of ceftazidime bolus was 2 g i.v., then permanent infusion 3g per day. The dose of amikacine was 15 mg/kg per day once a day. The use of cephalosporins of the III-d generation and aminoglycosides in the high dosage is one of the possible safe forms to increase the effectiveness of antibacterial therapy in the treatment of nosocominal infection in the condition of polyresistent flora.
