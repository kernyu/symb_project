The study presents the echinocandin susceptibility profile of a multi-centre collection of pathogenic yeast isolates from Romanian tertiary hospitals. The 562 isolates were identified using ID32C strips, MALDI-TOF MS and DNA sequencing. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of caspofungin (CAS), micafungin (MCA), and anidulafungin (ANI) were assessed and interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. Minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFC) were determined by plating content from the clear MIC wells. The activity was considered fungicidal at MFC/MIC </= 4. The three echinocandins had strongly correlated MICs and high percentages of MIC essential agreement. Most often, MCA had the lowest MICs, followed by CAS and ANI. Against C. parapsilosis and C. kefyr, CAS had the lowest MIC values. The MIC50 values were between 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, except C. parapsilosis. The MIC90 values were usually one dilution higher. MFCs and MICs were weakly correlated. ANI and MCA had the lowest MFC values. The MFC50 values were between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/l, except C. parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii, and C. dubliniensis. The MFC90 values were usually two dilutions higher. Based on EUCAST breakpoints, 47 isolates (8.4%) were resistant to at least one echinocandin, most often ANI. Most resistant isolates were of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei. There were 17 isolates (3%) resistant to echinocandins and fluconazole and most belonged to the same three species. MCA and ANI had the highest rates of fungicidal activity. The high rates of echinocandin resistance and significant multidrug resistance make prophylaxis and empiric therapy difficult.
