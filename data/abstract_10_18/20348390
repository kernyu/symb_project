A new gene-tagging method (marker fusion tagging [MFT]) is demonstrated for Neurospora crassa and Magnaporthe oryzae. Translational fusions between the hygromycin B resistance gene and various markers are inserted into genes of interest by homologous recombination to produce chromosomally encoded fusion proteins. This method can produce tags at any position and create deletion alleles that maintain N- and C-terminal sequences. We show the utility of MFT by producing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tags in proteins localized to nuclei, spindle pole bodies, septal pore plugs, Woronin bodies, developing septa, and the endoplasmic reticulum.
