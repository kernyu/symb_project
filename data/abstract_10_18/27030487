We studied the performance of a new line probe assay for identifying the subspecies and determining the macrolide and aminoglycoside resistance levels of 50 Mycobacterium abscessus isolates. Agreement of GenoType NTM-DR results with sequencing and phenotypic resistance results was 92% for subspecies identification and 98% for determining molecular and phenotypic resistance.
