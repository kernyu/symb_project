PURPOSE: To investigate whether moxifloxacin therapy of bacterial conjunctivitis in children changes the moxifloxacin susceptibility of bacterial isolates in eyes, cheeks below eyes, nares, and throat. METHODS: Patients (age: 1 to 12 years, n = 105) with bacterial conjunctivitis were treated topically with moxifloxacin three times a day for 7 days. Gender- and age-matched subjects with normal eyes (age: 1 to 12 years, n = 57) served as the control group. Microbiological specimens were collected on days 1 (prior to therapy), 8 (1 day after end of therapy), and 42 (follow-up). Specimens were processed to recover total bacteria and bacteria that grew on fluoroquinolone-selective media. Bacteria were identified to the species level and susceptibility to moxifloxacin and selected other antibiotics determined. RESULTS: The primary pathogens recovered from the infected eyes on day 1 before therapy were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. None of the pre-therapy isolates of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were resistant to moxifloxacin. Isolates of these two pathogenic species were also recovered primarily from the nose and eyes. Moxifloxacin-resistant S. aureus isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration 1.0 mug/mL or greater) were recovered from the nose and throat prior to topical dosing on day 1. However, there was no change in the frequency of moxifloxacin-resistant isolates of S. aureus following treatment with moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Treatment of conjunctivitis with topical ophthalmic moxifloxacin did not select for moxifloxacin resistance in H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, or S. aureus in the eye or distal body sites.
