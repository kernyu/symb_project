Progressive macular hypomelanosis of the trunk is a disease of unknown origin that often goes unrecognized in the clinical setting. We present an adolescent with this condition initially diagnosed as tinea versicolor. She was asymptomatic, with hypopigmented macules located on the trunk and with no previous history of inflammation, infection or injury. Progressive macular hypomelanosis is a common disorder that has frequently been misdiagnosed, probably because it is often considered a post-inflammatory hypopigmentation or pityriasis versicolor.
