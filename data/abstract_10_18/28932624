Horizontal gene transfer plays a significant role in spreading antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes throughout the genus Staphylococcus, which includes species of clinical relevance to humans and animals. While phages and plasmids are the most well-studied agents of horizontal gene transfer in staphylococci, the contribution of integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) has been mostly overlooked. Experimental work demonstrating the activity of ICEs in staphylococci remained frozen for years after initial work in the 1980s that showed Tn916 was capable of transfer from Enterococcus to Staphylococcus. However, recent work has begun to thaw this field. To date, 2 families of ICEs have been identified among staphylococci - Tn916 that includes the Tn5801 subfamily, and ICE6013 that includes at least 7 subfamilies. Both Tn5801 and ICE6013 commonly occur in clinical strains of S. aureus. Tn5801 is the most studied of the Tn916 family elements in staphylococci and encodes tetracycline resistance and a protein that, when expressed in Escherichia coli, inhibits restriction barriers to incoming DNA. ICE6013 is among the shortest known ICEs, but it still includes many uncharacterized open reading frames. This element uses an IS30-like transposase as its recombinase, providing some versatility in integration sites. ICE6013 also conjugatively transfers among receptive S. aureus strains at relatively higher frequency than Tn5801. Continued study of these mobile genetic elements may reveal the full extent to which ICEs impact horizontal gene transfer and the evolution of staphylococci.
