Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) due to Pseudomonas oryzihabitans are very rare. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of this infection. We performed a retrospective review of six cases that occurred in our area over a period of 6 years, and six cases previously reported in the literature. Predisposing factors were recognized in 76.9% of patients, including previous surgery, immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, trauma, bites and lactation. The source of infection was probably environmental in most cases. Our study shows that P. oryzihabitans should be considered a potential pathogen, especially in patients with surgical site infections, mastitis and wound infections after bites or trauma. Clinical outcome is usually favourable and treatment is not difficult due to the low level of resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
