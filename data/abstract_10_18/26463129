Two novel compounds, pyridopyrimidines (1) and naphthyridines (2) were identified as potent inhibitors of bacterial NAD(+)-dependent DNA ligase (Lig) A in a fragment screening. SAR was guided by molecular modeling and X-ray crystallography. It was observed that the diaminonitrile pharmacophore made a key interaction with the ligase enzyme, specifically residues Glu114, Lys291, and Leu117. Synthetic challenges limited opportunities for diversification of the naphthyridine core, therefore most of the SAR was focused on a pyridopyrimidine scaffold. The initial diversification at R(1) improved both enzyme and cell potency. Further SAR developed at the R(2) position using the Negishi cross-coupling reaction provided several compounds, among these compounds 22g showed good enzyme potency and cellular potency.
