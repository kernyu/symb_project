Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a common complication that continues to have a poor cure rate in some patients with intravenous therapy alone. Aerosolized antibiotics are theoretically attractive in an attempt to optimize lung concentrations of antibiotics. Limited data suggest that aerosolized aminoglycosides or colistin in addition to intravenous therapy results in good response rates in patients with multidrug-resistant organisms or nonresponding pneumonia. Adverse events can occur, especially with colistin. When used, care should be taken to properly compound and administer aerosolized antibiotics to ensure tolerability and good drug delivery.
