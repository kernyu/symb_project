Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies examine the relationships of drug pharmacokinetic properties, in vitro drug potency, and treatment efficacy. Study results are integral to the design of optimal dosing strategies, prevention of toxicity, development and interpretation of susceptibility break points, and prevention and recognition of drug resistance. These principles are increasingly utilized to optimize therapy for pulmonary fungal pathogens such as ASPERGILLUS species, although they have been underutilized for other difficult-to-treat fungal pathogens. Understanding the design and implementation of PK/PD studies facilitates more effective utilization of the available antifungal agents to improve outcomes for many of these life-threatening infections.
