Clinical specimens from dogs, cats, and horses were examined for the presence of obligate anaerobic bacteria. Of 4,018 specimens cultured, 368 yielded 606 isolates of obligate anaerobic bacteria (248 from dogs, 50 from cats, and 308 from horses). There were 100 specimens from 94 animals from which only anaerobes were isolated (25 dogs, 8 cats, and 61 horses). The most common sites tested were abdominal fluid (dogs and cats) and intestinal contents (horses). The most common microorganism isolated from dogs, cats, and horses was Clostridium perfringens (75, 13, and101 isolates, respectively). The MICs of amoxicillin with clavulanate, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and penicillin were determined using a gradient endpoint method for anaerobes. Isolates collected at necropsy were not tested for antimicrobial susceptibility unless so requested by the clinician. There were 1/145 isolates tested that were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate (resistance breakpoint >/= 16/8 mug/ml), 7/77 isolates tested were resistant to ampicillin (resistance breakpoint >/= 2 mug/ml), 4/242 isolates tested were resistant to chloramphenicol (resistance breakpoint >/= 32 mug/ml), 12/158 isolates tested were resistant to clindamycin (resistance breakpoint >/= 8 mug/ml), 10/247 isolates tested were resistant to metronidazole (resistance breakpoint >/= 32 mug/ml), and 54/243 isolates tested were resistant to penicillin (resistance breakpoint >/= 2 mug/ml). These data suggest that anaerobes are generally susceptible to antimicrobial drugs in vitro.
