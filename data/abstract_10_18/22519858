The possible zoonotic spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is controversial. This review discusses global molecular epidemiological data combining both analyses of the chromosomal background, using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and analyses of plasmid (episomal) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC genes in Escherichia coli present in humans and animals. For consideration of major epidemiological differences, animals were separated into livestock and companion animals. MLST revealed the existence of ESBL-producing isolates thoughout the E. coli population, with no obvious association with any ancestral EcoR group. A similar distribution of major ESBL/AmpC types was apparent only in human isolates, regardless of their geographical origin from Europe, Asia, or the Americas, whereas in animals this varied extensively between animal groups and across different geographical areas. In contrast to the diversity of episomal ESBL/AmpC types, isolates from human and animals mainly shared identical sequence types (STs), suggesting transmission or parallel micro-evolution. In conclusion, the opinion that animal ESBL-producing E. coli is a major source of human infections is oversimplified, and neglects a highly complex scenario.
