Anemia and/or thrombocytopenia are the most relevant adverse effects of linezolid treatment. We report the case of a patient under hemodialysis who developed osteomyelitis involving the amputation stump of the left limb due to a vancomycin-resistant and teicoplanin-resistant Enterococcus faecium successfully treated with linezolid for 6 months. Close monitorization of the patient probably contributed to maintenance of treatment with linezolid despite hematological alterations observed, which could be attributed to either the underlying patient's clinical condition or antimicrobial treatment.
