OBJECTIVES: Urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence and antimicrobial resistance remain a common problem in kidney transplant recipients. Whilst the use of annual institutional antibiograms may help guide appropriate empirical antibiotic selection, these non-disease specific antibiograms do not always account for patient-specific risk factors or disease-specific resistance patterns. This study determined the frequency of UTI recurrence during the first year after kidney transplantation as well as differences in antimicrobial susceptibility between an institutional antibiogram and the disease-specific antibiogram for patients following kidney transplantation. METHODS: In this study, adult patients with at least one UTI during an inpatient admission within 1 year post kidney transplantation were evaluated. A disease-specific antibiogram for UTIs in kidney transplant recipients was prepared based on culture results and was compared with the annual institutional antibiograms. RESULTS: Of 299 kidney transplants performed during the study period, 66 subjects meet the study inclusion criteria, of whom 47% had two or more UTIs within the first year after kidney transplant. In comparison with the institutional antibiogram, Escherichia coli isolated from urine samples from kidney transplant recipients were significantly more resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple UTIs are common in kidney transplant recipients during the first year post-transplantation. E. coli urinary isolates were significantly more resistant to multiple antibiotic drug classes in this patient population compared with the general hospital population. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes at transplant centres should consider producing disease-specific antibiograms specifically for transplant recipients to improve empirical antibiotic selection guidance.
