BACKGROUND: Infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to cure due to the acquisition of resistance by these bacteria and lead to an increase in the general costs of hospitalization. The aim of this study was to determine tigecycline susceptibility of Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from intensive care unit and non-intensive care unit patients with skin and soft tissue infections. METHODS: MICs were tested by Etest among 70 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. RESULTS: The MIC range was from 0.5 to 8.0 mg L(-)(1). For ESBL-producing Acinetobacter baumannii, as well as for strains without carbapenemases, the highest MIC to tigecycline value was 8.0 mg L(-)(1). For AmpC-producing Acinetobacter baumannii, the highest MIC to tigecycline value was 6.0 mg L(-)(1) and, for MBL-producing strains, 2.0 mg L(-)(1). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from ICU and non-ICU patients demonstrated high values of MIC range, MIC50 and MIC90 to tigecycline.
