OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth filled with a resin-based obturation material using two different chelating agents. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty extracted single-canal human teeth were prepared, instrumented, and randomly divided into three groups: Group 1 (n=15) received a final flush with 10 ml of neutralized 17% EDTA, followed by 10 ml of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then obturated using lateral condensation with RealSeal. Group 2 (n=15) received a final flush of BioPure MTAD, followed by 10 ml of NaOCl, then obturated using lateral condensation with RealSeal. Group 3, the control group (n=10), was instrumented but not obturated, then the root canal opening was sealed with a temporary filling material. The specimens were stored in 100% humidity for 10 days, mounted in polyester resin, and loaded to failure. RESULTS: The ANOVA revealed a significant difference between the control group and the experimental groups, although there was no statistically significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 (p=0.05). The MTAD group displayed higher mean fracture load values than the EDTA group. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that filling the root canals with RealSeal increased the in vitro resistance to fracture of single-canal extracted human teeth when compared to instrumented and unobturated teeth. Teeth treated with MTAD demonstrated high fracture-resistance values when compared to teeth treated with 17% EDTA, but they were not statistically significant. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Filling the root canals with RealSeal with increased bonding to roots will increase resistance to fracture of these teeth.
