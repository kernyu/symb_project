BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection is the second most common type of infection and the problem is further compounded by the emergence of drug resistance in bacterial uropathogens. The aim of this study was to determine the spectrum of bacterial uropathogens and their drug resistant pattern. METHODS: A single institutional cross-sectional study was carried out at Arsho Advanced Medical laboratory from September 2015 to May 2016. A total of 712 urine samples were collected, inoculated onto primary isolation culture media, incubated at 37 degrees C for 18-24 h, and significant bacteriuria was determined. Identification and the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria were determined by using the automated VITEK 2 compact system. RESULTS: Out of 712 urine samples processed, 256 (36%) yielded significant bacteriuria of which 208 (81.25%) were obtained from female and 48 (18.75%) from male patients. Age group of 25-44 were more affected with the infection. Of 256 bacterial isolates recovered, Escherichia coli, was the dominant bacterium. Ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were the least effective drugs while piperacillin/tazobactam was the most effective drug against Gram-negative bacteria. Erythromycin was the least effective drug while vancomycin was the most active drug against Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Observation of many bacterial species causing UTI in this study warrants, a continuous epidemiological survey of UTI in health institutions across the country. High level of drug resistance to the commonly prescribed drugs necessitates a search for other options.
