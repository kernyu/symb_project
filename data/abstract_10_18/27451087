In this study, the performance of two commonly used routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods, the automated VITEK((R))2 system and Etest (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France), was compared with the standard broth microdilution (BMD) method on 87 multidrug- and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2015 breakpoints (susceptible, </=4 mg/L; intermediate, 8 mg/L; and resistant, >/=16 mg/L) were used. Minocycline showed excellent activity, with 94.3% of isolates susceptible by BMD (VITEK((R))2, 73.6%; Etest, 63.2%). The MIC50/90 values (minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit 50% and 90% of the isolates, respectively) were as follows: BMD, 1/4 mg/L; VITEK((R))2, </=1/8 mg/L; and Etest, 4/16 mg/L. Etest produced 14.9% major/20.7% minor errors and VITEK((R))2 produced 3.4% major/17.2% minor errors. These data indicate that VITEK((R))2 may be more reliable than Etest for routine susceptibility testing of minocycline for A. baumannii isolates. As both VITEK((R))2 and Etest produced higher minocycline MICs compared with the reference method, BMD may be needed to validate the categorisation of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii by these assays as minocycline non-susceptible.
