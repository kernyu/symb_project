The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a complex anaerobic metabolism characterized by a plastidic hydrogenase (HYD1) coupled to photosynthesis and a bacterial-type fermentation system in which pyruvate formate lyase (PFL1) is the central fermentative enzyme. To identify mutant strains with altered hydrogen metabolism, a C. reinhardtii nuclear transformant library was screened. Mutant strain 48F5 showed lower light-dependent hydrogen (H(2)) evolution rates and reduced in vitro hydrogenase activity, and fermentative H(2) production in the dark was enhanced. The transformant has a single integration of the paromomycin resistance cassette within the PFL1 gene, and is unable to synthesize PFL1 protein. 48F5 secretes no formate, but produces more ethanol, D-lactate and CO(2) than the wild type. Moreover, HYD1 transcript and HYD1 protein levels were lower in the pfl1 mutant strain. Complementation of strain 48F5 with an intact copy of the PFL1 gene restored formate excretion and hydrogenase activity to the wild type level. This analysis shows that the PFL1 pathway has a significant impact on hydrogen metabolism in C. reinhardtii.
