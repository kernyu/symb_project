INTRODUCTION: Resistance of Salmonella to therapeutic agents currently being used for treatment of Salmonella infections is emerging as a global problem. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Salmonella serotypes and their susceptibility patterns to commonly used drugs for treatment of Salmonella infections including quinolones. Correlation between nalidixic acid susceptibility of these isolates and their ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations was also sought. METHODOLOGY: Salmonella isolates (n=213) were collected between January 2007 and May 2009 at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The isolates were serotyped and their susceptibilities to commonly used first-line anti-Salmonella drugs (ampicillin, ceftriaxone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin) were determined using the automated Microscan system, the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, and E-test. RESULTS: The most frequently detected serotype was D1 (37%) followed by the serotypes, B (24%) and C1 (11%). Non-typable Salmonella isolates detected using available conventional Salmonella anti-sera were (11%). Overall resistance rates to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ceftriaxone were 99/213 (46%), 43/213 (20%), 34/213 (16%) and 7/213 (3%), respectively. Of the total isolates, 117 (55%) had a ciprofloxacin MIC of <0.125 microg/ml and among these 105 (90%) were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The remaining 96 (45%) isolates had a ciprofloxacin MIC of >/= 0.125 microg/ml and among them, 83 (86.5%) were resistant to nalidixic acid. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Salmonella isolates in this study were non-typhi serotypes. Significantly higher proportions of Salmonellae were resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin and a vast majority of nalidixic acid resistant organisms exhibited decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.
