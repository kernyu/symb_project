Calcification is a major factor that limits the durability of bioprosthetic valve. A novel bovine pericardial tissue treated with aldehyde capping chemistry and glycerolization was evaluated for its resistance to calcification in comparison with porcine tissues treated with amino oleic acid and bovine pericardial tissue with ethanol rinsing in a rabbit intramuscular model. Tissue discs from the test and control tissues were implanted in rabbits for 60 days. The explanted discs were subject to X-ray imaging, calcium quantification and histology analysis. The test tissue showed 95 and 96 % reduction in calcification in comparison with amino oleic acid treatment and ethanol rinsing treatment, respectively. In addition, the test tissue showed the least inflammatory response as evidenced by a reduced amount of macrophages and giant cells in histology analysis. Furthermore, the aldehyde analysis of the pre-implanted samples showed associated reduction in free aldehyde levels with the test tissue. The reduction in calcification is consistent with previously reported results and is hypothesized to be attributed to the capping of free aldehydes in the test tissue.
