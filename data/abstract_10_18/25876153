Antibiotic resistance is concern of today's world. Search for alternative molecules, for treatment and immune stimulation, remains at the forefront. One such group of biomolecules with promise, along the line of immune stimulation or therapy, is host defense peptide (HDP). These molecules, however, are required at a higher dose to be effective which leads to high cost. To alleviate such problems, an aid can be used to achieve similar efficacy but at a smaller effective dose of the immune stimulant. We hypothesised that by conjugating HDPs with carbon nanotubes and/or gold nanoparticles, it would be possible to stimulate a protective immune response in host system at a lower dosage of HDP. In this report, we characterized, using biophysical methodologies, conjugation of Indolicidin, as a representative of HDP. We further established efficacy of peptide-nanomaterial conjugates in activating innate immunity and protecting against pathogen infection in vitro at a significantly small dose.
