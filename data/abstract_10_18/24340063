Immunosenescence predisposes the elderly to infectious and autoimmune diseases and impairs the response to vaccination. We recently demonstrated that ageing also impedes development of transplantation tolerance. Unlike their young counterparts (8-12 weeks of age) aged male recipients (greater than 12 months of age) transplanted with a full MHC-mismatched heart are resistant to tolerance mediated by anti-CD45RB antibody. Surprisingly, either chemical or surgical castration restored tolerance induction to levels observed using young recipients. Based on the strong impact of endocrine modulation on transplant tolerance, we explored the impact of ageing and castration on the immune system. Here we report a significant increase in the percentage of T cells that produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in aged male versus young male animals and that the overall increase in IFN-gamma production was due to an expansion of IFN-gamma-producing memory T cells in aged animals. In contrast to IFN-gamma production, we did not observe differences in IL-10 expression in young versus old male mice. We hypothesized that endocrine modulation would diminish the elevated levels of IFN-gamma production in aged recipients, however, we observed no significant reduction in the percentage of IFN-gamma+ T cells upon castration. Furthermore, we neutralized interferon-gamma by antibody and did not observe an effect on graft survival. We conclude that while elevated levels of interferon-gamma serves as a marker of tolerance resistance in aged mice, other as yet to be identified factors are responsible for its cause. Defining these factors may be relevant to design of tolerogenic strategies for aged recipients.
