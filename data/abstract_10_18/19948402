Based on the promising drug resistance profile and potent anti-HIV activity of beta-d-3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine, a series of purine modified nucleosides were synthesized by a chemical transglycosylation reaction and evaluated for their antiviral activity, cytotoxicity, and intracellular metabolism. Among the synthesized compounds, several show potent and selective anti-HIV activity in primary lymphocytes.
