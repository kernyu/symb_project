BACKGROUND: The spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), particularly E. faecium, in hospitals leads to many cases of colonization, but only sporadic infections. Detailed and valid risk assessment is needed so that patients at risk can be protected from VRE infection. The principal aims of risk assessment must include not only lowering VRE-associated morbidity and mortality in patients at risk, but also refraining from unnecessary anti-infective measures among those who are not at risk. METHODS: We selectively searched the PubMed database for pertinent articles on the epidemiology and clinical relevance of VRE in order to derive a uniform and practical hygiene strategy from the available scientific evidence. RESULTS: Only low-level evidence is available for the interventions studied to date, and most of the recommendations that have been issued can be characterized as expert opinion. As a rule, VRE are not highly pathogenic; they tend to have high rates of colonization, but low rates of infection. The risk factors for colonization with VRE include (among others) the administration of antibiotics and immunosuppressants, prior hospitalization, diarrhea, intubation, and other invasive treatments. The areas of highest risk are hematology/oncology wards, liver transplantation wards, dialysis units, and neonatology wards. CONCLUSION: The chain of infection can be broken by improved and consistently applied standard hygienic measures (hand and surface disinfection). Some patients are nonetheless at elevated risk of VRE infection. In specific clinical situations, the optimal protection of these patients against VRE infection demands the obligatory enforcement of stricter hygienic measures (contact isolation).
