This study evaluated the synergistic effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, in combination with azoles against Candida albicans both in vitro and in vivo and explored the underlying mechanism. MICs, sessile MICs, and time-kill curves were determined for resistant C. albicans Galleria mellonella was used as a nonvertebrate model for determining the efficacy of the drug combinations against C. albicans in vivo For the mechanism study, gene expression levels of the SAP gene family were determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and extracellular phospholipase activities were detected in vitro by the egg yolk agar method. The combinations resulted in synergistic activity against C. albicans strains, but the same effect was not found for the non-albicans Candida strains. For the biofilms formed over 4, 8, and 12 h, synergism was seen for the combination of fluconazole and fluoxetine. In addition, the time-kill curves confirmed the synergism dynamically. The results of the G. mellonella studies agreed with the in vitro analysis. In the mechanism study, we observed that fluconazole plus fluoxetine caused downregulation of the gene expression levels of SAP1 to SAP4 and weakened the extracellular phospholipase activities of resistant C. albicans The combinations of azoles and fluoxetine showed synergistic effects against resistant C. albicans may diminish the virulence properties of C. albicans.
