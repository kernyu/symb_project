Once considered a crowning achievement of modern drug development, tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy has proven increasingly unable to keep pace with the spread of the pandemic and rise of drug resistance. Efforts to revive the TB drug development pipeline have, in the meantime, faltered. Closer analysis reveals key experimental deficiencies that have hindered our ability to 'reverse engineer' knowledge of antibiotic mechanisms into rational drug development. Here, we discuss the emerging potential of metabolomics; the systems level study of small molecule metabolites, to help overcome these gaps and serve as a unique biochemical bridge between the phenotypic properties of chemical compounds and biological targets.
