From July 2006 to June 2008, a total of 3876 Escherichia coli strains were collected from 1014 porcine intestinal contents to investigate antimicrobial resistance and related gene patterns. Average resistance rates of porcine E. coli isolates were 93.2% for tetracycline, 65.3% for ampicillin, 60.4% for chloramphenicol, 57.7% for streptomycin, 35.8% for nalidixic acid, 23.6% for gentamicin, 10.8% for ciprofloxacin, 10.0% for norfloxacin, 4.5% for cephalothin, 1.0% for cefoxitin, and 0.4% for cefazolin. The number of isolates resistant to more than 3 different classes of antimicrobials was 2537. Among these, 92 isolates were resistant to 5 or more classes of antimicrobials, and 69 isolates among 92 multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates were integrase positive. Among 69 integrase-positive MDR isolates, only class I integron was detected in 19 isolates (20.7%). The class-1-integron-positive isolates had different sizes and gene contents (i.e., 1.0 kb containing aadA1 and 1.5 kb containing aadA1-dfrA1 and aadA1-aadB), and showed 15 distinct types by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis, with 80% cut-off band pattern similarity. PFGE typing of four groups of isolates with identical antimicrobial resistance gene profiles showed two heterogeneous groups, while one group had very similar PFGE patterns; the fourth group was not typeable due to DNA degradation. In conjugation experiments, class I integron-harboring isolates transferred resistance to ampicillin, norfloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol to the recipient strain. This study showed that antimicrobial resistance rates and corresponding genes in porcine E. coli isolates are different from those in human isolates described by previous studies, and that transfer of antimicrobial-resistant genes from animal to human occurred. These data can be used as a baseline to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial use after implementation of the animal antimicrobial ban for prophylactic and growth promotion except for therapeutic use in 2012 in Korea.
