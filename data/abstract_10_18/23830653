Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus have emerged as the most important nosocomial pathogens. Traditional therapy may be sufficient in most but not all patients, in whom alternatives should be sought. The infection is often complicated with several sites of metastatic foci and is nosocomial frequently. New antibiotics to fight MRSA have been introduced and are equivalent or better than vancomycin.
