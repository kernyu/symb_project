Current therapy for mycoses is limited to the use of a relative reduced number of antifungal drugs. Although amphotericin B still remains considered as the "gold standard" for treatment, acute and chronic toxicity, such as impairment of renal function, limits its use and enhances the investigation and clinical use other chemical families of antifungal drugs. One of these chemical class of active drugs are azole derivatives, discovered in 70s and introduced in clinical practice in 80s. Being the most prolific antifungal class, investigation about more molecules, with a safer and better pharmacological profile, active against a wide spectrum of fungi, with a wide range of administration routes gives us some azole representatives.
