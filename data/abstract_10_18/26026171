OBJECTIVES: Several studies, especially in Europe, have recently reported the emerging phenomenon of azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus, but very few data are available in France. Our study aimed to determine the resistance prevalence in A. fumigatus isolates recovered from clinical samples over a 1-year period in two university hospital centers. METHODS: All A. fumigatus isolates were screened for azole resistance using RPMI agar plates supplemented with itraconazole and voriconazole. Resistance was then confirmed by the EUCAST method. A part of the beta-tubulin gene was amplified for resistant isolates to confirm the A. fumigatus species, and the Cyp51A gene and its promoter were afterward sequenced to detect mutations potentially responsible for this resistance. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five A. fumigatus isolates were recovered from 134 patients. Three isolates recovered from three patients were found resistant with MICs of >8 mg/l, 4 mg/l, and 1 mg/l for itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole, respectively. The TR34/L98H mutation, previously and largely described in other countries, was detected in the three isolates. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the occurrence of azole resistance among unselected A. fumigatus clinical isolates, with an overall prevalence of 1.8%.
