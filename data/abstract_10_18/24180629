PURPOSE: Gram-positive cocci and Propionibacterium acnes are widely reported agents of infectious postoperative endophthalmitis. This multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the eradication effectiveness and safety profile of levofloxacin 1.5% ophthalmic solution (LVFX 1.5%) for use in perioperative disinfection. METHODS: Patients who were scheduled for cataract surgery were enrolled. The perioperative regimen of LVFX 1.5% was administered 3 times daily as follows: preoperative 3 days; the day of surgery (in the morning, 1 h before surgery, and immediately after surgery); and postoperative 2 weeks. Conjunctival sac scrapings were collected 3 times in the observation period; before preoperative administration, before iodine eyewash on the day of surgery, and after completion of postoperative administration. Isolated and identified microbial strains were assessed for antibacterial susceptibility. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled and data obtained from 96 patients (mean age, 72.7 +/- 8.9 years). The preoperative eradication rate was 86.7% in total microbes. In the case of gram-positive cocci, the preoperative eradication rate was 100%, even though there were LVFX-registrant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which had a high minimum inhibitory concentration against LVFX, such as 32 mug/mL. On the other hand, that of P. acnes was 78.3%. No acquired drug resistance was suspected in all strains. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 4.2% patients, and all were slight. CONCLUSIONS: For ophthalmic perioperative disinfection, the LVFX 1.5% ophthalmic solution showed a good safety profile, and critical eradication of gram-positive cocci, including the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains.
