BACKGROUND: Interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is secreted by Th17 cells, is a proinflammatory cytokine that is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and plays a role in nonresponse of MS patients to interferon-beta (IFN-beta) therapy. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to establish a correlation between nonresponders (NR) and IL-17A serum titers and binding antibodies (BAbs) to IFN-beta, as well as to find a correlation between IL-17A serum levels and other features of MS patients. METHODS: Our prospective study included 72 inactive relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients that had been treated for at least 18 months with IFN-beta and 15 healthy subjects. We determined the serum levels of IL-17A and of BAbs. IL-17A levels were considered elevated (IL-17A+) if the recorded value was greater than 1.6 pg/ml. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (37.5%) were NR and had a significantly higher serum IL-17A level compared to the responders group. Nineteen patients (26.4%) were IL-17A+ and had had a significantly higher number of relapses in the previous year and a higher Expanded Disability Status Score. The majority of IL-17A+ patients were NR and had a shorter MS duration. CONCLUSIONS: RRMS patients with high serum IL-17A levels do not respond well to IFN-beta therapy and have shorter MS duration compared to patients with low IL-17A levels. This response is not influenced by the presence of BAbs.
