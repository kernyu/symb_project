Simplification of a suppressive triple antiretroviral therapy to a dual or monotherapy has demonstrated safety and efficacy in a high proportion of stable patients. The key rationales behind regimen simplification are to improve the patient's quality of life and to maintain long-term compliance, without enhancing the risk of virological failure. A simplified startegy offers the potential advantages of a decreased risk of toxicities associated with the use of nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Moreover, the use of high genetic barrier antiretroviral drugs (basically, PIs/r) in dual regimen or in monotherapy regimen minimises the selection of drug-resistant HIV variants. The aim of this paper is to present a score that taking into account all the data in the literature relating to the simplification studies to monotherapy with PI/r allows the clinician to have more information to choose with less chance of error by the patient simplify.
