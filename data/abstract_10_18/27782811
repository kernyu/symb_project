BACKGROUND: The widespread use of antiretroviral therapies has led to considerable concerns about the prevalence of drug-resistant, as transmission of drug-resistant (TDR) strains poses a challenge for the control of the HIV-1 epidemic. METHODS: We conducted an epidemiological study enrolling treatment-naive HIV-1-positive subjects at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital since 1991. Drug resistance was determined by submitting the sequences to the Stanford University Network HIV-1 database. RESULTS: Of 521 participants, 478 samples were amplified and sequenced successfully. HIV Transmitted drug resistance prevalence in China was determined to be 6.7 %. We did not find significant differences in the TDR rate by demographic characteristics. No significant time trend in the prevalence of overall TDR was observed (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We identified an intermediate prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR), exhibiting a stable time trend. These findings enhance our understanding of HIV-1 drug resistance prevalence and time trend, and provide some guidelines for the comprehensive public health strategy of TDR prevention.
