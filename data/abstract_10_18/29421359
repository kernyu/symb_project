Our study aimed to investigate colistin resistance and the mechanisms involved in a collection of 35 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and 13 CMY-2-producing E. coli strains which were previously recovered from chicken gut microbiota in Tunisia, as well as to determine the genetic location of mcr genes. Forty-eight ESBL and CMY-2-producing E. coli strains were obtained from 137 fecal samples of healthy chickens during 2013. These strains were tested for colistin resistance by the broth microdilution method, and screened for mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes by PCR. Two of these strains were colistin-resistant (MIC=8mg/L). Both harbored the mcr-1 gene, were CMY-2 producers, and were additionally resistant to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tobramycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. They shared phylogroup A, the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)-pattern, and were typed as ST2197. In both strains, ISApl1 and pap2 were detected upstream and downstream of mcr-1 gene, respectively. The analysis of the two mcr-1-positive strains and their transconjugants by PCR-based replicon typing and S1-PFGE, demonstrated that mcr-1 gene is linked to an IncP plasmid (~242kb), and blaCMY-2 to an IncI1 plasmid (97kb). The occurrence of E. coli harboring mcr-1 gene among intestinal microbiota in poultry and its location on a conjugative plasmid could represent a risk for public health. The evolution of this type of resistant microorganisms should be evaluated in the future.
