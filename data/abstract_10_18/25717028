The objective of this study was to assess the activity of amikacin in combination with doxycycline against clinical strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the search for new strategies against multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. The study included 28 clinical M. tuberculosis strains, comprising 5 fully susceptible, 1 isoniazid-resistant, 17 MDR, 1 poly-resistant (streptomycin/isoniazid), 1 rifampicin-resistant and 3 XDR isolates, as well as the laboratory strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a modified chequerboard methodology in a BACTEC MGIT 960 System. Fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) were calculated, and synergy, indifference or antagonism was assessed. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to investigate the genetic basis of synergy, indifference or antagonism. The MIC50 and MIC90 values (MICs that inhibit 50% and 90% of the isolates, respectively) were, respectively, 0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L for amikacin and 8 mg/L and 16 mg/L for doxycycline. The combination of amikacin and doxycycline showed a synergistic effect in 18 of the 29 strains tested and indifference in 11 strains. Antagonism was not observed. A streptomycin resistance mutation (K43R) was associated with indifference. In conclusion, the benefit of addition of doxycycline to an amikacin-containing regimen should be explored since in vitro results in this study indicate either synergy or indifference. Moreover, doxycycline also has immunomodulatory effects.
