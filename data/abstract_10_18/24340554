Bacterial meningitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite the availability of effective antimicrobial therapy. The management approach to patients with suspected or proven bacterial meningitis includes emergent cerebrospinal fluid analysis and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial and adjunctive therapies. The choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy is based on the patient's age and underlying disease status; once the infecting pathogen is isolated, antimicrobial therapy can be modified for optimal treatment. Successful treatment of bacterial meningitis requires the knowledge on epidemiology including prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens, pathogenesis of meningitis, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial agents. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in recent years has necessitated the development of new strategies for empiric antimicrobial therapy for bacterial meningitis.
