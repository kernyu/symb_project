DS-8587 is a novel broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with extended antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of DS-8587 against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. The MIC range of DS-8587 against MDR A. baumannii was 0.25-2 mg/L. These DS-8587 MICs were a minimum of 16-fold or 8-fold more potent than ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, respectively. Bactericidal activity, a 3 log10 reduction from the initial bacterial counts, was observed within 2 h for 1593644 and 4 h for 1593684 after exposure to DS-8587. Therapeutic efficacy of DS-8587 in the murine calf muscle model was observed at 256 mg/kg. The analysis of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic index revealed that the AUC/MIC ratio showed the best correlation with efficacy. The total and free drug AUC/MIC value required for a static effect was 29.4 and 14.1, respectively. These data indicate DS-8587 would be an effective agent against MDR A. baumannii infection.
