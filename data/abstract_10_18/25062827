The cysteine desulfurase, IscS, is a highly conserved and essential component of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) system that serves as a sulfur donor for Fe-S clusters biogenesis. Fe-S clusters are versatile and labile cofactors of proteins that orchestrate a wide array of essential metabolic processes, such as energy generation and ribosome biogenesis. However, no information regarding the role of IscS or its regulation is available in Leishmania, an evolving pathogen model with rapidly developing drug resistance. In this study, we characterized LdIscS to investigate the ISC system in AmpB-sensitive vs resistant isolates of L. donovani and to understand its regulation. We observed an upregulated Fe-S protein activity in AmpB-resistant isolates but, in contrast to our expectations, LdIscS expression was upregulated in the sensitive strain. However, further investigations showed that LdIscS expression is positively correlated with ROS level and negatively correlated with Fe-S protein activity, independent of strain sensitivity. Thus, our results suggested that LdIscS expression is regulated by ROS level with Fe-S clusters/proteins acting as ROS sensors. Moreover, the direct evidence of a mechanism, in support of our results, is provided by dose-dependent induction of LdIscS-GFP as well as endogenous LdIscS in L. donovani promastigotes by three different ROS inducers: H2O2, menadione, and Amphotericin B. We postulate that LdIscS is upregulated for de novo synthesis or repair of ROS damaged Fe-S clusters. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for regulation of IscS expression that may help parasite survival under oxidative stress conditions encountered during infection of macrophages and suggest a cross talk between two seemingly unrelated metabolic pathways, the ISC system and redox metabolism in L. donovani.
