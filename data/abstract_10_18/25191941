Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have not yet been introduced into the national program for childhood vaccination in Tunisia. The aim of this 7-year study was to obtain local data about serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae. A total of 203 isolates of culture confirmed that S. pneumoniae was evaluated. Invasive (n=108) and noninvasive (n=95) pneumococcal isolates were obtained from patients aged from 1 month to 85 years old. Considering all age groups, vaccine coverage was 40%, 62%, and 68% for PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 serotypes, respectively. Overall, 31% of these isolates were penicillin G nonsusceptible. The most prevalent serotypes identified were those found in currently available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, emphasizing the importance of implementing the vaccine in the routine immunization schedule at the national level.
