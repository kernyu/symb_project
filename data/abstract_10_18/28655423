Three novel structural series of 4''-O-(1-aralkyl-1,2,3-triazol-4-methyl-carbamoyl) azithromycin analogs were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity. All the target compounds exhibited excellent activity against erythromycin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, and significantly improved activity against three phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae compared with clarithromycin and azithromycin. Among the three series of azithromycin analogs, the novel series of 11,4''-disubstituted azithromycin analogs 9a-k exhibited the most effective and balanced activity against susceptible and resistant bacteria. Among them, compound 9j showed the most potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 (0.008microg/mL) and Streptococcus pyogenes R2 (1microg/mL). Besides, all the 11,4''-disubstituted azithromycin analogs 9a-k except 9f shared the identical activity with the MIC value <0.002microg/mL against Streptococcus pyogenes S2. Furthermore, compounds 9g, 9h, 9j and 9k displayed significantly improved activity compared with the references against all the three phenotypes of resistant S. pneumoniae. Particularly, compound 9k was the most effective (0.06, 0.03 and 0.125microg/mL) against all the erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae expressing the erm gene, the mef gene and the erm and mef genes, exhibiting 2133, 133 and 2048-fold more potent activity than azithromycin, respectively.
