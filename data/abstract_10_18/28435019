This study was conducted to investigate the epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in the Asia-Pacific region (APR) from 2010-2013. A total of 17 350 isolates were collected from 54 centres in 13 countries in the APR. The three most commonly isolated GNB were Escherichia coli (46.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.8%). Overall, the rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae were 38.2% and 24.3%, respectively, and they were highest in China (66.6% and 38.7%, respectively), Thailand (49.8% and 36.5%, respectively) and Vietnam (47.9% and 30.4%, respectively). During 2010-2013, the rates of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates causing community-associated (CA) IAIs (collected <48 h after admission) were 26.0% and 13.5%, respectively, and those causing hospital-associated (HA) IAIs were 48.0% and 30.6%, respectively. Amikacin, ertapenem and imipenem were the most effective agents against ESBL-producing isolates. Piperacillin/tazobactam displayed good in vitro activity (91.4%) against CA ESBL-producing E. coli. For other commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae, fluoroquinolones, cefepime and carbapenems exhibited better in vitro activities than third-generation cephalosporins. Amikacin possessed high in vitro activity against all GNB isolates (>80%) causing IAIs, except for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (ACB) complex (30.9% for HA-IAI isolates). All of the antimicrobial agents tested exhibited <45% in vitro activity against ACB complex. Antimicrobial resistance is a persistent threat in the APR and continuous monitoring of evolutionary trends in the susceptibility patterns of GNB causing IAIs in this region is mandatory.
