The rise of Candida spp. resistant to classic triazole antifungal agents has led to a search for new therapeutic options. Here, we evaluated combinations of antifungals in a checkerboard assay against two groups of Candida glabrata strains: one containing fluconazole-susceptible clinical isolates (FS) and another containing fluconazole-resistant laboratory derivative (FR). The most synergistic combination observed was amphotericin B + flucytosine (synergistic for 61.77 % of FS strains and 76.47 % of FR strains). The most antagonistic combination observed was ketoconazole + flucytosine (FS 61.77 % and FR 55.88 %). Surprisingly, most combinations evidenced indifferent interactions, and the best synergism appeared when amphotericin B and flucytosine were combined against both groups of isolates.
