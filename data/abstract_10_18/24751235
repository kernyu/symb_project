Azole resistance among clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus is becoming a serious problem in Europe, but the status in Japan is not yet known in detail. The aim of this study was to determine the present status of azole resistance in A. fumigatus in Japan. We employed 171 clinical isolates of A. fumigatus sensu stricto collected from 1987 to 2008 at the Medical Mycology Research Center, Chiba University, Japan for azole resistance determination. Identification of all isolates were re-examined both from the aspect of morphology and molecular phylogeny. The antifungal susceptibility of these isolates was tested based on the CLSI M38-A2 broth microdilution method. In our collection, only 1 (0.6%) and 2 isolates (1.2%) showed elevated MIC to voriconazole and itraconazole, respectively. Our study disclosed that the frequency of azole resistance in A. fumigatus still remains low in this collection.
