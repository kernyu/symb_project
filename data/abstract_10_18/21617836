An extended-spectrum B-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Providencia stuartii isolate was studied. A qnrA1 gene co-expressing blaVEB-1 gene was detected. Both genes were transferred to the recipient strain. The ciprofloxacin MIC of recipient strain increased tenfold. The blaVEB-1 gene persisted in microorganisms in Turkey but it also spread with PMQR genes to other species. The combination of PMQR with multidrug resistant isolates producing ESBLs may compromise the use of valuable antibiotics. Serious efforts are necessary to detect PMQR determinants not only with common B-lactamases in widespread pathogens but also with uncommon forms that are encountered infrequently.
