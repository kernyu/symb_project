Burkholderia cepacia is a gram-negative bacilli leading to pneumonia with poor prognosis and usually seen in patients with immunosuppression or with structural lung diseases. This report is about two patients with no underlying disease diagnosed as B. cepacia pneumonia mimicking malignancy and tuberculosis. Bronchoscopy was applied on both patients since no response to treatment with wide spectrum antibiotics and negative sputum smears for acid-fast bacili. B. cepacia was isolated from bronchial lavage culture. Antibiogram revealed sensitivity to quinolones in both cases. Radiological and clinical complete remission was seen in patients by quinolones. The current cases showed that community-acquired Burkholderia pneumonia is possible in healthy patients. Bronchial washing is important in diagnosis.
