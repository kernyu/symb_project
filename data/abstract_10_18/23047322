Shields down! Adjuvant molecules that have the ability to restore the susceptibility of multi-drug-resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, to clinically available antibiotics are a promising alternative to the development of novel antimicrobials. Pictured is a potent small molecule (1) that, at sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) levels, lowers the MIC of oxacillin (2) against a number of MRSA strains by up to 512-fold.
