Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are predominant fungi associated with oral candidiasis. Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is a small cationic human salivary peptide with high fungicidal activity against C. albicans, however many strains of C. glabrata are resistant. Since Hst 5 requires fungal binding to cell wall components prior to intracellular translocation, reduced Hst 5 binding to C. glabrata may be the reason for its insensitivity. C. glabrata has higher surface levels of beta-1,3-glucans as compared with C. albicans; however these differences did not account for reduced Hst 5 uptake and killing in C. glabrata. Similarly, the biofilm matrix of C. glabrata contained significantly higher levels of beta-1,3-glucans compared with C. albicans, but it did not reduce the percentage of Hst 5 positive fungal cells in the biofilm. Hst 5 enters C. albicans cell through polyamine transporters Dur3p and Dur31p that are uncharacterized in C. glabrata. C. glabrata strains expressing CaDur3 and CaDur31 had two-fold higher killing and uptake of Hst 5. Thus, neither C. glabrata cell surface or biofilm matrix beta-1,3-glucan levels affected Hst 5 toxicity; rather the crucial rate limiting step is reduced uptake that can be overcome by expression of C. albicans Dur proteins in C. glabrata.
