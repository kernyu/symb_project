Using different typing methods (MLST, spa-, SCCmec- and agr-typing), PFGE and DNA microarray-based chip analysis, we characterized 20 MRSA strains isolated from livestock and veterinarians. PFGE analysis after macrorestriction with EagI provided seven different band patterns, which could be grouped into four clusters. One cluster consisted of all MRSA ST398 strains isolated from pigs, calves, mastitis milk and two veterinarians. One strain of ST398 from a veterinarian and the two strains of ST1 and ST8 formed the three other clusters. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 15 of 20 strains were resistant to ampicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin, oxacillin, penicillin and tetracycline. All strains were susceptible to rifampin and vancomycin, 19 were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and 18 were susceptible to sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Genes encoding different enterotoxins, leukotoxins and haemolysins were found in certain strains.
