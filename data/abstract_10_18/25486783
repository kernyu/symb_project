Oxidative stress has been shown to induce either apoptosis or stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) in different cell types. At present, it is generally accepted that stem cells have high resistance to oxidative stress; however data reported by various authors are controversial. In this study, we investigated stress responses of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMESC) derived from desquamated endometrium to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. LD50 were determined as 300-350, 350-400 and 600-700 muM for hESC, human embryonic fibroblasts and hMESC, respectively. Thus, among the cell lines studied, hMESC demonstrated the most resistance to increased H2O2 concentration. We have found for the first time that sub-lethal doses of H2O2 induce premature senescence phenotype in hMESC, like in HEF, which is characterized by increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1), an irreversible cell cycle arrest, the permanent loss of proliferative potential, cell hypertrophy and SA-beta-Gal staining. While a sub-lethal H2O2 dose (200 muM) promoted in hMESC only SIPS, the higher H2O2 doses induced also apoptosis in the part of the cell population. On the contrary, in hESC, H2O2 regardless of the doses tested (from 50 to 500 muM) triggered apoptosis, that was the only pronounced response of these cells to oxidative damage. The data obtained demonstrate that stem cells of various origins under oxidative stress utilize the different defense mechanisms: hESC rapidly eliminate damaged cells through apoptosis, whereas hMESC may enter SIPS.
