Here we report the clinical features and treatment outcomes of three patients with Candida haemulonii infection. Candida haemulonii was confirmed by sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the rRNA genes and the 18S rRNA genes. Two of the three isolates were associated with fungaemia and reduced susceptibility to fluconazole [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 16 mg/L] and amphotericin B (MICs of 2 mg/L). However, one of these two patients responded to fluconazole therapy. Echinocandins, voriconazole and posaconazole demonstrated excellent in vitro potency against the isolates.
