Intravenous minocycline (Minocin((R))) is approved in the USA for use in patients with infections due to susceptible strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including infections due to Acinetobacter spp. Minocycline is a synthetic tetracycline derivative that was originally introduced in the 1960s. A new intravenous formulation of minocycline was recently approved and introduced to address the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Minocycline shows antibacterial activity against A. baumannii clinical isolates worldwide, and exhibits synergistic bactericidal activity against MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii isolates when combined with other antibacterial agents. In retrospective studies, intravenous minocycline provided high rates of clinical success or improvement and was generally well tolerated among patients with MDR or carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections. While randomized clinical trial data would be useful to fully establish the place of minocycline in the management of these infections for which there are currently very few available options, clinical trials in patients with infections due to Acinetobacter spp. are difficult to perform. Nevertheless, current data indicate a potential role for intravenous minocycline in the treatment of patients MDR A. baumannii infections, particularly when combined with a second antibacterial agent (e.g. colistin).
