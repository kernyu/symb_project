OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori eradication rates show a constant decline over the last few years. The main reason for H. pylori treatment failure is the increasing antibiotic resistance.We assessed antibiotic susceptibility of H. pylori in a region of mid-Germany and analyzed the relationship of antibiotic resistance with the number of eradication therapies over a period of 7 years (2005-2012). METHODS: H. pylori strains were isolated from 436 patients who underwent gastroscopy for different clinical indications. Susceptibility to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, levofloxacin, and rifabutin was determined using the E-test. RESULTS: Primary, secondary, and tertiary resistances against clarithromycin were 7.5, 63.2, and 75.4%, respectively. Primary, secondary, and tertiary resistances to levofloxacin were 11.7, 17.6, and 36.4% and to metronidazole were 32.7, 63.2, and 80.1%, respectively. The resistance rates against tetracycline and rifabutin were comparatively low (<5%), even in patients with previous exposure to these antibiotics. Resistance to rifabutin increased to 6.2% in patients who received more than two previous eradication therapies. Amoxicillin resistance was not detectable in all patients. CONCLUSION: In our region, we observed a stable, but constantly increasing, resistance rate to antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Knowledge of the local antibiotic resistance rates is essential for developing successful treatment strategies for H. pylori eradication.
