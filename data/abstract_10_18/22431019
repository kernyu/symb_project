Currently the prevalence of HIV-1 infection in Cameroon is 5.1%, CRF02_AG subtype is responsible for about 50% of infections. Since an HIV-1 drug resistance test is not yet available widely, accurate data on the prevalence of resistant viral strains are missing. The objective of this study was to determine HIV-1 genetic diversity and to characterize HIV-1 mutations conferring drug resistance among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and ART-treated patients. A cohort of 239 patients infected with HIV were followed-up between January 2007 and July 2010 in Cameroon. Two hundred and sixteen plasma samples were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis and identification of drug resistance mutations in the HIV-1 pol region. A significant genetic diversity was found: Seven pure subtypes (A1, A3, D, F1, F2, G, H), nine circulating recombinant forms (CRFs: 01_AE, 02_AG, 06cpx, 09cpx, 11cpx, 13cpx, 16cpx, 18cpx, 37cpx) and one new unique recombinant form (URF) (G/F2). The rate of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in naive patients was 8.2% (4/49). Around 80% of patients failing a first-line ART harbored a virus with at least one resistance mutation to two antiretroviral (ARV) classes, and 36% of those failing a second-line regimen carried a virus with at least one resistant mutation to three ARV classes. The high level of drug resistance observed in the cohort is alarming because this occurred as a result of only few years of treatment. Adherence to therapy, adequate education of physicians, and the appropriate use of genotypic resistance assay are critical points of intervention for the improvement of patient care.
