Preformed spacers have proved to be effective in the two-stage revision of infected total hip replacements. In the treatment of septic arthritis of the hip, the use of a temporary device has occasionally been described, but the implantation of a preformed antibiotic-loaded spacer has not yet been reported. A 71-year-old man with a destructive Staphylococcus aureus septic arthritis of the hip joint was admitted to hospital. Given the persistence of local infection regardless of all antibiotics and the worsening of joint damage, an aggressive surgical treatment including early placement of a preformed temporary spacer loaded with antibiotics was performed. Two months later an uncemented total hip replacement was successfully implanted. Two years after surgery the patient had a complete functional recovery with no signs of recurrence. The advantages of a preformed device include an effective and predictable local release of antibiotics and a mechanically tested resistance that allows early partial weight bearing and immediate joint mobilization.
