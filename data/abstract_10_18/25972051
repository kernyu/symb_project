OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between patient age, sociological factors, and the microbiology of pediatric neck infections. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of children up to 5 years old who underwent surgical management of suppurative cervical lymphadenitis. RESULTS: A total of 76 individuals met inclusion criteria; 93% of culture-positive infections were caused by Staphylococcus aureus in infants, compared with 59% in children between 13 months and 5 years of age (P = .002). Of the S aureus isolates, 51% were methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 49% were methicillin-sensitive S aureus. Methicillin resistance was associated with African American race (P = .004); 67% of participants received empirical antibiotics prior to admission. Of these, 73% received antibiotics in the beta-lactam class, and 25% received treatment with clindamycin. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of MRSA is high in infants with cervical lymphadenitis who fail empirical antibiotic therapy and require surgical management. Empirical coverage for cervical lymphadenitis with beta-lactam antibiotics may provide inadequate coverage for early infection in this population.
