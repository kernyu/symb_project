To clarify the characteristics of the virulence factors (VFs) of ciprofloxacin resistant Escherichia coli (CFRE) with acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC), we determined the VFs and the phylogenetic background of all 54 CFRE strains and the 55 randomly selected ciprofloxacin sensitive E. coli strains (CFSE) from patients with AUC in 22 Korean hospitals. The prevalence of the VFs was as follows: fimA, papEF, papGIII, sfaI, dafaBC, cnf1, and hlyA were presented in 96%, 54%, 68%, 91%, 49%, 72%, and 29% of the samples, respectively. The expressions of papEF, cnf1, and hlyA were significantly more prevalent in the CFSE. Moreover, the expressions of cnf, and papEF significantly reduced the risk of ciprofloxacin resistance. The CFSE was also marginally associated with the group B2 (P=0.05). Although the presence of pyuria and a previous cystitis history were not related with the phylotyping and the expressions of VFs, group B2, and fimA and papEF were more expressed in the younger age patients (P<0.05). In conclusion, the CFRE exhibits a selective loss of VFs and the non-B2 phylotype in Korean AUC patients. The group B2 and the presence of fimA and papEF are associated with a younger age of AUC patients.
