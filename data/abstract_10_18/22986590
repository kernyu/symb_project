Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is an important molecule involved in multiple biological processes, such as cell growth, cell cycle progression, malignant transformation, and enhancement of the anti-apoptotic activity. In this study, the TCTP from orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides (Ec-TCTP) was cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA of Ec-TCTP was comprised of 1057 bp with a 510 bp open reading frame that encodes a putative protein of 170 amino acids. Recombinant Ec-TCTP (rEc-TCTP) was expressed in Escherichia BL21 (DE3) and purified for mouse anti-Ec-TCTP serum preparation. The rEc-TCTP fusion protein was demonstrated to possess antioxidant activity, which conferred resistance to H(2)O(2) damage. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that Ec-TCTP mRNA is predominately expressed in the liver, and the expression was up-regulated in the liver of grouper after viral challenge with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV). Intracellular localization revealed that Ec-TCTP expression was distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm. Although human TCTP has a role in apoptosis regulation, it is not known if grouper TCTP has any role in apoptosis regulation. Strikingly, grouper TCTP, when overexpressed in fathead minnow (FHM) cells, protected them from cell death induced by cycloheximide (CHX). In addition, overexpressed Ec-TCTP in grouper spleen (GS) cells inhibited the replication of SGIV. These results suggest that Ec-TCTP may play a critical role in their response to SGIV infection, through regulation of a cell death pathway that is common to fish and humans.
