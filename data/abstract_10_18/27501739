AIM: To evaluate the effect of propolis against Candida species planktonic cells and its counterpart's biofilms. MATERIALS & METHODS: The MIC values, time-kill curves and filamentation form inhibition were determined in Candida planktonic cells. The effect of propolis on Candida biofilms was assessed through quantification of CFUs. RESULTS: MIC values, ranging from 220 to 880 microg/ml, demonstrated higher efficiency on C. albicans and C. parapsilosis than on C. tropicalis cells. In addition, propolis was able to prevent Candida species biofilm's formation and eradicate their mature biofilms, coupled with a significant reduction on C. tropicalis and C. albicans filamentation. CONCLUSION: Propolis is an inhibitor of Candida virulence factors and represents an innovative alternative to fight candidiasis.
