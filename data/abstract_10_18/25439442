The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, spiramycin and erythromycin against 30 caprine Greek isolates of Mycoplasma agalactiae were determined using E test methodology. The E test strips were placed on Eaton's agar medium without antimicrobials and phenol red. MICs were then read by determining where the growth inhibition zone intersected with the MIC scale on the strip. An MIC value of 8 microg/mL was considered as a guide to mycoplasma resistance. All isolates were sensitive to fluoroquinolones (MIC50, 0.19 g/mL; MIC90, 0.38 microg/mL; highest MIC, 0.5 microg/mL), spectinomycin (MIC50, 0.5 microg/mL; MIC90, 1 microg/mL; highest MIC, 1 microg/mL), and spiramycin (MIC50, 1 microg/mL; MIC90, 1.5 microg/mL; highest MIC, 2 microg/mL). Two strains exhibited resistance to tetracycline (MIC 32 microg/mL) but these were not found to carry any of the tet(M), tet(O), and tet(S) resistance genes. Finally all isolates expressed resistance to erythromycin (MIC50, 128 microg/mL; MIC90, >256 microg/mL).
