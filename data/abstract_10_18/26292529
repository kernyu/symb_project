Eleven avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strains isolated from 2006 to 2010 from different farms in Algeria and resistant to cephalosporins were studied. Their susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined by disk diffusion, and the genes responsible for resistance to critical antimicrobials were studied by PCR, sequencing, and conjugation. Their genetic profiles were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All strains were resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and neomycin and showed the same PFGE profile. For most of them, resistance was encoded by a nontransferable group 1 bla(CTX-M) gene, and multiple mutations were detected in the quinolone resistance-determining regions. The clonal dissemination of this resistant APEC is worrying for animal and public health.
