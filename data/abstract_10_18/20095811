Macrophages are involved in the host defense against infectious pathogens and tumors. Tilia species have been used in folk medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases, previously it was demonstrated that a dichloromethane (DM) extract possess antiproliferative action "in vitro" on a lymphoma cell line. The aim of this work was to study the "in vivo" effect of DM extract upon mice peritoneal macrophages. DM extract-activated macrophages phagocytosis through hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and nitric oxide (NO) production (phagocytosis (%): basal 16.93 +/- 0.18, DM extract 25.93 +/- 2.8; H(2)O(2) (M): basal 0.0022 +/- 0.00016, DM extract 0.0036 +/- 0.0005; NO (mM): basal 0.0052 +/- 0.0007, DM extract 0.0099 +/- 0.0004). These actions were mediated by cell superoxide dismutase activation. On the other hand, DM extract decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha but increased interleukin-10 in serum. These results suggest that the modulation activity exerted by the extract on immune system cells could be an important mechanism to acquire resistance to tumors and infectious diseases.
