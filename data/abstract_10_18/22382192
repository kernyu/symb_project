BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (PMABL) resistance in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. is an emerging problem worldwide. Phenotypic methods are commonly used for detection of PMABL production in Gram-negative isolates, but molecular data about the prevalence of plasmid-mediated AmpC-type resistance at the national level are needed. Hence, a prospective study was undertaken to determine the occurrence of PMABL gene and its types among clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae obtained from six different hospitals in India. METHODS: A total of 241 nosocomial isolates of K. pneumoniae (n=109) and E.coli (n=132) from six geographically distant hospitals in India were included. These were screened for cefoxitin resistance. AmpC disk test and modified three dimensional extraction test were used for phenotypic detection of PMABL production. Molecular types were determined by a multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Among the 241 isolates, 187 (77.5%) were found to be cefoxitin resistant (K. pneumoniae n=83, E. coli n=104). AmpC activity was detectable in 153 (63.4%) isolates, (K. pneumoniae n=69, E. coli n=84). By PCR, the plasmid encoded AmpC genes were found in 92 (38.1%) isolates and the molecular types of the genes detected predominantly were DHA, CIT followed by MOX and ACC types. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of plasmid-encoded AmpC enzymes was noted in E. coli and K. pneumonia isolates obtained from different parts of the country. Phenotypic methods alone may not reflect the true number of PMABL producers. Genotypic methods need to be employed in national surveillance studies.
