A 60-year-old female came to our hospital with defective vision due to persistent diabetic macular edema and was treated with intravitreal ozurdex implant in the right eye. Three days later, the patient presented with diminution of vision, ocular pain, congestion, and hypopyon with no fundus view. B-scan ultrasonography showed vitritis, and diagnosis of endophthalmitis was made. Subsequently, 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy was performed along with intravitreal vancomycin and amikacin and removal of implant. On culture, there was growth of coagulase-negative staphylococcus which was resistant to ofloxacin antibiotic. A week following treatment, there was significant improvement in the patient's sign and symptoms with improvement in vision. Our case demonstrated that acute endophthalmitis can occur following dexamethasone intravitreal implant.
