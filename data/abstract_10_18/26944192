Tigecycline (TIG) resistance is a growing concern because this antibiotic is regarded as one of the last resorts to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria. Information regarding TIG-resistant Escherichia coli isolates is scarce. In this study, we report the emergence of high-level TIG resistance in a longitudinal series of XDR E. coli isolates collected during TIG treatment. Whole-genome sequencing was performed for six E. coli strains harbouring bla(NDM-5) and genomic comparison revealed two amino acid substitutions. Mutation in rpsJ could be a significant factor conferring TIG resistance in these isolates. The fitness cost of TIG resistance in resistant strains was evaluated by determining the relative growth rate, indicating that TIG resistance reduced fitness by ca. 7%. This study is the first report to demonstrate high-level TIG resistance in E. coli in vivo. In addition, we report the first treatment-emergent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) development of TIG from 1mg/L to 64 mg/L in E. coli. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of an increase in the MIC of TIG under therapy.
