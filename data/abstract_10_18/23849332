Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 530) were collected from 20 hospitals in different parts of Taiwan from 2006 to 2010. MICs to 16 antimicrobial agents were determined by broth dilution method and serotypes were identified by latex agglutination. Based on meningitis (non-meningitis) criteria established by the CLSI, 11.7% (63.2%) of all isolates were susceptible to penicillin and 46.0% (83.8%) were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Of the isolates, 94.3% were non-susceptible to azithromycin and 5.8% and 7.2% were non-susceptible to moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, respectively. Susceptibility to penicillin by meningitis criteria increased significantly (P = 0.0012) with year, and that to clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid declined significantly (P < 0.05). Six major serotypes were found, namely 19F (24.0%), 23F (18.5%), 14 (13.6%), 6B (12.5%), 19A (7.5%) and 3 (5.1%). Prevalence of serotypes 19F and 14 remained stationary, that of serotype 6B decreased significantly (P < 0.0001) and that of serotype 19A increased significantly (P < 0.0001) with year. The coverage rate of PCV-7 among the pneumococcal isolates declined from 80.5% in 2006 to 50% in 2010 (P < 0.0001) and that of PCV-13 declined from 91.5% in 2009 to 75% in 2010. The non-susceptibility rate to levofloxacin was highest among serotype 23F isolates (13.3%) and lowest among serotype 19A isolates (2.5%). Rates of resistance to the four agents penicillin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin and clindamycin were highest among serotype 19A isolates (70.0%) and 23F isolates (49.0%). All serotype 3 isolates were susceptible to four of the most commonly used antibiotics (penicillin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin and levofloxacin).
