BACKGROUND: Bacterial resistance of Helicobacter pylori to antibiotics is increasing and it often leads to failure of antibiotic treatment. A new sitafloxacin-based triple therapy was developed to counter this situation; the fluoroquinolone sitafloxacin has a low minimum inhibitory concentration for H. pylori. AIM: To investigate the efficacy in Japanese patients of sitafloxacin-based triple therapy and document its efficacy in relation to anti-microbial susceptibility. METHODS: We investigated the efficacy of a 1-week sitafloxicin-based regimen of rabeprazole 10 mg four times daily (q.d.s.), metronidazole 250 mg twice daily (b.d.) and sitafloxacin 100 mg b.d. in 180 H. pylori-positive Japanese patients (first-line treatment: n = 45, second-line; n = 41, third-line: n = 94). At 8 weeks, patients were given the (13) C-urea breath test to assess eradication status. RESULTS: Eradication rate was 92.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 87.3-95.7%, 166/180] in intention-to-treat analysis. Although the eradication rate was higher in patients treated with first-line therapy [45/45 (100%, 95% CI: 83.4-100%)] than in those with second- [38/41 (92.7%, 80.1-98.5%)] or third-line therapy [83/94 (88.3%, 80.0-94.0%)], no significant differences were noted with respect to the number of previous therapy attempts (P = 0.054). Eradication rates in patients infected with sensitive- and resistant strains to metronidazole were 96.6% (28/29) and 96.3% (77/80) (P = 0.941), respectively, while rates were 98.4% (60/61) in sitafloxacin-sensitive and 50.0% (1/2) in sitafloxacin resistant strains (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Sitofloxacin-based triple therapy with metronidazole b.d. and rabeprazole q.d.s. achieved an eradication rate exceeding 88%, irrespective of eradication history, CYP2C19 genotype, or metronidazole resistance status.
