Daptomycin non-susceptible Enterococcus (DNSE) is an emerging clinical problem. Little is known about how de novo DNSE infections develop or the risk factors associated with them. Determining risk factors associated with de novo DNSE infections will aid in understanding the mechanisms of daptomycin non-susceptibility. Humans in contact with animals worldwide are at risk of carriage of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Herein, I review the scientific evidence that supports the hypothesis that transport of daptomycin non-susceptibility genes between animals and humans may be a possible mechanism for development of de novo daptomycin non-susceptibility in enterococci.
