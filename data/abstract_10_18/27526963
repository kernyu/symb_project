The steady rise in antimicrobial resistance poses a severe threat to global public health by hindering treatment of an escalating spectrum of infections. We have previously established the potent activity of alpha-MSH, a 13 residue antimicrobial peptide, against the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we sought to determine whether an increase in cationic charge in alpha-MSH could contribute towards improving its staphylocidal potential by increasing its interaction with anionic bacterial membranes. For this we designed novel alpha-MSH analogues by replacing polar uncharged residues with lysine and alanine. Similar to alpha-MSH, the designed peptides preserved turn/random coil conformation in artificial bacterial mimic 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho- rac-(1-glycerol) (7:3, w/w) vesicles and showed preferential insertion in the hydrophobic core of anionic membranes. Increased cationic charge resulted in considerable augmentation of antibacterial potency against MSSA and MRSA. With ~18-fold better binding than alpha-MSH to bacterial mimic vesicles, the most charged peptide KKK-MSH showed enhanced membrane permeabilization and depolarization activity against intact S. aureus. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed a membrane disruptive mode of action for KKK-MSH. Overall, increasing the cationic charge improved the staphylocidal activity of alpha-MSH without compromising its cell selectivity. The present study would help in designing more effective alpha-MSH-based peptides to combat clinically relevant staphylococcal infections.
