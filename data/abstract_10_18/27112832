Clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii complex (1312), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (464), and Burkholderia cepacia species complex (30) were selected from medical centers in the United States (USA), Europe and the Mediterranean (EU-M) region, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. Only one isolate per infected patient episode was included and local identifications were confirmed by the monitoring laboratory. Susceptibility testing was performed at the monitoring laboratory using the reference broth microdilution method as described by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). A. baumannii complex were classified as MDR (multi-drug resistant [MDR]; nonsusceptible to >/=1 agent in >/=3 antimicrobial classes) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR; nonsusceptible to >/=1 agent in all but </=2 antimicrobial classes). A total of 81.6% of A. baumannii complex were MDR. Colistin was the most active agent against MDR A. baumannii complex. Minocycline was the most active "tetracycline" against these organisms based on susceptibility. Against B. cepacia, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC90, 2 mug/mL; 100.0% susceptible) was the most active agent tested. Overall, minocycline was the most active tetracycline tested against A. baumannii complex and S. maltophilia isolates collected from patients throughout EU-M, USA, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific. Minocycline, particularly the intravenous formulation, has activity against several ESKAPE pathogens and merits consideration in seriously ill patients where treatment options may be limited due to the presence of MDR bacteria.
