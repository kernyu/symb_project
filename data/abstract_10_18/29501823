Since the plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance gene mcr-1 was first reported in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in China, only one mcr-1-positive isolate of Shigella sonnei, containing inactivated mcr-1, has been reported worldwide. Here, we screened 1650 historical S. sonnei strains isolated from 2003 to 2015 in China for mcr-1. We determined the antimicrobial susceptibilities and resistance genes of mcr-1-positive isolates and investigated the transferability of polymyxin resistance by plasmid conjugation. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, plasmid profiles, and Southern blot were used to analyze genetic relationships and plasmid characteristics, and mcr-1-positive plasmids were sequenced. In total, we identified six mcr-1-positive S. sonnei isolates from Shanghai (2010-2012) with polymyxin B resistance (MIC 4-8 mug/mL). Four of these exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR), including resistance to azithromycin and third-generation cephalosporins, and co-harbored blaCTX-M-14, mph (A), and blaTEM on different plasmids. Mcr-1-positive plasmids shared highly similar IncI2 backbones that resembled reference plasmids, although some differences were observed, including various and abundant insertion sequences/patterns (IS1294, IS1, and ISApl1) and a diverse recombination shufflon region. Mcr-1 in S. sonnei may date back to mid-2006. For the first time, we report the presence of active mcr-1 in MDR S. sonnei in China, which has existed since at least 2010. Our study highlights the diverse mobile genetic elements on mcr-1-harboring plasmids, potentially resulting in high rates of mcr-1 horizontal transfer among Enterobacteriaceae. Our findings emphasize the importance of continuous national and international surveillance of mcr-1-positive Shigella and changes in antibiotic resistance patterns.
