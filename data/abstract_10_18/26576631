INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health concern. And while there are treatments already on the market, there is a demand for new drugs that are effective and safe against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which reduce the number of drugs and the duration of treatment in both drug-susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). AREA COVERED: This review covers promising novel investigational TB drugs that are currently under development. Specifically, the authors review the efficacy of novel agents for the treatment of TB in preclinical, phase I and phase II clinical trials. The authors also review the safety and tolerability profiles of these drugs. EXPERT OPINION: Bedaquiline and delamanid are the most promising novel drugs for the treatment of MDR-TB, each having high efficacy and tolerability. However, the best regimen for achieving better outcomes and reducing adverse drug reactions remains to be determined, with safety concerns regarding cardiac events due to QT prolongation still to be addressed. Pretomanid is a novel drug that potentially shortens the duration of treatment in both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB in combination with moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide. Linezolid shows marked efficacy in the treatment of MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), but the drug is known to cause significant adverse drug reactions, including peripheral neuropathy, optic neuropathy and myelosuppression. These adverse reactions must be considered prior to prescribing long-term usage of this drug.
