The present clinical immunological study included 90 women of reproductive age presenting with mycoplasma infection of the lower urogenital tract. Low-frequency ultrasonic radiation was shown to successfully correct the disbalance in the system of congenital immunity that manifested itself as marked dysfunction of neutrophil granulocytes. The local application of low-frequency ultrasonic radiation normalized concentration of neutrophil defensins in cervical secretion as well as the number and function of neutrophils themselves.
