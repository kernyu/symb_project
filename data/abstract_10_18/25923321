Pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by progressive increases in resistance and pressure in the pulmonary artery and Cor pulmonale. The effect of exercise on hydrogen peroxide-dependent signaling in the right ventricle (RV) of Cor pulmonale rats was analyzed. Rats were divided into sedentary control (SC), sedentary monocrotaline (SM), trained control (TC), and trained monocrotaline (TM) groups. Rats underwent exercise training (60% of VO2 max) for 5 weeks, with 3 weeks after monocrotaline injection (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Pulmonary resistance was enhanced in SM (2.0-fold) compared with SC. Pulmonary artery pressure was increased in SM (2.7-fold) and TM (2.6-fold) compared with their respective controls (SC and TC). RV hypertrophy indexes increased in SM compared with SC. Hydrogen peroxide was higher in SM (1.7-fold) than SC and was reduced by 47% in TM compared with SM. p-Akt was increased in TM (2.98-fold) compared with SM. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase 3 were also increased (2.9-fold and 3.9-fold, respectively) in SM compared with SC. Caspase 3 was decreased in TM compared with SM (P < 0.05). Therefore, exercise training promoted a beneficial response by decreasing hydrogen peroxide concentrations, and consequently, apoptotic signaling in RV.
