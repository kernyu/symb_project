OBJECTIVE: To study the status of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Ningxia, and therefore to provide scientific data for tuberculosis control in this area. METHODS: Drug sensitivity tests were carried out by sputum culture and the proportional method in all patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis from April 2014 to April 2013 in Ningxia. Statistical analysis was performed with chi(2)-test. RESULTS: This survey included 2 369 cases (1 177 males, 1 192 females), aged 12 to 80 years (mean 51 +/- 21). There were 1 176 patients of Han nationality, 844 Hui nationality , and 349 other nationalities. Cases with initial treatment were 2 255, and those with retreatment were 114. A total of 665 isolates were obtained. The total drug resistance rate was 26.6% (177 cases); the initial drug resistant rate was 20.2% (119/590 cases), while the acquired resistant rate was 77.3% (58/75 cases). The rate of single drug resistance was 11.7%(78/665 cases), MDR was 7.8%(52/665 cases), and multiple drug resistance was 7.1%(47/665 cases). In different areas, ethnic minority, drug-resistant bacterial classification, the rate of initial and retreatment resistance were statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistant tuberculosis prevention and control in Ningxia should be focused on newly diagnosed single drug-resistant cases, retreatment multiple-drug resistant cases, and drug resistant cases in minority areas.
