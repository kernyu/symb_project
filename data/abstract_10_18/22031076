INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed at identifying Candida isolates obtained from blood, urine, tracheal secretion, and nail/skin lesions from cases attended at the Hospital Universitario de Londrina over a 3-year period and at evaluating fluconazole susceptibilities of the isolates. METHODS: Candida isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using species-specific forward primers. The in vitro fluconazole susceptibility test was performed according to EUCAST-AFST reference procedure. RESULTS: Isolates were obtained from urine (53.4%), blood cultures (19.2%), tracheal secretion (17.8%), and nail/skin lesions (9.6%). When urine samples were considered, prevalence was similar in women (45.5%) and in men (54.5%) and was high in the age group >61 years than that in younger ones. For blood samples, prevalence was high in neonates (35%) and advanced ages (22.5%). For nail and skin samples, prevalence was higher in women (71.4%) than in men (28.6%). Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated in the hospital, but Candida species other than C. albicans accounted for 64% of isolates, including predominantly Candida tropicalis (33.2%) and Candida parapsilosis (19.2%). The trend for non-albicans Candida as the predominant species was noted from all clinical specimens, except from urine samples. All Candida isolates were considered susceptible in vitro to fluconazole with the exception of isolates belonging to the intrinsically less-susceptible species C. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS: Non-albicans Candida species were more frequently isolated in the hospital. Fluconazole resistance was a rare finding in our study.
