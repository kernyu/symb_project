Molecular features of the first carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (KP1 and KP2) from the University Hospital Tahar Sfar, Tunisia, were investigated. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing, S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, Southern blot, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based replicon typing were performed. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemase genes were detected by PCR and sequencing. Both isolates were multidrug resistant. KP1 was of sequence type (ST) ST101 and exhibited blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM-1 on an untypeable plasmid and blaOXA-48 on an IncL/M plasmid. KP2 was genetically unrelated to KP1 (ST147) and harbored an IncA/C plasmid carrying blaCMY-4 and the blaOXA-48 derivative gene: blaOXA-204. This study reports the second case worldwide of an OXA-204-producing K. pneumoniae isolate from the same country, however, in a different genetic background.
