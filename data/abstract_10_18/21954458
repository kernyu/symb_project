OBJECTIVES: To compare the activity of tedizolid (formally known as torezolid and TR-700) with that of 15 agents against a collection of linezolid-resistant staphylococci (164 coagulase-negative staphylococci and 5 Staphylococcus aureus). METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using the broth microdilution method following the recommendations of the CLSI. RESULTS: All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and tigecycline. Based on the MIC(90) values, the potency of tedizolid against coagulase-negative staphylococci was >16-fold greater than that of linezolid. Tedizolid retained activity against most of the linezolid-resistant staphylococci tested, including multidrug-resistant isolates with elevated linezolid MICs (32 to >128 mg/L). Of the isolates, 79.2% and 31.4% were inhibited by tedizolid at </= 4 mg/L and </= 2 mg/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm the activity of tedizolid against linezolid-resistant staphylococci. This new oxazolidinone could have an important role as a potential therapeutic agent against multidrug-resistant staphylococci.
