The article deals with the results of study of sensitivity of strains of Corinebacterium non diphtheriae circulating in Rostov-on-Don and Rostov oblast to antibacterial preparations. The strains of Corinebacterium non diphtheriae isolated from urogenital tract (C. xerosis, C. pseudotuberculosis. C. amycolatum, C. striatum) are analyzed. The sample of 41 strains of C. non diphtheriae was used to detect the sensitivity to 9 antibacterial preparations. The technique of serial dilutions in liquid growth medium was applied. The range of variations (minimal suppressive concentration) of preparations as related to C. non diphtheriae made up 0.003-20.0 mkg/ ml. The results demonstrated that C. non diphtheriae are: highly sensitive to gentamycin, vancomycin and cefotaxime: sensitive to rifampicinum; and resistant to lincomicyn. In all analyzed strains of Corinebacterium non diphtheriae the greatest indicators of minimal suppressive concentration are detected in lincomicyn and at that the maximal indicator was for C. striatum and consisted 11.52 +/- 2.26 mkg/ml.
