INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on root fracture with respect to various concentrations at different time exposures. METHODS: A total of 48 mandibular incisors were selected. Eight nonprepared roots were selected as a negative control. The remaining 40 specimens were instrumented with rotary files and randomly assigned to one of the following groups for final irrigation: (1) 10 mL distilled water for 10 minutes (positive control); (2) 10 mL of 17% EDTA for 1 minute + 10 mL of 1% NaOCl for 1 minute; (3) 10 mL of 5% EDTA for 1 minute + 10 mL of 1% NaOCl for 1 minute; (4) 10 mL of 17% EDTA for 10 minutes + 10 mL of 1% NaOCl for 1 minute; (5) 10 mL of 5% EDTA for 10 minutes + 10 mL of 1% NaOCl for 1 minute. Thereafter, the root canals were filled by using AH26 root canal sealer with a single-cone technique. The specimens were loaded vertically at 1 mm/min crosshead speed until vertical root fracture occurred. Results were evaluated statistically with 1-way analysis of variance and Student's t test. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were detected among the groups (P < .05). The highest mean fracture resistance was obtained from the group treated with 5% EDTA for 10 minutes. This is about 2 times more than the weakest mean fracture resistance, which was obtained from the 17% EDTA-10 minute group. CONCLUSIONS: The fracture resistances of endodontically treated roots were found to be differently affected by the various concentrations of EDTA at different time exposures.
