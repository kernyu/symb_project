Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most critical causes of healthcare-related or community-related infections. Resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics makes MRSA a big threat to clinical treatment. Utilization of low efficiency antibiotics such as vancomycin and teicoplanin makes new choices for therapies. Recently, much researchhas shed light on relevance between genetic mutations of MRSA and clinical characteristics such as antibiotic resistance, and virulence. These findings could contribute to development of novel antibiotics and vaccines.
