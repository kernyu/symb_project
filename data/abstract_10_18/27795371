The in vitro activities of two novel azole compounds (aryl-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylthio analogues of fluconazole [ATTAFs]) and five comparator antifungal agents against 52 clinical Candida isolates from 5 different species were determined. The novel azole compounds had the lowest geometric mean MICs, followed by fluconazole. Moreover, combinations of these compounds with fluconazole exhibited synergistic effects against fluconazole-susceptible (22 of 23 isolates), fluconazole-susceptible dose-dependent (10 of 13 isolates), and fluconazole-resistant (1 of 16 isolates) Candida isolates.
