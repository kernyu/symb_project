Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Constitutive overexpression of 11beta-HSD1 in adipose tissue in mice leads to metabolic syndrome. In the process of generating transgenic mice overexpressing 11beta-HSD1 in an inducible manner, we found a metabolic syndrome phenotype in control, transgenic mice, expressing the reverse tetracycline-transactivator (rtTA) in adipose tissue. The control mice exhibited all four sequelae of metabolic syndrome (visceral obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), a pro-inflammatory state and marked hepatic steatosis. Gene expression profiling of the adipose tissue, muscle and liver of these mice revealed changes in expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Transient transfection of rtTA, but not tTS, into 3T3-L1 cells resulted in lipid accumulation. We conclude that expression of rtTA in adipose tissue causes metabolic syndrome in mice.
