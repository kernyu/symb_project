AIM: Study of features of interactions of mucosal epitheliocytes of vagina with dominant and associative vaginal microsymbionts in bacterial vaginosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Changes in growth characteristics and ability to form biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus spp. under the influence of secretory products of vaginal epitheliocytes obtained from 36 women with bacterial vaginosis and 32 practically healthy women were studied. RESULTS: Vaginal epitheliocytes of women with bacterial vaginosis were shown to change their functional activity during contact with microorganisms and their secretory products, causing differential influence on the properties of symbiont bacteria. A suppression of growth of dominant microsymbionts--lactobacilli, mostly their peroxide producing biovars, and a weakening of suppressing effect on the growth of biomass of associative microorganisms accompanied by stimulation of their ability to form biofilms was noted. Preliminary contact of an epitheliocyte with bacterial cell or its supernatant increased the intensity of the changes of properties of bacteria under the influence of secretory products of epitheliocytes. CONCLUSION: Suppression of growth of lactobacilli (mostly their peroxide producing biovars) and stimulation of the ability to for biofilms of the associative microorganisms as a result of bacterial-epithelial interactions in bacterial vaginosis determine mechanisms of formation and stability of pathomicrobiocenosis and a reduction of colonization resistance of vaginal biotope.
