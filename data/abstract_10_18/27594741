INTRODUCTION: Bronchopneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation of pneumonia in pediatric population and leading infectious cause of mortality in children under 5 years. Evaluation of treatment involves diagnostic procedures, assessment of disease severity and treatment for disease with an emphasis on vulnerability of the population. AIM: To determine the most commonly used antibiotics at the Pediatric Clinic in Sarajevo and concomitant therapy in the treatment of bronchopneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was retrospective and included a total of 104 patients, hospitalized in pulmonary department of the Pediatric Clinic in the period from July to December 2014. The treatment of bronchopneumonia at the Pediatric Clinic was empirical and it conformed to the guidelines and recommendations of British Thoracic Society. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: First and third generation of cephalosporins and penicillin antibiotics were the most widely used antimicrobials, with parenteral route of administration and average duration of treatment of 4.3 days. Concomitant therapy included antipyretics, corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, agonists of beta2 adrenergic receptor. In addition to pharmacotherapy, hospitalized patients were subjected to a diet with controlled intake of sodium, which included probiotic-rich foods and adequate hydration. Recommendations for further antimicrobial treatment include oral administration of first-generation cephalosporins and penicillin antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Results of the drug treatment of bronchopneumonia at the Pediatric Clinic of the University Clinical Center of Sarajevo are comparable to the guidelines of the British Thoracic Society. It is necessary to establish a system for rational use of antimicrobial agents in order to reduce bacterial resistance.
