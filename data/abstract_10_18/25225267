The adaptation of Porphyromonas gingivalis to H2O2-induced stress while inducible is modulated by an unknown OxyR-independent mechanism. Previously, we reported that the PG_2212 gene was highly upregulated in P. gingivalis under conditions of prolonged oxidative stress. Because this gene may have regulatory properties, its function in response to H2O2 was further characterized. PG2212, annotated as a hypothetical protein of unknown function, is a 10.3-kDa protein with a cysteine 2-histidine 2 (Cys2His2) zinc finger domain. The isogenic mutant P. gingivalis FLL366 (DeltaPG_2212) showed increased sensitivity to H2O2 and decreased gingipain activity compared to the parent strain. Transcriptome analysis of P. gingivalis FLL366 revealed that approximately 11% of the genome displayed altered expression (130 downregulated genes and 120 upregulated genes) in response to prolonged H2O2-induced stress. The majority of the modulated genes were hypothetical or of unknown function, although some are known to participate in oxidative stress resistance. The promoter region of several of the most highly modulated genes contained conserved motifs. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the purified rPG2212 protein did not bind its own promoter region but bound a similar region in several of the genes modulated in the PG_2212-deficient mutant. A metabolome analysis revealed that PG2212 can regulate a number of genes coding for proteins involved in metabolic pathways critical for its survival under the conditions of oxidative stress. Collectively, our data suggest that PG2212 is a transcriptional regulator that plays an important role in oxidative stress resistance and virulence regulation in P. gingivalis.
