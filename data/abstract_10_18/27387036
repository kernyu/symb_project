The mcr-1 gene was found in 11 isolates from a Portuguese Salmonella collection (n=1,010; 58 serotypes; 2002-15) of clinical samples, foodstuff, food-animals and water. Mcr-1 has been located on different plasmids (IncX4/IncHI2) in pig-associated multidrug-resistant, copper-tolerant S.1,4,[5],12:i:-/ST34 and S. Rissen/ST469 clones from human and pork products since at least 2011. Our data highlight dissemination of mcr-1 by successful resistant clones in Europe and raise questions about the efficacy of copper-based interventions to reduce colistin use.
