Autophagy, an important homeostatic cellular recycling mechanism, has emerged as a novel cytoprotective mechanism to increase tumor cell survival through escaping chemotherapyinduced cell death. To explore whether autophagy plays a protective role in the resistance to the tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL), we evaluated the autophagy levels in TRAILsensitive MDAMB231 breast cancer cell lines and in TRAILrefractory MDAMB231 cells before and after TRAIL treatment. After treatment with 40 ng/ml TRAIL, TRAILsensitized MDAMB231 parental cells expressed higher level of LC3B protein and accumulated more autophagic vacuoles. Compared with TRAILsensitive MDAMB231, MDAMB231 TRAILrefractory cells showed higher levels of the lipidated form of LC3B and decreased p62/SQSTM1 protein expression, characterizing the occurrence of increased autophagic flux in TRAILrefractory cells. Electron microscopy and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) autophagyspecific fluorescence staining analyses also revealed that the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles was drastically higher in TRAILrefractory MDAMB231 parental cells. We demonstrated that chloroquine (CQ) and 2(4morpholinyl)8phenylchromone (LY294002) could effectively reduce TRAILrefractory breast cancer cell viability. Combination of TRAIL with CQ could effectively reverse the resistance of MDAMB231 TRAILrefractory cells to TRAIL. Knockdown of light chain 3 (LC3) expression via small interfering RNA (siRNA) similarly resulted in reduced TRAILrefractory cell proliferation and resensitizing to TRAIL. This is the first report showing that breast cancer cells chronically exposed to TRAIL exhibit upregulation of the autophagic activity, indicating that autophagy efficiently protects breast cancer cells from TRAIL. Therapeutic targeting of autophagosome formation could be a novel molecular avenue to reduce the resistance of TRAIL in breast cancer.
