Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm) strain Afade had previously been shown to undergo spontaneous phase variations between an opaque capsulated variant and a translucent (TR) variant devoid of a capsule but able to secrete cell-free exopolysaccharides. This phase variation is associated with an ON/OFF genetic switch in a glucose permease gene. In this study, in vivo and in vitro assays were conducted to compare the virulence of the two variants and their abilities to resist host defence. Capsulated variants were shown, in a mouse model, to induce longer bacteraemia that was correlated with better serum resistance in vitro. In contrast, TR variants displayed better ability to adhere to an inert support, linked to the absence of a capsule, changes in cell surface hydrophobicity and increased resistance to antimicrobial peptide and hydrogen peroxide. The switch from one variant population to another, which was observed both in vivo and in vitro under stress conditions, is further discussed as a means for Mmm to modulate its interactions with animal hosts during different stages of the disease.
