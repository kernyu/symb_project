Extensive use of antimicrobial agents in finfish farming and the consequent selective pressure lead to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance in aquaculture environment bacteria. Vibrio genus represents one of the main pathogens affecting gilthead sea bream. The development of antibiotic resistance by Vibrio represents a potential threat to human health by exchange of resistant genes to human pathogens through food chain. The objective of the present study was to conduct a multisite survey on the antibiotic resistance of Vibrio spp. isolated from gilthead sea bream reared in Italian mariculture. Vibrio spp. strains were isolated from skin, gills, muscles and intestinal content of 240 gilthead sea bream. A random selection of 150 strains was sequenced for species identification. Resistance against 15 antimicrobial agents was tested by the broth microdilution method. Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio alginolyticus accounted for 36.7% and 33.3% of the isolates respectively. 96% of the strains showed multiple resistance to the tested drugs, with two strains, Vibrio aestuarianus and Vibrio harveyi resistant to 10 and 9 antibiotics, respectively. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin and sulfadiazine showed low efficacy against Vibrio spp. Rational use of antimicrobial agents and surveillance on antibiotic administration may reduce the acquisition of resistance by microorganisms of aquatic ecosystems.
