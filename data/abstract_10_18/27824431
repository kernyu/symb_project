Background:Helicobacter pylori is a prevalent pathogen which is considered as an etiological cause for gastroduodenal ulcers, and a substantial risk factor for gastric malignancies. The vital factor to take into account is that roughly half of the world's population is infected with this bacterium. However, most subjects colonized remain asymptomatic and do not require any treatment. Several antimicrobial agents such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole are used to eradicate the infection. However, these drug regiments do not eradicate H. pylori in all patients because of the anti-drug resistance. Aim: In this review we aim to discuss the role and mechanisms of probiotics, as supportive medicines, in management of H. pylori infection. Methods: We have reviewed the published articles in PubMed and Medline databases. Also, abstracts presented in international conferences on the management of H. pylori infections and treatment protocol, have been thoroughly reviewed. Results: The overall trend in the literature indicates the usefulness of probiotics in controlling H. pylori infection. This bacterium is among the most studied human pathogens regarding the efficacy of probiotics for treating its infection. Nevertheless, some studies suggest that probiotics do not efficiently eradicate H. pylori but retain the number of this bacterium at low levels inside the human stomach. Conclusion: The analyzed literature suggest that when probiotics are consumed in conjunction with antibiotics, the eradication rate may be improved through modulating the immune response and decreasing the adverse effects of routine drugs leading to gastroprotection.
