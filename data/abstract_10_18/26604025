Baicalin is a flavonoid purified from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. It possesses a variety of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and neuro-protective properties, and provides protection against cerebral hemorrhage. However, it is seldom considered a therapeutic in mental disorders. Recent studies showed that baicalin protects cerebral functions against ischemia and has sedative and anxiolytic-like effects. Animal experiments showed that it protects dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, hippocampus and substantia nigra. It also has effects such as anti-depressive and anti-epileptic and offers resistance to Parkinson's disease. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pathogenesis is closely related to dopamine deficiency. However, the therapeutic effect of baicalin in ADHD has not been studied. We hypothesize that baicalin may protect dopaminergic neurons and increase brain dopamine levels, thus serving as an effective novel treatment for ADHD.
