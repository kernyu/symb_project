Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml (100.0% susceptible), respectively, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Telavancin was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 100% susceptible) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), while higher MIC values were obtained against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/ml) and E. faecalis (MIC50/90, >2/>2 mug/ml). Streptococci showed telavancin modal MIC results of </= 0.015 mug/ml, except against Streptococcus agalactiae (i.e., 0.03 mug/ml). This study reestablishes the telavancin spectrum of activity against isolates recovered from the United States (2011-2012) using the revised broth microdilution method.
