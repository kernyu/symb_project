Autophagy occurs in tumor cells acquiring cytotoxic drug resistance and its activation may impair their susceptibility to apoptosis in response to apoptogen agents. We investigated the pro-apoptotic effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on MM cell lines (U266, INA-6, LR5-8226, LIG, and MCC2) and primary malignant plasma cells from naive and refractory/relapsed patients. We evaluated the transcriptional and ultrastructural events leading to autophagy by measuring Beclin-1 and p62 levels and transmission electronic microscopy. Autophagy was inhibited by hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), whereas the ability of Dex-resistant MM cells to recover the susceptibility to apoptosis was measured. A direct relationship between autophagy and Beclin-1 or LC3/Atg8 levels was observed, whereas their mRNAs were inversely correlated to p62 expression. Starvation strongly activated autophagy by inducing cellular, transcriptional, and ultrastructural modifications that were reversed by HCQ. Taken together, these data suggest that autophagy is a potential mechanism leading to drug resistance in MM, and suggest Beclin-1 and p62 as early markers of cell susceptibility to apoptosis. The combination of HCQ with novel agents may thus be considered to improve the therapeutic response in relapsed/resistant MM patients.
