Salmonella spp. is a foodborne pathogen that causes zoonotic disease worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolated from turkey farms in Taiwan. During the past 2 yr, 243 strains of Salmonella were isolated from 2,040 samples (11.9%) from turkey farms, including 32.5% (52/160) from the intestines of 12-day-old turkey poults, 14.2% (119/840) from feces collected from the turkey growing periods, and 6.9% (72/1,040) from finishing periods. S. Albany (35.0%, 85/243), S. Schwarzengrund (23.0%, 56/243), and S. Hadar (19.3%, 47/243) were the most common serovars on turkey farms. For these strains, a high frequency of resistance was observed against florfenicol (97.5%), oxytetracycline (89.3%), doxycycline (78.6%), colistin (77.8%), ampicillin (75.7%), amoxicillin (75.3%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.7%), chloramphenicol (69.1%), and nalidixic acid (67.9%). floR (63.8%), tet (A) (60.5%), blaPSE (57.6%), blaTEM (42.0%), blaCTX-M (34.2%), cmlA (34.2%), and tet (D) (29.2%) were the most common resistance genes found in this study. The int1 gene was identified in 72.4% (176/243) of Salmonella isolates in which the conserved region 3' of class 1 integrons also was amplified, whereas none had the int2 gene. This study demonstrates that imported and fattening turkeys could be a reservoir for Salmonella isolates resistant to multiple antimicrobials. These results also reinforce the need to develop strategies and implement specific control procedures to reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance.
