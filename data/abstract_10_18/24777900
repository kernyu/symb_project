OBJECTIVES: Daptomycin has demonstrated synergy with beta-lactams against Enterococcus faecium and this combination has been used successfully to treat infections refractory to daptomycin. We investigated daptomycin alone and combined with ceftriaxone against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic simulated endocardial vegetation (SEV) model. METHODS: Daptomycin (6 and 12 mg/kg/day) with and without 2 g of ceftriaxone every 24 h were evaluated against two clinical E. faecium strains (8019 and 5938) and one Enterococcus faecalis (6981) in a 96 h in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic SEV model. FITC-labelled poly-l-lysine was used to assess beta-lactam-induced changes in cell surface charge. RESULTS: For 8019 and 6981, daptomycin 6 mg/kg with ceftriaxone and daptomycin 12 mg/kg alone and in combination with ceftriaxone displayed significantly more activity than daptomycin 6 mg/kg alone from 48 to 96 h (P </= 0.005). The addition of ceftriaxone significantly enhanced activity of daptomycin 6 mg/kg against both strains at 96 h (8019, reductions -0.55 versus 3.64 log10 cfu/g; 6981, reductions 1.11 versus 5.67 log10 cfu/g; P < 0.001) and improved daptomycin 12 mg/kg against 8019 at 96 h. Daptomycin 12 mg/kg plus ceftriaxone displayed no appreciable activity against 5938 (daptomycin MIC 32 mg/L). Daptomycin non-susceptibility developed in 8019 and 6981 versus daptomycin 6 mg/kg by 96 h. Ampicillin or ceftriaxone exposure reduced daptomycin surface charge in 8019, resulting in significantly increased FITC-poly-l-lysine binding. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of daptomycin and ceftriaxone may be promising for eradicating high-inoculum, deep-seated enterococcal infections. Further research is warranted to examine the enhancement of daptomycin and innate immunity killing of VRE by ceftriaxone and other beta-lactams.
