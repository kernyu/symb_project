Among gonococcal isolates examined at the Hawaii State Laboratory Division from 2003 to 2011, the prevalence of elevated cefixime minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs; >/=0.064 mug/mL) and elevated cefpodoxime MICs (>/=0.19 mug/mL) increased over time. In contrast, few isolates exhibited elevated ceftriaxone MICs (>/=0.094 mug/mL), and the prevalence of elevated ceftriaxone MICs did not change.
