NDM-1 is a new metallo-beta-lactamase that readily hydrolyses carbapenems, penicillins and cephalosporins. Its rising incidence has been reported in many countries around the world, with many cases linked to a possible origin from the Indian subcontinent. Due to the lack of effective antibiotic regimes to treat these infections, the increased prevalence of NDM-1 is alarming. We describe a case of NDM-1 infection in an immunocompromised foreign patient, and discuss its implications.
