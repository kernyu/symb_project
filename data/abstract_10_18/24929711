Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Salmonella enterica have been reported worldwide. However, research on foodborne ESBL-producing Salmonella has been rarely conducted. One hundred and thirty eight ceftriaxone or/and cefoperazone-resistant Salmonella strains recovered from retail foods in Shaanxi and Henan Province, China, were screened for ESBL. The ESBL-producing strains were further characterized for antimicrobial resistance, pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles, and the presence of blaTEM, blaSHV, blaOXA, blaCTX-M, and blaPSE. The transferability of ESBL encoding genes to a susceptible Escherichia coli strain was also investigated. Thirty (21.7%) isolates were identified as ESBL positive and belonged to S. enterica serovars Indiana, Shubra, Typhimurium, and Enteritidis. S. Indiana and S. Shubra isolates were firstly identified in ESBL-producing strains. Great genetic diversity was seen among these ESBL-producing strains. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that blaTEM-1B was the only ESBL-encoding gene among the genes tested and was detected in 26 of 30 strains and was carried in the conjugative plasmids. The blaTEM-1B gene was transferable through conjugation at rates ranging from 4.71 x 10(-7) to 7.55 x 10(-6) transconjugant per recipient cell. This study provides the evidence of foodborne ESBL-producing Salmonella, and the transferability of plasmid harboring ESBL-encoding genes could possibly contribute to the dissemination of ESBL.
