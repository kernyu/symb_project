Two salts of the mesoionic compounds 1,4-diphenyl-5-(5-nitro-2-furanyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazolium-2-thiol chloride (MC-1) and 4-phenyl-5-(5-nitro-2-furanyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazolium-2-phenylamine chloride (MC-2) were synthesized utilizing 1,4-diphenyl-thiosemicarbazide and 5-nitro-2-furoyl chloride as starting materials. Their structures were characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, (1)(3)C-NMR and elemental analysis. These compounds were analyzed for their influence on the effectiveness of norfloxacin, tetracycline, and erythromycin (standard antibiotics) against resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. MC-1 and MC-2, at sub-inhibitory concentrations of 16 mug/mL, favourably modulated the antibiotic activity of tetracycline by 16- and 32-fold, respectively (MIC), and that of erythromycin by 4-fold.
