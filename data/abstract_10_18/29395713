Susceptibility testing of ceftobiprole and comparators against 12,240 isolates was performed following CLSI/EUCAST guidelines. The percentage of susceptible MRSA isolates was higher for ceftobiprole (96.5% susceptible) than for ceftaroline (86.2% susceptible). Both ceftobiprole (MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mg/L) and ceftaroline (MIC50/90, 0.25/1 mg/L) demonstrated potent activity against coagulase-negative staphylococci. Ceftobiprole demonstrated good potency against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90 values of 0.5/2 mg/L); ceftaroline (MIC50/90, 2/8 mg/L) was 4-fold less active against these strains. Ceftobiprole activity was comparable to that of the other beta-lactam agents tested against S. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.5 mg/L vs 0.12-2 mg/L [other beta-lactams]), viridans-group streptococci (MIC90,0.25 mg/L vs 0.006-1 mg/L [other beta-lactams]), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC90,0.03 mg/L vs 0.015-0.06 mg/L [other beta-lactams]). Overall, 73.8% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates tested were susceptible to ceftobiprole. Ceftobiprole inhibited 70.4% of P. aeruginosa at </=4 mg/L and all isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis at </= 0.5 mg/L. Ceftobiprole was active in vitro against a broad range of clinically-relevant contemporary Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial isolates.
