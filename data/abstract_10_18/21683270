The constitutive or inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) phenotype of 30 erm(B)-positive Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was determined by different methods and under various growth conditions and correlated to the sequence of the 5'-untranslated regions of erm(B). The MLS phenotype of one-third of the isolates could not be classified. In liquid medium, some of these isolates responded to induction only during the logarithmic phase of growth, while others expressed clindamycin resistance even under noninducing conditions. By increasing the growth rate, we observed a shift from a constitutive towards an inducible pattern of resistance. All data were confirmed by analysis of the 23S rRNA methylation level. The erm(B)-5'-untranslated region was 99% similar in sequence. In erm(B)-positive S. pyogenes, the MLS phenotype is strongly influenced by culture conditions and control of its expression does not depend exclusively on the sequence of the erm(B)-5'-untranslated region.
