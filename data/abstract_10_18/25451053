The development of direct-acting antiviral agents is a promising therapeutic advance in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, rapid emergence of drug resistance can limit efficacy and lead to cross-resistance among members of the same drug class. ABT-450 is an efficacious inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease, with 50% effective concentration values of 1.0, 0.21, 5.3, 19, 0.09, and 0.69 nM against stable HCV replicons with NS3 protease from genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a, and 6a, respectively. In vitro, the most common amino acid variants selected by ABT-450 in genotype 1 were located in NS3 at positions 155, 156, and 168, with the D168Y variant conferring the highest level of resistance to ABT-450 in both genotype 1a and 1b replicons (219- and 337-fold, respectively). In a 3-day monotherapy study with HCV genotype 1-infected patients, ABT-450 was coadministered with ritonavir, a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor shown previously to markedly increase peak, trough, and overall drug exposures of ABT-450. A mean maximum HCV RNA decline of 4.02 log10 was observed at the end of the 3-day dosing period across all doses. The most common variants selected in these patients were R155K and D168V in genotype 1a and D168V in genotype 1b. However, selection of resistant variants was significantly reduced at the highest ABT-450 dose compared to lower doses. These findings were informative for the subsequent evaluation of ABT-450 in combination with additional drug classes in clinical trials in HCV-infected patients.
