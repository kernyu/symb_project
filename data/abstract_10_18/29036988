Objective: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of S.paratyphi A strains in Zhengzhou city isolated from sentinel hospitals in 2013-2015. Methods: According to Salmonella molecular typing and K-B drug susceptibility testing method published by international PulseNet bacterial infectious disease monitoring network and USA Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI2015), we analyzed drug sensitivity and PFGE molecular characteristics of 67 S.paratyphi A strains(11 strains in 2013, 7 strains in 2014, 49 strains in 2015) isolated from blood and stool samples in two sentinel hospitals of fever with rash syndrome surveillance system established in Zhengzhou city in 2013-2015. Results: The results showed 67 strains of S.paratyphi A had different levels of resistance to 13 kinds of antibiotics, 65 strains were multi-drug resistant strains (97.0%), 5 isolates were resistant to 2-3 kinds of antibiotics (7.5%), 41 isolates were resistant to 5-8 kinds of antibiotics (61.2%),11 isolates were resistant to 9-10 kinds of antibiotics(16.4%),8 isolates were resistant to 11-12 kinds of antibiotics(11.9%). 67 strains of S.paratyphi A were divided into 10 molecular patterns(PTYA1-PTYA10) by digestion with Xba restriction endonuclease and pulsed field gel electrophoresis, each pattern contains 1-48 strains with similarity ranged from 94.31%-100%. PTYA3 contained 48 strains, which was predominant band type; PTYA1, 9 contained 6 strains; PTYA 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 contained 1 strains among them. Conclusion: The status of drug resistance of clinical isolates of S.paratyphi A in Zhengzhou city was rather serious, PFGE patterns showed diversity and dominant characteristics. The PFGE patterns of partial strains and its corresponding anti-drug spectrum have certain relevance and cluster relationship.
