Faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRTs) were performed on 21 goat farms in Guadeloupe (FWI). Anthelmintic resistance (AR) to netobimin (benzimidazole) was found in all 15 herds in which it was tested. AR to ivermectin (avermectin) and levamisole (imidazothiazole) were also very largely spread (14 out of 17 farms and 7 out of 9 farms, respectively). AR to the final moxidectin (milbemycin) released was already present in 2 out of 9 farms in which it was tested. Haemonchus was the dominant genus of gastrointestinal nematodes and was more frequently found to be resistant to netobimin, ivermectin and moxidectin than Trichostrongylus, the latter appeared to be more often resistant to levamisole. A first survey 15 years ago revealed only AR to benzimidazoles and one suspected case of AR to ivermectin.
