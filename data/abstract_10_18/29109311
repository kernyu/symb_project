AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lemon, ginger, garlic, and honey extracts on Streptococcus mutans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commercially obtained honey, ginger, garlic, and lemon were included in the study to evaluate its efficacy in isolation and in combination against S. mutans. The efficacies of extracts were tested using well diffusion method, and its effect was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition around the well. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts was carried out individually and compared considering triplicates of all the extracts. RESULTS: When individual comparison of the extracts was made, garlic showed greatest antimicrobial activity with a mean zone of inhibition (34.9 +/- 0.58 mm) and honey showed least antimicrobial activity (0.5 +/- 0.6 mm). When combinations of extracts were tested against S. mutans, lemon and garlic combination showed the greatest zone of inhibition (27.6 +/- 0.43 mm) compared with other combinations, and ginger + lemon combinations showed the least zone of inhibition (12.6 +/- 0.43 mm). CONCLUSION: This study concluded that garlic showed a greatest antimicrobial effect against S. mutans when compared with other preparations individually and garlic and lemon showed greatest zone of inhibition in combination than other preparations. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Antibiotics and other chemical agents are mainly used to treat the common dental infections. However, due to the excessive use, it can result in antibiotic resistance. Hence, herbal medicines with medicinal values should be replaced with conventional methods.
