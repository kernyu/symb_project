Schistosomiasis, a chronic neglected tropical disease caused by Schistosoma worms, is reported in nearly 80 countries. Although the disease affects approximately 260 million people, the treatment relies exclusively on praziquantel, a drug discovered in the mid-1970s that lacks efficacy against the larval stages of the parasite. In addition, the dependence on a single treatment has raised concerns about drug resistance, and reduced susceptibility has already been found in laboratory and field isolates. Therefore, novel therapies for schistosomiasis are needed, and several approaches have been used to that end. One of these strategies, molecular modeling, has been increasingly integrated with experimental techniques, resulting in the discovery of novel antischistosomal agents.
