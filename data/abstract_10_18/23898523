OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clonal relatedness of local bla(OXA-58)-carrying Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. METHODS: Non-duplicated isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii were collected in West China Hospital and verified by recA sequencing. Acquired bla(OXA-58) gene and natural bla(OXA51/66) genes were detected by PCR. Strain typing for bla(OXA-58)-carrying Acinetobacter baumannii isolates was performed by Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: A total of 115 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were verified by recA gene and bla(OXA-51/6)6 detection. Among them, nine (7.8%) isolates carry bla(OXA-58) with reduced susceptibility to imipenem (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) were observed. ERIC-PCR fingerprints of nine bla(OXA-58)-carrying isolates were highly similar. MLST revealed that eight isolates were ST95 and one isolate was ST75. PFGE showed that eight isolates with the same sequence type were of the same fingerprint types, which were of two closely-related subtypes. CONCLUSION: In West China Hospital, some Acinetobacter baumannii isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenem carried bla(OXA-58). The major spread way of bla(OXA-58)-carrying isolates was clonal dissemination.
