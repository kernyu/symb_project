OBJECTIVES: The "One Health" concept recognizes that the health of humans, animals and the environment are interconnected. Therefore, the knowledge on the behavior of microorganisms from the most diverse environmental niches is important to prevent the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Wild animals are known to carry antimicrobial resistant microorganisms with potential public health impact. However, no data is available on the sessile behavior of bacteria from wild animals, even if antimicrobial resistance is amplified in biofilms. This study characterizes the antimicrobial susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, and the adhesion and biofilm formation abilities of 14 distinct Aeromonas spp. (eight A. salmonicida, three A. eucrenophila, two A. bestiarum and one A. veronii) isolated from wild animals and already characterized as resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin was determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The biofilm formation assay was done according to a modified microtiter plate method. Bacterial surface hydrophobicity was assessed by sessile drop contact angles measurement. RESULTS: All Aeromonas spp. strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentrations between 6 and 60mug/ml) and had hydrophilic surfaces (ranging from 2 and 37mJ/m(2)). These strains were able to adhere and form biofilms with distinct magnitudes. Biofilm exposure to 10 times minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin only caused low to moderate removal. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the strains tested are of potential public health concern and emphasize that wild animals are potential reservoirs of multidrug resistant strains. In fact, Aeromonas species are consistently considered opportunistic pathogens. Moreover, bacterial ability to form biofilms increases antimicrobial resistance and the propensity to cause persistent infections.
