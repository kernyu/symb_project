The aim of this study was to confirm the effect of implementing a hospital-wide project for appropriate use of antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) to reduce the rate of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Fifteen different manuals for each surgical department have been simultaneously implemented since February 2007. Compliance rate was compared between pre- and postintervention periods (3 months for each period). As an effect of this intervention, we analyzed changes in the rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among organisms isolated postoperatively. The number of operations was 1,627 in both periods. Among patients whose surgeries were longer than 3 h in duration, 75% received an additional intraoperative antimicrobial dose in the postintervention period and 23% in the preintervention period (P < 0.001). Although most patients received postoperative AMP with an interval of q12 h in the preintervention period, 63% of the patients received AMP with an interval of q8 h in the postintervention period. The duration of AMP use was reduced from 2.4 +/- 1.9 to 1.6 +/- 1.5 days (P < 0.001). Forty-seven percent of patients discontinued AMP within 24 h and 81% within 48 h. Isolation rates of P. aeruginosa among all gram-negative organisms significantly decreased from 13% (68/538 patients) to 7.3% (37/509 patients) (P = 0.004). Execution of a hospital-wide project to promote the appropriate use of AMP, including shortening the duration of AMP use, was useful to decrease the rate of P. aeruginosa isolated postoperatively.
