Recipients of solid organ transplantation are, because of immunosuppressive therapy, disposed to opportunistic infections including tuberculosis (TB). Spinal TB is a rare complication after transplantation but it is serious with high mortality. We report 3 cases of spinal TB in Chinese recipients of orthotopic liver transplant whose first complaint was back pain. These 3 cases were diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and percutaneous biopsy. After treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol for >1 year, symptoms of 2 patients improved noticeably, but 1 patient died of liver failure and severe mixed pulmonary infection. Diagnosis and treatment regimens of spinal TB are discussed.
