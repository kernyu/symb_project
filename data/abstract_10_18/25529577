INTRODUCTION: Nemonoxacin , a novel non- fl uorinated quinolone, exhibits potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA and fluoroquinolone-resistant MRSA, Gram-negative and atypical pathogens. This agent also has a reduced propensity for resistance development in many kinds of pathogens. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews currently available clinical and in vitro data that support the potential role of nemonoxacin for the treatment of common infectious diseases, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). One recent Phase II trial comparing either 500 mg or 750 mg oral nemonoxacin with 500 mg oral levofloxacin for mild to moderate CAP demonstrated that nemonoxacin had comparable clinical success with levofloxacin. Nemonoxacin showed lower MICs against clinical C. difficile isolates than commercially available fluoroquinolones, making it a potential therapeutic agent if novel formulations are developed to maintain a higher concentration in the human gut. For STDs, nemonoxacin also showed good activity against some common pathogens, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. EXPERT OPINION: Although in vitro studies have shown promising results regarding the susceptibility to nemonoxacin of common pathogens causing CDIs, ABSSSIs and STDs, further clinical trials are needed to prove its efficacy.
