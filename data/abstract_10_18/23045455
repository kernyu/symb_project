Although Staphylococcus aureus can cause a variety of infections, involvement of the biliary tract is rare. We present a middle-aged Caucasian woman who presented with methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia. Subsequent investigation revealed a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis with MRSA-positive specimen cultures. The patient showed clinical improvement after vancomycin therapy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This case adds to the growing list of infections that can be attributed to MRSA.
