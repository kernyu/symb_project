Fusidic acid (FA) activity was evaluated against 2,002 clinical staphylococcal isolates collected in U.S. hospitals during 2014. FA (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml) inhibited 99.8% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at </=1 mug/ml. Only four S. aureus isolates displayed FA values of >2 mug/ml (three strains with fusC and one with an L461K substitution in fusA), and they were isolated from patients in four states. In conclusion, FA demonstrated sustained, potent activity against this recent collection of U.S. staphylococci.
