This study showed that silencing BMP4 expression significantly activated caspase-2, 3, and 9, while decreasing Matrigel colony formation in Cytarabine (Ara-C)-treated leukemia HL-60 cells. In contrast, Ara-C significantly upregulated Atg5 and Beclin-1 expression, the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, and CDK1 and cyclin B1 expression in leukemia cells expressing BMP4. BafA significantly sensitized the apoptotic effect of Ara-C in leukemia cells. Injection of Ara-C significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice inoculated with leukemia cells with BMP4 silenced. In conclusion, BMP4 plays a crucial role in the chemoresistance of leukemia cells through the activation of autophagy and subsequent inhibition of apoptosis.
