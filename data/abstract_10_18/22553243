Vancomycin-intermediate resistance has not been previously reported among sequence type 72 (ST72) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates of SCCmec type IV (ST72-MRSA-IV), which are distinctive community genotype strains in Korea. We report the first case of vancomycin treatment failure due to development of vancomycin-intermediate resistance in infection caused by an ST72-MRSA-IV isolate.
