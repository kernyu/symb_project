Genetically homogeneous bacterial cultures contain persisters, cells that are not killed by bactericidal antibiotics. These cells are suggested to be involved in the establishment of chronic infections. Persister levels depend on growth conditions. Here, we discuss the parameters that have to be considered when measuring persister levels and provide a sample protocol to do it.
