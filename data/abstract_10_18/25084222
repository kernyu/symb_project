Gemcitabine is the first-line treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but is increasingly used to treat breast, bladder, and non-small cell lung cancers. Despite such broad use, intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance is common. In general, the underlying mechanisms of chemoresistance are poorly understood. Here, current knowledge of gemcitabine metabolism, mechanisms of action, sensitivity and chemoresistance reported over the past two decades are reviewed; and we also offer new perspectives to improve gemcitabine efficacy with particular reference to the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
