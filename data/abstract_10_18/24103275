BACKGROUND: Recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after liver transplantation can lead to graft loss and a reduction in long-term survival. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current therapeutic options for preventing HBV recurrence in liver transplant recipients. DATA SOURCES: Up to January 2013, studies that were published in MEDLINE and EMBASE on prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation were reviewed. RESULTS: There have been remarkable advancements in the past two decades on the prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation, from the discovery of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and lamivudine monotherapy to the combination therapy using HBIG and lamivudine. With the development of newer and stronger antiviral agents, the need for life-long HBIG is doubtful. With their low resistance profile, oral antiviral prophylaxis using these new agents alone is sufficient and is associated with excellent outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of host HBV immunity with adoptive immunity transfer and vaccination may represent the ultimate strategy to withdraw prophylactic treatment and to achieve a drug free regimen against HBV recurrence after liver transplantation.
