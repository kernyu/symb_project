Multidrug-resistant gram-negative rods (MDR-GNR) are an increasing cause for concern in intensive care units (ICUs). We used hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) to decontaminate our entire ICU in an attempt to eradicate undetected environmental contamination during outbreaks of MDR-GNR. Surface sampling identified GNR, including MDR strains, on 10 (48%) of 21 areas cultured after intensive cleaning but before decontamination with HPV, and on no areas after HPV. No new cases of Acinetobacter were identified for approximately 3 months after HPV.
