The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) conducts population-based surveillance for Campylobacter infection. For 2010 through 2015, we compared patients with Campylobacter jejuni with patients with infections caused by other Campylobacter species. Campylobacter coli patients were more often >40 years of age (OR = 1.4), Asian (OR = 2.3), or Black (OR = 1.7), and more likely to live in an urban area (OR = 1.2), report international travel (OR = 1.5), and have infection in autumn or winter (OR = 1.2). Campylobacter upsaliensis patients were more likely female (OR = 1.6), Hispanic (OR = 1.6), have a blood isolate (OR = 2.8), and have an infection in autumn or winter (OR = 1.7). Campylobacter lari patients were more likely to be >40 years of age (OR = 2.9) and have an infection in autumn or winter (OR = 1.7). Campylobacter fetus patients were more likely male (OR = 3.1), hospitalized (OR = 3.5), and have a blood isolate (OR = 44.1). International travel was associated with antimicrobial-resistant C. jejuni (OR = 12.5) and C. coli (OR = 12) infections. Species-level data are useful in understanding epidemiology, sources, and resistance of infections.
