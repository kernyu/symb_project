Twenty-seven colistin-resistant, carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were identified from hospitals in Serbia. All isolates were blaCTX-M-15 positive; ST101, ST888, ST437, ST336, and ST307 were blaOXA-48 positive; and ST340 was blaNDM-1 positive. ST307 had an insertion, and ST336 had a premature stop codon in the mgrB gene. Amino acid substitutions were detected in PmrAB of isolates ST101, ST888, ST336, and ST307. The mcr-1 and mcr-2 were not detected. An increase in phoP, phoQ, and pmrK gene transcription was detected for all sequence types.
