OBJECTIVES: In vascular surgery, the infection of prosthetic vascular grafts represents a serious life-threatening complication. Due to the increasing resistance of hospital micro-organisms to standard antibiotic therapies, maximum effort should be put in the primary prevention of such infections. For this purpose, grafts may be coated with different antibacterial silver formulations. In the present study the different effects of silver acetate-coating and vaporized metallic silver-coating on the vascularization and perigraft inflammation during the initial phase after implantation of Intergard Silver (IS) and Silver Graft (SG) were compared. METHODS: Silver acetate-coated IS and vaporized metallic silver-coated SG were implanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of C57BL/6 mice (n = 8 per group) to study angiogenesis and leukocyte inflammation at the implantation site by means of repetitive intravital fluorescence microscopy over a 14-day period. At the end of the in vivo experiments, apoptosis and cell proliferation in the newly developed granulation tissue surrounding the implants was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: IS exhibited an improved vascularization, resulting in a significantly higher functional capillary density when compared to SG. Moreover, the leukocyte inflammatory response to IS was less pronounced, as indicated by a reduced number of adherent leukocytes in perigraft venules. This was associated with a higher proliferative activity of the granulation tissue incorporating the IS when compared to SG. The numbers of apoptotic cells in the perigraft tissue were low and did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Silver acetate-coated IS exhibits an improved vascularization and reduced perigraft inflammation during the first 14 days after implantation when compared to vaporized metallic silver-coated SG. This may contribute to reducing the risk of early perigraft seroma formation and subsequent infection.
