TriABC-OpmH is an efflux pump from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an unusual substrate specificity and protein composition. When overexpressed, this pump confers a high level of resistance to the biocide triclosan and the detergent SDS, which are commonly used in combinations for antimicrobial treatments. This activity requires an RND transporter (TriC), an outer membrane channel (OpmH), and two periplasmic membrane fusion proteins (TriA and TriB) with nonequivalent functions. In the active complex, TriA is responsible for the recruitment of OpmH, while TriB is responsible for stimulation of the transporter TriC. Here, we used the functional and structural differences between the two membrane fusion proteins to link their functional roles to specific interactions with OpmH. Our results provide evidence that the TriB-dependent stimulation of the TriC transporter is coupled to opening of the OpmH aperture through binding to the interprotomer groove of OpmH. IMPORTANCE: Multidrug efflux transporters are important contributors to intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance in clinics. In Gram-negative bacteria, these transporters have a characteristic tripartite architecture spanning the entire two-membrane cell envelope. How such complexes are assembled and how the reactions separated in two different membranes are coupled to provide efficient efflux of various compounds across the cell envelope remain unclear. This study addressed these questions, and the results suggest a mechanism for functional integration of drug efflux by the inner membrane transporter and opening of the channel for transport across the outer membrane.
