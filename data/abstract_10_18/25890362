We studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated with Eastern Virginia Medical School. The data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram- positive and E. coli the most common Gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. Overall 53% of S.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. There was a broad scatter of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and MIC of 4 mug/mL was reported in 2012. Penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of Enterococcus faecium and 2% of Enterococcus faecalis respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant Gram negative organism in the data compiled. Among the Escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( SXT) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. We found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. Based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.
