In this publication, we design and report the synthesis of calix[4]arene-based beta-diketo derivatives as novel HIV-1 integrase (IN) inhibitors. The target compounds were obtained using Claisen condensation, and their structures were characterized by NMR and ESI-MS. Preliminary bioassays showed that calix[4]arene-based beta-diketo derivatives inhibit strand transfer (ST) with IC50 values between 5.9 and 21.2 microM. Docking studies revealed the predominant binding modes that were distinct from the binding modes of raltegravir, which suggests a novel binding region in the IN active site. Moreover, these compounds are predicted not to interact with some of the key amino acids (GLN148 and ASN155) implicated in viral resistance. Therefore, this series of compounds can further be investigated for a possible chemotype to circumvent resistance to clinical HIV-1 IN inhibitors.
