NAI-107, a lantibiotic produced by Microbispora sp. 107891, shows potent activity against multi-drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. It is produced as a complex of related molecules, which is unusual for ribosomally synthesized peptides. Here we describe the identification, characterization, and antibacterial activity of the congeners produced by Microbispora sp. 107891 and by the related Microbispora corallina NRRL 30420. These molecules differ by the presence of two, one, or zero hydroxyl groups at Pro-14, by the presence of a chlorine at Trp-4, and/or by the presence of a sulfoxide on the thioether of the first lanthionine.
