The wide use of antimicrobial agents and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has led to major changes in the epidemiology of childhood pneumococcal diseases. In Korea, data on the population-based incidence of childhood invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) are not available; however, institution-based surveillance data suggest a substantial burden of childhood IPD. Following the introduction of the PCV7 in Korea in 2003, the proportion of IPD caused by vaccine-type pneumococci has decreased, while non-PCV7 serotypes, especially serotypes 19A and 6A, whose proportions had been increasing before the introduction of the vaccine, became predominant among childhood IPD isolates. This article reviews the overall impact of PCV7 utilization and summarizes the results obtained so far. Continuous monitoring and gathering of scientific evidence for the epidemiological transition of pneumococcal carriage and IPD will be important for the management of pneumococcal infections in Korea.
