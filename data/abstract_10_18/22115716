In the present study salicylanilide was reacted with 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine producing reactive salicylanilide at a yield of 45% according to reaction conditions set. The reactive salicylanilide was confirmed structurally through FT-IR analysis. Pristine viscose fabric was treated with active salicylanilide to impart permanent antibacterial and antifungus properties to the fabric. Covalently attached reactive salicylanilide, as revealed, was quantitatively assessed through spectrophotometric and nitrogen elemental analysis. The antibacterial and antifungus capability of reactive salicylanilide treated viscose fabric; fastness and washing reproduction were examined and evaluated.
