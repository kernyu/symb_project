OBJECTIVE: Community acquired complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) are a common condition. Few data are available about the level of antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from community acquired cIAIs in Argentina. METHODS: Retrospective-prospective observational study (March 2010 to February 2012). Gram-negative bacteria antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from community acquired cIAIs were evaluated. RESULTS: During this period, a total of 85 patients were included and 138 pathogens were collected. Male sex: 58%. Median age: 33. Monomicrobial cultures were obtained in 49% of the cases. Ninety (65%) corresponded to Gram-negative organisms, and 48 (38%) to Gram-positive cocci. Gram-negative organisms most frequently observed were: Escherichia coli 76%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 8%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7% and Enterobacter spp. 6%. E. coli and K. pneumoniae showed a high percentage of strains resistance to ciprofloxacin of 37% and 29%, respectively. Similarly, resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam was observed in a 16% of the E. coli isolates. The prevalence of multiresistant Gram-negative organisms was 38%. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of resistance to antimicrobials was observed in community acquired cIAIs, mainly to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin/sulbactam two of the most used antimicrobial for empirically treatment of cIAIs in our country. In addition a significant proportion of multiresistant Gram-negative organisms were identified.
