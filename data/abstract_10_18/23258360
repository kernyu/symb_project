The comprehensive evaluation of infectious complications after kidney transplantation from the living related donor was performed. Microbes predominantly encountered in urinary tract infection (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, E. cloacae, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis) were studied. Prevention patterns and dosing regimens for the antibacterial therapy were developed considering data from the retrospective analysis of the isolated flora and its resistance. This resulted in the reduced rate of infectious complications.
