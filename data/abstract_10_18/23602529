INTRODUCTION: To know the prevalence of primary resistance in chronic hepatitis B naive patients is essential to decide on the need of routine laboratory testing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The genetic sequence of the HBV polymerase from 105naive patients was analysed. RESULTS: rtV173L, a lamivudine compensatory mutation, was detected in two patients (1.9%), rtI233V in one patient, and another one carried the sG145R vaccine escape mutation. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that studying HBV resistance in naive patients should not be recommended in the routine laboratory setting, for the time being.
