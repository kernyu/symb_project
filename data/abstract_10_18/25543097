OBJECTIVES: The epidemics of cholera were reported in the Kashipur, K.singhpur, B cuttack blocks of Rayagada district and Mohana block of Gajapati district of Odisha during 2010. The present study was carried out to isolate the bacterial pathogen, its drug sensitivity pattern and to describe the spread of the disease in those areas. METHODS: A total of 68 rectal swabs collected from patients with severe diarrhea, admitted to different health centers and diarrhea affected villages were bacteriologically analyzed. Similarly 22 water samples collected from different villages from nala, chua, etc were tested for the presence of V cholerae. RESULTS: Out of 68 rectal swabs tested 35 (51.5%) were V cholerae O1 Ogawa and 14(20.6%) were E coli; which might be commensals. All water samples were negative for V cholerae. The V cholerae strains were sensitive to gentamicin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and ofloxacin; but were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, furazolidone, streptomycin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, neomycin and chloramphenicol. All V cholerae strains were 100% resistant to tetracycline and they were El Tor variants harboring ctxB gene of classical strain. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated the emergence and spread of tetracycline resistant V cholerae O1 El Tor variant in the tribal areas which needs close monitoring.
