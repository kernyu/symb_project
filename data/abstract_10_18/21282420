A total of 4,226 Spanish clinical isolates of Candida spp. were analyzed to assess resistance to voriconazole according to breakpoints established by the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (where susceptibility [S] to voriconazole corresponds to a MIC of </= 0.12 mg/liter). Resistance was uncommon among Candida albicans (5%), C. parapsilosis (1.2%), and C. tropicalis (11%) isolates. Voriconazole MICs of >0.12 mg/liter were more frequent among Candida glabrata and C. krusei isolates. A significant percentage of voriconazole-resistant strains came from oropharyngeal infections and exhibited high MICs of other azoles.
