No series have reported the results of the use of the therapeutic anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Rituximab) in the setting of adult refractory/relapsed B-ALL. We report here the outcomes of such nine patients treated at two french institutions by a combination of Rituximab+chemotherapy. We showed that four patients could achieve complete response while four other patients were documented with blast clearance superior to 50% from the baseline in bone marrow. We conclude that our results suggested some efficacy for the use of Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in the setting of refractory/relapsed adult B-ALL. Larger series within prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.
