BACKGROUND/AIMS: There is increasing need for third-line therapy of Helicobacter pylori due to increasing level of antibiotics resistance. The aim of this study was to compare rifabutin and levofloxacin rescue regimens in patients with first- and second-line Helicobacter pylori eradication failures. METHODS: Patients, in whom a first treatment with proton pump inhibitor-clarithromycin-amoxicillin and a second trial with proton pump inhibitor-bismuth-tetracycline-metronidazole had failed, received treatment with either rifabutin or levofloxacin, plus amoxicillin (1 g twice daily) and standard dose proton pump inhibitor. Eradication rates were confirmed with 13C-urea breath test or rapid urease test 4 weeks after the cessation of therapy. RESULTS: Eradication rates were 71.4% in the rifabutin group, and 57.1% in the levofloxacin group, respectively. Although there was no significant difference in Helicobacter pylori eradication rates between two groups (p=0.656), rifabutin based regimen showed relatively higher eradication rate. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori eradication rates of rifabutin- or levofloxacin-based triple therapy could not achieve enough eradication rate. Further studies would be needed on combination of levofloxacin and rifabutin-based regimen or culture based treatment.
