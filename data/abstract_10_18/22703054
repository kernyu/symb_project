Overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is often responsible for the failure of chemotherapy as a treatment for human tumors. The presence of proteins homologous to P-gp in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes indicates that drug export is a general mechanism of multidrug resistance. Yeasts are no exception. They have developed a large subfamily of ABC exporters involved in pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) and in the cellular efflux of a wide variety of drugs. The PDR transporters Pdr5p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cdr1p of Candida albicans are important members of this PDR subfamily, which comprises up to 10 phylogenetic clusters in fungi. Here, we review current achievements concerning the structure, molecular mechanism, and physiological functions of yeast Pdr transporters.
