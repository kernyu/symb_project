Anastatica hierochuntica L. (A. hierochuntica) is a desert plant consumed by people across the globe to treat various medical conditions. This review is aimed at providing a summary of the scientific findings on biological activities of A. hierochuntica and suggests areas in which further research is needed. This systematic review was synthesized from the literature obtained from the following databases; PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar and WorldCat. Previous studies have indicated that the methanolic and aqueous extracts of this plant have antioxidant, antifungal and antimicrobial activities. It was shown to have the ability to activate phagocytes and to possess microbicidal activity, thereby causing increased resistance to infection. Both methanolic and aqueous extracts of this plant were also demonstrated to have a hypoglycaemic property, whilst the methanolic extract significantly exhibited hypolipidaemic effects in diabetic rats. Moreover, the methanolic extract of A. hierochuntica has been suggested to have hepatoprotective properties. This is supported by its ability to significantly decrease transaminase and alkaline phosphatase activities in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Besides, this desert plant exhibited anti-inflammatory, anti-melanogenic and gastroprotective activities. Even though A. hierochuntica is widely used, studies on this plant are still scarce, thus its reputed biological activities and medical benefits require critical evaluation. Before A. hierochuntica can be used clinically, further studies need to be conducted to increase our understanding of the effects of this plant, its constituents, and possible mechanisms of action.
