In this study, we partially purified the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of the ethanol extract of the root of Allum hookeri. We identified seven compounds, benzoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, ferulic acid, cinnamic acid, octadecanoic acid and hexanedioic acid, that have antimicrobial activity using GC-MS, and evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
