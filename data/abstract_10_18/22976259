INTRODUCTION: Management of frequently relapsing steroid-responsive or steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) in children has been a clinical challenge for pediatric nephrologists. In addition, adverse effects of long-term corticosteroids and cyclosporine administration emerge seeking a safe and effective treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study reviewed the outcomes of children with frequently relapsing or steroid-resistant idiopathic NS who were treated with MMF. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients (23 boys and 13 girls) were included. Their mean age at the time of diagnosis of NS was 61.94 +/- 43.9 months. Of the children, 91.6% of those who had frequent relapses and 8.3% of those with steroid-resistant NS responded to MMF significantly (P < .001), with no significant association between age and gender with response to MMF. The treatment was well tolerated with no significant complications. CONCLUSIONS: In children with frequently relapsing NS, MMF was a safe and useful drug for maintaining remission, while it was of low value in children with steroid-resistant NS.
