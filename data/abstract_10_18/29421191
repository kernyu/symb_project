BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters (CVC) are needed for monitoring and treatment of critically ill patients; however, their use increases the risk of bacteremia. The aim of the study was to quantify the incidence of central venous catheter-related bacteremia (CVCRB) and to identify factors associated with this infection. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in a concentration hospital of western Mexico. The association of CVCRB and study variables was investigated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred four patients with CVC were studied. The average age was 4.6 years; 66.2% were male. Insertion sites of the catheters were subclavian vein 72.5% (n = 148), jugular vein 20.1% (n = 41) and femoral vein 7.4% (n = 15). CVCRB incidence was 6.5 events/1,000 catheter days; microorganisms identified were gram-positive cocci 37.5% (n = 6), gram-negative bacilli 37.5% (n = 6) and Candida albicans 25% (n = 4). It was observed that the increase in catheter manipulations per day was associated with bacteremia (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.23), whereas the use of intravenous antibiotics showed a protective effect (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to strategies of maximum caution when placing or manipulating the catheter, we recommend decreasing, as much as possible, disconnects between the CVC and infusion line. Antibiotics showed a protective effect, but the outcome is uncertain and promotion of antimicrobial resistance should be considered.
