A series of original quinazolines bearing a 4-thiophenoxy and a 2-trichloromethyl group was synthesized in a convenient and efficient way and was evaluated toward its in vitro antiplasmodial potential. The series revealed global good activity against the K1-multi-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain, especially with hit compound 5 (IC(50)=0.9 muM), in comparison with chloroquine and doxycycline chosen as reference-drugs. Both the in vitro cytotoxicity study which was conducted on the human HepG2 cell line and the in vitro antitoxoplasmic screening against Toxoplasma gondii indicate that this series presents an interesting selective antiplasmodial profile. Structure-activity- and toxicity relationships highlight that the trichloromethyl group plays a key role in the antiplasmodial activity and also show that the modulation of the thiophenol moiety influences the toxicity/activity ratio.
