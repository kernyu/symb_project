OBJECTIVES: This study explores viral factors of the interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) resistance-determining region (IRRDR), the IFN sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) and the core protein, and host factor interleukin 28B associated with response to pegylated IFN (PEG-IFN) and RBV combination therapy, and the correlation of viral and host factors with IFN-lambda1. METHODS: A total of 58 patients underwent PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy for 48 weeks. The pretreatment factors associated with rapid virological response (RVR) and sustained virological response (SVR) were analyzed. Pretreatment IFN-lambda1 serum levels were compared with the viral and host factors. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that IRRDR >/=6 and ISDR >/=2 were significant pretreatment predictors of RVR, and multivariate analysis identified IRRDR >/=6 and hemoglobin as significant predictors of SVR. Pretreatment IFN-lambda1 was significantly higher in the SVR group than in the non-SVR group and also in the IRRDR >/=6 group than in the IRRDR </=5 group. CONCLUSIONS: IRRDR >/=6 was the only significant predictor of SVR and was correlated with IFN-lambda1. High serum levels of IFN-lambda1 may be conducive to effective PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy because of the immunomodulatory system.
