Salmonella infection, ranging from mild, self-limiting diarrhea to severe gastrointestinal, septicemic disease and enteric fever, is a global health problem both in humans and animals. Rapid development of microbial drug resistance has led to a need for efficacious and affordable vaccines against Salmonella. Microbial heat shock proteins (HSPs), including HSP60 and HSP70, are the dominant antigens that promote the host immune response. Co-administration of these antigens with cytokines, such as IL-22, which plays an important role in antimicrobial defense, can enhance the immune response and protection against pathogens. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the immunogenicity of rGroEL (Hsp60) of S. Typhi, alone or administered in combination with murine rIL-22, and its protective efficacy against lethal infection with Salmonella, in mice. There was appreciable stimulation of the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice immunized with rGroEL alone. However, co-administration of rGroEL with rIL-22 further boosted the antibody titers (IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a), T-cell proliferative responses and the secretion of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Additionally, rGroEL alone accorded 65%-70% protection against lethal challenge with S. Typhi and S. Typhimurium, which increased to 90% when co-administered with rIL-22.
