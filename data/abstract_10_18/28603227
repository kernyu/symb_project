Surveillance of antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to guide empirical treatment. However, the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network provides a general picture, which might not be applicable to clinical settings that are excluded from this survey. We evaluated resistance patterns of ESKAPE isolates over a four-year period in a third level University hospital in the province of Catanzaro (Southern Italy). In this retrospective study, we evaluated the frequency of ESKAPE isolates with different resistance patterns (group 1=low-resistant bacteria; group 2=multi-drug and extremely drug-resistant bacteria; group 3=pan-resistant bacteria), stratified by year (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014), hospital units (intensive care units, medical and surgical units) and by sample type (urine, blood, wound swabs, respiratory samples, other samples). Chi square test was applied to find differences between isolates with different resistance patterns by hospital unit and by organs and systems. Cochran-Armitage trend test was applied to assess the trend in resistance patterns during the four years analyzed. Amongst 2385 isolates, Escherichia coli (38%) was the most frequent, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Staphylococcus aureus (13%), Acinetobacter baumannii (9%), Enterococcus faecalis (8%) and Enterococcus faecium (3%). From 2011 to 2014, frequency of isolates in group 2 plus 3 decreased from 23% to 14% (chi square=55.093; p<0.0001), particularly for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, but the trend increased for S. aureus (from 5% in 2011 to 10% in 2014), and remained stable for the other species. Frequency of isolates in group 2 plus 3 was higher in intensive care units for K. pneumoniae (chi square =32.292; p<0.0001), A. baumannii (chi square =6.947; p<0.0001) and S. aureus (chi square =22.079; p<0.0001). It was also higher from blood than from different sources for most species.
