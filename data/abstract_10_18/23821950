The results on in vitro culture establishment, plantlet regeneration and rooting of Camelina sativa cultivar sample Peremozhets and cultivar Mirazh are presented. Effective concentrations of sterilizing agents and duration of plant material treatment were estimated. Phytohormone ratio, sucrose concentration in nutrient medium that induce effective formation of C. sativa shoots and NAA concentration for plantlet rooting have been established. The method of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Camelina by using binary vector pGH217 carrying reporter beta-glucoronidase (gus) gene driven under 35S CaMV promoter and nos-terminator, and selective marker hpt gene conferring hygromycin-resistance in transgenic plant was elaborated.
