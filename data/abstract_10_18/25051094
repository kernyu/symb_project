The background of quinolone resistance was characterized in ciprofloxacin-resistant commensal Escherichia coli selected out of 3,551 isolates from slaughtered animals in Poland between 2009 and 2012. Plasmid-mediated determinants were suspected in 6.2% of the study group, ranging from 1.1% in cattle to 9.7% in turkeys. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing identified up to four quinolone resistance-determining substitutions in gyrA (Ser83, Asp87) and parC (Ala56, Ser80). Plasmid-mediated mechanisms were identified as qnrS1 (or qnrS3, n=70, including six isolates with chromosomal mutations), qnrB19 (or qnrB10, n=19), and qnrB17 (n=1). All tested isolates were negative for qnrA, qnrC, qnrD, qepA, and aac(6')-Ib-cr. Still, there were several E. coli suspected for both plasmid- and chromosome-mediated resistance with unrevealed genetic background of the phenomenon. Since all tested isolates showed diverse XbaI-PFGE profiles, chromosome-encoded quinolone resistance does not result from the spread of a single resistant clone, however, it is rather due to antimicrobial pressure leading to the selection of random gyr and par mutants. It also favors the selection and spread of plasmids carrying predominant qnr genes, since the same determinants were found in Salmonella, isolated from similar sources. The identification of carrier plasmids and mitigation of their spread might be essential for sustainable quinolone usage in animal husbandry and efficient protection of human health.
