Bacteroides fragilis is the anaerobe most frequently isolated from clinical specimens and piperacillin/tazobactam is among the drugs that can be used to treat polymicrobial infections in which this bacteria is often involved. During antibiotic therapy, inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics are always followed by subinhibitory concentrations which can generate phenotypic changes in bacteria. So, in this study we aimed to evaluate changes in the proteomic profile of B. fragilis grown in a sub-MIC of PTZ, using 2-D electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time of-flight. Analysis of the 2-DE gels showed 18 spots with significantly different volume percentages between experimental conditions and 12 were successfully identified by MS/MS. Two proteins with decreased abundance in sub-MIC condition were involved in the glycolysis (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate isomerase), others two involved in amino acid metabolism (Oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier protein) synthase II and dihydrodipicolinate reductase), and finally, one protein involved in fatty acid metabolism (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase). Among the proteins with increased abundance, we founded three ATP synthase (alpha, beta, and alpha type V), which could be involved in antibiotic bacterial resistance by efflux pump, one protein involved in glycolysis (enolase), and one involved in protein degradation (aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase). In conclusion, our data show overall changes in the proteome of B. fragilis conducted by sub-MIC of PTZ, whose consequences on bacterial physiology deserve further investigation.
