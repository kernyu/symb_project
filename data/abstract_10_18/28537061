INTRODUCTION: A proof-of-concept study was designed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of a two-drug regimen with dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (QD) plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily as initial highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among antiretroviral (ARV)-naive patients. METHODS: PADDLE is a pilot study including 20 treatment-naive adults. To be selected, participants had no IAS-USA-defined resistance, HIV-1 RNA </=100,000 copies/mL at screening and negative HBsAg. Plasma viral load (pVL) was measured at baseline; days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28; weeks 6, 8 and 12; and thereafter every 12 weeks up to 96 weeks. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL in an intention to treat (ITT)-exposed analysis at 48 weeks (the FDA snapshot algorithm). RESULTS: Median HIV-1 RNA at entry was 24,128 copies/mL (interquartile range (IQR): 11,686-36,794). Albeit as per protocol, all patients had pVL </=100,000 copies/mL at screening as required by inclusion criteria, four patients had >/=100,000 copies/mL at baseline. Median baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 507 per cubic millimetre (IQR: 296-517). A rapid decline in pVL was observed (median VL decay from baseline to week 12 was 2.74 logs). All patients were suppressed at week 8 onwards up to week 24. At week 48, 90% (18/20) reached the primary endpoint of a pVL <50 copies/mL. Median change in CD4 cell count between baseline and week 48 was 267 cells/mm(3) (IQR: 180-462). No major tolerability/toxicity issues were observed. Nineteen patients completed 48 weeks of the study, and one patient (with undetectable VL at last visit) committed suicide. One patient presented a low-level protocol-defined confirmed virological failure at week 36, being the only observed failure. This patient had pVL <50 copies/mL at the end-of-study visit without having changed the two-drug regimen. Observed failure rate was 5%. This is the first report of integrase strand transfer inhibitor/lamivudine dual regimen in ARV-naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: This novel dual regimen of dolutegravir and lamivudine warrants further clinical research and consideration as a potential therapeutic option for ARV-therapy-naive patients.
