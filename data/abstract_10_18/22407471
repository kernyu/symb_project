The HIV-infection in adults or children and adolescent differs substantially. Differences include the mode of infection, viral dynamics facing a developing immune system and the clinical course of the infection. In addition to the virological, immunological and epidemiological aspects the psychosocial situation is also very different. The above aspects and the decreased number of antiretroviral substances underline the need for specific guidelines for HIV-therapy in children and adolescents. The German Pediatric Working group AIDS (PAAD) has formulated this guideline in 2011 based on new study results, changes in international recommendations and newly available drugs.
