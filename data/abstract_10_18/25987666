Previous in vivo study demonstrated that chronic hypoxia during gestation was associated with estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) gene repression in ovine uterine arteries. Yet, it remains undetermined whether hypoxia had a direct effect and if DNA methylation played a causal role in hypoxia-mediated ER-alpha gene repression. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that prolonged hypoxia has a direct effect and increases promoter methylation resulting in ER-alpha gene repression and inhibition of estrogen-mediated adaptation of uterine vascular tone. Uterine arteries isolated from nonpregnant and pregnant sheep were treated ex vivo with 21.0% O2 and 10.5% O2 for 48 hours. Hypoxia significantly increased ER-alpha promoter methylation at both specificity protein-1 and upstream stimulatory factor binding sites, decreased specificity protein-1 and upstream stimulatory factor binding to the promoter, and suppressed ER-alpha expression in uterine arteries of pregnant animals. Of importance, the effects of hypoxia were blocked by a methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In addition, hypoxia abrogated steroid hormone-mediated increase in ER-alpha expression and inhibited the hormone-induced increase in large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel activity and decrease in myogenic tone in uterine arteries of nonpregnant animals, which were reversed by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The results provide novel evidence of a direct effect of hypoxia on heightened promoter methylation that plays a causal role in ER-alpha gene repression and ablation of steroid hormone-mediated adaptation of uterine arterial large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel activity and myogenic tone in pregnancy.
