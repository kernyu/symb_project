Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged worldwide as an important opportunistic nosocomial pathogen and has become a major public health concern. In this study, the draft genome sequence of A. baumannii TCM331 (ST208/CC92), a multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate harbouring the blaOXA-23 gene isolated in China, was determined. The genome of TCM331 was sequenced via Illumina HiSeq 2000, and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Important antimicrobial resistance determinants were observed in an estimated genome size of 4,058,691bp with 3838 predicted coding regions. In conclusion, these data might facilitate further understanding of the specific genomic features of MDR A. baumannii in China.
