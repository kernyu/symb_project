BACKGROUND: VIKING-4 assessed the safety and efficacy of dolutegravir in heavily antiretroviral treatment-experienced patients who had documented integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance-associated substitutions in their HIV. VIKING-4 had a placebo-controlled 7-day dolutegravir functional monotherapy phase followed by dolutegravir plus an optimized background regimen for 48 weeks. METHODS: Independent resistance analyses evaluated week 48 virological responses in the VIKING-4 trial based on the presence of baseline INSTI resistance-associated substitutions and baseline dolutegravir phenotypic susceptibility. Response rates at week 48 based on baseline dolutegravir resistance subgroups were compared for the 7-day dolutegravir functional monotherapy arm and placebo-control arm. Additionally, genotypic and phenotypic resistance at day 8 and time of failure was analysed for the virological failures from both arms. RESULTS: Week 48 response rates for VIKING-4 were 23% (3/13) in the 7-day dolutegravir functional monotherapy arm compared with 60% (9/15) in the 7-day placebo arm. Response rates were consistently lower in the dolutegravir functional monotherapy arm across baseline INSTI genotypic and phenotypic subgroups. There was a higher proportion of virological failures in the 7-day dolutegravir functional monotherapy arm (n=6/13; 46%) compared with the 7-day placebo arm (n=3/15; 20%). Additionally, five virological failures in the dolutegravir arm had virus expressing emergent INSTI resistance-associated substitutions compared with two in the placebo arm. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of response rates and resistance emergence in VIKING-4 suggests careful consideration should be given to the duration of functional monotherapy in future studies of highly treatment-experienced patients to reduce the risk of resistance and virological failure.
