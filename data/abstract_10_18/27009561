Little information is available on the molecular epidemiologic profile of HIV-1 in French Guiana, the French department with the highest HIV/AIDS incidence. To follow the evolution of HIV-1 diversity, we carried out a molecular analysis of HIV-1 isolates from 305 treatment-naive patients between 2006 and 2012. Protease and reverse-transcriptase sequences were obtained for subtype characterization, polymorphism analysis, and identification of drug resistance mutations. Of 305 HIV-1 strains, 95.1% were subtype B viruses. The overall prevalence of transmitted drug-resistance mutations (TDRMs) was 4.6% (14/305), ranging from 1.9% to 7.1% depending on the year. This study shows a low level of HIV-1 genetic diversity and a moderate prevalence of TDRMs with no evidence of an increasing trend over the study period. Nevertheless, the strong genetic polymorphism observed on both genes may be of concern for long-term treatment of people living with HIV-1 and thus deserves continuous monitoring.
