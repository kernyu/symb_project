OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of third-line gemcitabine monotherapy (Gem) in patients with platinum-resistant advanced urothelial cancer (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 2005 to March 2009, 13 patients were enrolled. All patients had previously received methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as first-line therapy. Second-line therapy consisted of paclitaxel/carboplatin (Pca) therapy: paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) followed by carboplatin (area under the curve = 5) was intravenously infused on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Following Pca failure, Gem was given as third-line treatment: gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) was intravenously administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. All patients were eligible for toxicity assessment. Survival curves were produced using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: An average of 3.2 Gem cycles (range, 1-8 cycles) were given. Following Gem treatment, overall response rates were 0% CR, 7.7% PR (n = 1), 53.8% SD (n = 7), and 38.5% PD (n = 5). Grade 3-4 toxicities included anemia (31%), neutropenia (31%), and thrombocytopenia (31%). One case experienced grade 3-4 hepatic dysfunction during treatment with Gem. Low-grade alopecia was observed in all 13 patients (100%). Median time to progression and overall survival was 2 and 7.3 months, respectively, following Gem. The 1- and 2-year overall survival rate was 30.8% and 15.3%, respectively, for Gem. CONCLUSION: Gem as third-line therapy was performed safely with good tolerability in platinum-resistant advanced UC, even though the efficacy was very limited.
