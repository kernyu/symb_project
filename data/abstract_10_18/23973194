World health organization has called for academic research and development of new chemotherapeutic strategies to overcome the emerging resistance and side effects exhibited by the drugs currently used against leishmaniasis. Diospyrin, a bis-naphthoquinone isolated from Diospyros montana Roxb., and its semi-synthetic derivatives, were reported for inhibitory activity against protozoan parasites including Leishmania. Presently, we have investigated the antileishmanial effect of a di-epoxide derivative of diospyrin (D17), both in vitro and in vivo. Further, the safety profile of D17 was established by testing its toxicity against normal macrophage cells (IC(5)(0) approximately 20.7 muM), and also against normal BALB/c mice in vivo. The compound showed enhanced activity (IC(5)(0) approximately 7.2 muM) as compared to diospyrin (IC(5)(0) approximately 12.6 muM) against Leishmania donovani promastigotes. Again, D17 was tested on L. donovani BHU1216 isolated from a sodium stibogluconate-unresponsive patient, and exhibited selective inhibition of the intracellular amastigotes (IC(5)(0) approximately 0.18 muM). Also, treatment of infected BALB/c mice with D17 at 2mg/kg/day reduced the hepatic parasite load by about 38%. Subsequently, computational docking studies were undertaken on selected enzymes of trypanothione metabolism, viz. trypanothione reductase (TryR) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), followed by the enzyme kinetics, where D17 demonstrated non-competitive inhibition of the L. donovani ODC, but could not inhibit TryR.
