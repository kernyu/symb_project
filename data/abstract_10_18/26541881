Oritavancin is a lipoglycopeptide that has been approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused by susceptible organisms. Oritavancin causes cell death by inhibiting cell wall synthesis as well as depolarising and permeabilising the cellular membrane of Gram-positive pathogens. The activities of oritavancin in comparison with vancomycin, daptomycin and linezolid were determined against a collection of over 11000 recent clinical Gram-positive isolates from patient infections (2011-2014), including skin and skin-structure infections. A total of 7253 Staphylococcus aureus, 839 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 1464 enterococci and 1637 beta-haemolytic streptococci (betaHS) were collected from the USA and Europe. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methods, and susceptibility was determined using CLSI and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (for oritavancin) breakpoint criteria. Equivalent in vitro activity (MIC50/90, 0.015-0.03/0.06 mug/mL) was observed for oritavancin against meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and Enterococcus faecalis in both regions. Slightly higher oritavancin MICs were obtained against CoNS, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium (MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL) and against other betaHS (MIC90, 0.25 mug/mL). Oritavancin demonstrated comparatively lower MICs than daptomycin and vancomycin when tested against multidrug-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and erythromycin-resistant betaHS. Oritavancin exhibited potent in vitro activity against the most common pathogens associated with ABSSSIs in the USA and Europe.
