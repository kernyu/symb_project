Due to the emergence of severe infectious diseases and thriving antibiotic resistance, there is a need to explore microbial-derived bioactive secondary metabolites from unexplored regions. Present study deals with a mangrove estuary derived strain of Streptomyces sp. with potent antimicrobial activity against various pathogens, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Bioactive compound was effective even at low MIC level, damages the membrane of methicillin resistant S. aureus and causes cell death, however it has no cytotoxic effect on H9C2 cells. 16S rRNA shared 99.5% sequence similarity to Streptomyces longispororuber. Optimum biomass and antimicrobial compound production were observed in production medium supplemented with 1.0% maltose and 0.5% yeast extract. The active compound purified from the chloroform extract of the cell-free supernatant was studied by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and LC ESI-MS and identified as aromatic polyketide. beta-ketosynthase (KS) domain of the Streptomyces strain revealed 93.2% sequence similarity to the benzoisochromanequinone, an actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). However, the region synthesizing the secondary metabolite produced by the S. longispororuber was not related to the KS domain of the strain, due to the phenomenon of horizontal gene transfer over the period of evolutionary process, thus generating metabolic compound diversity.
