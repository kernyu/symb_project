A recurrent case of left-sided endocarditis caused by high-level aminoglycoside-resistant Enterococcus faecalis was successfully treated with ceftaroline and daptomycin. This combination demonstrated excellent synergy in vitro. Mechanistically, ceftaroline enhanced binding of daptomycin to the cell membrane and sensitized E. faecalis to killing by human cathelicidin LL-37, a cationic innate host defense peptide. Daptomycin plus ceftaroline may be considered in salvage therapy in E. faecalis endovascular infections and requires further study.
