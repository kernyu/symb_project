Dufulin is a newly developed antiviral agent (or pesticide) that activates systemic acquired resistance of plants. This pesticide is widely used in China to prevent abroad viral diseases in rice, tobacco and vegetables. In this study, the potential impacts such as soil type, moisture, temperature, and other factors on Dufulin degradation in soil were investigated. Degradation of Dufulin followed the first-order kinetics. The half-life values varied from 2.27 to 150.68 days. The dissipation of Dufulin was greatly affected by soil types, with DT50 (Degradation half time) varying between 17.59, 31.36, and 43.32 days for Eutric Gleysols, Cumulic Anthrosols, and Dystric Regosols, respectively. The elevated moisture accelerated the decay of Dufulin in soil. Degradation of Dufulin increased with temperature and its half-life values ranged from 16.66 to 42.79 days. Sterilization of soils and treatment with H2O2 resulted in a 6- and 8-fold decrease in degradation rates compared to the control, suggesting that Dufulin degradation was largely governed by microbial processes. Under different light spectra, the most effective degradation occurred with 100-W UV light (DT50=2.27 days), followed by 15-W UV light (DT50=8.32 days) and xenon light (DT50=14.26 days). Analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) revealed that 2-amino-4-methylbenzothiazole was one of the major decayed products of Dufulin in soils, suggesting that elimination of diethyl phosphate and 2-fluorobenzaldehyde was most like the degradation pathway of Dufulin in Eutric Gleysols.
