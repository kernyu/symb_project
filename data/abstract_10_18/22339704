Three hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) gene expression systems for culinary-medicinal Oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus, plasmid pSHC, pAN7-1, and pBHt1 were evaluated through PEG/CaCl(2)-mediated protoplast transformation. Plasmid pSHC is a newly constructed hph gene expression system, composed of Escherichia coli hph gene, the P. ostreatus sdi promoter, and the CaMV35S terminator. The vector pAN7-1 was commonly used for integrative transformation in filamentous fungi. Plasmid pBHtl is a T-DNA binary vector, usually introduced into fungi by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The results showed that plasmids pSHC, pAN7-1, and pBHt1 were all integrated into the host chromosomes and expressed hygromycin B resistance in P. ostreatus. pAN7-1 had the highest transformation efficiency and hph gene expression level, pSHC the second, and pBHt1 the lowest. Growth rates of the transformants on plates containing hygromycin B were in correspondence with their hph gene expression levels. To our knowledge, this is the first report on integrated transformation of plasmid pAN7-1 and pBHt1 in P. ostreatus.
