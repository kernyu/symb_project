Extrapulmonary and, in particular, spinal tuberculosis (TB) constitutes a minor but significant part of the total TB incidence. In spite of this, almost no studies on the genetic diversity and drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from spinal TB patients have been published to date. Here, we report results of the first Russian and globally largest molecular study of M. tuberculosis isolates recovered from patients with tuberculous spondylitis (TBS). The majority of 107 isolates were assigned to the Beijing genotype (n = 80); the other main families were T (n = 11), Ural (n = 7), and LAM (n = 4). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was more frequently found among Beijing (90.5%) and, intriguingly, Ural (71.4%) isolates than other genotypes (5%; P < 0.001). The extremely drug-resistant (XDR) phenotype was exclusively found in the Beijing isolates (n = 7). A notable prevalence of the rpoB531 and katG315 mutations in Beijing strains that were similarly high in both TBS (this study) and published pulmonary TB (PTB) samples from Russia shows that TBS and PTB Beijing strains follow the same paradigm of acquisition of rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance. The 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) subtyping of 80 Beijing isolates further discriminated them into 24 types (Hunter Gaston index [HGI] = 0.83); types 100-32 and 94-32 represented the largest groups. A genotype of Russian successful clone B0/W148 was identified in 30 of 80 Beijing isolates. In conclusion, this study highlighted a crucial impact of the Beijing genotype and the especially prominent role of its MDR-associated successful clone B0/W148 cluster in the development of spinal MDR-TB in Russian patients.
