The effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (1 g/kg body weight/day) on serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels, insulin resistance (IR), and hepatic and renal prooxidant-antioxidant balance was evaluated in rats treated with homocysteine thiolactone (HcyT) (500 mg/kg body weight/day for 6 weeks). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were determined in the liver and kidney. HcyT elevated serum Hcy levels and caused IR, but liver and kidney function tests remained unchanged. HcyT increased ROS and MDA without any change in hepatic antioxidants, but it elevated renal SOD and GSH-Px activities. NAC decreased serum Hcy, hepatic and renal ROS and MDA levels, and renal SOD and GSH-Px activities in rats with high Hcy levels. However, it did not ameliorate IR. Our results indicate that NAC supplementation may be effective in decreasing Hcy levels and Hcy-induced hepatic and renal oxidative stress.
