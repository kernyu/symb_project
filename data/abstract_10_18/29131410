The study evaluated primary antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori within the period 2013-2015 and trends of antibiotic consumption over the last decade in Lithuania; 242 adults and 55 children were included in the study. E-tests were performed for amoxicillin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin and tetracycline. The presence of H. pylori and clarithromycin resistance was additionally tested by PCR. Helicobacter pylori culture was positive in 67 of 242 (28%) adult and in 12 of 55 (21.8%) children samples. Resistance rates among adults by E-tests were as follows: metronidazole - 32.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22.7-44.7%), ciprofloxacin - 7.5% (95% CI: 3.2-16.3%), rifampicin - 7.5% (95% CI: 3.2-16.3%), amoxicillin - 0%, whereas resistance rates in children were as follows: metronidazole - 25% (95% CI: 8.9-53.2%), rifampicin - 8.3% (CI: 1.5-35.4%), amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin - 0%. Accumulated clarithromycin resistance rates by E-tests and PCR were 8.2% (95% CI: 4.1-16.0%) in adults and 17.7% (95% CI: 6.2-41.0%) in children. Total use of macrolides and lincosamides in Lithuania increased from 1.26 to 1.86 defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/day among adults, while it has doubled from 1.10 to 2.22 DDD/1000/children/day in children within 2003-2015. There are no significant changes in the susceptibility of H. pylori to the most widely used antibiotics in adults over the last years in Lithuania; however, clarithromycin resistance among children exceeds 15% and mandates further larger-scale studies in paediatric population.
