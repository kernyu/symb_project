Thymidylate kinase (TMK) is an essential enzyme in bacterial DNA synthesis. The deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) substrate binding pocket was targeted in a rational-design, structure-supported effort, yielding a unique series of antibacterial agents showing a novel, induced-fit binding mode. Lead optimization, aided by X-ray crystallography, led to picomolar inhibitors of both Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus TMK. MICs < 1 mug/mL were achieved against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S. pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Log D adjustments yielded single diastereomers 14 (TK-666) and 46, showing a broad antibacterial spectrum against Gram-positive bacteria and excellent selectivity against the human thymidylate kinase ortholog.
