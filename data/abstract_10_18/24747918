Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a public health challenge worldwide. Antiviral agents (nucleos(t)ide analogues, NAs) and immune-based therapies (IFN-alpha or Pegylated-IFN-alpha) are two therapeutic approaches available currently against chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, these approaches are associated with the development of acquired drug resistance or poor response rates and are accompanied by numerous side effects. Furthermore, due to defective innate and adaptive immune responses, HBV cannot be effectively controlled or completely eliminated, which may ultimately result in liver decompensation and hepatocelluar carcinoma. The imperative for development of new approaches targeting CHB cannot be overstated. Various immunotherapeutic interventions have been tried as adjuvants to inhibit HBV replication. In this paper, we will review immunotherapeutic interventions in the treatment of CHB.
