Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic discovered in Spain in 1969. It has bactericidal activity against a wide range of bacteria, including gram-negative micro-organisms and some gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococci. Initially fosfomycin was administered parenterally and only to patients with severe infections. Today it is often dispensed as fosfomycin-trometamol, an oral formula recommended in the treatment of urinary tract infections. Fosfomycin-trometamol in a single dose is indicated for the treatment of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
