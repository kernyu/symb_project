INTRODUCTION: The International Circumpolar Surveillance network is a population-based surveillance system that collects data on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Northern Canada. A 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was first introduced in some regions of Northern Canada in 2002, followed by 10-valent (2009) and 13-valent (PCV-13) vaccines (2010). A 23-valent polysaccharide (PPV-23) vaccine was first introduced in 1988 for special populations and adults aged 65 years and older. To describe the epidemiology in the context of pneumococcal vaccination programs, we analysed surveillance data from Northern Canada from 1999 to 2010. METHODS: A standardized case report form capturing demographic and clinical information was completed for all IPD cases in Northern Canada meeting the national case definition. Isolates were sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation, serotyping and antimicrobial resistance testing. Both laboratory and epidemiological data were sent to the Public Health Agency of Canada for analysis. Population denominators were obtained from Statistics Canada. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2010, 433 IPD cases were reported (average 36 cases per year). Incidence was greatest among infants aged < 2 years and among those aged 65 years and older, with an average annual incidence of 133 and 67 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. After a peak in incidence in 2008, rates among infants have declined. Incidence rates varied from 2 to 16 times greater, depending on the year, among Aboriginals compared to non-Aboriginals. Hospitalization was reported in 89% of all cases and the case fatality ratio was 6.0%. Clinical manifestations varied, with some patients reporting > 1 manifestation. Pneumonia was the most common (70%), followed by bacteremia/septicaemia (30%) and meningitis (8%). Approximately, 42% of cases aged < 2 years in 2009 and 2010 had serotypes covered by the PCV-13. In addition, the majority (89%) of serotypes isolated in cases aged 65 years and older were included in the PPV-23 vaccine. CONCLUSION: IPD continues to be a major cause of disease in Northern Canadian populations, with particularly high rates among infants and Aboriginals. Continued surveillance is needed to determine the impact of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine programs. Additional studies investigating factors that predispose infants and Aboriginal peoples would also be beneficial.
