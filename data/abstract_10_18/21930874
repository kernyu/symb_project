A new variant of the New Delhi metallo-enzyme (NDM) carbapenemase was identified in a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli ST648 isolate recovered from the perineum and throat of a patient in the United Kingdom with a recent history of hospitalization in India. NDM-5 differed from existing enzymes due to substitutions at positions 88 (Val --> Leu) and 154 (Met --> Leu) and reduced the susceptibility of E. coli TOP10 transformants to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems when expressed under its native promoter.
