In the current paper authors presented the latest information concerning etiology of severe community-acquired pneumonia. Most cases are caused by a relatively small number ofpathogenic bacterial and viral natures. The frequency of detection of various pathogens of severe community-acquired pneumonia may vary greatly depending on the region, season and clinical profile of patients, availability of relevant risk factors. Authors presented clinical characteristics of severe community-acquired pneumonia and comparative evaluation of a number of scales to assess the risk of adverse outcome of the disease. Diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia includes the following: collecting of epidemiological history, identification of pneumonia, detection of sepsis and identification of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, detection of acute respiratory failure, assessment of comorbidity. Authors gave recommendations concerning evaluation of the clinical manifestations of the disease, the use of instrumental and laboratory methods for diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia. To select the mode of antimicrobial therapy is most important local monitoring antimicrobial resistance of pathogens. The main criteria for the effectiveness of treatment are to reduce body temperature, severe intoxication, respiratory and organ failure.
