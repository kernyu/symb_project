Cytomegalovirus infection remains a major complication of solid organ transplantation. In 2005 the Spanish Transplantation Infection Study Group (GESITRA) of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC) developed consensus guidelines for the prevention and treatment of CMV infection in solid organ transplant recipients. Since then, numerous publications have clarified or questioned the aspects covered in the previous document. These aspects include the situations and populations who must receive prophylaxis and its duration, the selection of the best diagnosis and monitoring technique and the best therapeutic strategy. For these reasons, we have developed new consensus guidelines to include the latest recommendations on post-transplant CMV management based on new evidence available.
