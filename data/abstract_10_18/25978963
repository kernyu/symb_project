Novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (NBTIs) are a new class of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents targeting bacterial Gyrase A and ParC and have potential utility in combating antibiotic resistance. (R)-Hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridinone left-hand side (LHS) oxabicyclooctane linked pyridoxazinone right-hand side (RHS) containing NBTIs showed a potent Gram-positive antibacterial profile. SAR around the RHS moiety, including substitutions around pyridooxazinone, pyridodioxane, and phenyl propenoids has been described. A fluoro substituted pyridoxazinone showed an MIC against Staphylococcus aureus of 0.5 mug/mL with reduced functional hERG activity (IC50 333 muM) and good in vivo efficacy [ED90 12 mg/kg, intravenous (iv) and 15 mg/kg, oral (p.o.)]. A pyridodioxane-containing NBTI showed a S. aureus MIC of 0.5 mug/mL, significantly improved hERG IC50 764 muM and strong efficacy of 11 mg/kg (iv) and 5 mg/kg (p.o.). A phenyl propenoid series of compounds showed potent antibacterial activity, but also showed potent hERG binding activity. Many of the compounds in the hydroxy-tricyclic series showed strong activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, but reduced activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bicyclic heterocycles appeared to be the best RHS moiety for the hydroxy-tricyclic oxabicyclooctane linked NBTIs.
