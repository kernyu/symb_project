Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become a treatable chronic disease with near-normal life expectancy when patients receive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Family physicians and other primary care clinicians commonly provide long-term comprehensive care for persons with HIV infection. This article describes the scope of initial care, including obtaining a thorough history; physical examination for HIV-associated manifestations; attention to HIV-specific immunization schedules; routine and HIV-specific laboratory evaluation; and ensuring standard health care maintenance to prevent HIV- and non-HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should encourage combination ART as early as possible, although careful assessment of patient readiness and ability to sustain lifelong treatment must be weighed. After ART initiation, monitoring viral load and CD4 lymphocyte response is essential to ensure viral suppression and evaluate immune system restoration. Opportunistic infections are now less common than in the past because ART usually prevents or markedly delays progression to advanced HIV disease. The most important reasons for consultation or comanagement with an HIV expert include management of antiretroviral drug resistance or drug toxicities, as well as special circumstances such as viral hepatitis coinfection or pregnancy.
