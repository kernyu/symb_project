PURPOSE: This study was conducted in an attempt to identify the regional, geographic, climatic, socioeconomic, and other risk factors for microbial keratitis in south Nile Delta, Egypt. METHODS: This is a prospective cross-sectional study that was carried out on 340 eyes of 340 patients with microbial keratitis attending at the outpatient clinic of Ophthalmology Department of Menoufia University Hospital during a period of three years between March 2010 and March 2013. RESULTS: Epidemiological factors, lines of management, and follow-up results were recorded and statistically analyzed and there were regional variations in the prevalence, risk factors, and outcome in resistant corneal ulcers. CONCLUSION: Higher incidence of affections and complications has appeared in farmers, rural area residents, and illiterates which are considered the main predisposing factors for ulcer resistance. According to culture results, bacterial organisms (especially Staphylococcus aureus) were the main cause of resistant corneal ulcers.
