The aims of this study were to determine carbapenem resistance mechanisms, molecular epidemiological relationship, clinical impact, and patient outcome of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) infections. A total of 42 nonduplicated CRPA were recovered from Urmia, Iran. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were carried out using phenotypic methods. The carbapenem resistance mechanisms such as carbapenemase genes, efflux pump hyperexpression, AmpC overproduction, and OprD gene downregulation were determined by phenotypic and molecular methods. Eighteen metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producer isolates were found to be sensitive to amikacin. Among the CRPA, 52.3%, 26.1%, 26.1%, and 59.5% were identified as carbapenemase, efflux pump hyperexpression, AmpC overproduction, and reduced expression OprD gene, respectively. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA analysis yielded 25 distinct profiles. Most MBL-positive isolates were recovered from patients hospitalized in urology and internal wards with urinary tract infections. Most of the strains showed downregulation of porin. The clonal distribution of the strains was related to carbapenem resistance mechanisms (most of MBL producers belong to the same clones) and the same hospital wards where the isolates were collected. The study demonstrates that the main risk factor of MBL-related infections was hospitalization in non-intensive wards. Amikacin was considered a very efficient antibiotic to treatment of MBL-producing CRPA isolates. Our results showed that OprD downregulation and IMP-type MBL are the main carbapenem resistance mechanisms in CRPA isolates from northwest of Iran.
