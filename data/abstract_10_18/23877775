BACKGROUND: The most of the surveillance studies has been conducted in hospitalized patients with invasive infections. Recently, new clinical breakpoints (CBPs) have been proposed for antifungal susceptibility testing and epidemiological cutoffs (ECVs). AIM: To evaluate species distribution and susceptibility pattern of Candida spp. obtained from in and outpatients in a period of 6 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The isolates (n=223) came from vaginal discharge (51.6%), lower respiratory tract (24.7%), urine (20.2%), wounds (1.8%), blood (0.9%), peritoneal fluid (0.4%) and nails (0.4%). RESULTS: The species distribution was C. albicans 84.8% (n: 189), C. glabrata 7.6% (n: 17), C. tropicalis 2.7% (n: 6), C. parapsilosis 2.2% (n: 5), C. kefyr 0.9% (n: 2) and others 1.8% (C. krusei, C. lusitanie, C. guilliermondii, C. intermedia) (n: 4). The susceptibility dose dependence (SDD) and resistance were 3.2% for fluconazole and 2.2% for voriconazole. The most of SDD and resistant strains were isolated from ambulatory patients. Also, a higher percentage of MICs over the new CBPs and ECVs were found in strains from ambulatory patients and especially in C. glabrata isolates to caspofungin. CONCLUSION: Taking into consideration that most of the invasive infections are caused by strains from the endogenous microbiota, and that there is a resistant population of Candida spp. in the community, should be important to include in surveillance studies strains isolated from ambulatory patients.
