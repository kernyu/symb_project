Gemcitabine has long been the standard of care for treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), despite its poor pharmacokinetics/dynamics and rapid development of drug resistance. In this study, we have developed a novel nanoparticle platform based on nanoscale coordination polymer-1 (NCP-1) for simultaneous delivery of two chemotherapeutics, oxaliplatin and gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP), at 30 wt.% and 12 wt.% drug loadings, respectively. A strong synergistic therapeutic effect of oxaliplatin and GMP was observed in vitro against AsPc-1 and BxPc-3 pancreatic cancer cells. NCP-1 particles effectively avoid uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) in vivo with a long blood circulation half-life of 10.1 +/- 3.3h, and potently inhibit tumor growth when compared to NCP particles carrying oxaliplatin or GMP alone. Our findings demonstrate NCP-1 as a novel nanocarrier for the co-delivery of two chemotherapeutics that have distinctive mechanisms of action to simultaneously disrupt multiple anticancer pathways with maximal therapeutic efficacy and minimal side effects.
