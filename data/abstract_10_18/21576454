Recent studies have shown that ampicillin resistance has increased steadily over the past 3 decades within U.S. Enterococcus faecium isolates. Analysis of the predicted PBP5 protein of 41 isolates showed a consensus PBP5 pattern for the 9 isolates with MICs of <4 mug/ml that is distinctly different from the PBP5 consensus of the 32 isolates with MICs of >4 mug/ml with approximately 5% difference between these; however, there were no consistent amino acid changes that correlated with specific increases in the MICs of ampicillin within the latter group. Analysis of three other genes encoding cell wall/surface proteins also showed that there are two distinct evolutionary groups for each gene, but with occasional mixing of genes, consistent with a species that evolves by recombination.
