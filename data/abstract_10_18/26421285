Using the phage display biopanning technique, we have previously identified a heptapeptide KLWVIPQ which specifically binds to the surface of the IFN-alpha-sensitive but not the IFN-alpha-resistant CML cells. The effects of this heptapeptide on the IFN-alpha-sensitive CML cells were investigated in the present study. IFN-alpha-sensitive KT-1/A3 and IFN-alpha-resistant KT-1/A3R CML cells were transfected by pEGFP-KLWVIPQ expression vector and/or induced by IFN-alpha. WST-1 cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry, and western blotting were performed to determine the effects of this heptapeptide and/or IFN-alpha on CML cells. The viability of the KT-1/A3 cells was inhibited and apoptosis was induced by either expression of the heptapeptide KLWVIPQ or IFN-alpha treatment with concurrent upregulation of P53 and downregulation of P210(bcr/abl). However, these effects were not observed in the IFN-alpha-resistant KT-1/A3R cells. These results suggest that the heptapeptide KLWVIPQ shares a similar mechanism with IFN-alpha in the regulation of CML cell growth and apoptosis, implying that the heptapeptide KLWVIPQ could be a novel target to go further into mechanisms of IFN-alpha sensitivity and/or resistance in CML.
