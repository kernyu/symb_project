The aim of this study was comparison of the susceptibility to antibiotics of E. coli strains with K1 antigen (E. coli K1+) and non-K1 E. coli strains (E. coli K1-). This study included 67 of E. coli K1+ and 67 of E. coli K1- strains isolated in the time period from June to September of 2008 from pregnant women and newborns hospitalized at dr. J. Biziel University Hospital number 2 L. Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun. Antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli strains was tested by the disc-diffusion method, on the Mueller Hinton 2 Agar (Becton Dickinson). It was found that 64,2% of E. coli K1+ strains and 53,7% of E. coli K1-strains were susceptible to all tested antibiotics and chemioterapeutics. E. coli K1- strains were more often than E. coli K1+ nonsusceptible to at least one antimicrobial agent. The obtained results indicate that E. coli K1+ strains significant differed in the susceptibility to ampicillin/sulbactam (85,1% versus 95,5%) (p=0,041), cephalothin (70,1% versus 85,1%) (p=0,038) and tetracycline (91,0% versus 74,6%) (p=0,012) from E. coli K1-strains. All tested E. coli K1+ and K1-strains were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, amikacin, netilmicin and tigecycline. There weren't the ESBL-producing strains among tested E. coli K1+ and K1- rods.
