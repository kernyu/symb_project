Campylobacter species are among the most frequently identified bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis. Because Campylobacter spp. harbored by cattle can be transmitted to humans, in this study we investigated antimicrobial resistance of thermophilic Campylobacter isolated from cows. Our study included 150 strains of Campylobacter (143 strains of C. jejuni and 7 strains of C. coli) isolated from cows in South-Western Poland. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin and tetracycline were determined using the agar dilution methodology. All strains of C. coli were susceptible to all four drugs studied. The most frequently detected resistance of C. jejuni was to ciprofloxacin (26 strains 18.2%). Resistance to tetracycline was observed in 5 strains (3.5%). All strains of C. jejuni were susceptible to erythromycin and gentamicin.
