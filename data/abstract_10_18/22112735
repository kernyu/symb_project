INTRODUCTION: Studies on the carriage rate of beta-hemolytic streptococci among children form an important component of public health practice to prevent disease complications such as rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease, nephritis, and other local or systemic infections. METHODOLOGY: Throat swabs collected from asymptomatic schoolchildren were inoculated into appropriate media for isolation of beta-hemolytic streptococci. They were identified by standard biochemical methods and sero-grouped. Antibiotic sensitivity was evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 106 (7.7%) out of the 1,384 throat swabs and Group F was the predominant sero-group isolated. The highest resistance observed among all the beta-hemolytic streptococci was to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
