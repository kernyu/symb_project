In the present paper, we analyse the effect of a primary infection of ICR mice with Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) on the generation of resistance against homologous challenge infections. In ICR mice, E. caproni induces chronic infections concomitantly with strong responses characterized by the development of T-helper 1 (Th1)-type local immune responses with elevated levels of local interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and inflammatory and antibody responses. Here, the effect of the response generated against a primary infection with E. caproni in the generation of resistance against subsequent homologous infections was analysed. For this purpose, ICR mice were challenged with metacercariae of E. caproni and the results obtained showed that primary infection induces partial resistance against subsequent homologous infections in ICR mice. This resistance was expressed as a reduced rate of infection, worm recovery and worm size, indicating that primary infection induces changes in the host, making a hostile environment for the development of the parasite.
