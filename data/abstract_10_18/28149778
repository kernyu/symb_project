AIM: To analyze the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings of infectious keratitis. METHODS: A retrospective study on cases of infective keratitis, attended our institution from Mar. 2013 to Feb. 2015, was done at Mansoura Ophthalmic Center, Egypt. Corneal scrapings were performed and processed for direct microscopy and culture in appropriate media using standard laboratory protocols. RESULTS: Out of 245 patients enrolled for study, 247 corneal scrapings were obtained. Ocular trauma was the most common predisposing factor (51.4%), followed by diabetes mellitus (15.1%). Cultures were positive in 110 scraping samples (44.5%): 45.5% samples had pure fungal infection, 40% had pure bacterial infections and 10% had mixed fungal and bacterial growths. Acanthamoeba was detected in 5 (4.5%) samples. The most common fungal pathogen was Aspergillus spp. (41%). The most common bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (38.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.8%). CONCLUSION: Incidence of fungal keratitis is high in our region. Therapeutic approach can initially be based on clinical features and sensitivity/resistance patterns. Microbiological research should direct the antimicrobial treatment. Antibiotic resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides is an important consideration.
