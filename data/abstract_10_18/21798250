Antibiotic resistance issues necessitate the continued discovery and development of new antibacterial agents. Efforts are ongoing in two approaches to find new compounds that are effective against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. These efforts involve modification of existing classes including fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, and beta-lactams and identification of inhibitors against previously unexploited antibacterial targets. Examples of both approaches are described here with emphasis on compounds in late pre-clinical or clinical stages of development.
