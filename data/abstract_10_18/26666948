CPS-1 is a subclass B3 metallo-beta-lactamase from a Chryseobacterium piscium isolate collected from soil, showing 68% amino acid identity to the GOB-1 enzyme. CPS-1 was overproduced in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3), purified by chromatography, and biochemically characterized. This enzyme exhibits a broad-spectrum substrate profile, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, which overall resembles those of L1, GOB-1, and acquired subclass B3 enzymes AIM-1 and SMB-1.
