Data correlating beta-lactamases found in commensal Escherichia coli of human and animal origin are limited. In this study, 447 commensal E. coli isolates from the faeces of humans and swine (280 human isolates from four hospitals and 167 swine isolates from seven farms) were collected between September 2006 and January 2009 in western China. For extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and other cephalosporin-resistant isolates, the relevant beta-lactamase genes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M-1/2/9) group, bla(CMY-2) and bla(KPC)) were detected by PCR analysis. Of the 447 isolates tested, 120 (26.8 %) were confirmed as producing ESBL. Among these, 70 and 40 human isolates carried a member of the bla(CTX-M-1 )group (13 bla(CTX-M-3), 21 bla(CTX-M-15), four bla(CTX-M-22), eight bla(CTX-M-28), four bla(CTX-M-36), 15 bla(CTX-M-55) and five bla(CTX-M-69)) or bla(SHV) (14 bla(SHV-2), seven bla(SHV-5), ten bla(SHV-12), five bla(SHV-57) and four bla(SHV-97)),respectively, whilst six and four swine isolates carried a member of the bla(CTX-M-1 )group (one bla(CTX-M-15) and five bla(CTX-M-22)) or bla(SHV) (three bla(SHV-2) and one bla(SHV-12)), respectively. Furthermore, 59 human and swine isolates and seven human isolates carried bla(CMY-2) and bla(KPC), respectively. These findings indicate that the bla(CTX-M-1) group, including the novel variant bla(CTX-M-69), and bla(SHV) are the predominant ESBL genes in both humans and swine in western China, and bla(CMY-2) is also common in both groups. The carriage rates of broad-spectrum beta-lactamases among commensal E. coli was much lower in swine than in humans, suggesting that beta-lactamase genes have not established themselves in animal ecosystems in western China.
