BACKGROUND: The increase of antimicrobial resistances to first- and second-line antibiotics, especially of Gram-negative bacteria, and the lack of novel antimicrobial substances are a challenge in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. METHODS: Review article. RESULTS: The efficacy and safety of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in visceral surgery has been demonstrated by several meta-analyses. Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is defined as a single administration of antibiotics shortly before a surgical intervention. A so-called prolonged prophylaxis including the postoperative period (e.g. 1-3 days postoperatively) should be avoided as it does not reduce the number of wound infections and is associated with an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance and side effects. Antimicrobial management of severe intra-abdominal infections involves a delicate balance of optimizing empirical therapy which has been shown to improve outcomes while simultaneously reducing unnecessary use of antimicrobials. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance poses a serious threat to human health and requires a rational use of antibiotics to curb further spreading. This applies for perioperative prophylaxis as well as for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
