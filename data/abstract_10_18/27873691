The environment in a Lebanese tertiary-level care hospital was examined for bacterial contamination. In total, 8 open-air and 62 surface samples were taken and CFU were enumerated. Morphologically different isolates (n=104) were obtained and tested for resistance to a wide range of antibiotics by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Minimum bactericidal concentrations of isolates to seven different biocides used within this facility were also determined using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Gram-positive bacteria (82.7% of isolates) were encountered more often than Gram-negative bacteria (17.3%), and the genus Staphylococcus was most prevalent among isolates (59.6% of the isolates). Gram-positive isolates showed the highest resistance to penicillin (60.6%), clindamycin (54.5%) and ceftazidime (39.4%); the lowest frequencies of resistance were seen with vancomycin (0% of isolates), nitrofurantoin (3.5%), tetracycline (12.1%) and ciprofloxacin (12.1%). The prevalence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and meticillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci among all environmental samples was 3.8% and 11.5% of isolates, respectively. All Gram-negative isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). With respect to biocides, the highest frequency of resistance was to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) (13.5% of isolates) and the lowest frequency of resistance was to QAC/biguanide complex (<1% of isolates) and Anios DVA (3.8%). MDR bacteria can pose a serious threat in the hospital environment, showing the need for prudent use of antibiotics and correct infection control procedures.
