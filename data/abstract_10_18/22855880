Development of antiviral resistance is a particular concern for the Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infections (ARHAI). Over the last 4 years, considerable time has been devoted to examining the ability of the UK to monitor the presence and transmission of antiviral resistance. Resistances to antiviral agents in influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses were identified as the main targets. The emphasis is on a network of laboratories that are able to perform diagnostic tests for resistance and to participate in surveillance programmes with co-ordination either through a central reference facility in the HPA or a collaborative study group.
