Hepatic steatosis is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome because of increased hepatic triglyceride content. We have reported previously that deficiency of response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) prevents high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice. This study was conducted to determine the role of RGC-32 in the regulation of hepatic steatosis. We observed that hepatic RGC-32 was induced dramatically by both HFD challenge and ethanol administration. RGC-32 knockout (RGC32(-/-)) mice were resistant to HFD- and ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis. The hepatic triglyceride content of RGC32(-/-) mice was decreased significantly compared with WT controls even under normal chow conditions. Moreover, RGC-32 deficiency decreased the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). RGC-32 deficiency also decreased SCD1 activity, as indicated by decreased desaturase indices of the liver and serum. Mechanistically, insulin and ethanol induced RGC-32 expression through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, which, in turn, increased SCD1 expression in a SREBP-1c-dependent manner. RGC-32 also promoted SREBP-1c expression through activating liver X receptor. These results demonstrate that RGC-32 contributes to the development of hepatic steatosis by facilitating de novo lipogenesis through activating liver X receptor, leading to the induction of SREBP-1c and its target genes. Therefore, RGC-32 may be a potential novel drug target for the treatment of hepatic steatosis and its related diseases.
