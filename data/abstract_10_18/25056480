KEY MESSAGE: Our studies indicate a potential important elicitor candidate which can aid in the fight against a worldwide disease, rice blast. In this study, we report the purification, identification, characterization, and gene cloning of a novel hypersensitive response-inducing protein elicitor (MoHrip2) secreted from an important pathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. The protein fraction was isolated from the culture filtrate of M. oryzae and identified by de novo sequencing. The elicitor-encoding gene mohrip2 was cloned following sequence comparison and PCR amplification. This 459-bp gene encodes a 152-residue polypeptide that contains an 18-residue signal peptide and exhibits a pI of 4.72 and an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa. The hypothetical protein, MoHrip2, was expressed in Escherichia coli, and both the recombinant and the endogenous protein caused necrotic lesions in tobacco leaves. In addition to phenolic compound deposition and alkalization of the extracellular medium, MoHrip2 also induced hydrogen peroxide production and nitric oxide accumulation in tobacco cells. Moreover, rice seedlings treated with MoHrip2 exhibited pronounced resistance to M. oryzae compared with control seedlings.
