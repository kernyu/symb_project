Malaria is a potentially lethal disease caused by species of the plasmodium parasite. Despite the advances in the interventions for its control and approaches to manage fatality, morbidity and mortality rates associated with malaria are still high. At present, artemisinin-based combination therapy is the first line of treatment. However, there is the need to explore newer approaches as reduced effectiveness and multi-drug resistance (even to artemisinin) has been reported in some regions and is expected to widen in scope. Phytomedicines have shown promise for the management of this debilitating disease and there are abundant resources in most of the areas where this disease is endemic. This report would systematically review the literature, emphasizing the challenges encountered in the control of malaria, active phytochemicals currently utilised in the management, drug delivery approaches as well as the nanotechnology-based systems that could be exploited in its treatment. These phytomedicines, either delivered conventionally or via the use of advanced delivery systems may suggest new strategies towards the better management of malaria.
