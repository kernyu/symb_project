Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to interact with cancer cells through direct cell-to-cell contact and secretion of paracrine factors, although their exact influence on tumor progression in vivo remains unclear. To better understand how fetal and adult stem cells affect tumors, we analyzed viability of human renal (786-0) and bladder (T24) carcinoma cell lines cultured in conditioned media harvested from amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSCs) and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). Both media reduced metabolic activity of 786-0 cells, however, decreased viability of T24 cells was noted only after incubation with conditioned medium from ASCs. To test the hypothesis that MSCs-secreted factors might be involved in chemoresistance acquisition, we further analyzed influence of mesenchymal stem cell conditioned media (MSC-CM) on cancer cells sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, that is considered as potential candidate agent for urinary tract cancers treatment. Significantly increased resistance to tested drug indicates that MSCs may protect cancer cells from chemotherapy. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 1361-1368, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
