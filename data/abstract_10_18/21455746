Both the World Health Organization and the United States Department of Health and Human Services have recently substantially revised perinatal HIV treatment guidelines based on emerging data, much of it from the developing world. Management of HIV infection in pregnancy and delivery is complicated by concerns for maternal and fetal drug toxicity, acquisition of antiretroviral resistance, prior therapy, co-infections with other viruses, as well as incident opportunistic infections. Intrapartum and peripartum obstetric management, including the role of Caesarean section, continue to evolve in the setting of maternal HIV infection. Finally, new data have expanded the role of antiviral therapy in allowing safer infant feeding choices for HIV-infected mothers in resource-limited settings.
