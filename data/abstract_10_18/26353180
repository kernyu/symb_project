BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in SLC11A1/NRAMP1 have shown an important association with susceptibility to tuberculosis and progression to active disease. However, whether there is an association of these polymorphisms with treatment failure is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the association of SLC11A1 polymorphisms with treatment failure in Mexican subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: Thirty-three subjects with treatment failure were paired by age and body mass index with 33 patients who successfully completed treatment and were considered cured. We assessed the polymorphisms of SLC11A1 in the regions of D543N and INT4 via polymerase chain reaction real-time TaqMan(R) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. RESULTS: We found that D543N (G/A genotype) was associated with treatment failure in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [odds ratio (OR) 11.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.66-36.78]. When adjusted by gender, this association remained significant in males (OR 11.09, 95% CI 3.46-35.51). CONCLUSIONS: In our male population, the presence of the D543N polymorphism of SLC11A1 is a risk factor for treatment failure. This finding should be confirmed in other populations.
