Staphylococcus lugdunensis can cause virulent infections in immunosuppressed individuals. This report describes the first known case of hospital acquired pneumonia and septicemia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus lugdunensis in a newborn at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital, North Western Ethiopia. The strain was simultaneously resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline (30 ug), chloramphenicol (30 ug), gentamycin (10ug) and ciprofloxacin (5ug) but sensitive to erythromycin (15ug) and clindamycin (10ug).
