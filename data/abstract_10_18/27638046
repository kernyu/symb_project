The effects of ampicillin; kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline on electrophysical characteristics of cells of sensitive (ampicillin; kanamycin, chloramphenicol) and resistant (ampicillin; kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline) Escherichia coli strains were studied. Under the action of antibiotics sensitive and resistant E. coli strains acquire different electro-optical properties. Changes in suspension-orientational spectra, that are observed under the action of ampicillin; kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline can be used in determination of antibiotic resistance of the studied bacterial strains. In our opinion, the methods of microbial suspension electro-optical analysis can be used in microbiology, msmall ie, Cyrillicdicinsmall ie, Cyrillic, veterinary, and are an effective tool for solving the problems connected with determination of microbial cell antibiotic resistance.
