The use of therapeutic herbs has become of great importance these days due to the increase in drug resistance. From a long time ago the Venus' navel plant has been used to treat infections. In this study the antibacterial effect of the aqueous extract from the Quercus coccifera (jaft) herb, under laboratory conditions. This study was carried out experimentally. After collecting the Venus navel herb, it was dried in a warm dry environment away from direct sunlight in the shade. The alcoholic extract was prepared using a standard method. Clinical samples of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were acquired from Ilam's health care institutes. The inhibitory effect of the extracts was analysed in the Mueller Hinton using the disk diffusion method for both bacteria. Then MIC and MBC of the extracts was determined using the Macro broth dilution method. At its highest concentration the aqueous extract had an inhibition zone of 27.2 and 23.7 mm on staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa consecutively. The MIC and MBC for staphylococcus aureus were 10 and 12.5 microg/ml and for pseudomonas aeruginosa they were 10 and 17.5 microg/m consecutively. The results of this study show the strong antimicrobial effect of jaft's aqueous extract on staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa and if more studies are based on this topic it could be a substitute for common antibiotics.
