Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous disease and a variable percentage of patients are non-responders to common treatment. Early diagnosis of non-responders allows change to a more useful therapy for the patient and better allocates a large amount of financial resources. Quantification of Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) and of biological activity of IFN-beta are recognized approaches to identify immuno-pharmacological non-responders. A consistent number of studies have demonstrated that quantification of Myxovirus-induced protein A (MxA) is a valid biomarker to detect immune-pharmacological non responders after one year of treatment. Persistent high titre of Nabs and absence of biological activity predict abolition of IFN-beta effects in disease activity measured through MRI, number of relapses and disability. Guidelines and flow-charts including both Nabs and MxA quantification are presented.
