AIM: This study explored the incidence and aetiology of bloodstream infections after patients received the pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and a risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against early onset sepsis caused by group B streptococcus. We also monitored clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance. METHOD: We studied 3986 positive blood cultures from children up to 17 years of age at a paediatric hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, using data from medical records before and after the initiatives, to reduce early onset sepsis, were introduced in 2007 and 2008. RESULTS: Bloodstream infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by 42% overall (5.6 to 3.2/100 000) and by 62% in previously healthy children under 36 months of age (24.2 to 9.2/100 000). Early onset sepsis caused by group B streptococcus declined by 60% (0.5 to 0.2/1000 live born children). Bacterial meningitis caused by these bacteria decreased by 70%. Staphylococcus aureus and various Gram-negative bacteria became the dominant pathogens, in both previously healthy children and those with underlying disease. Overall, antimicrobial resistance remained low between the two 5-year study periods. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus effectively decreased the incidence of bloodstream infections. Empirical antibiotic therapy should target Staphylococcus aureus in both community and hospital-acquired invasive bacterial infections.
