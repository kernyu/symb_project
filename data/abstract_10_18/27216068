BKC-1 is a new class A serine carbapenemase that was recently identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates. The principal objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of blaBKC-1 by testing a collection of Klebsiella isolates. Only 2 of 635 Klebsiella isolates (0.3%) carried blaBKC-1 The two BKC-1-producing isolates belonged to clonal complex 442 and possessed identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. The blaBKC-1 gene was inserted into a 10-kb plasmid that was identical to the previously reported plasmid, p60136. The BKC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates presented also possessed other mechanisms for beta-lactam resistance, such as genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and mutations in the genes ompK35 and ompK36, encoding the major porins.
