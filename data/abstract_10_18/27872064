We compared the efficacy of telavancin (TLV) and daptomycin (DAP) in an experimental rabbit endocarditis model caused by two clinically derived daptomycin-resistant (DAP(r)) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. TLV treatment significantly reduced MRSA densities in all target tissues and increased the percentage of these organs rendered culture negative compared to those with the untreated control or DAP-treated animals. These results demonstrate that TLV has potent in vivo efficacy against DAP(r) MRSA isolates in this invasive endovascular infection model.
