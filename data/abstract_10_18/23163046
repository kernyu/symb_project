Mechanisms of resistance of bacteria genus Enterococcus to the most important factors of innate immunity of the host--antimicrobial proteins and peptides--are described in the review. Data on enterococci lysozyme resistance associated with modification of peptidoglycan and changes in the net charge of the bacterial cell surface are presented. The role of enterococci sigma-factor with extra cytoplasmic SigV function is described. Evidence on microbial activation/degradation of neutrophil alpha-defensin (HNP-1), antibacterial peptide LL-37, cecropin, beta-lysine (thrombocytic cationic peptide) is presented. The accumulated experimental material is discussed from the position of persistence of enterococci--both pathogens causing various infectious processes and commensals composing a part of normal host microflora.
