Great progress has been made in understanding the HCV genome and its molecular virology. This understanding has culminated in the development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents targeting HCV viral proteins. Telaprevir (TVR) and boceprevir (BOC) were the first DAAs introduced for treatment of genotype 1 HCV in 2011; when used in combination with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV), these protease inhibitors improved efficacy in patients with chronic HCV infection compared to the traditional dual therapy. However, this combination was associated with adverse events that often led to early termination of therapy. In late 2013, the FDA approved a second wave of DAAs, sofosbuvir (SOF) and simeprevir (SMV). The use of SOF with SMV opened the door for IFN-free combination regimens. This combination was highly efficacious and well tolerated in patients with HCV genotype 1. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (LDV) fixed-dose oral combination (FDC) therapy, and paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir +/- RBV were recently approved, elevating sustained virologic response (SVR) rates to over 95 %. We are anticipating the approval of additional IFN-free regimens with comparable efficacy and tolerability but with the addition of pangenotypic coverage, fewer drug-drug interactions, and a high barrier to resistance. This review will summarize current management for chronic HCV infection.
