BACKGROUND: Toll-Like receptors (TLRs) belong to the family of pattern-recognition receptors with a crucial function of recognising pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Cryptococcal meningitis is a potentially fatal disease with a high mortality and risk of neurological sequelae. METHODS: We studied the ability of microglial cells to increase the phagocytosis of cryptococci after stimulation with agonists of TLR1/2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR9. RESULTS: Stimulation of murine microglial cells with these TLR agonists for 24 h increased the phagocytosis of encapsulated Cryptococcus neoformans. Stimulation increased the release of TNF-alpha, CXCL1 (KC), IL-6, IL-10 and MIP-2, which indicated the activation of microglial cells. Unstimulated and TLR agonist-stimulated MyD88-deficient cells showed a reduced ability to phagocytose cryptococci compared to their wild-type counterpart. Intracellular killing of cryptococci was also increased in TLR-stimulated cells compared to unstimulated microglial cells. CONCLUSION: Our observation suggests that stimulation of microglial cells by TLR agonists can increase the resistance of the brain against CNS infections caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. This may be of interest when an immunocompromised patient is unable to eliminate Cryptococcus neoformans despite antifungal therapy.
