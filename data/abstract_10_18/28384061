We tested 772 cloacal swabs from wild ducks to estimate the prevalence of enteric bacteria resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC). We found a low prevalence of the important ESC resistance genotypes, blaCMY (5.7%) and blaCTX-M (0.3%). This suggests a minor role for wild ducks in the movement of resistant bacteria in the environment.
