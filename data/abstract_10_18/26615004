Cutaneous leishmaniasis usually presents therapeutic resistance to antimonials, and the existing therapies for leishmaniasis have many adverse effects and toxicity. Natural products may be regarded as possible candidates for alternative leishmaniasis treatment. The plant Tetradenia riparia has shown promise for the treatment of infectious diseases in folk medicine. We evaluated the antileishmanial activity of an essential oil from T. riparia (TrEO) and the modulatory effects of TrEO on cytokine modulation by peritoneal fluid cells that were infected with L. (L.) amazonensis. Peritoneal fluid cells were infected with Leishmania and incubated with TrEO (30 ng/mL) for 3, 6, and 24 h. Cytokines were screened using semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry. Antileishmanial activity was evaluated at 24 h by microscopic counting and quantitative PCR (qPCR). TrEO treatment induced the death of 50% of Leishmania amastigotes (indicated by microscopic counting) and 91% of the parasite load (indicated by qPCR). TrEO inhibited some of the most critical cytokines for parasite growth and the establishment of infection, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor. The parasite inhibited interferon-gamma and IL-12, and TrEO blocked this inhibition, indicating that these cytokines are critical for activating mechanisms associated with the death and elimination of the parasite. These results suggest that TrEO may be an alternative leishmaniasis therapy when considering its antileishmanial and immunomodulatory activity.
