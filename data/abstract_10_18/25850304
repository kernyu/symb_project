Here we describe a system based on recombinant lentiviral vectors for the safe screening of potential anti-HIV drugs. The system allows to evaluate the sensitivity of HIVl-1 reverse transcriptase and integrase (wild-type as well as mutant forms of these enzymes detected in drug-resistant virus isolates) towards different drugs and substances, but also to screen inhibitors of other stages of HIV-1 life cycle.
