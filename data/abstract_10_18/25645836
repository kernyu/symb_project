A novel New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) variant, NDM-14, was identified in clinical isolate Acinetobacter lwoffii JN49-1, which was recovered from an intensive care unit patient at a local hospital in China. NDM-14, which differs from other existing enzymes by an amino acid substitution at position 130 (Asp130Gly), possesses enzymatic activity toward carbapenems that is greater than that of NDM-1. Kinetic data indicate that NDM-14 has a higher affinity for imipenem and meropenem.
