Data on community-associated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (CA-ESBLEC) infections in Japan are scarce. We compared the clinical and microbiological epidemiology of CA-ESBLEC infections with that of healthcare-associated-ESBLEC infections among 76 patients with ESBLEC infections. We identified a high prevalence (26%) of CA-ESBLEC infections in Japan; only a small proportion (15%) of patients with CA-ESBLEC infections had recent exposure to antibiotics.
