A multiplex PCR-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) assay was developed for rapid detection of methicillin, tetracycline, and vancomycin resistance, as well as toxic shock toxin and Panton-Valentine leukocidin. The assay was tested on 470 positive blood culture bottles containing Staphylococcus aureus or enterococci. PCR-LDR exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of > or = 98% for all components except tetracycline resistance, which had a sensitivity of 94.7%. Rapid and sensitive detection of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes could help guide therapy and appropriate infection control measures.
