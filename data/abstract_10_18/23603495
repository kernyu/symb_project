Influenza virus exploits a number of cellular signaling pathways during the course of its replication, rendering them potential targets for new therapeutic interventions. Several preclinical approaches are now focusing on cellular factors or pathways as a means of treating influenza. By targeting host factors, rather than viral mechanisms, these novel therapies may be effective against multiple virus strains and subtypes, and are less likely to elicit viral drug resistance. The most promising candidates are inhibitors of intracellular signaling cascades that are essential for virus replication. This article reviews novel approaches and compounds that target the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, NF-kappaB signaling, the PI3K/Akt pathway and the PKC signaling cascade. Although these new antiviral strategies are still in an early phase of preclinical development, results to date suggest they offer a new approach to the treatment of influenza, supplementing direct-acting antiviral drugs.
