BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) cause serious infections that are difficult to treat. We carried out this study to determine the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) of linezolid when combined with minocycline against VRE strains, to determine the mechanism of drug resistance in vitro, and to provide a theoretical basis for the rational use of drugs against VRE. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of linezolid and minocycline against 30 Enterococci (E.) isolates (including 20 VRE strains) were determined by the broth microdilution method. Drug interactions were assessed by the checkerboard microdilution tests and confirmed by time-kill studies. Two vancomycin-susceptible strains N27 and N40 (linezolid MIC, 2 g/ml; minocycline MIC, 4 microg/ml) and control strains E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and ATCC 51299 were also tested. The MPCs of linezolid and minocycline (alone and combined) were determined using the agar dilution method. Strains showing stable resistance were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. RESULTS: Checkerboard titration studies revealed synergistic effects of combination therapy in 26.7% of 30 E. isolates. Antagonism was not observed. The G2576U mutation was detected in stable linezolid-resistant strains of ATCC 29212, N40, and N27 before and after resistance screening, and MIC values increased with the number of G2576U mutations. The MPC of linezolid against E. decreased dramatically when combined with minocycline, and vice versa. CONCLUSION: Linezolid or minocycline alone produce resistant strains; however, their joint use may reduce the MPC of each agent against VRE, thereby decreasing resistant mutants and bacterial infections.
