We report the presence of mcr-1 in Escherichia coli and carbapenem-resistant Cronobacter sakazakii from the same diseased chicken. The mcr-1 gene linked with ISApl1 was located on two different IncI2 plasmids, including one multidrug plasmid in E. coli, whereas fosA3-blaNDM-9 was on an IncB/O plasmid in C. sakazakii The development of the fosA3-blaNDM-9 resistance region was mediated by IS26 The colocation of mcr-1 or blaNDM-9 with other resistance genes will accelerate the dissemination of the two genes.
