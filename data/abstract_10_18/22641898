Surgical treatment is a cornerstone in the management of infective endocarditis, approximately 50% of patients should be operated in the acute phase. Surgery is indicated in heart failure by acute valvular insufficiency refractory to medica treatment, persistent sepsis despite adequate antibiotic therapy, infections by microorganisms with low response to antibiotics, paravalvular abscess or cardiac fistulas, and for prevention of cerebral embolism when large vegetations are present. Other indication in prosthetic valve endocarditis is prosthesis dysfunction including significant perivalvular leaks or obstruction. In infection of leads of electrophysiological cardiac devices material should always be removed, preferably percutaneously, surgery is indicated when it is not technically possible.
