The acquisition of beta-lactamases, such as class B metallo-beta-lactamases, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is detrimental to antimicrobial therapy in hospitalized patients. In Mexico, metallo-beta-lactamase IMP-15 has been found to be encoded on the In95 class 1 integron in a major clone of P. aeruginosa. In this work, we describe the variability of this class 1 integron in an epidemic clone of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates highly related to isolates previously described in Mexico.
