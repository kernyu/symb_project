Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of health care-associated infections. In this study, a total of 173 nurses was screened for S aureus nasal colonization, of which 8 (4.6%) were MRSA carriers. Among the MRSA isolates, 6 were mecA positive and oxacillin resistant, and 2 were mecA-positive, oxacillin-susceptible (OS-MRSA) strains. Reports of the OS-MRSA strains are increasing worldwide. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report on the occurrence of OS-MRSA strains in Iran.
