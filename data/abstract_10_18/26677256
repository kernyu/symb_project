Invasive heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (h-VISA) isolates were identified and characterized in 10 Korean hospitals from July 2009 to June 2011. The prevalence of h-VISA infections was 3.3% (42/1,289). Most (41/42) were health care-associated infections caused by strains belonging to sequence type 5. Cases of persistent bacteremia were frequent (17/42), and 30-day mortality was high (16/40).
