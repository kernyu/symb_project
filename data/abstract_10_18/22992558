Acinetobacter baumannii is an important pathogen causing infections, especially in burnt patients. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) and Metallo-Beta-Lactamase (MBL) in isolates of A. baumannii from burnt patients. One hundred-twenty-six A. baumannii strains were isolated from both male and female burnt patients admitted to Burnt Unit in Motahari hospital, Tehran. The susceptibility test was done by the disk combination technique. Disk test and disk diffusion methods were performed to confirm the production of ESBL and MBL in accordance with CLSI standard guidelines. Twenty-one percent of ceftazidime-resistance A. baumannii isolates were found to be ESBL producers. Thirty-nine percent of imipenem-resistant isolates produced MBL. Prolonged hospitalization of burnt patients made an important contribution to the incidence of resistant bacteria. The utility of an accurate surveillance for ESBL and MBL in A. baumannii isolated from burnt patients as an important step for successful antimicrobial treatment in the future.
