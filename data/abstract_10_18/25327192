Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are the most widely used drugs for the empirical treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) in Uruguay. The rates of fluoroquinolone resistance are increasing. The objective was to determine the risk factors associated with the development of community-acquired UTI caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli (ECRFQ). A descriptive, cross-sectional, prospective study of 525 patients with community-acquired UTI, who consulted at the Hospital Pasteur Emergency Department was carried. In 434 patients (82.7%) E. coli was the cause of UTI. Multivariate analysis identified as independent risk factors for the development of ECRFQ UTI, being older than 60 years (OR 2.52 95% CI 1.35 to 4.72), having obstructive uropathy (OR 2 09 95% CI 1.03 to 4.28) with recurrent UTI history (OR 2.98 95% CI 1.55 to 5.76) and / or use of FQ in the previous 3 months (OR 4.27 95% CI 1.88 to 9.71). Patients with these characteristics have a higher risk of ECRFQ UTI and should be treated with alternative drugs.
