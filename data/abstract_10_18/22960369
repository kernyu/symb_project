November 18th 2012 is the fifth annual European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD), an opportunity to raise public and professional awareness about the importance of prudent antibiotic use, and the threat of antibiotic resistance to public health. The aims of EAAD have been supported and reinforced by antibiotic stewardship campaigns across Europe, aimed at both healthcare professionals, and the public. Within the UK, antimicrobial stewardship is embedded within the Health and Social Care Act 2008, and is taken into account by the Care Quality Commission when making decisions about registration. The Department of Health Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection has recently produced guidance for antimicrobial stewardship in hospitals, 'Start Smart - then Focus', and the Royal College of General Practitioners has agreed antimicrobial stewardship as a clinical priority for 3 years, providing educational and audit materials, and tools to help general practitioners in patient consultations, to manage public demand for antibiotics when not clinically indicated. British Infection Association members need to be familiar with these initiatives and resources, and are encouraged to lead on local initiatives within their own workplaces and communities.
