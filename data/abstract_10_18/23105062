Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is one of the most prevalent serovars of Salmonella that causes human gastroenteritis. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of the S. Typhimurium multidrug-resistant strain ST1660/06. Comparative genomic analysis unveiled three strain-specific genomic islands that potentially confer the multidrug resistance and virulence of the strain.
