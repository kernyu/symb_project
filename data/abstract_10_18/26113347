OBJECTIVE: To compare the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of three common mastitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis and Str. dysgalactiae) isolated from milk samples from New Zealand and the USA. METHODS: A total of 182 S. aureus, 126 Str. uberis and 89 Str. dysgalactiae isolates from New Zealand (107, 106 and 41, respectively) and the USA (75, 20 and 48, respectively) were assessed using the disk diffusion test. RESULTS: Susceptibility varied among the bacterial species. All isolates were susceptible to the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination. Resistance to lincomycin was most frequent (susceptibility of 8.6%) across all species. Non-susceptible (i.e. resistant or intermediate) isolates of S. aureus were identified for the three non-isoxazolyl penicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin and penicillin: 20.6% and 36.0%) and lincomycin (99.9% and 94.6%) for NZ and the USA, respectively. Resistance to erythromycin (5.3%) and tetracyclines (6.7%) was detected only in isolates from the USA. There were differences in susceptibility between Str. uberis and Str. dysgalactiae; all streptococcal isolates demonstrated resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin 52.4% and streptomycin 27.9%) and enrofloxacin (28%). Resistance of Str. dysgalactiae to tetracycline was almost 100.0% and to oxytetracycline 89.9%. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Most of the isolates tested were susceptible to most of the antimicrobials commonly used for treatment of bovine mastitis, with the exception of the lincosamides. Susceptibility to a selected class-representative antimicrobial and at the genus level should be interpreted with caution. Differences between NZ and the USA confirm the value of national surveys to determine the susceptibility patterns of mastitis pathogens.
