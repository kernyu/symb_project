A moderate growing strain designated as MPKL 26(T) was isolated from a soil sample of Bidar Fort, Karnataka, India. The strain MPKL 26(T) was Gram positive, bent rod in shape. The optimum pH and temperature for growth was 7.0 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain MPKL 26(T) was closely related to S. atrocyanea DSM 20127(T) (98.09%), S. flava CW 108(T) (98.04%), S. soli CW 59(T) (97.99%) and S. notoginsengisoli SYP-B575(T) (97.0%) and showed DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness (46.05+/-1.2, 33.56+/-2.55, 32.56+/-1.7 and 26.79+/-2.5, respectively, between these strains) less than the threshold value for the delineation of genomic species. The peptidoglycon type was A3alpha type with glycine, alanine, lysine and glutamic acid as the amino acids. The whole-cell sugars were fructose, ribose, mannose, glucose and galactose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol along with three unknown polar lipids. The fatty acid profile contained C14:0, C16:0, iso-C14:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, iso-C17:0, anteiso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0 and summed feature 4 (17:1 iso I/anteiso B). The predominant respiratory quinine was MK-9(H2) with MK-10(H2), MK-8(H2) and MK-8(H4) as minor respiratory quinines. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.8 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular characteristics, the strain MPKL 26(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sinomonas, for which the name Sinomonas mesophila sp. nov. is proposed with MPKL 26(T) as the type strain (=NCIM 5552(T)= JCM 30094(T)).
