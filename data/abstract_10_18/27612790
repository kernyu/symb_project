A water resistant surface was first obtained by immobilizing hydrophobic copolymers, poly (styrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PSG), with functional groups on soy protein isolate (SPI) films. XPS and AFM results showed that PSG copolymers were immobilized on the film by chemical bonding, and formed a rough surface with some bumps because of the segregation of two different phases on PSG copolymers. Water resistance of the modified films could be adjusted dramatically by further immobilizing different amounts of guanidine-based antimicrobial polymers, poly (hexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride) (PHMG) on the resulting hydrophobic surface. The introduction of hydrophilic PHMG on the resulting surface generated many micropores, which potentially increased the water uptake of the modified films. Furthermore, the modified SPI films showed higher thermostability compared to native SPI film and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by contact killing, attributed to the presence of PHMG on the surface. The modified SPI film with a multi-functional surface showed potential for applications in the packaging and medical fields.
