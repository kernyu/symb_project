AIMS: To investigate the tetracycline resistance related to tet genes in Aeromonas isolates collected from water and diseased fish in South Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 34 Aeromonas strains were examined for their susceptibility to tetracycline using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, and the genetic determinants (tetA to E) were analysed. Among these strains, the tetA and tetE genes were predominant (tetA was found in six strains, and tetE was found in nine strains), and 15 strains were tetracycline-resistant by the MIC assay. Additionally, the 8979-bp plasmid that contains the tetE gene was fully sequenced. CONCLUSIONS: These data may be important with regard to the spread and persistence of tetracycline resistance genes in the bacterial populations that are present in aquaculture systems. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Interestingly, no isolate has previously been shown to harbour three tet genes that are mediated by efflux systems, but the tetA, tetD and tetE genes were all isolated from one strain, which had the highest MIC value for tetracycline among the strains analysed in this study. We also investigated the full-length plasmid that encoded the tetE gene from a tetracycline-resistant strain.
