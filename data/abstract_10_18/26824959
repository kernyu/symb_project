Using aGalleria mellonellaanimal model, we compared the virulence of two sequence type 258 (ST258) KPC-producingKlebsiella pneumoniaestrains, which were representative of the two clades of this clonal lineage, with that of isogenic colistin-resistantmgrBmutants. With both strains, themgrBmutants did not exhibit modification in virulence. In theG. mellonellamodel, the clade 1 strain (capsular typecps-1[wzi29, producing KPC-2]) was significantly more virulent than the clade 2 strain (capsular typecps-2[wzi154, producing KPC-3]).
