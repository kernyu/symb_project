The Australian Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory Network collects and analyses laboratory data on new cases of disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. In 2011, a total of 1,057 cases were identified bacteriologically; an annual reporting rate of 4.6 cases per 100,000 population. Eighteen children aged less than 15 years plus an additional 11 children from the Torres Strait Protected Zone had bacteriologically-confirmed tuberculosis. Results of in vitro drug susceptibility testing were available for 1,056 isolates for isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. A total of 107 (10.0%) isolates of M. tuberculosis were resistant to at least one of these anti-tuberculosis agents. Resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin (defined as multi-drug resistance, MDR) was detected in 25 (2.4%) isolates; 18 were from the respiratory tract (sputum n=14, bronchoscopy n=3, tissue n=1). Ten (55.6%) of the MDR-TB-positive sputum specimens were smear-positive, as was a single sample from a lymph node. Ten patients with MDR-TB were Papua New Guinea (PNG) nationals in the Torres Strait Protected Zone. If these PNG nationals are excluded from the analysis, the underlying MDR-TB rate in Australia was 1.4%. No cases of extensively drug-resistant TB (defined as MDR-TB with additional resistance to a fluoroquinolone and an injectable agent) were detected in 2011.
