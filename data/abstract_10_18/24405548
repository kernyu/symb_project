OBJECTIVE: To explore the antitumor effects of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) plus docetaxel (Doc) on PC3 and DU145 cells and its mechanism. METHODS: The proliferation of cells was detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Then propidium iodide (PI) staining measured apoptotic cells on flow cytometry. ATP assay kit was used to detect ATP content. The expressions of proteins ubiquitinated protein (Ub) and Hsp70 were measured by Western blot. RESULTS: 2-DG could inhibit proliferation of PC3 and DU145 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, it could not induce apoptosis in PC3 or DU145. The inhibition rates for PC3 proliferation at 48 h by Doc with concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5 nmol/L were 10.71%, 25.32% and 56.46% respectively. The inhibition rates for DU145 cell proliferation at 48h by Doc with concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5 nmol/L were 12.28%, 23.94% and 63.43% respectively. The inhibition rates for PC3 cell proliferation by Doc plus 2-DG with a concentration of 1.0 g/L were 27.15%, 58.74% and 87.95% respectively and 29.53%, 59.41%, and 90.48% for DU145 respectively. 2-DG could enhance the effectiveness of inhibition to PC3 and DU145 proliferation by Doc with a synergistic manner (all q>1.15). The apoptotic rates for PC3 and DU145 induced by Doc 0.5 nmol/L plus 2-DG 1.0 g/L at 48 h were 46.49% and 53.64% respectively. The apoptotic rates were significantly higher than Doc 0.5 nmol/L alone (21.30% for PC3 and 18.92% for DU145 respectively) (P < 0.05). The ATP relative concentration for PC3 in 2-DG 1.0 g/L at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h were 13.75, 11.23, 10.19, 9.81 and 9.02 and for DU145 15.00, 12.59, 11.38, 10.54 and 10.37 respectively. Simultaneously, Western blot showed that Ub and Hsp70 protein were expressed intensively. CONCLUSIONS: 2-DG can enhance the sensitivity of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells to docetaxel. Its mechanism may be associated with the decrease of proteasome function.
