Most members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are important human opportunistic pathogens. Although progress has been achieved on the taxonomy and molecular identification of these bacteria, the molecular mechanisms of Bcc pathogenicity remain unclear and little development is made for new therapeutic agents. As Bcc is resistant to many common clinically-relevant antibiotics, revealing its virulence determinants is therefore very important to develop novel antibiotics or alternative anti-infective therapies. In this review, we summarize current advances in principal virulence determinants, limitations and genetic tools for studies of pathogenesis of Bcc. We primarily focus on key pathogenicity factors, including innate resistance to antibiotics, protein secretion system, and quorum-sensing systems.
