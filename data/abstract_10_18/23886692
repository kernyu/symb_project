The aim of the study was to characterize ABC transport proteins gene expression and efflux activities in gills and hemocytes of the Mediterranean mussel and to evaluate their response to Cd. At basal level a higher expression of abcb-like gene was observed in gills than in hemocytes while abcc-like gene showed similar levels. Both P-gp and MRPs inhibitors (cyclosporine and MK571) blocked efflux activities in gills; hemocytes were sensitive only to MK571. After 120 min in vitro pre-exposure to CdCl2, the efflux activity increased significantly in gills and hemocytes. In vivo exposure to CdCl2 (0.4 muM) increased abcb-like gene expression in gills without affecting efflux activity. In hemocytes abcc-like gene resulted up-regulated and Ca-AM efflux resulted enhanced. An increased uptake of Cd in gills biopsies was observed in the presence of both P-gp and MRPs inhibitors. Our results indicate that ABC transporters seem involved in the first protective response to Cd and this response is tissue-specific.
