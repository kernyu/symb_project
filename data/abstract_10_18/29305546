We describe results from a multicenter study evaluating the Accelerate Pheno system, a first of its kind diagnostic system that rapidly identifies common bloodstream pathogens from positive blood cultures within 90 minutes and determines bacterial phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results within approximately seven h. A combination of fresh clinical and seeded blood cultures were tested and results from the Accelerate Pheno system were compared to VITEK(R) 2 for identification (ID) and broth microdilution or disk diffusion for AST. The Accelerate Pheno system accurately identified 14 common bacterial pathogens and two Candida spp. with sensitivities ranging from 94.6-100%. Of fresh positive blood cultures, 89% received a monomicrobial call with a positive predictive value of 97.3%.Six common Gram-positive cocci were evaluated for ID. Five were tested against eight antibiotics and two resistance-phenotypes [lsqb]methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus spp. (MRSA/MRS) and inducible clindamycin resistance (MLSb)[rsqb]. From the 4,142 AST results, the overall essential agreement (EA) and categorical agreement (CA) were 97.6% and 97.9%, respectively. Overall very major (VME), major (ME) and minor (mE) error rates were 1.0%, 0.7% and 1.3%, respectively.Eight species of Gram-negative rods were evaluated against 15 antibiotics. From the 6,331 AST results, overall EA and CA were 95.4% and 94.3%, respectively. Overall VME, ME and mE rates were 0.5%, 0.9% and 4.8%, respectively. The Accelerate Pheno system has the unique ability to identify and provide phenotypic minimum inhibitory concentration and categorical AST results in a few hours directly from positive blood culture bottles and support accurate antimicrobial adjustment.
