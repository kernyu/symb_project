We have designed and fabricated a microecology to mimic a naturally occurring bacterial culture, which includes the stress gradient, metapopulation, and cellular motility. In this microecology, we show that it is possible to fix the resistance to the mutagenic antibiotic Ciprofloxacin in wild-type Escherichia coli within 10 h. We found the evolution of resistance is further accelerated in microecology if bacteria have already acquired the phenotype of growth advantage at the stationary phase (GASP).
