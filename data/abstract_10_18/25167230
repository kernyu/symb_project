PURPOSE: To determine whether penetrating scleral or corneal injury can enhance intraocular penetration of systemic moxifloxacin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. METHODS: Thirty rabbits were divided into 3 groups for each antibiotic and then further subdivided to receive either scleral or corneal injury to the right eye. The left eye served as a control. Intravenous antibiotics were given following injury, and eyes were subsequently enucleated. Vitreous antibiotic concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Plasma concentration was measured for comparison. RESULTS: Intravitreal moxifloxacin concentration was unchanged by injury. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) was achieved in the vitreous against the most common gram-positive endophthalmitis-causing organisms. Intravitreal vancomycin levels were not enhanced by injury and did not reach the MIC90 for gram-positive organisms commonly causing intraocular infection. Intravitreal ceftazidime was increased in the injured eyes, 67% and 73% higher in scleral and corneal injury eyes. It reached MIC90 of many gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal antibiotic penetration of systemic antibiotics with or without penetrating ocular injury varies depending on the antibiotic. For prevention or treatment of gram-positive-bacteria-causing endophthalmitis, intravitreal vancomycin is necessary and provides the most reliable coverage. Systemic ceftazidime can be used for many gram-negative bacteria, but intravitreal injection is recommended for better coverage, especially for more-potent organisms. Systemic moxifloxacin can be considered for most gram-positive and -negative infections due to its excellent intraocular penetration and broad coverage, but the patient's previous history of its topical use and increasing resistance patterns must be considered.
