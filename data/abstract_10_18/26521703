BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a frequent cause of orthopedic surgical site infections (SSIs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a bundle approach in the prevention of orthopedic MRSA SSIs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MRSA active surveillance and decolonization were performed preoperatively at our institution from July 2004 until 2007. In January 2008, a bundle approach comprising contact precautions for MRSA-positive patients and cefazolin-based antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) stewardship was implemented. Data on the prevalence of MRSA SSIs, antimicrobial use density, duration of AMP, and the use of an alcohol antiseptic agent (L/1,000 patient-days) were evaluated during 2 periods: July 2004-December 2007 (period A) and January 2008-December 2012 (period B). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The MRSA SSI rate during period B (0.97%; 19 out of 1,966) was significantly lower than that during period A (2.17%; 29 out of 1,333; P = .003). The infection rate correlated negatively with both the cefazolin antimicrobial use density (r = -0.76; P = .0002) and the use of an alcohol antiseptic agent (r = -0.68; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: An infection-prevention bundle consisting of contact precautions for carriers and AMP stewardship in addition to active surveillance was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of orthopedic MRSA SSIs.
