We investigated the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance among HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive patients in Guangxi, southern China. A total of 144 subjects from Liuzhou or Nanning, two cities having the most HIV-infected cases in Guangxi, were enrolled. HIV-1 pol fragments were amplified and sequenced from plasma of all patients. In all, 124 sequences were obtained, with 67 from Liuzhou and 57 from Nanning. All sequences were subtyped by phylogenetic analysis and analyzed for antiretroviral resistance using the HIVdb program. Our data showed that the sequences from Liuzhou were subtyped as CRF01_AE (77.6%), CRF07_BC(20.9%), and BC (1.5%), respectively, and the sequences from Nanning as CRF01_AE (78.9%), CRF08_BC (15.8%), B (3.5%), and C (1.8%), respectively. Of the sequences 11.9% from Liuzhou and 28.1% from Nanning harbored drug resistance-associated mutations, but there were only two sequences with mutations associated with significantly reduced phenotypic susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs.
