The purpose of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of a series of 33 Prevotella strains isolated from patients with abscesses in the head and neck spaces, presented to one Romanian hospital. The Etest was applied to determine the value of the minimum inhibitory concentrations for: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, metronidazole and clindamycin. In addition, the beta-lactamase activity was detected by the chromogenic cephalosporin disc method. The results indicated that 11 isolates were resistant to both penicillin G and ampicillin due to the beta-lactamase production. All the 33 Prevotella strains were susceptible to the other 3 antimicrobial agents tested, except for only one penicillin G - ampicillin resistant isolate of Prevotella buccae (MIC > 32 and MIC = 12 mg/L, respectively), which showed high resistance to clindamycin (MIC > 256 mg/L) too. Our data underline the necessity for antimicrobial testing including monitoring of beta-lactamase production in cases of oro-maxillo-facial mixed anaerobic infections where antimicrobial treatment is required in addition to the surgical drainage. The results of the study indicated that amoxicillin-clavulanate, like metronidazole, was fully active against the tested Prevotella strains. However, local and multicentre surveys on drug resistance among the clinically significant anaerobic isolates should be carried out periodically.
