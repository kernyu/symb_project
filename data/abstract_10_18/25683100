Plants recognize certain microbial compounds as elicitors in their active defence mechanisms. It has been shown that a series of defence reactions are induced in potato plant cells after treatment with water-soluble hyphal wall components prepared from Phytophthora infestans. In this study, a methanol extract from mycelia of P. infestans (MEM), which contains lipophilic compounds, was used as another elicitor for the induction of the defence reactions in potato. MEM elicitor induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially O2(-) and H2O2 production, and nitric oxide (NO) generation in potato leaves and suspension-cultured cells. Hypersensitive cell death was detected in potato leaves within 6-8 h after MEM elicitor treatment. The accumulation of phytoalexins was detected by MEM elicitor treatment in potato tubers. In potato suspension-cultured cells, several defence-related genes were induced by MEM elicitors, namely Strboh, Sthsr203J, StPVS3, StPR1, and StNR5, which regulate various defence-related functions. Enhanced resistance against P. infestans was found in MEM-treated potato plants. These results suggested that MEM elicitor is recognized by host and enhances defence activities to produce substances inhibitory to pathogens.
