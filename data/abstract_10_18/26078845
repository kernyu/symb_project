PURPOSE: To assess the rates of infectious complications before and after the change of prophylactic antibiotic regimens in prostate needle biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 5,577 patients who underwent prostate needle biopsy at Asan Medical Center between August 2005 and July 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Group 1 (n=1,743) included patients treated between 2005 and 2009 with fluoroquinolone for 3 days, group 2 (n=2,723) included those treated between 2009 and 2012 with ceftriaxone once before the biopsy and fluoroquinolone before biopsy and continue therapy for 3 days, and group 3 (n=1,111) received the same treatment for more than 7 days after the biopsy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models addressed risk factors associated with infectious complication after prostate needle biopsy. RESULTS: Infectious complication after prostate needle biopsy developed in 18 (group 1), seven (group 2), and two patients (group 3) (p=0.001). In group 1, seven patients with infectious complication had positive blood cultures and harbored fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli, four had ceftriaxone susceptible isolates, and three had extended spectrum beta-lactamase-positive E. coli. Two patients in group 1 required intensive care because of septic shock. In multivariable analysis, the patients with combination of fluoroquinolone and ceftriaxone had significantly lower infectious complication rate than the fluoroquinolon alone (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prophylaxis with ceftriaxone and fluoroquinolone before prostate needle biopsy decreased the risk of potentially serious infectious complications.
