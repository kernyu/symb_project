PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Public health control of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is dependent on the delivery of effective therapy and so will be compromised by the emergence of resistance. The scope of the problem and the implications for treatment that follow are discussed in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging resistance has been documented in all the bacterial STIs, but is considered rare and unconfirmed in Chlamydia trachomatis whereas is of global concern in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Azithromycin resistance has now been recognized in Mycoplasma genitalium, Treponema pallidum and N. gonorrhoeae, questioning its widespread use for chlamydial infection and threatening its future use. Rapidly increasing levels of decreased susceptibility to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins in N. gonorrhoeae and emerging treatment failures to both cefixime and ceftriaxone, without an obvious alternative agent, are of considerable concern. Implications for treatment include choice and timing of any change in therapy, reintroduction of test of cure and definition of treatment failure in an era of molecular testing. SUMMARY: Emerging resistance in all bacterial STIs and the particular problem of resistant gonorrhoea will present a challenge to maintain antimicrobial therapy at the forefront of public health control.
