PURPOSE: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat combined with fixed doses of cytarabine (ara-C or cytosine arabinoside) and etoposide in patients with poor-risk or advanced acute leukemia, to obtain preliminary efficacy data, describe pharmacokinetics, and in vivo pharmacodynamic effects of vorinostat in leukemia blasts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this open-label phase I study, vorinostat was given orally on days one to seven at three escalating dose levels: 200 mg twice a day, 200 mg three times a day, and 300 mg twice a day. On days 11 to 14, etoposide (100 mg/m(2)) and cytarabine (1 or 2 g/m(2) twice a day if >/=65 or <65 years old, respectively) were given. The study used a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. RESULTS: Eighteen of 21 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) treated on study completed planned therapy. Dose-limiting toxicities [hyperbilirubinemia/septic death (1) and anorexia/fatigue (1)] were encountered at the 200 mg three times a day level; thus, the MTD was established to be vorinostat 200 mg twice a day. Of 21 patients enrolled, seven attained a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery, including six of 13 patients treated at the MTD. The median remission duration was seven months. No differences in percentage S-phase cells or multidrug resistance transporter (MDR1 or BCRP) expression or function were observed in vivo in leukemia blasts upon vorinostat treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Vorinostat 200 mg twice a day can be given safely for seven days before treatment with cytarabine and etoposide. The relatively high CR rate seen at the MTD in this poor-risk group of patients with AML warrants further studies to confirm these findings.
