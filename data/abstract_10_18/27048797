UNLABELLED: Colistin is an ultimate line of refuge against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Very recently, the emergence of plasmid-mediatedmcr-1colistin resistance has become a great challenge to global public health, raising the possibility that dissemination of themcr-1gene is underestimated and diversified. Here, we report three cases of plasmid-carried MCR-1 colistin resistance in isolates from gut microbiota of diarrhea patients. Structural and functional analyses determined that the colistin resistance is conferred purely by the singlemcr-1gene. Genetic and sequence mapping revealed thatmcr-1-harbouring plasmid reservoirs are present in diversity. Together, the data represent the first evidence of diversity inmcr-1-harbouring plasmid reservoirs of human gut microbiota. IMPORTANCE: The plasmid-mediated mobile colistin resistance gene (mcr-1) challenged greatly the conventional idea mentioned above that colistin is an ultimate line of refuge against lethal infections by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. It is a possibility that diversified dissemination of themcr-1gene might be greatly underestimated. We report three cases of plasmid-carried MCR-1 colistin resistance in isolates from gut microbiota of diarrhea patients and functionally define the colistin resistance conferred purely by the singlemcr-1gene. Genetic and sequence mapping revealed unexpected diversity among themcr-1-harbouring plasmid reservoirs of human gut microbiota.
