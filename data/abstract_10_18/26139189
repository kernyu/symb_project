Fly and louse infestations are readily discerned and remedied in feedlot cattle. Tapeworm and fluke infections are accepted as probable but, given the lack of anthelmintics with realistic efficacy against these infections, these helminths are allowed to persist without treatment. Nematode infections are considered ubiquitous with cattle coming from pasture and are targeted with a macrocyclic lactone, usually in combination with a benzimidazole. Populations of nematodes seem to be effectively controlled by a combination of anthelmintic treatment, animal resistance and resilience, lack of reinfection, and diet.
