Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen responsible for health-care-associated infections as well as community acquired ones. It is the etiological factor of a wide spectrum of infections. Therapeutic problems are caused by resistance of S. aureus to many antibiotics, specifically to methicillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, MRSA). In such cases a limited spectrum of antibiotics may be used and prolonged hospitalization is costly. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative antibiotic therapeutics. This work reviews the current knowledge concerning prospective treatment of staphylococcal diseases.
