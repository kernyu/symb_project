Fucoidan is sulfated polysaccharide extracted from seaweed brown algae. This study was designed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects and disease resistance of dietary fucoidan on catfish, Clarias gariepinus, immunosuppressed by cadmium. Three hundred and sixty African catfish, C. gariepinus, was allocated into six equal groups. The first group served as a control. Groups (F1 and F2) were fed on fucoidan supplemented ration at concentrations of 4 and 6g/kg diet respectively for 21 days. Groups (Cd, CdF1 and CdF2) were subjected throughout the experiment to a sub-lethal concentration of 5ppm cadmium chloride solution and groups (CdF1 and CdF2) were fed on a ration supplemented with fucoidan. Macrophages oxidative burst, phagocytic activity percentages and lymphocytes transformation index were a significant increase in the fucoidan-treated groups (F1 and F2), while serum lysozyme, nitric oxide and bactericidal activity were enhanced only in group (F2) when compared with controls. These parameters as well as absolute lymphocyte count and survival rate were significantly increased in group (CdF2) when compared with cadmium chloride immunosuppressed group (Cd). It could be concluded that the fucoidan can be used as immunostimulant for the farmed African catfish, C. gariepinus as it can improve its resistance to immunosuppressive stressful conditions.
