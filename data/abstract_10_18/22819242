JNJ-Q2, a fluorinated 4-quinolone, was very active against both methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 42; MIC(50/90), 0.008/0.12 mug/mL) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n = 69; MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.12 mug/mL) obtained from patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI). Overall moxifloxacin and levofloxacin resistance rates were 31.5% and 46.9%, respectively. These favorable results support the continued clinical development of JNJ-Q2 to treat ABSSSI.
