We report a case of Acetobacter indonesiensis pneumonia in a 51-year-old woman after bilateral lung transplantation. We found 2 other A. indonesiensis pneumonia cases reported in the literature. All 3 cases involved complex patients exposed to broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, suggesting that this pathogen may be opportunistic and highly drug-resistant.
