The results of monitoring of the microorganisms resistance to antibiotics in departments of anesthesiology and abdominal surgery of the Ternopyl University Hospital are adduced. The data obtained permit to estimate possibilities for application of antimicrobic preparations in empiric therapy. Taking into account a large quantity of multiresistant isolates in a certain stationary, administration of empiric therapy in the treatment of intrahospital infection must be conducted, basing on the local data, concerning the microflora sensitivity to antibiotics.
