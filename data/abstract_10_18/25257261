Against a constant background of established infections, epidemics of new and old infectious diseases periodically emerge, greatly magnifying the global burden of infections. TB poses formidable challenges to the global health at the public health and scientific level by acquiring gene mutation into anti TB drugs specially rifampin and isoniazid which leads resistant to drug regime and treatment forms. Our tools to combat MDR (multidrug resistant) TB are dangerously out of date and ineffective. Besides new tools (TB drugs, vaccines, diagnostics), we also need new strategies to identify key Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human host interaction. It is all equally important that we build up high quality clinical trial capacity and bio banks for TB biomarkers identification. But most important is global commitment at all levels to roll back TB before it expose us again. Rapid development of drug resistance caused by M. tuberculosis has lead to measure resistance accurately and easily. This knowledge will certainly help us to understand how to prevent the occurrence of drug resistance as well as identifying genes associated with new drug resistance.
