The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of bacterial colonisation and catheter related blood stream infections (CRBSI) together with the antibiotic susceptibility patterns in a tertiary care hospital. CRBSI was detected with semi-quantitative and quantitative methods. The antimicrobial susceptible patterns of the isolated organisms were performed by Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. The rate of catheter colonisation and CRBSI were 42.1% and 14% (16.1/1000 catheter days) respectively. The most common causative pathogens were Pseudomonas sp. (23.7%), Acinetobacter sp. (18.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.2%) and Enterobacteriaceae (10.5%). The rate of isolation of methicillin resistance S. aureus, imipenem resistant Pseudomonas sp. and extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae were 60%, 44.0% and 100%. The result of this study would be useful for control and treatment of CRBSI.
