BACKGROUND: Candida parapsilosis is one of the main causes of fungemia in tertiary-care hospitals. Few studies have analysed the changes in its distribution over a long period. We compared the distribution of C. parapsilosis with that of other fungi over a 15-y period in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: The susceptibility of C. parapsilosis was analysed using the new species-specific clinical breakpoints. The C. parapsilosis complex species were differentiated molecularly. RESULTS: From January 1997 to December 2011, 360 isolates causing 350 episodes of fungemia were isolated. C. parapsilosis was the second most frequently isolated species (20%); only 1 C. orthopsilosis was identified and there were no C. metapsilosis. The remaining episodes were caused by C. albicans (43.1%), C. tropicalis (14.4%), C. glabrata (11.7%), and other fungal species (10.8%). The incidence of candidemia increased more than two-fold between 2009 and 2011 (from 3.3 to 7.4 cases/100,000 population), and C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata fungemia increased throughout the period. C. parapsilosis was the most frequent species in children under 15 y (57.1%). All C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to anidulafungin, micafungin, flucytosine, amphotericin B, and posaconazole, while 98.5% were susceptible to caspofungin, 97.1% to voriconazole, 95.6% to fluconazole, and 76.5% to itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term study showed a slight increase in the incidence of candidemia during the years of the study and a trend towards an increase in C. parapsilosis. Because of its high frequency and intrinsic low susceptibility to echinocandins, the prevalence and susceptibility of C. parapsilosis should be monitored, especially in children.
