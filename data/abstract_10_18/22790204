An in-house IS6110 real-time PCR (IH IS6110), MTB Q-PCR Alert (Q-PCR) and GenoType MTBDRplus (MTBDR; Hain Lifescience) were compared for the direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in 87 specimens following automated NucliSENS easyMAG DNA extraction. This included 82 first smear-positive specimens and three smear-negative specimens. Another in-house real-time PCR with a Mycobacterium genus-specific probe for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (IH ITS) was used to allow a full comparison with culture results. The sensitivities of IH IS6110, Q-PCR, MTBDR and IH ITS for MTBC detection were 100, 92, 87 and 87 %, respectively, compared with culture. Both IS6110-based real-time PCRs (in-house and Q-PCR) were similar in performance, with 91.2 % concordant results for MTBC detection. Inhibition rates were low, with zero to three specimens producing uninterpretable results. However, the Q-PCR failed to detect MTBC in five samples that were smear negative or had few acid-fast bacilli (one to 10 bacilli in 10 microscopic fields) detected by IH IS6110. IH ITS was the least sensitive assay but may be useful when used in conjunction with IS6110 PCR results to determine the presence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in smear-negative specimens. None of the real-time PCR assays tested provided drug-resistance data. It was concluded that an IH IS6110 assay could easily be incorporated into the workflow of a diagnostic laboratory for rapid and accurate identification of MTBC from clinical specimens. The inclusion of an internal control and amplification of an ITS target enhance the diagnostic utility of the test.
