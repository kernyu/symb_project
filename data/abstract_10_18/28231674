Objective: To investigate the relationship between D-cycloserine resistance and the gene mutations of alrA, ddlA and cycA of Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis, as well as the association between D-cycloserine resistance and spoligotyping genotyping. Methods: A total of 145 M. tuberculosis strains were selected from the strain bank. D-cycloserine resistant phenotypes of the strains were determined by the proportion method and the minimal inhibitory concentration was determined by resazurin microtiter assay. PCR amplification and DNA direct sequencing methods were used for the analysis of gene mutations. Relationship between the resistance phenotype and genotype was analyzed by chi-square test. Results: Of the 145 clinically collected strains, 24 (16.6%) of them were D-cycloserine resistant and 121 (83.4%) were sensitive. There were only synonymous mutations noticed on alrA, ddlA and cycA in sensitive strains. Of the 24 D-cycloserine resistant strains, 3 (12.5%) isolates' cycA and 1 (4.2%) isolates' alrA happened to be non-synonymous mutations, in which the codes were 188, 318 and 508 of cycA, and 261 of alrA, respectively. Results on drug sensitivity tests confirmed the minimal inhibitory concentration of the mutant strains were all increased to some degrees. The D-cycloserine resistant rates of 88 Beijing genotype and 57 non-Beijing genotype strains were 20.5% and 10.5% , respectively, but with no statistically significant difference (chi(2) =2.47, P>0.05). Conclusions: The non-synonymous mutations of alrA and cycA might contribute to one of the mechanisms of M. tuberculosis D-cycloserine resistance. M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype or non-Beijing genotype was not considered to be associated with the D-cycloserine resistance.
