The ability of antibiotic resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium isolated from food to form biofilm at different temperatures in the absence or presence of 0.75% glucose was evaluated. A synergistic effect on biofilm at 10 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C and glucose was observed for E. faecalis and E. faecium.
