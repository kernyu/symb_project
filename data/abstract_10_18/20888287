In the 80 years since their discovery the beta-lactam antibiotics have progressed through structural generations, each in response to the progressive evolution of bacterial resistance mechanisms. The generational progression was driven by the ingenious, but largely empirical, manipulation of structure by medicinal chemists. Nonetheless, the true creative force in these efforts was Nature, and as the discovery of new beta-lactams from Nature has atrophied while at the same time multi-resistant and opportunistic bacterial pathogens have burgeoned, the time for empirical drug discovery has passed. We concisely summarize recent developments with respect to bacterial resistance, the identity of the new beta-lactams, and the emerging non-empirical strategies that will ensure that this incredible class of antibiotics has a future.
