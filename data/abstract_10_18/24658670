The presence of pathogenic bacteria with acquired carbapenem resistance constitutes an increasing problem for infection control and infectious disease management. Prompted by an outbreak of infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae producing the carbapenemase KPC-2 at a hospital in Saxony, the Saxon State Ministry of Social Affairs and Consumer Protection (SMS) initiated a point-prevalence survey for carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria. Wards at 53 hospitals in Saxony, mainly intensive care units, were investigated between October 2012 and February 2013. Stool samples and rectal swabs of 1,037 patients were analyzed for the presence of bacteria with resistance against four major groups of antibiotics (4MRGN). Carbapenemase producers were detected in 3 patients [0.3% CI95 (0.0596; 0.843)] and carbapenem-resistant bacteria without carbapenemases were detected in 9 patients [0.9% CI95 (0.397; 1.64)]. Furthermore, antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed 166 patients [16.0% CI95 (13.82; 18.38)] with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria. At the time of investigation, K. pneumoniae producing the carbapenemase KPC-2 was diagnosed in 2 patients at one hospital. Moreover, it is necessary to remain vigilant towards other types of carbapenemase producers, as demonstrated by the finding of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain harbouring the carbapenemase VIM-1 in another hospital.
