An impending disaster is currently developing in the infectious disease community: the combination of rapidly emerging multidrug-resistance among clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, together with an unprecedented withdrawal from industrial dedication to this disease area, is jeopardizing human health on a societal level. For those who remain focused and dedicated to identifying solutions to this growing problem, additional challenges await when in vitro activity does not correlate with in vivo efficacy. Thus the development of more effective translational assays will greatly improve and streamline the process of identifying novel antibacterial agents that can stand the test of preclinical and clinical development. Here we describe recent examples of research that justify the need for such assays.
