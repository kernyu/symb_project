The nationwide surveillance of antibacterial susceptibility to meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates during 2012 in Japan was conducted. A total of 2985 strains including 955 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1782 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 248 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 31 medical institutions were examined. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MEPM was also active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 2. Of all species tested, there were no species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous studies in 2009 or 2006. Therefore, the tendency to increase in antimicrobial resistance rates was not observed. 3. MEPM resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 17.8% (56/315 strains). Compared to our previous results, it was the lowest than that in 2006 and 2009. 4. Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter species, which emerged in worldwide, were not observed. 5. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 6.2% (59/951 strains) in enterobacteriaceae, which increased compared with that of our previous studies in 2009 or before. Whereas, the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5/315 strains) in P. aeruginosa, which was stable. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem for serious infections treatment at present, 17 years passed after available for commercial use in Japan.
