BACKGROUND: The widespread emergence of anti-malarial drug resistance has necessitated the discovery of novel anti-malarial drug candidates. In this study, chloroquine derivatives were evaluated for the improved anti-malarial activity. RESULTS: Novel two derivatives (SKM13 and SKM14) were synthesized based on the chloroquine (CQ) template containing modified side chains such as alpha,beta-unsaturated amides and phenylmethyl group. The selective index indicated that SKM13 was 1.28-fold more effective than CQ against the CQ-resistant strain Plasmodium falciparum. An in vivo mouse study demonstrated that SKM13 (20 mg/kg) could completely inhibit Plasmodium berghei growth in blood and increased the survival rate from 40 to 100% at 12 days after infection. Haematological parameters [red blood cell (RBC) count, haemoglobin level, and haematocrit level] were observed as an indication of clinical malarial anaemia during an evaluation of the efficacy of SKM13 in a 4-day suppression test. An in vivo study showed a decrease of greater than 70% in the number of RBC in P. berghei-infected mice over 12 days, but the SKM13 (20 mg/kg)-treated group showed no loss of RBC. CONCLUSIONS: CQ derivatives with substituents such as alpha,beta-unsaturated amides and phenylmethyl group have enhanced anti-malarial activity against the CQ-resistant strain P. falciparum, and SKM13 is an excellent anti-malarial drug candidate in mice model.
