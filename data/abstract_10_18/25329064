BACKGROUND: Cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role in resistance to intracellular infection. We previously reported antibodies against interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in HIV- negative (HIV-) patients with acquired immunodeficiency presenting with repeated episodes of disseminated infection caused by uncommon opportunistic intracellular fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens. This follow-up study aimed to investigate cellular immune responses in these unusual patients. METHODS: Twenty HIV- patients presenting with >/=2 episodes of culture- or histopathologic-proven opportunistic infections were enrolled along with age- and sex-matched controls comprised of 20 HIV+ patients plus 20 healthy adults. Monocyte phenotyping and intracellular cytokine production were determined by staining with specific antibodies followed by flow cytometry. Anti-interferon-gamma antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and inducible nitric oxide synthase by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: There were no differences among cases, HIV+, and healthy controls in the percentage of monocytes, or CD68 and HLA-DR expression on their surfaces. FcR1 (CD119) expression on monocytes was significantly higher in cases than in HIV+ (p<0.05) and healthy controls (p<0.01), suggesting the presence of activated monocytes in the circulation. Interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production in CD4 cells were significantly lower in cases than in healthy controls (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). CD8 production of TNF-alpha among cases was significantly lower than that of healthy controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Immunodeficiency in HIV- individuals with repeated infections with intracellular pathogens may be associated with one or more of the abnormal immune responses reflected by the reduced production of both IL-2 by CD4 T cells and TNF-alpha by CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, as well as presence of anti-IFN-gamma antibody, as previously reported.
