This paper describes self-reinforced antibacterial and oil-resistant properties that were successfully prepared by surface selective dissolution of filter paper in a NaOH/Urea/ZnO (weight ratio of 8:12:0.25) aqueous solution. The effect of the processing time on the mechanical properties of this paper was evaluated at -12 degrees C. The paper morphologies were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The oil-resistance and antibacterial properties of the produced paper were also investigated. Excellent mechanical properties were observed for an optimized handling time. The tensile and burst strengths of the modified paper were in excess of 100% of the original. Meanwhile, the treated paper was completely oil-resistant within 24 h and demonstrated good antibacterial properties when exposed to Staphylococcus aureus. The traces of residual zinc oxide were found to be safe for food.
