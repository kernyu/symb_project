We solved the crystal structure of the class C beta-lactamase MOX-1 complexed with the inhibitor aztreonam at 1.9A resolution. The main-chain oxygen of Ser315 interacts with the amide nitrogen of aztreonam. Surprisingly, compared to that in the structure of free MOX-1, this main-chain carboxyl changes its position significantly upon binding to aztreonam. This result indicates that the interaction between MOX-1 and beta-lactams can be accompanied by conformational changes in the B3 beta-strand main chain.
