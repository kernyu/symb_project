We compared the ability of the EUCAST EDef 7.2 and the Etest to detect the susceptibility to micafungin of 160 Candida and non-Candida clinical isolates. Agreement was higher when Etest MICs were obtained after 24 h of incubation; essential agreement was 90%, and categorical agreement was >90%. False susceptibility was seen only for Candida krusei (10%), and false resistance was observed in 6% of the isolates, ranging from 2.6% (C. glabrata) to 13% (C. albicans).
