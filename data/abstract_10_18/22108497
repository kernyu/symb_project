Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to almost all ss-lactams except imipenem designated as ISMRK (imipenem-susceptible meropenem-resistant Klebsiella) is emerging in Japan. All ISMRK carries bla(IMP-6) which differs from bla(IMP-1) by only a single nucleotide at position 640. We devised a rapid detection system of bla(IMP-6) by using ARMS PCR.
