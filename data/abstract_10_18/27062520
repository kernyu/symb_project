BACKGROUND: To assess the potential effects of telbivudine (LdT) and entecavir (ETV) on renal function in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), we performed a meta-analysis of the relevant data available on these agents to evaluate their effects on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during treatment. METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Cochrane Library, and WanFang databases were searched for relevant articles appearing in the literature up to July 1, 2015. A total of 6 studies (1960 CHB patients) with 1-year eGFR outcomes were retrieved and analyzed. RESULTS: Generally, the results of the 6 studies analyzed showed that eGFR was improved after LdT treatment, but was decreased after ETV treatment. Using a fixed-effects approach, the change in eGFR was found to be significantly different between LdT and ETV treatment (Z = 3.64; P = 0.0003). Whereas the eGFR was slightly decreased with ETV compared with baseline (-1.45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), the eGFR was improved with LdT (2.99 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) after 1 year of treatment. An overall test of effect in the meta-analysis showed that the eGFR in LdT-treated patients was significantly improved after 1-year of treatment (Z = 3.71; P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis has confirmed that LdT has a renal protective effect whereas ETV does not. However, whether the benefit on renal function outweighs the occurrence of resistance in specific clinical situations is not yet clear.
