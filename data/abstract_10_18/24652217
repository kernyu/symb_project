INTRODUCTION: Little has been published in Colombia on HIV drug resistance in patients taking antiretroviral treatment (ART). Currently, the Colombian guidelines do not recommend the use of genotypic antiretroviral resistance tests (GART) for treatment-naive patients or for those experiencing a first therapeutic failure. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of relevant resistance mutations and the degree of susceptibility/ resistance of HIV to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in ART-experienced patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A non-random sample of 170 ART-experienced HIV patients with virologic failure and who underwent GART was recruited. A study of HIV drug resistance was carried out in two groups of patients: one group that underwent early GART and the other group that received late GART testing. RESULTS: The most frequent type of resistance affected the non-nucleoside class (76%). The late-GART group had higher risk of nucleoside analog and protease inhibitor drug resistance, a higher number of resistance mutations and more complex mutational profiles than the early-GART group. A high cross resistance level (30%) was found in the nucleoside analog class. The least affected medications were tenofovir and darunavir. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that performing GART late is associated with levels of ARV resistance that could restrict the use of an important number of essential ARV in subsequent regimens. There is a need to revise the current recommendations to include GART prior to start of treatment and after the first virologic failure.
