The increase in antibiotic resistance due to multiple factors has encouraged the search for new compounds which are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens. In this context, chalcones, dihydrochalcones, hydrazones and oxadiazoles were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates, which were obtained from clinical laboratories and were characterized as MRSA using traditional and molecular methods. Among 65 tested compounds, two chalcones, one dihydrochalcone and two hydrazones were active against MRSA. Based on the minimal inhibitory concentration and cytotoxicity, hydrazones provided a better selectivity index than chalcones. Active hydrazones are promising antibiotic-like substances and they should be the subject of further microbiological studies.
