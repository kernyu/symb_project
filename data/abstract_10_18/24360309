Chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia is a frequent event in children with cancer, with a high morbidity. Antibiotic prophylaxis has been proposed for many years to prevent infectious diseases in patients with neutropenia. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis induced a significant reduction of mortality and infectious morbidities in these situations. Less data are available in children with neutropenia. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance involving not only quinolones, but also cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and penems, is the main long term risk. This article summarise the usefulness of the prophylactic antibiotic treatment and its perspective in children with cancer.
