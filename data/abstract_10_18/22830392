Antibiotic resistance has prompted the search for new agents that can inhibit bacterial growth. We recently reported on the antibiofilm activities of nanosized ZnO and CuO nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by using sonochemical irradiation. In this study, we examined the antibacterial activity of ZnO and CuO NPs in a powder form and also examined the antibiofilm behavior of teeth surfaces that were coated with ZnO and CuO NPs using sonochemistry. Free ZnO and CuO NPs inhibited biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans . Furthermore, by using the sonochemical procedure, we were able to coat teeth surfaces that inhibited bacterial colonization.
