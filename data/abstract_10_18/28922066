Two basic questions about lysozyme activities on the selected microorganisms were investigated, namely whether lysozyme inhibits biofilm production and which concentrations of the enzyme have the ability to change the natural biofilm producing capacity of different strains of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive and resistant), Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Gardnerella vaginalis. The effect of lysozyme on biofilm formation capacities of 16 strains of selected microorganisms was investigated, whereby four testing replicates have been performed in vitro using the Test Tube method, and the potential of lysozyme to change biofilm forming capacities depending on its concentration, species, and strains of microorganisms is demonstrated. A lysozyme concentration of 30 mug/ml indicated to have the highest inhibiting effect on all tested microorganisms. Furthermore, G. vaginalis was the most sensitive of them all, as its biofilm formation was inhibited in the presence of as low as 2.5 mug/ml of lysozyme. At enzyme concentrations of 7.5-50 mug/ml (with the exception of 30 mug/ml) the biofilm forming capacities of P. aeruginosa were enhanced. Depending on the strain of P. aeruginosa, the total biofilm quantity was either reduced or unaffected at lysozyme concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 30 mug/ml. In contrast, lysozyme concentrations below 15 or 20 mug/ml did not affect or increase the volume of biofilm formation, while higher concentrations (15, 20, 25 mug/ml) reduced biofilm formation by 50% (3/6) and 30 mug/ml of biofilm reduced biofilm forming capacity of S. aureus by 100% (6/6). The results of this study are a strong foundation for further research on lysozyme as a modulator of the biofilm forming capacity of different species with the potential to aid in the development of new drugs for the treatment of oral and vaginal infections.
