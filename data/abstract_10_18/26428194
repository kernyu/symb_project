Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide with increasing antimicrobial resistance. 600 randomly chosen asymptomatic healthy children aged 2-60 months attending Alexandria University Children's Hospital were evaluated for prevalence of nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of S. pneumoniae. Prevalence of NP carriage was 29.2% (n = 175/600) Capsular serotyping was done using Quellung reaction. Vaccine covered serotypes (VST) represented 67.4% while non-vaccine serotypes (NVST) were 32.6%. The most common VST isolated were 19F (24.6%), 6B (14.3%) and 6A (10.9%). Confirmation of serotyping was performed by multiplex PCR which showed 100% concordance with the Quellung reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed penicillin non-susceptibility of 15% (using non-meningitis penicillin MIC breakpoints) and 55% (using meningitis penicillin MIC breakpoints). Highest resistance was found in sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (55%), tetracyclins (49%), erythromycin (40%) and clindamycin (25%). This study revealed the epidemiological importance to evaluate regularly the prevalence, serotypes and the increasing antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae in the community.
