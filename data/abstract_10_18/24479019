CONTEXT: Globally, there has been an increase in incidence of paratyphoid fever, including paratyphoid fever caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains. Studying the clinical profile and antimicrobial sensitivity of paratyphoid fever would help in early diagnosis, appropriate treatment, rational use of antibiotics and prevent drug resistance. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical profile and sensitivity patterns of antibiotics used in the treatment of paratyphoid fever. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A record-based study was done in tertiary care hospital, South India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of culture-proven cases of paratyphoid fever was done in a tertiary care hospital. The socio-demographic characteristics, mode of presentation and the sensitivity pattern of isolates from blood culture were recorded. One hundred and ten case files of Salmonella paratyphi were reviewed from the medical records section and the required data (data regarding the clinical profile and antibiotic sensitivity) was collected and analyzed using SPSS version 11.5. RESULTS: Fever was present in all patients. All the cases were sensitive for third-generation cephalosporins, and only 31.8% of the cases were sensitive for quinolones. Sensitivity towards other antibiotics in descending order was as follows: ampicillin 93.6%, chloramphenicol 91.8%, aminoglycosides 90.4% and sulphonamides 76.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Research shows that there is increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones and sensitivity to chloramphenicol. Considering the changing trend in the sensitivity pattern, the recommendations of treatment for enteric fever need to be rationalized and re-considered.
