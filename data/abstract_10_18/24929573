Steadily rising rates of antimicrobial resistance, in a range of common bacterial pathogens, are a major threat to human health in New Zealand in the near future. The single largest contributor to this threat is the high level of antimicrobial consumption in New Zealand. Antimicrobial consumption in New Zealand needs to be reduced if we are to slow the spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Reporting the per capita antimicrobial consumption within each District Health Board (DHB), in relation to targets for reductions from present levels of consumption, could provide an impetus for DHBs to address this threat to the health of their populations.
