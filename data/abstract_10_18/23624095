Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of both healthcare- and community-associated infections globally. S. aureus exhibits diverse clinical presentations, ranging from benign carriage and superficial skin and soft tissue infections to deep wound and organ/space infections, biofilm-related prosthesis infections, life-threatening bacteremia and sepsis. This broad clinical spectrum, together with the high incidence of these disease manifestations and magnitude of the diverse populations at risk, presents a high unmet medical need and a substantial burden to the healthcare system. With the increasing propensity of S. aureus to develop resistance to essentially all classes of antibiotics, alternative strategies, such as prophylactic vaccination to prevent S. aureus infections, are actively being pursued in healthcare settings. Within the last decade, the S. aureus vaccine field has witnessed two major vaccine failures in phase 3 clinical trials designed to prevent S. aureus infections in either patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery or patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis. This review summarizes the potential underlying reasons why these two approaches may have failed, and proposes avenues that may provide successful vaccine approaches to prevent S. aureus disease in the future.
