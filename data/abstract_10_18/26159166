BACKGROUND: Nosocomial Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) enteritis is rare but can be fatal unless it is detected at an early stage and treated effectively. Dysbiosis of the gut is one of the leading reasons of MRSA enteritis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a burgeoning treatment to rectify this imbalance. But the impact of FMT on MRSA enterocoitis is still unknown yet. METHODS: A total of 5 patients diagnosed as MRSA enteritis during the early postoperative period were given vancomycin 2 g/day for 3 days and FMT for three continuous days as a standard treatment. RESULT: There was a 100% clinical response rate that all the symptoms resulting from MRSA enterocolitis disappeared and MRSA in the feces eliminated clearly. The microbiota profile in feces of the patients also regained balance. CONCLUSION: FMT can be a preferential measure to restore the dysbiosis caused by MSRA enterocolitis.
