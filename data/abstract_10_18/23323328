It is established in experiments on noninbred rats that the use of imunofan (20 mg/kg daily) and polyoxidonium (150 mg/kg daily) for 7 days on the background of chronic intoxication with organophosphorus agent VX (0.01 LD50, single daily treatment for 30 days) resulted in almost complete recovery of phagocytic-metabolic activity of neutrophils, the content of lysozyme, cationic protein of platelet, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL-1b and IL-6 in the blood. The administration of T-activin (20 mg/kg daily for 7 days) restores these parameters insignificantly. The maximum overall stimulatory effect was produced by polyoxidonium, while the minimum effect was observed for T-activin.
