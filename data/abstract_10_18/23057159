Inadvertent exposure of bacterial pathogens to X-ray radiation may be an environmental stress, where the bacterium may respond by increasing mutational events, thereby potentially resulting in increased antibiotic resistance and alteration to genotypic profile. In order to examine this, four clinical pathogens, including the Gram-negative organisms Escherichia coli O157:H7 NCTC12900 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC10662, as well as the Gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus NCTC6571 and Enterococcus faecium were exposed to X-rays (35,495 cGy/cm2) over a seven-day period. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed before, during and after exposure by examining susceptibility, as quantified by E-test with six antibiotics, as well as to a further 11 antibiotics by measurement of susceptibility zone sizes (mm). Additionally, the DNA profile of each organism was compared before, during and after exposure employing the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC PCR). Results indicated that exposure of these organisms to this amount of X-ray radiation did not alter their antibiotic susceptibility, nor their genomic DNA profile. Overall, these data indicate that exposure of bacteria to X-ray radiation does not alter the test organisms' antibiotic susceptibility profiles, nor alter genomic DNA profiles of bacteria, which therefore does not compromise molecular epidemiological tracking of bacteria within healthcare environments in which patients have been exposed to X-ray radiation.
