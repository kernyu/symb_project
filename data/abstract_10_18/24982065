Ninety-four patients infected with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were randomized to receive colistin alone or colistin plus fosfomycin for 7 to 14 days. The patients who received combination therapy had a significantly more favorable microbiological response and a trend toward more favorable clinical outcomes and lower mortality than those who received colistin alone.
