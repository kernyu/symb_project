OBJECTIVE: Detecting the sensitivities of bacterium in the inactive stage of chronic suppurative otitis media, to guide a clinical rational drug use after the type I tympanoplasty. METHOD: Collecting 148 hospitalized patients from Guangdong General Hospital diagnosed as inactive stage of chronic suppurative otitis media, who had been dry ear for more than 1 months. Analyse the results of drug sensitivity on the mucosa surfaces of the middle ear. RESULT: There are 16 species of bacterium, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae etc. Total positive rate of bacteria was 33.1%, the detectable rate of gram-positive bacteria was 69.4%, gram-negative bacteria was 30.6%. Drug sensitive test demonstrated that vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, rifampicin etc were effective in gram positive bacteria, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam etc were effective in gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: Patients with dry ears,who were going to take type I tympanoplasty, still had potential pathogens. Bacterial cultivation and drug sensitive test before operation can guide the clinical medication and prevent infection.
