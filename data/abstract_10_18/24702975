Ceftaroline is a new cephalosporin for parenteral use. Notable among its microbiological properties is its ability to inhibit penicillin-binding protein 2a of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and its good in vitro activity against several microorganisms of clinical interest. The European Committee of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) has defined both epidemiological breakpoints (defining wild-type populations that lack known acquired mechanisms of resistance) and clinical breakpoints for this compound. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has also defined clinical breakpoints. Based on the microbiological activity of ceftaroline, clinical categories have been defined for enterobacteria, S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. EUCAST has also established breakpoints based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic criteria.
