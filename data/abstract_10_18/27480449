BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Literature data suggest an association between Helicobacter pylori infection and glucose homeostasis. However, a causative link between them has not been demonstrated yet. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of H. pylori eradication on glucose homeostasis in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to investigate the effect of H. pylori eradication on glucose homeostasis in 154 patients with type 2 diabetes and who tested positive for H. pylori infection (mean age (SD), 63.1 (8.1) years). Subjects were assigned to H. pylori eradication treatment or placebo. Metabolic and inflammatory parameters were measured in all subjects at baseline and 4 weeks after the treatment. H. pylori eradication led to an improvement in glucose homeostasis, measured by HOMA-IR (p < 0.001) and KITT (0 = 0.041), due to the decrease in fasting insulin levels (p = 0.004). The results also showed that lower levels of inflammatory parameters were present after eradication. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first randomized, double blind, controlled study where the effect of H. pylori eradication on glucose homeostasis in subjects with type 2 diabetes has been investigated. Our findings demonstrate that H. pylori eradication improves glucose homeostasis in patients with type 2 diabetes through a decrease in pro-inflammatory factors.
