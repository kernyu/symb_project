Fusarium verticillioides is an important pathogen in maize that causes various diseases affecting all stages of plant development worldwide. The fungal pathogen could be seed borne or survive in soil and penetrate the germinating seed. Most F. verticillioides strains produce fumonisins, which are of concern because of their toxicity to animals and possibly humans, and because they enhance virulence against seedlings of some maize genotypes. In this work, we studied the action of fumonisin B1 (FB1) on the activity of maize beta-1,3-glucanases involved in plant defense response. In maize embryos, FB1 induced an acidic isoform while suppressing the activity of two basic isoforms. This acidic isoform was induced also with 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid, an analog of salicylic acid. Repression of the basic isoforms suggested a direct interaction of the enzymes with the mycotoxin as in vitro experiments showed that pure FB1 inhibited the basic beta-1,3-glucanases with an IC(50) of 53 muM. When germinating maize embryos were inoculated with F. verticillioides the same dual effect on beta-1,3-glucanase activities that we observed with the pure toxin was reproduced. Similar levels of FB1 were recovered at 24 h germination in maize tissue when they were treated with pure FB1 or inoculated with an FB1-producing strain. These results suggest that beta-1,3-glucanases are a relevant physiological target and their modulation by FB1 might contribute to F. verticillioides colonization.
