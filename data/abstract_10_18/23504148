INTRODUCTION: The occurrence of multiple beta-lactamases among bacteria only limits the therapeutic options but also poses a challenge. A study using boronic acid (BA), an AmpC enzyme inhibitor, was designed to detect the combined expression of AmpC beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in bacterial isolates further different phenotypic methods are compared to detect ESBL and AmpC. METHODS: A total of 259 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated and screened for ESBL production by (i) CLSI double-disk diffusion method (ii) cefepime- clavulanic acid method (iii) boronic disk potentiation method. AmpC production was detected using cefoxitin alone and in combination with boronic acid and confirmation was done by three dimensional disk methods. Isolates were also subjected to detailed antibiotic susceptibility test. RESULTS: Among 259 isolates, 20.46% were coproducers of ESBL and AmpC, 26.45% were ESBL and 5.40% were AmpC. All of the 53 AmpC and ESBL coproducers were accurately detected by boronic acid disk potentiation method. CONCLUSION: The BA disk test using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology is simple and very efficient method that accurately detects the isolates that harbor both AmpCs and ESBLs.
