We identified New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1)-producing Citrobacter freundii GB032, Escherichia coli GB102, and Acinetobacter baumannii GB661 in urine and stool samples from a single patient in China. Plasmid profiling and Southern blotting indicated that blaNDM-1 from GB032 and that from GB102 were likely located on the same plasmid, while blaNDM-1 from GB661 was located on a very large (>400-kb) plasmid. This case underscores the broad host range of blaNDM-1 and its potential to spread between members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii.
