BACKGROUND: Computers are widely used in healthcare for improved and effective care. Previous published reports have shown microorganisms colonising computer keyboards in some clinical areas. OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to measure, compare and characterize the aerobic microorganisms in computer keyboards of hospital and non-hospital settings. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected from commonly used keys of computers in hospital and non-hospital settings using moistened sterile swabs, inoculated in liquid and solid media, and incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C for 24-48 h. Growth was identified as per standard microbiological procedures. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined for pathogenic strains by Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: Growth was seen in all 80 samples (40 from each setting). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from both settings (hospital: 6 MRSA, 11 MSSA; non-hospital: 4 MRSA, 9 MSSA). Gram-negative bacilli were isolated more frequently from hospital (33%). Statistical analysis showed homogeneity among isolates from computer keyboards in both settings, except for Pseudomonas. CONCLUSION: Isolation of microorganisms from "high-touch" surfaces such as computer keyboards is indicative of the need for awareness on cleaning of such surfaces or disinfection and adequate hand hygiene.
