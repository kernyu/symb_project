Pan-genotypic nucleoside HCV inhibitors display a high genetic barrier to drug resistance and are the preferred direct-acting agents to achieve complete sustained virologic response in humans. Herein, we report, the discovery of a beta-d-2'-Cl,2'-F-uridine phosphoramidate nucleotide 16, as a nontoxic pan-genotypic anti-HCV agent. Phosphoramidate 16 in its 5'-triphosphate form specifically inhibited HCV NS5B polymerase with no marked inhibition of human polymerases and cellular mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Studies on the intracellular half-life of phosphoramidate 16-TP in live cells demonstrated favorable half-life of 11.6 h, suggesting once-a-day dosing. Stability in human blood and favorable metabolism in human intestinal microsomes and liver microsomes make phosphoramidate 16 a prospective candidate for further studies to establish its potential value as a new anti-HCV agent.
