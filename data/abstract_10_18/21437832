Our understanding of - as well as our approach to - castration resistant prostate cancer is currently undergoing major changes. New drugs like the CYP-17 inhibitor abiraterone have shown that even in the "hormone refractory" stage the progression of prostate cancer is still driven by signaling of the androgen receptor. Changing the term to castration resistant prostate cancer is one consequence of these new insights. Here we give an overview on the current situation of drug development, therapeutic consequences and future trends.
