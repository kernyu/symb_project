The effectiveness of switching from enfuvirtide to raltegravir in HIV-1-infected patients on a suppressive antiretroviral regimen has been poorly studied in the clinical practice of developing countries. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study in HIV-1-infected, multidrug-experienced adults (>/=18 years old) with plasma HIV-1-RNA <400 copies/ml for at least 4 months on an enfuvirtide-containing therapy between 2005 and 2010, in whom the attending physician switched from enfuvirtide to raltegravir. Effectiveness endpoints were measured at week 48 after switch. Analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis and two strategies for handling missing outcome data were used (hereafter, strategies 1 and 2). Overall, 87 patients were eligible for analysis. At baseline, the median CD4(+) T cell count was 400 cells/mul and 91.9% of patients had <50 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml. At week 48, the proportions of patients with plasma HIV-1-RNA <50 and <400 copies/ml were, respectively, 86.2% (95% CI=77.1; 92.7%) and 88.5% (95% CI=79.9; 94.3%) (strategies 1 and 2) and 89.7% (95% CI=81.3; 95.2%) and 90.8% (95% CI=82.7; 95.9%) (strategies 1 and 2). This was a -10.3% (95% CI=-2.8; -17.9%) and -9.2% (95% CI=-2; -16.4%) difference from baseline in the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1-RNA <400 copies/ml. The median increase in CD4(+) T cell counts was 41 and 64 cells/mul (p<0.001) (strategies 1 and 2). No patient withdrew raltegravir or developed opportunistic infections, but one was diagnosed with HIV-related dementia. In conclusion, switching from enfuvirtide to raltegravir in patients on a virologically suppressive regimen is an effective strategy even in a Brazilian clinical setting.
