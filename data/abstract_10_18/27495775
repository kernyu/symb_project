BACKGROUND: Antiviral-resistant or refractory cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is challenging, and salvage therapies, foscarnet, and cidofovir, have significant toxicities. Several investigational anti-CMV agents are under development, but more information is needed on outcomes of current treatments to facilitate clinical trial design for new drugs. METHODS: Records of solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients at a single center over a 10-year period were reviewed retrospectively to characterize those who had received foscarnet treatment for ganciclovir-resistant or refractory CMV infection. Data were collected on virologic responses, mortality, and nephrotoxicity. RESULTS: Of 39 patients (22 SOT, 17 HCT), 15 had documented ganciclovir resistance mutations and 11 (28%) of 39 had tissue-invasive CMV. Median duration of foscarnet was 32 days. Virologic failure occurred in 13 (33%) of 39 and relapses of viremia occurred in 31%. Mortality was 12 (31%) of 39 and was higher in HCT than SOT (P = 0.001), although ganciclovir resistance was more common in SOT (P = 0.003). Doses of ganciclovir or valganciclovir were low in 10 (26%) of 39 at some time before switching to foscarnet. Renal dysfunction occurred in 20 (51%) of 39 by end of treatment and in 7 (28%) of 25 after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of existing treatment for ganciclovir-resistant or refractory CMV are suboptimal, in terms of virologic clearance, renal dysfunction, and mortality. These data should provide background information for future clinical trials of newer antiviral agents.
