In the recent years, it has been noted that microorganisms with acquired resistance to almost all available potent antibiotics are increasing worldwide. Hence, the use of antibiotics in every clinical setup has to be organized to avoid irrational use of antibiotics. This study was aimed to establish the pattern of antibiotic sensitivity and relevance of antimicrobial resistance in aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. A total of 103 aerobic Gram-negative bacteria namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter koserii, Proteus spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from tertiary care centers around Chennai. Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion test and study for genes of cephalosporin, carbapenem, and aminoglycoside resistance were done. A descriptive analysis of the data on altogether 103 clinical urine isolates was performed. All strains showed susceptibility to colistin. The frequency of genes encoding 16S rRNA methylases armA and rmtB were 7.8% and 6.8%, respectively. Among metallo-beta-lactamases, blaVIM, blaIMP, and blaNDM-1 were detected in 6.8%, 3.8%, and 3.8%, respectively. One E. coli strain harbored blaSIM-1 gene. Cumulative analysis of data suggested that 30% of the strains carried more than one resistance gene. The current research evidenced the increasing frequency of resistance mechanisms in India. Combined approach of antibiotic restriction, effective surveillance, and good infection control practices are essential to overcome antibiotic resistance.
