The article analyses major guidelines on the management of uncomplicated cystitis. The authors outline and substantiate the role of fosfomycin in the management of urinary tract infections. They provide current evidence on the resistance of uropathogens, including those producing extended-spectrum -lactamase. Combination therapy (fosfomycin + -lactams or aminoglycosides) is often used to treat infections caused by multiresistant microorganisms. The possibility of using fosfomycin for perioperative prophylaxis of UTI during endourologic operations and transrectal prostate biopsy is shown.
