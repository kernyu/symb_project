We compared uropathogen antibiotic susceptibility across age groups of ambulatory pediatric patients. For Escherichia coli (n=5,099) and other Gram-negative rods (n=626), significant differences (p<0.05) existed across age groups for ampicillin, cefazolin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole susceptibility. In E. coli, differences in trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole susceptibility varied from 79% in children under 2 to 88% in ages 16-18 (p<0.001), while ampicillin susceptibility varied from 30% in children under 2 to 53% in ages 2-5 (p=0.015). Uropathogen susceptibility to common urinary anti-infectives may be lower in the youngest children. Further investigation into these differences is needed to facilitate appropriate and prudent treatment of urinary tract infections.
