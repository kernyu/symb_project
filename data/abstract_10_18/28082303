PURPOSE: The most important articles on infectious diseases (ID) pharmacotherapy published in the peer-reviewed literature in 2015, as nominated and selected by panels of pharmacists and others with ID expertise, are summarized. SUMMARY: Members of the Houston Infectious Diseases Network were asked to nominate articles published in prominent peer-reviewed journals in 2015 that were thought to have a major impact in the field of ID pharmacotherapy. A list of 55 nominated articles on general ID-related topics and 10 articles specifically related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was compiled. In a national online survey, members of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists (SIDP) were asked to select from the list 10 general ID articles believed to have made a significant contribution to the field of ID pharmacotherapy and 1 article contributing to HIV/AIDS pharmacotherapy. Of the 361 SIDP members surveyed, 153 (42%) and 76 (21%) participated in the selection of general ID-related articles and HIV/AIDS-related articles, respectively. The 11 highest-ranked publications (10 general ID-related articles and 1 HIV/AIDS-related article) are summarized here. CONCLUSION: With the growing number of significant ID-related publications each year, it can be challenging to stay current with the literature. This review of important ID pharmacotherapy publications in 2015 may be helpful in identifying key articles and lessening this burden.
