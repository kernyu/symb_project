AIM: To use existing hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral therapies as access to new treatments is limited. METHODS: A PubMed search for randomised control trials or meta-analysis related to response-guided therapy of HCV genotype 1 patients was undertaken using pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR), boceprevir (B) and telaprevir (T) and lead-in where response-guided therapy at TW4(TW4), 8(TW8), 10(TW10), or 12(TW12) based on HCVRNA(+) or HCVRNA(-). Studies presented at major conferences were also used. Where necessary, a post-hoc analysis was performed. A response-guided management roadmap was created based on sustained virological response (SVR). RESULTS: Starting with PR, those with HCVRNA(-) at TW4 have > 86% SVR, while those are HCVRNA(+) have 34%-41.7% SVR. HCVRNA(-) TW4 patients can have 24 wk PR if HCVRNA < 400000 IU/mL. Alternatively, 28 wk BPR has similar SVR. If HCVRNA(+) at TW4, 72 wk PR leads to 53% SVR, hence BPR is a better option, and if HCVRNA(-) by TW8, 28 wk therapy is sufficient. If HCVRNA(+) at TW8, then HCVRNA should be checked at TW10 and TW12. By TW12, HCVRNA >/= 100 IU/mL activates the stopping rule. This roadmap is applicable for treatment-naive, treatment failures and cirrhotic patients. Validation from an Asia Pacific early access boceprevir program confirmed the findings that HCVRNA(-) at TW4, or TW8 conferred > 80% SVR, leading to the "80-80" rule. CONCLUSION: Using a roadmap based on HCVRNA(-) at TW4 or TW8 (the "80-80" rule), high SVR can be achieved, and guide the best choices for treatment, and also reduces drug exposure in poor responders.
