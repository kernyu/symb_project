We report two cases of infantile diarrhea due to multidrug-resistant, NDM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Salmonella enterica serovar Agona from Pakistan. This study alerts toward possible risk of NDM-1 transmission to enteric fever pathogens and encourages microbiologists to consider active screening of carbapenem resistance in nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates.
