BACKGROUND: It has been reported that several baseline polymorphisms of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) agents resistance-associated variants (RAVs) would affect the treatment outcomes of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (CHC). The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of DAAs RAVs in treatment-naIve GT1b CHC patients. METHODS: Direct sequencing and ultra-deep sequencing of the HCV NS3, NS5A, and NS5B gene were performed in baseline serum samples of treatment-naIve patients infected with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCVs). RESULTS: One hundred and sixty CHC patients were studied. Complete sequence information was obtained for 145 patients (NS3), 148 patients (NS5A), and 137 patients (NS5B). Treatment-failure associated variants of DAAs were detected: 56.6% (82/145) of the patients presented S122G for simeprevir (NS3 protease inhibitor); 10.1% (14/148) of the patients presented Y93H for daclatasvir and ledipasvir (NS5A protein inhibitors); 94.2% (129/137) of the patients presented C316N for sofosbuvir (NS5B polymerase inhibitor). Nearly, all of the DAAs RAVs detected by ultra-deep sequencing could be detected by direct sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of genotype 1b CHC patients in China present a virus population carrying HCV DAAs RAVs. Pretreatment sequencing of HCV genome might need to be performed when patients infected with GT1b HCV receiving DAAs-containing regimens in China. Population sequencing would be quite quantified for the work.
