PURPOSE: To study the antifungal susceptibility of genotypes of Candida albicans from patients with atrophic or erosive oral lichen planus and provide evidence for the treatment of candidiasis. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction(PCR) was adopted to analyze 101 Candida albicans which were isolated from atrophic or erosive oral lichen planus.Microdilution broth method was carried out for antifungal susceptibility test. SPSS16.0 software package was used for Chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 101 strains of Candida albicans were divided into three types, 39 were genotype A strains,17 genotype B stains and 45 genotype C stains.Strains of genotype A were significantly more resistant to 5-fluorocytosine than strains of genotypes B and C(P<0.05). Strains of genotype B were significantly more resistant to fluconazole than strains of genotype A(P<0.05). Strains of genotype C were significantly more resistant to itraconazole than strains of genotype A(P<0.05).None of the strains of genotypes B and C presented drug resistance to nystatin. There was no significant difference among genotypes A,B and C(P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a correlation between Candida albicans genotypes and antifungal susceptibility. The use of antifungal agent should be based on the genotypes and antifungal susceptibility test of Candida albicans. For the treatment of candidiasis in patients with atrophic or erosive oral lichen planus, the value of nystatin should be addressed.
