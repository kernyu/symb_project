OBJECTIVES: To summarize published data on the clinical and economic burden, epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance levels, serotype prevalence, and prevention strategies for pneumococcal disease among adults in Asia. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed database for relevant, peer-reviewed articles published between January 1995 and December 2011, covering China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. RESULTS: Taiwan and Thailand had the most comprehensive epidemiological data on adult pneumococcal disease. Very little relevant data were found for Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Vietnam; surveillance is urgently needed in these countries. The emergence and spread of resistance emphasize the importance of vaccination to prevent infection in adults at increased risk for serious pneumococcal disease. Vaccination policies and opinions on the efficacy of vaccination vary widely in Asian countries, although a new option in the form of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is now available. CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness of the public health and economic benefits of pneumococcal vaccination is critically needed to help both the public and policymakers in making changes to vaccination policies in the region. Maximizing access to pneumococcal vaccines will decrease the number of hospitalizations, complications, and deaths associated with pneumococcal disease.
