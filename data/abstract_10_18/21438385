OBJECTIVE: To find a method for improving the salt resistance of seeds and seedlings for Perilla Frutescens under NaCl stress, seed germination and physiological characteristics of P. frutescens seedlings were studied. METHOD: Several physiological indexes of P. frutescens seeds treated with different concentrations of Ca2+, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), salicylic acid (SA) and spermidine (Spd) under NaCl stress like the germination vigor, germination rate, germination index and vigor index were measured. And other indexes like the biomass of the seedlings, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in leaves, the activities of superoxide (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were also measured. RESULT: The germination of P. frutescens seeds under NaCl stress (100 mmol x L(-1)) was inhibited obviously. But after the treatment with Ca2+, ALA , SA and Spd, all germination indexes were increased. Ca2+ (10 mmol x L(-1)), ALA (100 mg x L(-1)), SA (50 mg x L(-1)) and Spd (0.25 mmol x L(-1)) could obviously alleviate the damage of salt stress to the seeds of P. frutescens. ALA (100 mg x L(-1)) significantly increased all indexes. The germination vigor was 65.3%, the germination rate was 89.7%, the germination index and vigor index were 15.2 and 0.1238, respectively. All treatments decreased the content of MDA in leaves. The activities of three enzymes including SOD, POD and CAT were all increased. ALA (100 mg x L(-1)) had the enzymes activity reach the maximum with 0.72, 6, 82 and 5.64 U x mg(-1), respectively. CONCLUSION: Ca2+ ALA , SA and Spd with appropriate concentration could significantly alleviate the damages to the seeds and seedlings of P. frutescens under NaCl stress and promote the salt resistance of the seeds and seedlings.
