OBJECTIVE: We constructed a recombinant eukaryotic expression vector harboring green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the hygromycin resistance gene hph, and observed its expression in Clonostachys rosea. METHODS: We used PCR, enzyme digestion, phosphorylation, ligation and transformation to construct the plasmid. Using protoplast preparation and transformation technologies, we expressed the plasmid in the fungi C. rosea. RESULTS: We created the eukaryotic expression vector, transformed it into C. rosea and observed green fluorescence with fluorescence microscope. CONCLUSION: The successful construction of the pANGH3 recombinant plasmid and its expression in C. rosea establishes a new model for studying fungal infection mechanisms.
