BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) in well-selected groups of cirrhotic patients, but the impact of these recommendations has not been assessed in France. AIM: To evaluate AP prescription tendencies for gastrointestinal bleeding, and primary and secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). METHODS: Practitioners (n = 1,159) working in general hospitals (GH) or in university hospitals (UH) received a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-nine (33.6%; GH 35% and UH 30.4%) practitioners responded. AP was prescribed by 97.7%, 72.3% and 94.8% of practitioners, without significant differences between UH and GH, respectively, for gastrointestinal bleeding (quinolones 48.2%, third-generation cephalosporins 27.7% and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 22.2%), primary (quinolones 97.2%) and secondary prophylaxis of SBP (quinolones 99%). For gastrointestinal bleeding, ofloxacin (47.6%) and norfloxacin (37.4%) were the main quinolones prescribed, and ceftriaxone (77%) was the main third-generation cephalosporin prescribed. The principal reasons for prescribing AP were a decrease in bacterial infection (88.9% for gastrointestinal bleeding, 91.3% for primary and 94.3% for secondary prophylaxis of SBP), a recommendation by a consensus conference (83%, 38% and 74.4% respectively) and an improvement in survival (72.8%, 41.3% and 57.7% respectively). Only 31.7% of practitioners (39.6% for UH vs. 28.6% for GH; P = 0.038) believed that AP may reduce the risk of bleeding recurrence. Reported side effects (28%) of AP mainly concerned the risk of quinolone resistance (62% of cases). CONCLUSION: Antibiotic prophylaxis is well-recognized by French practitioners, but its routine use depends on the expertise of practitioners. Quinolones remain the main antibiotic class prescribed irrespective of the type of prophylaxis.
