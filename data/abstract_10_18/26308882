Very high baseline HIV-1 RNA viral loads require potent and robust antiretroviral regimens to achieve virological suppression. The coformulated single tablet regimen of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF) is recommended by the US Department of Health and Human Services for the treatment of HIV-1 in treatment-naive adults and adolescents regardless of baseline CD4(+) T-cell count and viral load. We report two cases of HIV-infected, treatment-naive patients, with baseline HIV-1 RNA viral loads >1,000,000 copies/ml who were initiated on the single tablet regimen EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF, but failed to attain viral load suppression and developed resistance to the components of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF.
