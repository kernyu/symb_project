Management of viral infections after transplantation involves antiviral drug therapy (if available) and reduction in immunosuppression, which allows for development of pathogen-specific immunity to the offending virus. Prevention of viral infections is of the utmost importance, and this may be accomplished through vaccination, antiviral strategies and infection control measures. This article discusses the current management of selected viral pathogens that cause clinical illness in solid organ transplant recipients. The benefits and toxicities of antiviral therapies are discussed in the context of prevention and treatment of various viral diseases. The emerging issue of antiviral resistance is emphasized for cytomegalovirus, recurrent hepatitis B and influenza, while the importance of immunominimization is discussed in the management of BK nephropathy and virus-associated malignancies.
