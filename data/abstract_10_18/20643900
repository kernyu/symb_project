We report the ex vivo lysogenic transfer of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes among group A streptococci (GAS). Of 42 susceptible strains, 69% acquired erythromycin/tetracycline resistance when infected with purified supernatants from strain m46 culture containing the phage Phim46.1. A significant emm-type-dependent barrier to lysogenic transfer was not observed. The emm12 strains were the only strains susceptible to the lytic action of the bacteriophage preparation.
