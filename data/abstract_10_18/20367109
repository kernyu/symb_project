IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a superfamily of efflux pumps that transport numerous compounds across cell membranes. These transporters are located in various human tissues including peripheral blood cells, in particular lymphocytes, and present a high variability of expression and activity. This variability may affect the intracellular concentrations and efficacy of drugs acting within lymphocytes, such as antiretroviral drugs. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review focuses on the current knowledge about the expression, activity, roles and variability of ABC drug transporters in human lymphocytes. The identified modulating factors and their impact on the intracellular pharmacokinetics and efficacy of antiretroviral drugs are also detailed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Controversial data regarding the expression, activity and sources of variability of ABC transporters in lymphocytes are discussed. The modulating factors and their pharmacological consequences regarding antiretroviral therapies are also provided. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Numerous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the expression and activity of ABC drug transporters in lymphocytes. Despite these discrepancies, which may partly result from heterogeneous analytical methods, ABCC1 appears to have the highest expression in lymphocytes and may thus play a predominant role in the resistance to antiretroviral drugs, particularly to protease inhibitors.
