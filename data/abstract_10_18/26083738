This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of Estericide((R)) QX (super oxidized solution) in 524 bacterial clinical isolates causing nosocomial infections. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the serial broth microdilution method. The bacterial viability of the isolates and control strains was tested. The bactericidal effect of the disinfectant was determined according to the European Standards (EN) Test Methods-1040 guidelines. Assay of stability in Estericide QX after 1 year of storage was performed. The microdilution assays showed that the isolates were inhibited at concentrations of 10-40 parts per million (ppm). For gram-positive bacteria, the MIC values 20 and 40 ppm were more predominant (95%), whereas for gram-negative bacteria, the MIC values 10 and 20 ppm had the highest percentage (91.7%). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). The results of the assay of bactericidal activity showed that all tested bacteria (99.999%) were killed within 30 sec of contact time. The stability test showed that Estericide QX maintained its disinfectant action over time. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that the super oxidized solution of Estericide QX provides a high antibacterial activity on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Based on these results and under the conditions of the present study, we believe that Estericide QX can be used efficiently against multiresistant nosocomial bacteria, providing an opportunity for new disinfection alternatives.
