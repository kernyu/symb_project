PURPOSE: To identify the prevalence and microbial profile of infectious keratitis in a tertiary eye care hospital, and to test for the in vitro antimicrobial resistance of the bacterial isolates. METHODS: A total of 312 patients presenting to a tertiary eye care hospital with infected corneal ulcer were enrolled in this study. Their socio-demographic data and risk factors were recorded. Corneal scrapings collected from the edge of the ulcer were processed for direct gram stain and KOH mount. Culture was recovered on blood agar, chocolate agar, MacConkey agar and Sabouraud's dextrose (SDA) agar in multiple C shaped streaks. After overnight incubation, bacterial culture was followed by standard biochemical tests and antimicrobial sensitivity according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) guidelines. Inoculated SDA was inspected daily for up to 10 days and the growth was identified by its colony morphology, pigment production and lacto-phenol cotton blue mount examination. RESULTS: Of 312 patients, a microbial etiology was established in 117 cases (37.5%). Of these, 72 (61.5%) were male. The age range of 41-60 years was the most affected group. Of 117 positive cases, 52 (44.5%) were bacterial, 58 (49.5%) were fungal and 7 (6%) patients showed mixed bacterial and fungal infection. The most common isolated fungus was Fusarium which was detected in 36 (31%) cases, followed by Aspergillus spp in 13 (11%) subjects. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolated bacteria. All Gram positive cocci were susceptible to vancomycin followed by gatifloxacin, whereas all Gram negative bacilli were susceptible to gatifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Routine microbiological examination of patients with corneal ulcer is necessary in order to analyze and compare the changing trends of the etiology and their susceptibility patterns.
