BACKGROUND: Over-use and misuse of antibiotics are major causes of antibiotic resistance. This study explored the understanding and reported use of antibiotics amongst three ethnic groups in New Zealand. METHODS: Questionnaire survey of 300 Indian, Egyptian, and Korean people. RESULTS: Most people (73.3%) knew that antibiotics killed bacteria, but other incorrect responses were also common. A range of medicines were mistakenly identified as antibiotics. Nearly half the sample (43.3%) believed colds and flu were caused by bacteria. Only 45.4% were sure that antibiotics were not useful for colds and flu. A minority of participants knew about antibiotic resistance. There were significant differences between groups, with Koreans having lower levels of understanding. DISCUSSION: Interventions to improve use of antibiotics need to be pitched at a very basic level of knowledge, and need to be targeted towards particular ethnic groups, particularly those in whose home countries antibiotics are widely available without prescription.
