Non-Acinetobacter baumannii spp. are emerging among clinical Acinetobacter isolates causing nosocomial infections, and some (such as genomospecies 13TU) appear to be multidrug resistant. The prevalence of non-Acinetobacter baumannii spp. in the hospital setting is likely understated due to poor identification techniques. We report the first identification of an AdeABC-type efflux pump in an Acinetobacter genomospecies 13TU clinical isolate, its contribution to multidrug resistance, and the coexistence of three Ade-type efflux pumps in this strain.
