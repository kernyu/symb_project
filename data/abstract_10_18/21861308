We assessed the clinical efficacy of tebipenem pivoxil (TBPM-PI) in 30 children with pneumonia who, despite having received oral administration of beta-lactam antibiotics at the standard dose for at least 3 days, had no relief of symptoms and showed an abnormal shadow on the chest X-ray and elevated serum CRP levels of 3.0 mg/dl or more between December 2009 and November 2010. TBPM-PI was administered at a single dose of 4 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days. The children ranged in age from 8 months to 5 years. The serum CRP level ranged from 3.05 to 12.9 mg/dl. In 28 of the 30 children, either Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae or both were detected. Of the 28 children, 7 carried penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae; 9 carried beta-lactamase nonproducing ampicillin resistant H. influenzae; and 3 carried both. In all children, defervescence was observed within 48 hours of the start of TBPM-PI administration, and the severity of coughing/wheezing reduced significantly by the 3rd to 5th day. Thus, TBPM-PI was determined to be effective. Diarrhea or loose stool was observed as an adverse reaction in 4 children (13.3%).
