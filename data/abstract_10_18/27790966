We investigated the epidemiology and characterization of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus within the Yorkshire and Humber (YH) region in the UK. In July 2015, each laboratory within YH (n = 14) was assigned two consecutive days during which all clinical isolates of S. aureus were collected. Isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibilities and the presence of genes encoding methicillin resistance (mecA and mecC), Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) (lukS-PV), and efflux-mediated chlorhexidine resistance (qacA); isolates were also characterized by spa-types. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to chlorhexidine were determined by the broth dilution method. Of 520 isolates collected, 6.2% were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, all mecA-positive) and mupirocin resistance was low [0.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-2.0] and only found in MRSA. Carriage of the qacA gene was identified in 1.7% (95% CI 0.8-3.3) of isolates and 3.5% (95% CI 2.2-5.4) had a chlorhexidine MIC of 4 mg/l. The PVL gene was infrequent (3.7%, 95% CI 2.4-5.6). Genotyping identified 234 spa-types that mapped to 22 clonal complexes. Comparison of these current data with previous work suggest that the widespread use of staphylococcal decolonization regimens over the past decade or more has not had an adverse impact on resistance rates, PVL carriage or the prevalence of specific S. aureus lineages.
