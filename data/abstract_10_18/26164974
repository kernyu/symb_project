The production of carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes has been recognized as one of the most currently relevant resistance mechanisms in gram negative bacterial isolates, and is being detected in various countries. In Lebanon, carbapenem resistance was studied among gram negative pathogens collected from a university hospital from January to June of years 2011 and 2012. All isolates were subjected to phenotypic tests including antibiotic susceptibility, cloxacillin effect, modified Hodge test, and Etest for metallo-beta-lactamase detection. They were also subjected to genotyping by PCR sequencing to characterize beta-lactamases. Between January and June 2011, 48 carbapenem non-susceptible strains were collected. Of these, one Klebsiella pneumoniae harbored OXA-48 and insertion sequence IS 1999; four Acinetobacter baumanni harbored simultaneously OXA-23 and GES-11, and three Pseudomonas harbored VIM-2 carbapenemase. Between January and June 2012, 100 carbapenem non-susceptible strains were collected. Of these, one K. pneumoniae harbored simultaneously OXA-48, IS 1999, and an acquired AmpC of the ACC group; four Serratia marcescens harbored OXA-48, while among eight A. baumannii, one strain co-harbored OXA-23 and GES-11, six harbored OXA-23 and one OXA-24. Fifteen P, aeruginosa and two Pseudomonas species harbored VIM-2; two P. aeruginosa strains produced IMP-1 and two others IMP-2. This epidemiological survey demonstrates the presence of carbapenemases of Ambler classes A, B, and D in a Lebanese hospital and indicates increase in the number and variety of such enzymes.
