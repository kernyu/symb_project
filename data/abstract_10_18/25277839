Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria continue to pose a threat, with many infections caused by these pathogens being virtually untreatable. A number of new antibacterial agents are in late stage clinical development to treat these infections. Drugs in known classes such as new quinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and beta-lactams have been designed to evade many of the known resistance mechanisms, whereas newer drug classes include novel beta-lactamase inhibitors in combination with new or approved beta-lactams, and a peptidomimetic that have entered full clinical development. The establishment of public-private partnerships and an increase in pharmaceutical interest in antibacterial R&D are encouraging signs for the future.
