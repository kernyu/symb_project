The comparative study of influence of exogenous salicylic (SaA) and succinic (SuA) acids on the production of reactive oxygen species by isolated wheat coleoptiles has been provided. Under the action of both acids the increase of generation of superoxide anion-radical (O2(.-)) was observed. This increase was partially suppressed by treatment of coleoptiles with inhibitors of peroxidase (salicylhydroxamic acid) and NADP H-oxidase (imidazole and alpha-naphthol). The increase of hydrogen peroxide content, activity of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was registered under the influence of SaA and SuA; catalase activity did not change essentially. The treatment of coleoptiles with the indicated acids resulted in the increase of their resistance to abiotic stress (damaging heating, 43 +/- 0,1 degrees C, 10 min). The conclusion is made, that the increase of O2(.-) generation in wheat coleoptiles under the action of SaA and SuA is related, probably, to the increase of apoplast peroxidase and NADP.H-oxidase activity, and the rise of H2O2 content is related to the growth of SOD activity. These enzymatic systems are involved in the induction of plant cells protective reactions to the hyperthermia.
