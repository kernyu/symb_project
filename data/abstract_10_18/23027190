ICESp1116, responsible for erm(B)-mediated, inducible erythromycin resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes, was comprehensively characterized, and its chromosomal integration site was determined. It displayed a unique mosaic organization consisting of a scaffold, related to TnGallo1 from Streptococcus gallolyticus, with two inserted fragments separated by IS1216. One fragment, containing erm(B), displayed high-level identity to a portion of the S. pyogenes plasmid pSM19035; the other, containing a truncated tet(M) gene, displayed high-level identity to the right-hand portion of Clostridium difficile Tn5397.
