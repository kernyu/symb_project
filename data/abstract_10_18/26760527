Bloodstream infections (BSIs) represent a common complication among critically ill patients and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The prompt initiation of an effective antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to reduce mortality and to improve clinical outcomes. However, the choice of the empiric antibiotic regimen is often challenging, due to the worldwide spread of multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms with reduced susceptibility to the available broad-spectrum antimicrobials. New therapeutic strategies are 5 to improve the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment while minimizing the risk of resistance selection.
