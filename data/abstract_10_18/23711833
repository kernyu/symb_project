Rising resistance against current antibiotics necessitates the development of antibacterial agents with alternative targets. The "switch region" of RNA polymerase (RNAP), addressed by the myxopyronins, could be such a novel target site. Based on a hit candidate discovered by virtual screening, a small library of 5-phenyl-3-ureidothiophene-2-carboxylic acids was synthesized resulting in compounds with increased RNAP inhibition. Hansch analysis revealed pi (lipophilicity constant) and sigma (Hammet substituent constant) of the substituents at the 5-phenyl moiety to be crucial for activity. The binding mode was proven by the targeted introduction of a moiety mimicking the enecarbamate side chain of myxopyronin into the hit compound, accompanied by enhanced RNAP inhibitory potency. The new compounds displayed good antibacterial activities against Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative Escherichia coli TolC and a reduced resistance frequency compared to the established antibiotic rifampicin.
