The phytotoxic effects of aluminum and the mechanisms of genetically-based Al tolerance have been widely investigated, as reported in many papers and reviews. However, investigations on many Al-sensitive and Al-resistant species demonstrate that Al phytotoxicity and Al-resistance mechanisms are extremely complex phenomena. The objective of the present study was to analyze the effects of aluminum on the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Also was evaluated the lipid peroxidation, H(2)O(2) content, levels of ascorbic acid (ASA), non-protein thiols (NPSH) and Al content in three genotypes of oat, Avena sativa L. (UFRGS 930598, UFRGS 17, and UFRGS 280). The genotypes were grown in different concentrations of Al ranging from 90 to 555 muM for 5 days. The antioxidant system was unable to overcome toxicity resulting in negative effects such as lipid peroxidation and H(2)O(2) content in UFRGS 930598. The results showed that UFRGS 930598 was the most sensitive genotype. UFRGS 17 and UFRGS 280 were more resistant to Al toxicity. These results suggest that UFRGS 17 has mechanisms of external detoxification and UFRGS 280 has mechanisms of internal detoxification. The different behavior of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants of the genotypes showed that aluminum resistance in UFGRS 17 and UFRGS 280 may be related to oxidative stress.
