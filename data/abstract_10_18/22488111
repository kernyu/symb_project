With the worldwide use of penicillin antibiotics comes the need for tighter controls. Bacterial resistance is a genuine problem and governmental and international bodies, for example the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), have designed strategies to overcome this unfortunate consequence of antibiotic use. Foodstuffs are monitored to ensure they contain very low quantities of antibiotics, so they are not prejudicial to health and the environment. Detection is based on chromatographic methods. However, screening can be performed by use of simpler, rapid methods of detection, e.g. microbial inhibition test, lateral flow assays, immunoassays, and use of biosensors, to reduce the final number of samples to be analyzed by chromatography. In this review, we have gathered information regarding all such screening methods for the penicillins and have critically assessed their capability and specificity for detection of penicillins.
