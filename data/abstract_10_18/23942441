Extensive use of antibiotics have resulted in development of resistance among most commonly used drugs in community acquired urinary tract infection (UTI). This study was conducted to identify the resistance pattern in community acquired UTI .We collected urine for routine examination and culture from suprapubic urine in all the cases to avoid any contamination. E. Coli was the most common organism identified. Among oral antibiotics, there was high degree of resistance to penicillin group and cephalosporin groups. Among parentral antibiotics, all the cephalosporins were variably resistant except cephaperazone-salbactum.
