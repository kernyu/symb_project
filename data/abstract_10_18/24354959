BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of tigecycline in the treatment of infections due to carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP) in critically ill patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in critically ill patients receiving different tigecycline doses for severe CPKP infections. We evaluated demographic data, localization and severity of infection, response to therapy, and mortality. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received tigecycline for 16 episodes of CPKP infection. The main infections were pneumonia (31%), urinary tract infection (31%), peritonitis (20%), catheter-related bacteraemia (12%), and meningitis (6%). Most infections were complicated with severe sepsis (44%), septic shock (12%), and/or bacteraemia (19%). The daily maintenance dose of tigecycline was 200 mg in 10 episodes and 100 mg in 6 episodes. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 25%. Univariate analysis showed that mortality was significantly associated (p < 0.01) with mean APACHE II and SOFA scores and the presence of immunosuppression, but not with the tigecycline dose. CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline appears to be an effective therapy for severe infections due to CPKP in critically ill patients. Mortality is related to the severity of the underlying disease. We observed no benefit from a higher maintenance dose of tigecycline, although the number of patients included in the study was too small to draw any general conclusions in this regard.
