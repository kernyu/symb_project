This review article presents an overview of the potential biomedical application of polymer nanocomposites arising from different chemistries, compositions, and constructions. The interaction between the chosen matrix and the filler is of critical importance. The existing polymer used in the biomedical arena includes aliphatic polyesters such as polylactide (PLA), poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO), poly(butylenes succinate) (PBS), poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s, and natural biopolymers such as starch, cellulose, chitin, chitosan, lignin, and proteins. The nanosized fillers utilized to fabricate the nanocomposites are inorganic, organic, and metal particles such as clays, magnetites, hydroxyapatite, nanotubes chitin whiskers, lignin, cellulose, Au, Ag, Cu, etc. These nanomaterials are taking root in a variety of diverse healthcare applications in the sector of nanomedicine including the domain of medical implants and devices. Despite sterilization and aseptic procedures the use of these biomedical devices and prosthesis to improve the patient's 'quality of life' is facing a major impediment because of bacterial colonization causing nosocomial infection, together with the multi-drug-resistant 'super-bugs' posing a serious threat to its utility. This paper discusses the current efforts and key research challenges in the development of self-sterilizing nanocomposite biomaterials for potential application in this area.
