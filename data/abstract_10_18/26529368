BACKGROUND: Non-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have a negative influence on graft survival. Expert opinion suggests a negative effect of NAS on other important aspects of post-transplant care, although its impact is largely unknown as data are scarce. METHODS: This retrospective single center study analyzed data on healthcare consumption, use of ionizing radiation, infectious complications and development of highly resistant microorganisms (HRMO) in adult patients with NAS. A comparison with a matched control group was made. RESULTS: Forty-three liver recipients with NAS and 43 controls were included. Hospital admissions were higher in patients with NAS. Most common reason for admission was bacterial cholangitis (BC), with 70% of the patients having at least one episode compared to 9% in the control group. In patients with NAS, 67% received at least one ERCP compared to 21% in the control group (p = 0.001). This resulted in a larger yearly received radiation dose for patients with NAS (p = 0.001). Frequency of intravenous antibiotic therapy was higher (p = 0.001) for patients with NAS, consistently resulting in a higher number of cultures found with HRMO (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: NAS after OLT have a negative effect on post-transplant care, increasing readmission rates, interventional procedures, exposure to ionizing radiation, use of antibiotics, and development of HRMO.
