BACKGROUND: S100A7/psoriasin is a member of the S100 protein family and is encoded in the epidermal differentiation complex, which contains genes for markers of epidermal differentiation. S100A7/psoriasin is overexpressed in hyperproliferative skin diseases, where it is believed not only to exhibit antimicrobial functions, but also to induce immunomodulatory activities, including chemotaxis and cytokine/chemokine production. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of S100A7/psoriasin on keratinocyte differentiation and regulation of the tight junction (TJ) barrier. METHODS: Expression of differentiation markers and TJ proteins in human keratinocytes was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The changes in TJ barrier function were assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance and paracellular permeability assays. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was analysed by Western blot, whereas beta-catenin and E-cadherin activation was evaluated by Western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: S100A7/psoriasin enhanced the expression of several differentiation markers and selectively increased the expression of TJ proteins (e.g. claudins and occludin), which are known to strengthen the TJ barrier. Furthermore, S100A7/psoriasin increased beta-catenin and E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell contact, and enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance while reducing the paracellular permeability of keratinocyte layers. The data suggest that S100A7/psoriasin-mediated regulation of the TJ barrier was via both the GSK-3 and MAPK pathways, as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of inhibitors for GSK-3 and MAPKs. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that S100A7/psoriasin regulates differentiation and strengthens TJ barrier function provides novel evidence that, in addition to antimicrobial and immunoregulatory activities, S100A7/psoriasin is involved in skin innate immunity.
