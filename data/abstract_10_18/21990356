MyD88 is an intracellular adaptor protein that transmits signals downstream of immune receptors such as the IL-1 receptor and the majority of the known mammalian toll-like receptors. Homologs of MyD88 have been identified in many vertebrate species; however, the adaptor has been studied mostly in mammals, and little is known about its function in lower vertebrates. The results presented in the current paper demonstrate, for the first time, that the teleost MyD88, through its Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domain, interacts with SsIRF3 and two SsIRF7 paralogs: transcription factors that are critically involved in the virus-induced IFN responses. The data further highlight the potential of transgenic SsMyD88 to modulate the IRF-induced type I IFN response as the adaptor synergized with SsIRF3 to activate IRF-E/IFN-stimulated response element-containing reporter gene constructs and endogenous myxovirus resistance homolog expression. Microscopy analyses demonstrated that, similar to mammalian MyD88, both endogenous and transgenic SsMyD88 accumulated in intracellular aggregates. However, unlike the endogenous SsMyD88 clusters, which co-localized with endocytosed CpGs and probably represented myddosomes, overexpressed SsMyD88 accumulated in aggresomes. Although these structures accumulated ubiquitinated proteins, they did not associate with the autophagosome markers p62 and light chain 3-like protein, indicating that they are most likely classical aggresomes rather than aggresome-like induced structures, aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins induced by toll-like receptor/MyD88 signaling in antigen-presenting cells. The significance of the accumulation of transgenic MyD88 in aggresomes is currently unknown; nevertheless it is tempting to speculate that it might represent a defense mechanism against the potentially harmful effects of excessive MyD88 signaling.
