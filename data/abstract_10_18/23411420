PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The incidence of both invasive fungal infections and respiratory mould infections is increasing and they cause significant costs, morbidity and mortality. Non-Aspergillus moulds are increasing as cause of lung infections in specific populations and new problems of susceptibility and resistance are appearing. RECENT FINDINGS: The antifungal armamentarium has markedly improved in the past 10 years and some new drugs are in the pipeline. The use of these new agents is one of the drivers of the changes in fungal epidemiology. These new antifungal drugs are discussed in this article. SUMMARY: A good selection of the antifungal, taking into consideration the pathogen, the host and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics of the drug, is paramount for clinical success.
