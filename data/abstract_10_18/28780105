Dairy calves are colonized shortly after birth by multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Escherichia coli. The role of dairy colostrum fed to calves as a potential source of MDR bacteria resistance genes has not been investigated. This study determined the recovery rate of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant (ESC-R) E. coli in colostrum from cows. The ESC-R E. coli isolates were further investigated to determine their phenotypic antimicrobial resistance pattern and the genes conferring ESC-R. Fresh colostrum was collected from 452 cows from 8 dairy herds in New Brunswick, Canada. The ESC-R E. coli was isolated from the colostrum by using the VACC agar, a selective media for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all the suspected ESC-R E. coli isolates using a commercial gram-negative broth microdilution method. Two multiplex PCR were conducted on all the suspected ESC-R E. coli isolates to determine the presence of the blaCTX-M (groups 1, 2, 9, and 8/25) blaCMY-2, blaSHV, and blaTEM resistance genes. The ESC-R E. coli were detected in 20 (4.43%) of the colostrum samples. At least 1 ESC-R E. coli isolate was detected in 6 (75%) of the dairy herds. All ESC-R E. coli had MDR profiles based on minimum inhibitory concentration testing. No blaCTX-M groups genes were detected; however, the blaCMY-2 gene was detected in 9 or 20 (45%) and blaTEM was detected in 7 of 20 (35%) of the ESC-R E. coli. No ESC-R E. coli had both blaCMY-2 and blaTEM resistance genes. This is the first report of blaCMY-2 and blaTEM genes found in E. coli isolates cultured from dairy colostrum to our knowledge.
