A chitosan-silver nanoparticle solution (CSNS) was applied as a coating material to Hanji (Korean traditional paper), and the properties of the coated paper were investigated as a function of the dilution ratio. The required CSNS was first prepared from AgNO3 (30mmol) by utilizing chitosan as a reducing and stabilizing agent via ultrasonication. The as-prepared CSNS was diluted to various ratios (undiluted, 1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000) and applied to Hanji by a dip-coating method. The tensile, burst, oil resistance, and antibacterial properties of the coated Hanji against Escherichia coli were evaluated. Among the various dilution ratios, the maximum level of dilution that can positively influence the tensile, burst, oil resistance, and antibacterial properties of Hanji was identified as 1/10, 1/100, 1/10 and 1/1000 of the pure CSNS, respectively. These findings are significant because a specific property of Hanji can be economically improved by changing the dilution ratio.
