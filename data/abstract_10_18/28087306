In this research, we analyzed the main sequence types (ST) and ST complexes of human- and chicken-derived isolates of Campylobacter jejuni in Japan by using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). We also analyzed lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis locus classes (LOS locus classes) and the numbers of isolates carrying genes coding resistance factors against various antibiotics, and observed their relationships. ST-21 complex was the main ST complex in isolates from humans (n = 38) and chickens (n = 25). None of the isolates showed resistance to imipenem, chloramphenicol, or erythromycin. Few isolates were resistant to ampicillin and streptomycin (1.3%-15%), whereas many showed resistance to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid (38%-48%). Among the ST-21 complex isolates, ST4526 was detected at a very high rate. Those isolates showed resistance to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, and were susceptible to ampicillin. Among the chicken-derived isolates, 37 of the 38 isolates that showed resistance to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid had threonine to isoleucine amino acid substitution in GyrA at codon 86 (T86I). Among the human-derived isolates, 17 of the 47 isolates that showed resistance to ciprofloxacin and 16 of the 48 isolates that showed resistance to nalidixic acid did not have T86I amino acid mutations in GyrA. The human-derived ST-21 complex isolates were classified into LOS locus classes A, B, C, D, and E. The chicken-derived ST-21 complex isolates, with the exception of one isolate, were all classified into LOS locus classes C and D. Among chicken-derived isolates, the most prevalent was ST51 (ST-443 complex) (10 isolates) and all of those were LOS locus class E.
