beta-Lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) binds and inhibits a diverse collection of class A beta-lactamases. Widespread resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics currently limits the treatment strategies for Staphylococcus infections. The goals of this study were to determine the binding affinity of BLIP for Staphylococcus aureus PC1 beta-lactamase and to identify mutants that alter binding affinity. The BLIP inhibition constant (K(i)) for PC1 beta-lactamase was measured at 350 nM, and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated a binding constant (K(d)) of 380 nM. Twenty-three residue positions in BLIP that contact beta-lactamase were randomized, and phage display was used to sort the libraries for tight binders to immobilized PC1 beta-lactamase. The BLIP(K74G) mutant was the dominant clone selected, and it was found to inhibit the PC1 beta-lactamase with a K(i) of 42 nM, while calorimetry indicated a K(d) of 26 nM. Molecular modeling studies suggested that BLIP binds weakly to the PC1 beta-lactamase due to the presence of alanine at position 104 of PC1. This position is occupied by glutamate in the TEM-1 enzyme, where it forms a salt bridge with the BLIP residue Lys74 that is important for the stability of the complex. This hypothesis was confirmed by showing that the PC1(A104E) enzyme binds BLIP with 15-fold greater affinity than wild-type PC1 beta-lactamase. Kinetic measurements indicated similar association rates for all complexes with variation in affinity due to altered dissociation rate constants, suggesting that changes in short-range interactions are responsible for the altered binding properties of the mutants.
