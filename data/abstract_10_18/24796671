TlyA proteins belong to 2'-O-methyltransferases. Methylation is a common posttranscriptional RNA modification. The Campylobacter jejuni Cj0588 protein belongs to the TlyA(I) protein family and is a rRNA methyltransferase. Methylation of ribosomal RNA catalyzed by Cj0588 appears to have an impact on the biology of the cell. Presence of the cj0588 gene in bacteria appears to be important for ribosome stability and virulence properties. Absence of the Cj0588 protein causes accumulation of the 50S ribosomal subunits, reduction in the amount of functional 70S ribosomes and confers increase resistance to capreomycin.
