This review focused on the news in CF airways infection. International guidelines were provided for the care of non tuberculous mycobacteria, and recent studies stressed on the benefit effect of azithromycin or combined antibiotics. The identification of multiresistant environmental bacteria in airways made to account for little-known consequences. Early diagnosis and eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus methi-R were still a concern, and reports were proposed. However, the studies on staphylococcus methi-R should be interpreted as regards the European or American continent. Thus, levofloxacine has demonstrated its efficacy without enhancing the efficiency. This drug will increase the choice for treating the patient, but no study were provided on the expected modification of the patient microbiota and the known risk of emergent resistance to antibiotics. Lastly, this review underlined that the CF practitioner was encouraged to search and not underestimate the presence of fungus, of which the not so well studied Aspergillus fumigatus.
