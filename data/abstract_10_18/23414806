A novel series of 3-O-carbamoyl erythromycin A derived analogs, labeled carbamolides, with activity versus resistant bacterial isolates of staphylococci (including macrolide and oxazolidinone resistant strains) and streptococci are reported. An (R)-2-aryl substituent on a pyrrolidine carbamate appeared to be critical for achieving potency against resistant strains. Crystal structures showed a distinct aromatic interaction between the (R)-2-aryl (3-pyridyl for 4d) substituent on the pyrrolidine and G2484 (G2505, Escherichia coli) of the Deinococcus radiodurans 50S ribosome (3.2A resolution).
