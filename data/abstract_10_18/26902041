BACKGROUND/AIMS: Entecavir and tenofovir are generally accepted as first-line therapeutic options in chronic hepatitis B. Both of them are potent and have high genetic barrier to viral resistance. Aim of this study was to compare the two-year efficacy of entecavir and tenofovir in treatment-naive chronic hepatitis B patients. METHODOLOGY: Study was comprised 164 patients with treatment naive chronic hepatitis or compensated liver cirrhosis. At least twenty four mouths of entecavir or tenofovir were given to all patients. RESULTS: Mean ALT levels, ALT normalization rates, mean HBV DNA levels, HBV DNA negativity rates and HBeAg negativity rates were not different in entecavir and tenofovir groups throughout the study. Mean serum creatinine levels were also similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Two-years of antiviral treatment of treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B or cirrhosis with entecavir or tenofovir were equally effective.
