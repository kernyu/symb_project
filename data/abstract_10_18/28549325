In recent years, the influence of new materials like nanoparticles in the water environment on biological substances has been widely studied. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) represent a new type of pollutant in the environment. Graphene oxide (GO), as a nano material, because of its unique structure, may have an impact on antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARB) and ARGs; however the research in this area is rarely reported. Therefore, this study mainly investigated the effects of GO on bacterial antibiotic resistance. The results showed that GO had a limited effect on ARB inactivation. A high concentration of GO (>10 mg/L) can damage resistant plasmids to reduce bacterial resistance to antibiotics, but low concentrations of GO (<1 mg/L) led to almost no damage to the plasmid. However, all tested concentrations of GO promoted the conjugative transfer from 1to over 3 folds, with low concentrations and high concentration (1-10 and 100 mg/L) of GO samples the least promoted. The overall effect of GO on antibiotic resistance needs further investigation.
