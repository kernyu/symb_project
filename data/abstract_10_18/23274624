Despite greater than 99% of influenza A viruses circulating in the Asia-Pacific region being resistant to the adamantane antiviral drugs in 2011, the large majority of influenza A (>97%) and B strains ( approximately 99%) remained susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. However, compared to the first year of the 2009 pandemic, cases of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with the H275Y neuraminidase mutation increased in 2011, primarily due to an outbreak of oseltamivir-resistant viruses that occurred in Newcastle, as reported in Hurt et al. (2011c, 2012a), where the majority of the resistant viruses were from community patients not being treated with oseltamivir. A small number of influenza B viruses with reduced oseltamivir or zanamivir susceptibility were also detected. The increased detection of neuraminidase inhibitor resistant strains circulating in the community and the detection of novel variants with reduced susceptibility are reminders that monitoring of influenza viruses is important to ensure that antiviral treatment guidelines remain appropriate.
