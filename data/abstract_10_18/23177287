NS5A protein plays a key role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Daclatasvir (DCV, BMS-790052) is a first-in-class inhibitor of the HCV NS5A replication complex with potent antiviral activity but a low barrier to resistance. DCV as triple therapy in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin resulted in a high rate of early virologic response in treatment-naive patients with genotype 1 infection; as quadruple therapy in combination with asunaprevir (BMS-650032, NS3 protease inhibitor), pegylated interferon, and ribavirin, it resulted in a high rate of sustained virologic response in genotype 1 prior null responders.
