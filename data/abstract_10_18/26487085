The quasispecies diversity of RNA viruses is mainly determined by the fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during viral RNA replication. Certain amino acid residues play an important role in determining the fidelity, and such residues can be substituted with other amino acids to produce virus strains with higher fidelity. In this study, two amino acid substitutions (A283T and H421Y) in the RdRp of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were identified under the selection of ribavirin. Preliminary data showed that two substitutions were involved in conferring PRRSV with the properties of increased ribavirin resistance and restricted quasispecies diversity. The results indicated that these two amino acid residues (Ala283 and His421) play a crucial role in PRRSV replication by affecting the fidelity of its RdRp. The results have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of PRRSV evolution and pathogenicity, and developing a safer modified live-attenuated vaccine (MLV) against PRRSV.
