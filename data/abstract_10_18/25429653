The scenario of tuberculosis has gone deadly due to its high prevalence and emergence of widespread drug resistance. It is now high time to develop novel antimycobacterial strategies and to understand novel mechanisms of existing antimycobacterial compounds so that we are equipped with newer tuberculosis controlling molecules in the days to come. Iron has proven to be essential for pathogenesis of tuberculosis and retinoic acid is known to influence the iron metabolism pathway. Retenoic acid is also known to exhibit antitubercular effect in in vivo system. Therefore there is every possibility that retinoic acid by affecting the iron metabolism pathway exhibits its antimycobacterial effect. These aspects are reviewed in the present manuscript for understanding the antimycobacterial role of retinoic acid in the context of iron metabolism and other immunological aspects.
