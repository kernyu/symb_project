In recent years, the emergence of fungal resistance has become frequent, partly due to the widespread clinical use of fluconazole, which is minimally toxic and effective in the prevention and treatment of Candida albicans infections. The limited selection of antifungal drugs for clinical fungal infection therapy has prompted us to search for new antifungal drug targets. Calcium, which acts as the second messenger in both mammals and fungi, plays a direct role in controlling the expression patterns of its signaling systems and has important roles in cell survival. In addition, calcium and some of the components, mainly calcineurin, in the fungal calcium signaling pathway mediate fungal resistance to antifungal drugs. Therefore, an overview of the components of the fungal calcium-calcineurin signaling network and their potential roles as antifungal targets is urgently needed. The calcium-calcineurin signaling pathway consists of various channels, transporters, pumps, and other proteins or enzymes. Many transcriptional profiles have indicated that mutant strains that lack some of these components are sensitized to fluconazole or other antifungal drugs. In addition, many researchers have identified efficient compounds that exhibit antifungal activity by themselves or in combination with antifungal drugs by targeting some of the components in the fungal calcium-calcineurin signaling pathway. This targeting disrupts Ca(2+) homeostasis, which suggests that this pathway contains potential targets for the development of new antifungal drugs.
