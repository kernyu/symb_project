BACKGROUND: Technologies applied to mobile devices can be an important strategy in antibiotic stewardship programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a decision-making application on antibiotic prescription. METHODS: This was an observational, analytical and longitudinal study on the implementation of an antimicrobial guide for mobile application. This study analyzed the period of 12 months before and 12 months after the app implementation at a university hospital based on local epidemiology, avoiding high cost drugs and reducing the potential for drug resistance including carbapenem. Antimicrobials consumption was evaluated in Daily Defined Dose/1000 patients-day and direct expenses converted into USD. RESULTS: The monthly average consumption of aminoglycosides and cefepime had a statistically significant increase (p<0.05), while the consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem was significantly decreased (p<0.05). The sensitivity to meropenem as well as to polymyxin increased after the app implementation. A decrease in sensitivity to cefepime was observed after introduction of this antibiotic as a substitute of piperacillin/tazobactam for treating intra-hospital infections. There was a net saving of USD 296,485.90 (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: An antibiotic protocol in the app can help antibiotic stewardship reducing cost, changing the microbiological profile and antimicrobial consumption.
