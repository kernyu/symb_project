Enterococci are part of the indigenous microbiota of human gastrointestinal tract and food of animal origin. Enterococci inhabiting non-human reservoirs play a critical role in the acquisition and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance determinants. The aim of this work was to investigate the antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium strains recovered from artisanal food of animal origin. Samples of goat cheese (n = 42), cow cheese (n = 40), artisanal salami (n = 30), and minced meat for the manufacture of hamburgers (n = 60) were analyzed. Phenotypic and genotypic tests for species-level identification of the recovered isolates were carried out. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) study for in vitro quantitative antimicrobial resistance assessment was performed, and 71 E. faecalis and 22 E. faecium were isolated. The recovered enterococci showed different multi-drug resistance patterns that included tretracycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, gentamicin (high-level resistance), and streptomycin (high-level resistance). VanA-type E. faecium were detected. beta-lactamase activity was not observed. Artisanal foods of animal origin act as a non-human reservoir of E. faecalis and E. faecuim strains, expressing multi-resistance to antimicrobials. In conclusion, the implementation of a continuous antimicrobial resistance surveillance in enterococci isolated from artisanal food of animal origin is important.
