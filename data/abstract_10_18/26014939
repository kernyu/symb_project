Candida albicans biofilms contain a subpopulation whose members are defined as persisters, displaying great tolerance of fungicides. To directly observe such persisters, an effective method using green fluorescent protein (GFP) strain labeling by mutation of the gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (TDH3), combined with propidium iodide (PI) staining, was established. Amphotericin B-tolerant persisters harbor the characteristics of both GFP positivity [GFP (+)] and propidium iodide (PI) negativity [PI (-)], which are easily visualized using a fluorescence microscope and measured by flow cytometry.
