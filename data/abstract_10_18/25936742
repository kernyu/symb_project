OBJECTIVE: To study the diagnostic accuracy of a multiplex real-time PCR (Anyplex II MTB/MDR/XDR, Seegene, Corea) that detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), fluoroquinolones (FLQ) and injectable drugs (kanamycin [KAN], amikacin [AMK] and capreomycin [CAP]) in isolates and specimens. METHODS: One hundred fourteen cultured isolates and 73 sputum specimens were retrospectively selected. Results obtained with multiplex PCR were compared with those obtained with BACTEC. Discordant results between multiplex PCR and BACTEC were tested by alternative molecular methods. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR for detecting drug resistance in isolates were 76.5% and 100%, respectively, for INH; 97.2% and 96.0%, respectively, for RIF; 70.4% and 87.9%, respectively, for FLQ; 81.5% and 84.8%, respectively, for KAN; 100% and 60%, respectively, for AMK, and 100% and 72.3%, respectively, for CAP. Sensitivity and specificity of Anyplex for detecting drug resistance in specimens were 93.3% and 100%, respectively, for INH; 100% and 100%, respectively, for RIF; 50.0% and 100%, respectively, for FLQ; and 100% and 94.4%, respectively, for both KAN and CAP. Among the discordant results, 87.7% (71/81) of results obtained with the multiplex PCR were concordant with at least one of the alternative molecular methods. CONCLUSIONS: This multiplex PCR may be a useful tool for the rapid identification of drug resistant tuberculosis in isolates and specimens, thus allowing an initial therapeutic approach. Nevertheless, for a correct management of patients, results should be confirmed by a phenotypic method.
