Honokiol (HNK), one of the main medicinal components in Magnolia officinalis, possesses antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. However, little is known of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the antimicrobial activity. To explore the molecular mechanism of its antifungal activity, we determined the effects of HNK on the mRNA expression profile of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a DNA microarray approach. HNK markedly induced the expression of genes related to iron uptake and homeostasis. Conversely, genes associated with respiratory electron transport were downregulated, mirroring the effects of iron starvation. Meanwhile, HNK-induced growth deficiency was partly rescued by iron supplementation and HNK reacted with iron, producing iron complexes that depleted iron. These results suggest that HNK treatment induced iron starvation. Additionally, HNK treatment resulted in the upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis and drug resistance networks. Furthermore, the deletion of PDR5, a gene encoding the plasma membrane ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, conferred sensitivity to HNK. Overexpression of PDR5 enhanced resistance of WT and pdr5Delta strains to HNK. Taken together, these findings suggest that HNK, which can be excluded by overexpression of Pdr5, functions in multiple cellular processes in S. cerevisiae, particularly in inducing iron starvation to inhibit cell growth.
