There is an urgent need to identify new antibiotics with novel mechanisms that combat antibiotic resistant bacteria. Herein, a series of chalcone derivatives that mimic the essential properties of cationic antimicrobial peptides were designed and synthesized. Antibacterial activities against drug-sensitive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, as well as clinical multiple drug resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), KPC-2-producing and NDM-1-producing Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were evaluated. Representative compounds 5a (MIC: 1 mug/mL against S. aureus, 0.5 mug/mL against MRSA) and 5g (MIC: 0.5 mug/mL against S. aureus, 0.25 mug/mL against MRSA) showed good bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including the drug-resistant species MRSA, KPC and NDM. These membrane-active antibacterial compounds were demonstrated to reduce the viable cell counts in bacterial biofilms effectively and do not induce the development of resistance in bacteria. Additionally, these representative molecules exhibited negligible toxicity toward mammalian cells at a suitable concentration. The combined results indicate that this series of cationic chalcone derivatives have potential therapeutic effects against bacterial infections.
