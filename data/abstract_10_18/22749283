We have designed and synthesized a series of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) with enamino-oxindole substituents optimized to interact with the S2' subsite of the HIV protease binding pocket. Several of these inhibitors have sub-nanomolar K(i) and antiviral IC(50) in the low nM range against WT HIV and against a panel of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains.
