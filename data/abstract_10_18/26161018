BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine bathing are candidate strategies to prevent healthcare-associated infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In Korea, intranasal mupirocin is not available, and mupirocin ointment, an over-the-counter drug, has been used indiscriminately. Furthermore, because it is covered by health insurance, mupirocin is easy to prescribe within hospitals. METHODS: We performed a mupirocin drug utilization review (DUR) within Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital. Annual use of mupirocin was investigated between 2003 and 2013, and monthly consumption of mupirocin was assessed during the final 2-year period. The DUR focused on August 2012, the period of highest use of mupirocin. Also, we investigated trends in mupirocin resistance in MRSA between 2011 and 2013. RESULTS: Annual consumption of mupirocin increased from 3,529 tubes in 2003 to 6,475 tubes in 2013. During August 2012, 817 tubes were prescribed to 598 patients; of these, 84.9% were prescribed to outpatients, and 77.6% at the dermatology department. The most common indication was prevention of skin infections (84.9%), and the ointment was combined with systemic antibiotics in 62.9% of cases. The average duration of systemic antibiotic administration was about 7.8 days. The rate of low-level mupirocin resistance in MRSA increased from 8.0% to 22.0%, and that of high-level mupirocin resistance increased from about 4.0% to about 7.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Inappropriate use of mupirocin is prevalent. Considering the increase in resistance and the future application of intranasal mupirocin, prophylactic use of mupirocin in dermatology departments should be reconsidered.
