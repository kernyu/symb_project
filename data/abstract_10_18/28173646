Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in children and to study the effectiveness of second-line anti-TB therapy for children and to examine the incidence of adverse drug reactions. Method: Retrospective research was conducted. The clinical records of children in West China Second Hospital diagnosed as drug-resistant TB from January 2010 to June 2014 were investigated.The clinical characteristics and risk factors were analyzed retrospectively. Treatment effect at discharge was examined as a short-term outcome indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of second-line anti-TB therapy and the incidence of adverse drug reactions. chi(2) test was used. Result: Forty-six patients were diagnosed as drug-resistant TB in 443 children infected with TB, with a 10.4% resistance rate. The 46 children included 26 male and 20 female patients, aged from one month and 28 days to 17 years and 5 months, with the average age (8.4+/-4.5) years, >7 to 14 years old patients as the biggest part(25 patients, 54.3%). Among the 46 children, 20 patients(43.5%)had close contact with TB patients, of whom 12 patients (60.0%) contacted with family members (including parents, brothers and sisters and grandparents living together) and 8 patients(40.0%) contacted with patients from outside family (such as relatives or neighbors). Moreover, 11 cases (23.9%) were under initial treatment and 35 cases (76.1%) were retreated.From 2010 to 2014, the number of cases of initial and retreated patients had no significant difference(0 and 1, 1 and 13, 4 and 7, 4 and 11, 2 and 3 cases, chi(2)=3.255, P=0.196). Among retreated patients, 31.4% (11/35) had irregular treatment before.Until discharge, the effective rate was 87.0% (40/46), while the incidence rate of adverse drug reaction was 10.9%(5/46). Conclusion: The therapy for drug-resistant TB is effective and the incidence of adverse drug reaction is relatively low.
