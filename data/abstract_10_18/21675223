Effects of low doses of ethanol on indices of spatial organization of cortical potentials (spatial synchronization, coherence, spectral power and information-power index) under the closed- and open-eyes conditions and during performance of divergent and convergent non-verbal and verbal tasks. Ethanol effect was shown to be more expressed under the open eyes-conditions as compared to that with the closed eyes. This finding may be associated with the greater effect of the stream of afferent information in the former case. Changes in topographical characteristics of the spatial synchronization of cortical potentials were more clearly localized and "specific" during divergent thinking as compared to the convergent type. Changes in the spectral power and information-power index testify to greater sensitivity to ethanol of divergent type of thinking as compared to convergent type. Psychological testing of stress resistance and impulsivity also showed a greater effect of ethanol on divergent thinking.
