We report high colonization rates among 400 healthy infants and children, and moderate (66%) coverage by PCV7 and PCV10, with a superior (80%) PCV13 coverage. Most frequent serotypes were 23F, 6B, 19F, and 14. Resistance to penicillin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was 83%, 18%, 62%, and 66%, respectively. 67% isolates were multidrug resistant. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines covered 80% to 93% of multidrug resistant isolates.
