OBJECTIVES: To investigate in vitro susceptibilities of canine and feline Escherichia coli and canine Pseudomonas spp. isolates to ticarcillin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (T/C). DESIGN: In vitro susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates collected from infections. METHODS: We tested 148 (83 canine and 65 feline) E. coli and 61 canine Pseudomonas spp. isolates for susceptibility to T/C using both disc diffusion and Epsilometer tests (E-tests). Additionally, susceptibilities of 96 E. coli and 23 canine Pseudomonas spp. isolates were tested via disc diffusion to ticarcillin alone. RESULTS: Of the E. coli isolates obtained from canine and feline urine, 92% by disc diffusion and 91% by E-tests were susceptible to T/C. Of the canine Pseudomonas isolates, 90% by disc diffusion and 82% by E-tests were susceptible to T/C. Of the Pseudomonas spp. isolates from the canine ear canal or tympanic bullae, 12% of isolates tested via disc diffusion and 23% via E-tests were found to be resistant to T/C. The 50% minimum inhibitory concentration of T/C for all feline E. coli isolates was significantly lower than that for all canine E. coli isolates (P = 0.0031). The addition of clavulanic acid significantly increased the efficacy of ticarcillin against E. coli (P< 0.0001), but had negligible effect against canine Pseudomonas spp. isolates. CONCLUSION: Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid has reasonable in vitro efficacy against canine and feline E. coli, and canine Pseudomonas spp. isolates. However, decisions to use this drug therapeutically must be made on prudent considerations to minimise selection for bacterial resistance.
