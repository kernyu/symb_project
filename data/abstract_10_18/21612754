BACKGROUND/AIMS: Refractory nephrotic syndrome (NS) is problematic because the optimal therapy for this disease is unclear and because persistent NS progresses eventually to end-stage renal disease. We report our experience using a combination of corticosteroid, cyclosporine A (CsA), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to treat 10 refractory NS patients. METHODS: Ten refractory NS patients, who showed resistance to corticosteroid and CsA, were treated with triple immunosuppressive therapy. Cyclophosphamide and MMF had been used previously in 6 patients, but had failed to induce remission. RESULTS: Triple immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued after 4 months in 1 patient because of progressive azotemia. Partial remission was achieved in 9 of the 10 patients after 10 months, and remission was maintained during the treatment (urine protein to creatinine ratio, mg/mg, baseline vs. 12th month; 5.7 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.7). Renal function was preserved in these 9 patients (estimated GFR, ml/min/1.73 m2, baseline vs. 12th month; 71.4 +/- 29.1 vs. 68.9 +/- 31.5). Of the 7 patients who discontinued triple immunosuppressive therapy, remission and renal function were maintained in 4 patients. CONCLUSION: Triple immunosuppressive therapy significantly reduced proteinuria and preserved renal function in refractory NS patients, indicating a promising role of this therapy for refractory NS.
