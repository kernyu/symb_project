The degree of polymerization of O-antigen from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is controlled by the products of the wzz(s)(t) and wzz(fepE) genes. In the present study we investigated the role of the PmrA/PmrB regulatory system in wzz(fepE) transcription. We report that the direct binding of the PmrA regulator to a specific promoter site induces the expression of the wzz(fepE) gene. This effect increases the amount of very long (VL) O-antigen, which is required for the resistance of Salmonella to serum human complement and polymyxin B, and for the replication of the bacteria within macrophages. The results obtained here highlight functional differences between Wzz(fepE) and Wzz(st), although the genes for both proteins are regulated in a PmrA-dependent way.
