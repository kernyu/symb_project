We report the emergence and analysis of a cluster of concurrent infections/colonisations with colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and OXA-23 carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii in patients who had undergone cardiac surgery. We describe the emergence of colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae harbouring blaCTX-M-15, blaSHV-11, blaOXA-1, blaTEM-1 beta-lactamases and aac(6')-Ib-cr fluoroquinolone resistance. Colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae infections (pneumonia, wound infection, urinary tract infections and bacteraemia) occurred in critically ill patients previously treated with colistin for post-surgery infections with carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or A. baumannii. Although the cause of death could not be directly attributed to a single pathogen, three patients co-infected/colonised with K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and/or A. baumannii died, whilst a fourth patient who had a mono-microbial infection with colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae only survived. The use of mobile intubation equipment in patients that shared the same ward, the clustering of cases over a short period of time, as well as the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) data all suggest cross-contamination between patients, either through equipment or by staff contact transmission. This report presents the 'worst-case scenario' where concurrent infection/colonisation with pathogens exhibiting resistance to different types of last-resort antimicrobials occurred in some of the most debilitated intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
