A bioadhesive wound dressing material, based on gelatin, was prepared by solution casting, and its properties were evaluated. The tensile strength (TS) and percentage elongation at break (Eb) of the membranes were found to be 12.7 MPa and 40.4%, respectively. The buffer uptake and water uptake of the prepared membranes were found to be 298 and 312%, respectively, after 8 min. A scanning electron micrograph of the membrane revealed its uniform porosity, which is an essential criterion to be an ideal wound dressing. From microbial sensitivity analysis, it was found that the membrane had a significant resistance against infection. The wound-healing characteristics of the membrane were evaluated using a rat (Rattus norvegicus) model. Full-thickness wounds were created on the ventral side of the Rattus norvegicus and were dressed with the membrane; eco-plast was used as a control. The wound healing and bioadhesion were monitored at 3-day intervals by real-time imaging. The results revealed that the prepared membrane was more effective in healing the wound than conventional wound dressing.
