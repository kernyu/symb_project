AIM: The pro-atherogenic role of RANTES, a chemokine expressing pleiotropic activities, in the course of type 2 diabetes-related atherosclerosis has been well documented. However, it is not known which of the diabetes-related factors primarily influence serum RANTES levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our aim was to investigate relationships between several factors known to be related to an increased risk of atherosclerosis and serum RANTES levels in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: A total of 168 subjects were examined, which included 138 patients with type 2 diabetes and 30 non-diabetic controls. Measurements of venous, fasting, plasma glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG) plasma levels, homocysteine and the fasting, serum C-peptide levels were performed. Serum concentrations of RANTES were assayed using BD(TM) Cytometric Bead Array tests. Peripheral insulin resistance was expressed according to a new index defined by Ohkura et al. RESULTS: RANTES levels in type 2 diabetic patients correlated with 1,5-AG, fasting glycaemia, HbA1c and the Ohkura index. Multivariate regression analysis was performed taking into consideration several factors related to the inflammatory process and atherosclerosis, namely the patient's age, diabetes duration, waist circumference, 1,5-AG, HbA1c, lipid profile parameters, serum homocysteine levels and Ohkura index, as independent variables potentially influencing serum RANTES levels in type 2 diabetic patients. It is shown that RANTES concentrations in the serum is primarily dependent upon 1,5-AG plasma levels. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that increased serum levels of RANTES in type 2 diabetic patients are closely related to postprandial (acute) hyperglycaemia.
