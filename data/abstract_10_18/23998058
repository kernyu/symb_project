OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to detect the prevalence of the blaNDM-1 metallo beta lactamases (MBLs) in the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were recovered from various clinical samples from hospitalized patients in a tertiary care centre in Pune, India. METHODS: A total of 200 isolates of P. aeruginosa which were obtained from various clinical samples were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by the disc-diffusion method and their MICs were determined by the Vitek - 2 Automated Antimicrobial Identification and Susceptibility Testing System against imipenem, meropenem, ticarcillin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, cefepime, tetracycline, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and colistin. Their MICs were also determined by the Etest method against imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin, tobramycin, ceftazidime, tigecycline and colistin. The presence of blaNDM-1 was detected by PCR and it was confirmed by sequencing the gene which was present in the isolates which exhibited carbapenem resistance. The experimental transferability of the plasmids which carried blaNDM-1 was determined by using E. coli J53 as the recipient. RESULT: In the present study, four isolates of P. aeruginosa, which carried the blaNDM-1 gene, were resistant to imipenem and meropenem. These blaNDM-1 carrying isolates remained susceptible to colistin. The plasmid carrying blaNDM-1 was successfully transferred from the four isolates to E. coli J53 recipients. CONCLUSIONS: We are reporting the emergence of the P. aeruginosa carrying NDM-1gene, which exhibited resistance to imipenem and meropenem, for the first time from India.
