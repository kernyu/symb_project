Using an enrichment protocol, we isolated 16 gram-negative, multidrug-resistant strains of known or opportunistic bacterial pathogens from the Salmon River in south-central British Columbia from 2005 to 2009, and investigated the genetic basis of their resistance to a variety of antibiotics. Of the 16 strains, 13 carried class 1 integrons and three carried class 2 integrons. Genes found in cassettes associated with the integrons included those for dihydrofolate reductases (dfrA1, dfrA12, dfrA17, and dfrB7), aminoglycoside adenyltransferases (aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, and aadB), streptothricin acetyltransferase (sat), and hypothetical proteins (orfF and orfC). A new gene cassette of unknown function, orf1, was discovered between dfrA1 and aadA5 in Escherichia sp. Other genes for resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and kanamycin (tetA, tetB, tetD; catA; strA-strB; and aphA1-Iab, respectively) were outside the integrons. Several of these resistance determinants were transferable by conjugation. The detection of organisms and resistance determinants normally associated with clinical settings attest to their widespread dispersal and suggest that regular monitoring of their presence in aquatic habitats should become a part of the overall effort to understand the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria.
