Fluoroquinolones have become a staple antimicrobial in a variety of settings for a wide spectrum of infectious diseases. Although fluoroquinolones have been associated with a broad spectrum of adverse events, the side effect profile is generally acceptable. Their use in the intensive care unit as empiric therapy is becoming compromised due to the development of multiple drug resistant gram negative pathogens and collateral damage with C difficile & MRSA. Fluoroquinolones should be used along with another antibiotic of different chemical structure, mechanism of action, and pharmacodynamic profile to ensure adequate initial antimicrobial coverage and maximize the likelihood of a favorable clinical and microbiologic response.
