BACKGROUND: In patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), switching to monotherapy with ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r) can maintain plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression with no treatment-emergent drug resistance; effects on cellular HIV-1 DNA burden are less well characterized. METHODS: In MONET, patients on stable combination ART for at least 6 months with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL and no history of virologic failure switched to DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily, either alone (n = 127) or with 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (n = 129). In a representative subset of 146 patients, total HIV-1 DNA load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was tested retrospectively at baseline, week 48, week 96, and week 144. RESULTS: Mean HIV-1 DNA levels at baseline vs week 144 were 2.50 vs 2.49 log10 copies/106 PBMC in the monotherapy arm and 2.59 vs 2.61 log10 copies/106 PBMC in the triple therapy arm, with mean (median) changes of -0.05 (-0.03) and +0.03 (+0.01) log10 copies/106 PBMC in the 2 arms, respectively. Overall baseline HIV-1 DNA levels were higher in patients with nadir CD4 counts <200 cell/microL (P<.05) and in patients who over 144 weeks experienced at least 1 HIV-1 RNA measurement >50 copies/mL (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In this substudy of the MONET trial, HIV-1 DNA levels remained stable during 144 weeks of either DRV/r monotherapy or triple therapy with DRV/r + 2 NRTIs. In both treatment arms, baseline HIV-1 DNA levels were predicted by the nadir CD4 cell count and predictive of plasma HIV-1 RNA detection during follow-up.
