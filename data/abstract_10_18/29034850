Overuse of antibiotics is contributing to an emerging antimicrobial resistance crisis. To better understand how bacteria adapt tolerance and resist antibiotic treatment, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates obtained from infection sites sampled from companion animals were collected and evaluated for phenotypic differences. Selected pairs of clonal isolates were obtained from individual infection samples and were assessed for antibiotic susceptibility, cyclic di-GMP levels, biofilm production, motility and genetic-relatedness. A total of 18 samples from equine, feline and canine origin were characterized. A sample from canine otitis media produced a phenotypically heterogeneous pair of P. aeruginosa isolates, 42121A and 42121B, which during growth on culture medium respectively exhibited hyper dye-binding small colony morphology and wild-type phenotypes. Antibiotic susceptibility to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin also differed between this pair of clonal isolates. Sequence analysis of gyrA, a gene known to be involved in ciprofloxacin resistance, indicated that 42121A and 42121B both contained mutations that confer ciprofloxacin resistance, but this did not explain the differences in ciprofloxacin resistance that were observed. Cyclic di-GMP levels also varied between this pair of isolates and were shown to contribute to the observed colony morphology variation and ability to form a biofilm. Our results demonstrate the role of cyclic di-GMP in generating the observed morphological phenotypes that are known to contribute to biofilm-mediated antibiotic tolerance. The generation of phenotypic diversity may go unnoticed during standard diagnostic evaluation, which potentially impacts the therapeutic strategy chosen to treat the corresponding infection and may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance.
