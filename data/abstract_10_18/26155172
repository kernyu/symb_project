Effective defense response of the body requires the proper nutritional and metabolic preparation and adequate energy expenditure. Every pathological process with coexisting malnutrition is subject to an increased risk of failure and complications in medical treatment, which is a serious threat to human health and life. Malnutrition, particularly protein-calorie malnutrition, is characterized by a decrease in resistance, particularly involving cellular immune deficiency, which in turn causes a significant decrease in resistance to infections. Inflammation is the price that the organism has to pay for the effective antimicrobial defense. Therefore, uncontrolled changes may occur in the immune system in nutrition disorders, especially in a significant protein-calorie malnutrition, which in turn prevents the correct response to microbial infection, including bacterial infection, which occurs in the course of periodontitis or untreated caries disease. Research determining the relationship between the clinical state of oral health, selected immune parameters and indicators of nutritional status of the organism, is an alternative to other attempts undertaken to reduce these risks.
