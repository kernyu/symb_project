The development of new drugs from plants is an interesting alternative approach to overcoming microbial resistance. Passiflora cincinnata shows resistance to diseases and pests and a higher concentration of chemical components that may be useful in the pharmaceutical industry. We investigated the potential antimicrobial and antibiotic-modifying activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of leaves, stems, bark, pulp and seeds of P. cincinnata. The extracts were prepared by homogenization of material in 50% ethanol. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth dilution method, and the bacterial strains tested were Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Antibiotic-modifying activity was evaluated against the strains S. aureus 03 and E. coli 08, using a subinhibitory concentration of extract. The antibiotics tested were: amikacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, potassium benzylpenicillin and oxacillin. The extracts did not show antimicrobial activity of clinical relevance, where the MIC was equal to or greater than 1024 mug/mL. S. aureus showed 13 events, while E. coli showed only 4 events. Among these events, 14 involved synergistic activity, potentiating the effect of the antibiotics, and only 3 events demonstrated antagonistic activity toward ampicillin. Hydroalcoholic extracts are potential antimicrobial agents when combined with conventional drugs little utilized in in vivo treatment.
