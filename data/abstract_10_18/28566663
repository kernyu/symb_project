In recent years, the incidence of fungal infections has been increasing, particularly among patients with immune systems compromised by human immunodeficiency virus infection, organ transplantation, and/or chemotherapy for cancer. Current therapies for treating systemic fungal infection have limited effectiveness and have created problems of adverse reactions and drug resistance. These issues therefore motivate us to develop novel antifungals. Elucidation of stress response mechanisms and virulence factors in pathogenic fungi is required in developing an effective antifungal strategy. There are actually numerous studies concerning various stress responses in several important fungal pathogens. Among these responses, we focused on stress response for iron starvation to identify potential targets for novel antifungals because iron starvation occurs in blood, where pathogenic fungi often infect. Here we show recent progress of studies on iron homeostasis in Candida species, especially focusing on Candida glabrata, and propose novel antifungal targets.
