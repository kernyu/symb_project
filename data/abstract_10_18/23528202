Recent studies have indicated a role of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of Campylobacter jejuni in the severe neurological Guillain Barre syndrome, as well as in development of more severe symptoms of acute enteritis. We evaluated the role of the LOS locus class in C. jejuni infection among 163 enteritis patients. The prevalence of LOS locus classes differed according to the origin of the isolates. Furthermore, LOS locus classes A and B were significantly associated with susceptibility or resistance to ciprofloxacin and doxycycline. However, our results do not corroborate earlier findings that isolates with potential to sialylate LOS might be associated with more severe symptoms of enteritis. Instead, in an infection model, such isolates gave weaker epithelial IL-8 responses than nonsialylated isolates. Absence of the iron transport protein encoded by the gene ceuE as well as the putative fucose permease gene cj0486 was associated with increased in vitro IL-8 secretion.
