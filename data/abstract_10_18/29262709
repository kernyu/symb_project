In recent years rapidly growing antibiotic resistance has increased interest toward natural products, especially essential oils because of their various effects. The aim of this study was to identify the chemical composition of the commercial Origanum onites essential oil (EO) and to investigate the antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion and dilution methods, against ten different ATCC strains, including eight bacteria, two yeasts and seventy-nine clinical nosocomial Escherichia coli isolates that produce extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL). The chemical composition of EO was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The major compounds of the EO were determined as carvacrol (51.4%) followed by linalool (11.2%), p-cymene (8.9%) and gamma-terpinene (6.7%). O. onites EO had antimicrobial activity against all standard strains and inhibited microbial growth of ESBL positive E. coli isolates. According to our results, O. onites EO may be an alternative to synthetic drug, used in combination with other antibiotics for treatment of infection caused by multidrug resistant bacteria after testing toxic effects and irritation at preferred doses on human.
