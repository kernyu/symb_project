The prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae coproducing carbapenemase metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) and OXA-48 has been increasing globally since 2013. The complete genome of KP617 was sequenced and assembled into a circular chromosome and two plasmids. This sequence provides the genetic background for understanding the evolution of carbapenemase genes in K. pneumoniae KP617.
