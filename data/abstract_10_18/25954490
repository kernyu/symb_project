BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) can cause life-threatening disease in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to identify the VZV immune status in pregnant women and also determine the validity of self-reported history for chickenpox. METHODS: Serologic testing for VZV was performed for 400 pregnant women attending prenatal care at clinics located in two teaching and referral hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The Enzyme Immunoassay method was used to assess IgG antibodies against VZV. RESULTS: A total of 400 pregnant women, aged 16-43 years (median: 27 years, mean: 27.6 +/- 5.9 years), were examined in which 361 (90.3%) were found to be seropositive. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of patients' self reported history were 51.8%, 71.7%, 94.4% and 13.8% respectively. CONCLUSION: Serologic screening for VZV in pregnant women seems crucial. We suggest considering the pregnant women as the target group for future immunization programs in Iran.
