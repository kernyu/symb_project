Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged worldwide as a dominant pathogen in nosocomial infections. In this study, we report the draft genome sequence of a clinical multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii ST191 (CC92) strain. Whole-genome sequencing of the isolate was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system, and bioinformatics analysis was also performed. The draft genome length was 4,259,210bp, harbouring 14 gene sequences relevant to antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that the isolate was resistant to all of the tested antibiotics except for tigecycline and colistin. These data will facilitate further understanding of the genomic and resistance features of MDR A. baumannii.
