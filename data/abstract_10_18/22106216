MICs of eight antibiotics were detected with 40 Chinese Mycoplasma pneumoniae isolates. Thirty-eight isolates (95%) were macrolide resistant. Each macrolide-resistant isolate harbored an A2063G or A2064G point mutation in the 23S rRNA gene. All 40 isolates (100%) were type I strains, but they might have originated from different clones.
