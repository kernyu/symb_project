We describe here the whole-genome sequence and basic characteristics of Escherichia coli isolate 15-AB01393, recovered from German beef within a national monitoring program in 2015. This isolate was identified as an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing E. coli strain of multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST58 harboring the antimicrobial resistance genes blaCTX-M-1, mph(A), sul2, dfrA5, strA, and strB.
