OBJECTIVES: To characterise the beta-lactam, quinolone and macrolide resistance levels and mechanisms in 62 Escherichia coli isolates causing bacteraemia in Peruvian children. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid (NAL) and azithromycin were determined in the presence and absence of Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide. Susceptibility to other 14 antimicrobial agents was also established. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were identified, and mutations in gyrA and parC as well as the presence of transferable mechanisms of quinolone resistance (TMQR) and macrolide resistance (TMMR) were determined. RESULTS: Fifty isolates (80.6%) were multidrug-resistant. High proportions of resistance to ampicillin (93.5%), NAL (66.1%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66.1%) were observed. No isolate showed resistance to carbapenems and only two isolates were resistant to nitrofurantoin. Twenty-seven isolates carried ESBL-encoding genes: 2 blaSHV-12; 13 blaCTX-M-15; 4 blaCTX-M-2; 6 blaCTX-M-65; and 2 non-identified ESBLs. Additionally, 27 blaTEM-1 and 9 blaOXA-1-like genes were detected. All quinolone-resistant isolates showed target mutations, whilst TMQR were present in four isolates. Efflux pumps played a role in constitutive NAL resistance. The association between quinolone resistance and ESBL production was significant (P=0.0011). The mph(A) gene was the most frequent TMMR (16 isolates); msr(A) and erm(B) genes were also detected. Only one TMMR-carrying isolate [presenting mph(A) and erm(B) concomitantly] remained resistant to azithromycin when efflux pumps were inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of ESBL-encoding genes and widespread of blaCTX-M-15 in Lima has been shown. The role of efflux pumps in azithromycin resistance needs to be further evaluated, as well as effective control of the use of antimicrobial agents.
