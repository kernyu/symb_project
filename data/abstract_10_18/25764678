All-oral combinations of direct-acting antivirals improve efficacy and safety outcomes for patients with hepatitis C virus infection, particularly those who are poor candidates for current interferon/ribavirin-based regimens. The frequency of adverse events was also low, especially compared with historical data in patients receiving a triple regimen with NS3/4A protease inhibitor and peginterferon/ribavirin. However, there was apparent association between preexisting NS5A resistance-associated variants and virologic failure. Furthermore, both NS5A and NS3 resistance-associated variants were also detected in most patients with virologic failure. In conclusion, more effective therapeutic regimens should be selected, based on further understanding of efficacy and safety in each of drugs.
