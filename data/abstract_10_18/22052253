Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant neoplasm in children and adolescents. Epirubicin is one of the chemotherapeutic agents currently used for the treatment of OS; however, the efficacy of chemotherapy is hampered by the acquired drug resistance of OS. Cerulenin, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase, has been defined as a candidate tumor suppressor. In this study, we explored the combined effect of cerulenin plus the chemotherapy drug, epirubicin, on human OS U2-OS cells in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that cerulenin plus epirubicin induced synergistic growth inhibition and enhanced apoptosis in U2-OS cells. We also demonstrated that cerulenin plus epirubicin synergistically suppressed tumor growth in subcutaneously xenografted U2-OS cells in athymic nude mice. Our results indicate that cerulenin enhances the anti-OS effects of epirubicin in vivo and in vitro.
