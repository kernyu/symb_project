Previously we discovered a tricyclic indoline, N-[2-(6-bromo-4-methylidene-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-carbazol-4a-yl)ethyl]-4-ch lorobenzene-1-sulfonamide (1, Of1), from bioinspired synthesis of a highly diverse polycyclic indoline alkaloid library, that selectively resensitizes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains to beta-lactam antibiotics. Herein, we report a thorough structure-activity relationship investigation of 1, which identified regions of 1 that tolerate modifications without compromising activity and afforded the discovery of a more potent analogue with reduced mammalian toxicity.
