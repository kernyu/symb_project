To investigate the in vitro activities of cephamycins (cefmetazole and flomoxef) for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (pAmpC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, a total of 574 third-generation cephalosporin-resistant clinical isolates were collected at a Japanese multicenter study. PCR and sequencing identified 394 isolates with only ESBL genes, 63 isolates with only pAmpC genes, and 6 isolates with both ESBL and pAmpC genes. blaCTX-M types predominated 95.5% of the ESBL genes, and blaCMY-2 predominated 91.3% of the pAmpC genes. The MIC50/90 values of cefmetazole and flomoxef were </= 1/4 and </= 1/</= 1 mug/mL for isolates with only ESBL genes, respectively, and 16/>16 and 8/16 mug/mL for isolates with only pAmpC genes, respectively. Flomoxef >/= 4 mug/mL had the best screening performance for the detection of isolates with pAmpC genes. Flomoxef had better in vitro activities against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and provided a clearer distinction between ESBL and pAmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae compared to cefmetazole.
