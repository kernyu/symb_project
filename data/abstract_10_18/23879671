OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of azithromycin on mucocutaneous manifestations and ex vivo intracellular cytokine responses in patients with Behcet's disease (BD). METHODS: Ten BD patients with active manifestations and nine healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. Patients were treated with azithromycin (1500 mg/week) for four weeks. Clinical and immunological responses were evaluated in the pre- and post-azithromycin treatment periods. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients and controls were stimulated by Streptococcus sanguinis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and heat shock protein-60 (HSP-60) for three hours. Ex vivo intracellular interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured. RESULTS: Follicular lesions and genital ulcers completely healed, and the number of oral ulcers decreased after treatment (P = 0.000). The stimulated intracellular IFN-gamma response to S. sanguinis was higher in BD patients (5.75%) than in HCs (3.9%) before treatment (P = 0.05). Likewise, the pretreatment IFN-gamma response was significantly higher than the post-treatment response (1.95%). In BD patients, pretreatment stimulated intracellular IFN-gamma responses to LTA (5.8%) were also higher than post-treatment responses (3.15%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin treatment decreased the mucocutaneous manifestations in BD patients and suppressed the intracellular IFN-gamma responses of PBMCs to S. sanguinis ex vivo, which suggests this treatment has an immunomodulatory effect.
