UNLABELLED: The aim of our study was to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) among carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 84 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates collected between January 2007- February 2011 from four university hospitals in Iasi (North-East region of Romania) were randomly selected. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI 2010 (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines. The isolates were tested for MBLs using EPI (EDTA-phenanthroline-imipenem) phenotypic test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bla(VIM) and bla(IMP). RESULTS: Fifty-eight carbapenem resistant strains were identified, from which 24 (41,3%) were positive for VIM-type MBLs. No IMP - type MBL was detected. All MBL-producing isolates displayed a MDR (multidrug resistant) phenotype, two of them were XDR (extensively drug-resistant). Colistin remained the most effective antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of MBL producing P. aeruginosa clinical isolates urges the need for a better use of antibiotics and for efficient infection control measures to prevent dissemination of MBL producers. This is the first report of VIM-like enzymes in P. aeruginosa isolates from the Iasi area.
