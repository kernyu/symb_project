BACKGROUND: This study is aimed at investigating the frequency of different functional IL-22(+) CD4(+) T cells in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: The frequency of circulating IFN-gamma+IL-17-IL-22-CD4(+) (Th1), IFN-gamma-IL-17A+IL-22-CD4(+) (Th17), and IFN-gamma-IL-17A-IL-22(+) CD4(+) (Th22), and other subsets of IL-22(+) CD4(+) T cells in 31 patients with new onset T2DM and 16 healthy controls was characterized by flow cytometry. The levels of serum IL-22, IL-17, IFN-gamma, insulin C-peptide, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose, and insulin were examined. RESULTS: The frequency of Th1, Th17, Th22, IFN-gamma(+) IL-17(-) IL-22(+) , and IFN-gamma(-) IL-17(+) IL-22(+) CD4(+) T cells and the concentrations of IL-22, but not IL-17 and IFNgamma, in the patients were significantly higher than controls. The percentages of Th22 cells were correlated positively with the frequency of IFN-gamma(-) IL-17(+) IL-22(+) CD4(+) T cells, the values of body mass index (BMI) and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and the levels of serum IL-22 in those patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IL-22(+) CD4(+) T cells may contribute to the early process of T2DM.
