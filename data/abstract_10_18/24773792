A retrospective cohort study was performed on 175 adult patients treated for community-acquired pneumonia with moxifloxacin or ceftriaxone/azithromycin in a nonintensive care unit. Both cohorts were very similar with regard to a wide range of characteristics including age, severity of disease, comorbidities, length of stay, and mortality. Multidrug-resistant organisms were subsequently isolated from 6 (15%) moxifloxacin-treated patients and 5 (4%) ceftriaxone/azithromycin-treated patients within 90 days after beginning of therapy (P = .026 on logistic regression analysis).
