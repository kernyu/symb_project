BACKGROUND: Mathematical or statistical tools are capable to provide a valid help to improve surveillance systems for healthcare and non-healthcare-associated bacterial infections. The aim of this work is to evaluate the time-varying auto-adaptive (TVA) algorithm-based use of clinical microbiology laboratory database to forecast medically important drug-resistant bacterial infections. METHODS: Using TVA algorithm, six distinct time series were modelled, each one representing the number of episodes per single 'ESKAPE' (E nterococcus faecium, S taphylococcus aureus, K lebsiella pneumoniae, A cinetobacter baumannii, P seudomonas aeruginosa and E nterobacter species) infecting pathogen, that had occurred monthly between 2002 and 2011 calendar years at the Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore general hospital. RESULTS: Monthly moving averaged numbers of observed and forecasted ESKAPE infectious episodes were found to show a complete overlapping of their respective smoothed time series curves. Overall good forecast accuracy was observed, with percentages ranging from 82.14% for E. faecium infections to 90.36% for S. aureus infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach may regularly provide physicians with forecasted bacterial infection rates to alert them about the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial species, especially when clinical microbiological results of patients' specimens are delayed.
