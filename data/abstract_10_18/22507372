BACKGROUND: The optimal management strategy for patients with isoniazid (INH) monoresistant forms of tuberculosis (TB) has been widely debated. The current daily 9-month regimen of rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol was established based largely on trials in settings with low TB rates and low rates of drug resistance. OBJECTIVE: To explore the outcomes of patients with INH-monoresistant TB in the country of Georgia, a setting with both high TB rates and drug-resistant forms of the disease. METHODS: Retrospective record review of all patients diagnosed with smear-positive pulmonary TB resistant to either INH or INH+SM (streptomycin) in Georgia between 2007 and 2009. RESULTS: Of 8752 patients with pulmonary TB registered in Georgia, 909 were found to have INH or INH+SM resistance. Treatment outcomes were relatively poor in this group, with only 71% treatment success. Outcomes were significantly worse among patients with older age and a history of previous treatment. CONCLUSIONS: INH or INH+SM resistance in pulmonary TB patients in Georgia is common. The low rates of treatment success suggest the need for an improved treatment regimen for patients with resistance to these first-line drugs; this need is particularly pronounced among the subset of patients with a history of previous treatment.
