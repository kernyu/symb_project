Two series of ferrocenyl- and aryl-derived cyclopalladated organosilane thiosemicarbazone complexes were synthesised via C-H bond activation. Selected compounds were evaluated for in vitro antiplasmodial activity against the chloroquine-sensitive (NF54) and chloroquine-resistant (Dd2) strains of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Cyclopalladation of the thiosemicarbazones resulted in antiplasmodial activities in the low micromolar range.
