In vitro activity of the aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase type Ib [AAC(6')-Ib] was inhibited by ZnCl2 with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 15 muM. Growth of Acinetobacter baumannii or Escherichia coli harboring aac(6')-Ib in cultures containing 8 mug/ml amikacin was significantly inhibited by the addition of 2 muM Zn(2+) in complex with the ionophore pyrithione (ZnPT).
