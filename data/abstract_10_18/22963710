Ivermectin (IVM) resistance of Cooperia spp. in cattle has become an increasing and global problem. The early detection of anthelmintic resistance (AR) is important to propose strategies to slow down the development of resistance and requires sensitive, reliable, economic high-throughput and practical tests. The purpose of the present study was to apply a larval migration inhibition test (LMIT) for evaluating IVM and MOX efficacy against well-characterized field isolates of Cooperia spp. infecting cattle in Brazil. Eight isolates were used for IVM and seven for MOX. The following EC50 values of IVM were observed for the isolates: susceptible, 1.16 etamol; Nova Alvorada do Sul I, 4.09 etamol (RF=3.52); Campo Grande BNA, 3.57 etamol (RF=3.07); Campo Grande TBR, 4.09 etamol (RF=3,52); Nova Alvorada do Sul II, 2.50 etamol (RF=2.15); Bandeirantes, 11.35 etamol (RF=9.78); Campo Grande II, 6.03 etamol (RF=5.20); and Porto Mortinho, 8.63 etamol (RF=7.44). For MOX, the following EC50 values were observed: susceptible, 0.75 etamol; Campo Grande BNA, 0.93 etamol (RF=1.24); Campo Grande TBR, 0.36 etamol (RF=0.48); Nova Alvorada do Sul II, 2.57 etamol (RF=3.42); Bandeirantes, 1.43 etamol (RF=1.90); Campo Grande II, 1.08 etamol (RF=1.44); and Porto Mortinho, 0.49 etamol (RF=0.65). The LMIT used in the present study can be a useful tool for in vitro evaluation of IVM, but not of MOX. However, such methodology cannot be used in large-scale studies yet. The isolates of Cooperia spp. showed various degrees of resistance to IVM, though remaining susceptible to MOX.
