INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a growing threat to public health, with the potential to reverse many of the gains made in modern medicine. AMR is contributed to by both inappropriate choice of antibiotics and inappropriate antibiotic course durations. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this audit was to determine if the introduction of antimicrobial prescribing electronic prompts in an electronic patient record had a positive impact on antimicrobial stewardship. METHODS: The audit examined the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions within a critical care unit in which both a valid stop date and indication were recorded. The audit was repeated on two occasions: first, after an education programme, and second, after the introduction of an electronic prompt within the patients' electronic patient record. RESULTS: Chi-square analyses indicated that significant improvements in both the recording of indications (chi(2)(4) = 39.69, P <0.0001) and stop-dates (chi(2)(4) = 42.10, P <0.0001) occurred across the three audits. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the novel use of daily electronic prompts has a positive impact on antimicrobial stewardship.
