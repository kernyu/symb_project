Tamoxifen is widely used as the first line drug for estrogen receptor-positive subtype which is expressed in 70% of overall breast cancer patients. However, approximately 50% of these patients develop acquired resistance after 5 years of treatment, which is characterized by tumor recurrence and metastasis. The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process in breast cancer invasion. Fundamentally, targeting the EMT represents a crucial therapeutic strategy for preventing or treating breast cancer metastasis. Plumbagin (PLB) is a natural naphthoquinone with significant anticancer effects against several types of tumor cells including breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the effect of PLB on human endocrine-resistant breast cancer cell growth, invasion and the possible mechanisms underlying such actions. PLB exhibited potent cytotoxic activity at a micromolar concentration against endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells. Interestingly, a fixed low concentration of PLB and tamoxifen combination resulted in an increase in growth inhibition in endocrine-resistant cells. In addition, PLB also significantly suppressed mesenchymal biomarker expressions that govern the EMT process, resulting in attenuated metastatic capabilities. In conclusion, PLB should be developed as a pharmacological agent for the use as a single treatment or in combination for endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
