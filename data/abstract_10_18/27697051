Antimicrobial resistance to drugs is a serious threat to public health. Different strategies have been adopted to deal with antimicrobial resistance to known drugs, one such strategy is the use of drug hybrids; this is a promising strategy to address the growing problem of drug resistance. The present review covers the very recent examples of combining (hybrid) two standard drugs in a single molecule for combating antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, and to present evidence supporting that drug hybrids are the urgent and practical solution to stop or slow down the spread of drug resistance. In addition, this review provides a literature overview of antimicrobial hybrids of standard drugs and their impact on antimicrobial resistance, covering publications between 2015 and 2016.
