Diets containing 8% salt or 4% fructose (FR) cause insulin resistance and increase tissue methylglyoxal and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), platelet cytosolic-free calcium, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in rats. In WKY rats, we have shown that moderately high salt, 4% NaCl (MHS) alone in diet does not cause hypertension, and when given along with 4% FR it does not have an additive effect. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or L-arginine (ARG), treatment alone does not prevent hypertension in this model. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of NAC plus ARG in diet on SBP, platelet cytosolic-free calcium in a MHS + FR model, and to measure the plasma levels of methylglyoxal and the AGE, methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone (MGH). At 7 weeks of age, WKY rats were divided into three groups: control group was given regular rat chow (0.7% NaCl) and water; MHS + FR group, diet containing 4% NaCl and 4% FR in drinking water; and MHS + FR + NAC + ARG group, MHS diet supplemented with 1.5% N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and 1.5% L-arginine (ARG), and 4% FR in drinking water, and followed for 6 weeks. NAC + ARG prevented the increase in platelet cytosolic-free calcium and SBP in MHS + FR treated rats. There was no difference in mean values of plasma methylglyoxal and MGH among the groups. In conclusion, NAC + ARG treatment is effective in preventing hypertension in a moderately high salt + FR-induced animal model. Plasma methylglyoxal and MGH may not represent tissue modification or, alternatively, other tissue AGEs, derived from methylglyoxal or other aldehydes, may be involved in hypertension in this model.
