OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of ertapenem use in Pseudomonas aeruginosa carbapenem resistance, taking into account the volume of antimicrobial consumption, the consumption by the entire hospital of alcohol-based antiseptic hand rub, and the density rate of invasive practices. DESIGN: Before-and-after trial. SETTING: A tertiary care university hospital in southern Brazil. METHODS: Ertapenem was first added to the hospital formulary in June 2006, and it was excluded in February 2009. We evaluated Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance rates through 3 study periods: period 1, before ertapenem use (17 months); period 2, during ertapenem use (33 months); and period 3, after exclusion of ertapenem (15 months). RESULTS: After introduction of ertapenem, there was a significant decrease in median consumption of imipenem or meropenem, from 2.6 to 2.2 defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 patient-days (level change from 0.04 to -1.08; P < .01), and an increase in the use of these medications after ertapenem exclusion, from 2.2 to 3.3 DDDs per 100 patient-days (level change from -0.14 to 0.91; P < .01), by segmented regression analysis. There was no difference in the incidence density of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa infection related to ertapenem use throughout the study periods. However, by multiple regression analysis, the reduction in the rate of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa infection correlated significantly with the increase in the volume of alcohol used as hand sanitizer, which was from 660.7 mL per 100 patient-days in period 1 to 2,955.1 mL per 100 patient-days in period 3 (P = .04). Ertapenem use did not impact the rate of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa infection. CONCLUSIONS: Use of alcohol-based hand gel, rather than ertapenem, was associated with a reduction in the rates of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa infection. Measures to reduce resistance must include factors other than just antimicrobial stewardship programs alone.
