We estimated the proportion of household contacts whose drug-susceptibility test results matched those of the purported source patient with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Ninety-nine (88.4%) contacts had isolates resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, and 41 (36.6%) contacts had isolates with results that also matched the purported source for ethambutol, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide.
