Linezolid is one of few treatment options available for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The present study investigated risk factors for linezolid-nonsusceptible enterococci using a case-control study of 15 cases and 60 control patients. Previous hospitalization, admission to a medical service, comorbidity, and linezolid and sulfonamide therapy were identified as risk factors.
