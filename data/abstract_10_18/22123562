Antibiotic revolution changed the course of modern medicine, by decreasing mortality due to bacterial infections. However, bacteria have developed several ways of resistance against all antibiotics used. In view of the rise of resistance and of its dissemination to different bacterial families, new effective antibiotics are scare and the return in the pre-antibiotic era seems to be a reality for some parts of the world. This review revises the worrying phenomenon of antibiotic resistance focusing on some examples of "superbugs", which represent a daily challenge for the medical profession, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, extended spectrum ss-lactamae-producing Enterobacteriaceae as well as carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Facing the emergence of the multiresistant strains, the priority is obviously to control the spread of these microorganisms. It is only through the prudent use of antimicrobial drugs and the introduction of new and effective antibiotics that the antibiotic resistance will be slowed down and that we continue to treat bacterial infections.
