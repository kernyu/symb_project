This study was done to investigate the rate of Streptococcus pyogenes or Group A streptococcus (GAS) and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolates in asymptomatic school children in Kathmandu and Sindhuli districts. Pharyngeal swabs were collected and subjected to crystal violet blood agar (CVBA). A total of 468 asymptomatic school aged children were included and 51 (10.8%) were found to be GAS carrier. Among the isolates 23 (12.0%) were from boys where 28 (10.1%) were from girls. The GAS colonization rate was statistically insignificant (P > 0.05) with sex and age sub-group, although the rate was slightly higher among the boys and age sub group 10-12 years. GAS was significantly higher in large family size (p < 0.05). Out of 51 isolates, 100.0% isolates were sensitive to antibiotic penicillin where as 7.8% and 5.8% isolates were resistant to antibiotic ampicillin and erythromycin respectively.
