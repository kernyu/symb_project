This study aims to determine drug sensitivity, metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production and elaboration of bla(OXA)-type carbapenemases in Acinetobacter spp. in a temperate climate area in north India with a heavy influx of tourists. Antimicrobial sensitivity of 165 isolates was performed. Imipenem-resistant isolates were subjected to combined disk (CDT) and double-disk diffusion tests (DDT) for MBL detection. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MBL production were tested by Etest. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for the detection of genes encoding bla(OXA)-23 like, bla(OXA-24) like, bla(OXA-51) like and bla(OXA-58) like genes. Ninety-nine (60%) isolates were imipenem-resistant (MICs 2-96 microg/mL). Fifty (50.5%) of the 99 carbapenem-resistant isolates were MBL producers by CDT and 26 (26.3%) by DDT. The majority (77%) of the isolates elaborated bla(OXA-23) and bla(OXA-51) like genes. Forty seven of the 50 MBL-positive isolates harboured bla(OXA-23) like and bla(OXA-51) like genes. MBL-producing Acinetobacter has emerged as a major pathogen in Kashmir with elaboration of bla(OXA-23) and bla(OXA-51) related carbapenemases. This poses a significant challenge for healthcare professionals and policy planners, and needs to be addressed immediately. Primary care physicians treating visitors to Kashmir need to be aware of the situation.
