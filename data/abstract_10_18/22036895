Elevated high mobility group A (HMGA) protein expression in pancreatic cancer cells is correlated with resistance to the chemotherapy agent gemcitabine. Here, we demonstrate use of HMGA-targeted AT-rich phosphorothioate DNA (AT-sDNA) aptamers to suppress HMGA carcinogenic activity. Cell growth of human pancreatic cancer cells (AsPC-1 and Miapaca-2) transfected with AT-sDNA were monitored after treatment with gemcitabine. Significant increases in cell death in AT-sDNA transfected cells compared to non-AT-rich sDNA treated cells were observed in both cell lines. The data indicate the potential use of HMGA targeted DNA aptamers to enhance chemotherapy efficacy in pancreatic cancer treatment.
