Ocular infection and inflammation are common and are associated with myriad ocular conditions ranging from mild disease to blinding conditions. There are numerous anti-invectives with spectra against inciting pathogens. Given the potential for ocular infections to rapidly progress initial broad spectrum therapy is usually required, with therapy tailored as microbiological identification and sensitivities become available. The emergence of antibiotic resistance has become a major health problem. Anti-inflammatory therapy can be institutes to prevent ocular symptoms and end-organ damage. A therapy should be selected which is potent enough to interrupt the inflammatory cascades in play, but which avoids potential side effects. Glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, and biological agents may be used singularly or in combination. New drug delivery devices may allow for better local treatment of chronic ocular inflammation.
