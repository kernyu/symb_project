AIM: Resistance to conventional antibiotics has spurred interest in exploring new antimicrobial strategies. Suppressing quorum sensing within biofilm is a promising antimicrobial strategy. LasR in quorum sensing system of the Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, directly enhances virulence and antibiotic resistance, with QscR as its indirect suppressor, so targeting both of them can synergistically take the effect. METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: An in silico protocol combining pharmacophores with molecular docking was applied. Pharmacophores of QscR agonists and LasR antagonists were prepared for preliminary screening, followed by counter-screen using a pharmacophore model of LasR agonists and molecular docking of LasR. Four compounds with novel scaffolds were confirmed as potential biofilm inhibitors with preliminary experimental data. CONCLUSION: Novel biofilm inhibitors can be found with the method.
