BACKGROUND: Beijing genotype strains are the most predominant strains in China. The aim of this study was to explore risk factors and clinical phenotypes associated with infection with Beijing genotype strains among tuberculosis patients in China. METHODS: Using data and strains derived from the first Chinese national drug resistance base-line survey, we performed a statistical analysis of the relationship between different genotypes, demographic characteristics and clinical phenotypes. RESULT: Of patients infected with the 3634 strains for which detailed information was available, we found that people in young age groups [aged under 25 years, OR (95% CI): 1.30(1.03-1.62)], urban people [OR (95% CI): 1.18 (0.47-0.94)], or of Hui ethnicity [OR (95% CI): 1.96 (1.10-3.50)] or those needing retreatment [OR (95% CI): 1.22 (1.03-1.43)] were more likely to be infected with Beijing genotype strains compared with patients who were rural, or of Han ethnicity or those with new TB cases. In contrast, Uyghur [OR (95% CI): 0.45 (0.30-0.67)], or Zhuang ethnicities [OR (95% CI): 0.30 (0.19-0.48)], presented lower than average risk in infections with the Beijing genotype strain. In addition, a higher proportion of patients with hemoptysis [OR (95% CI): 0.81 (0.69-0.94)] and chest pain [OR (95% CI): 0.79 (0.69-0.91)] were infected with non-Beijing genotype strains than with Beijing genotype strains. CONCLUSIONS: In China, young age group, urban people, Hui ethnicity and the earlier treated patients are all high risk factors for infection with Beijing genotype strains, while Uyghur and Zhuang ethnicity are lower than average risk factors for infection. The high rate of chest symptoms occurring in non-Beijing genotype infected patients indicates that more attention should be paid to basic research on non-Beijing genotype strains.
