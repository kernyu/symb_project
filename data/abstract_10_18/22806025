The aim of this study was to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility profiles and the presence of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Pseudomonas fluorescens isolates from coastal waters of the Kastela Bay, Croatia. Twenty-two water samples were collected during 2009. Isolates were tested for susceptibilities to 13 antibiotics by Etest. ESBL production was confirmed by double-disk synergy test carried out on Mueller-Hinton agar plates containing efflux pump inhibitor Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide dihydrochloride. PCR and DNA sequencing analysis were used to identify ESBL-encoding genes. The transferability of cephalosporin resistance was tested by conjugation experiments. Genetic relatedness of ESBL-producing isolates was determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Out of 185 P. fluorescens isolates recovered, 70 (37.8%) demonstrated multiresistance phenotype with highest rates of resistance to tetracycline (61.6%), aztreonam (31.9%), meropenem (17.3%), ceftazidime (15.1%) and cefotaxime (12.4%). Ten (5.4%) isolates were identified as ESBL producers. All isolates carried chromosomally located bla (TEM-116) gene. RAPD analysis identified four different genotypes. Here, we demonstrated a baseline profiles of antimicrobial resistance of P. fluorescens from coastal waters of the Kastela Bay, Croatia. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of TEM-type ESBL in P. fluorescens, indicating this bacterium as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes with clinical relevance.
