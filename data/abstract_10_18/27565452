BACKGROUND: The increase in blaNDM-1 in Enterobacteriaceae has become a major concern worldwide. In previous study, we investigated clonal dissemination and mechanisms of resistance to carbapenem in China. METHODS: We carried out retrospective surveillance for blaNDM-1 among carbapenem-resistant enterobacter strains, which were isolated from patients at our hospital by bacterial strains selection, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, species identification, and molecular detection of resistance gene. RESULTS: We found three blaNDM-1 -positive isolates which were identified as Enterobacter aerogenes in clinical patients in China. The blaNDM-1 -positive Enterobacter aerogenes isolates were first found. CONCLUSION: It is important to mandate prudent usage of antibiotics and implement infection control measures to control the spread of these resistant blaNDM-1 -positive strains.
