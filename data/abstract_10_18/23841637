AIM: The aim of this work was to analyze the eight resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) families (a group of proteins mainly involved in multidrug resistance of Gram-negative bacteria) in 26 Burkholderia genomes in order to gain knowledge regarding their presence and distribution, to obtain a platform for future experimental tests aimed to identify new molecular targets to be used in antimicrobial therapy against Burkholderia species and to refine the annotation of RND-like sequences in these genomes. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 417 coding sequences were retrieved and analyzed using different bioinformatics tools. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: A complex pattern of RND presence and distribution in the different Burkholderia species was disclosed and a core of proteins represented in all 26 genomes was identified. These 'core' proteins might represent useful targets of new synthetic antimicrobial compounds. Furthermore, the annotation of RND-like sequences in Burkholderia was refined.
