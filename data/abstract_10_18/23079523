Antiproliferative activity of seven amides and one benzotriazole ester derivative of salinomycin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic, with recently reported antibacterial activity, are herein described. Salinomycin and the majority of derivatives exhibit potent antiproliferative activity against the drug-resistant cancer cell lines. Moreover almost all derivatives show stronger activity against LoVo/DX cell line than that of unmodified salinomycin.
