Antibiotic stewardship (ABS) comprises a bundle of different interventions to improve anti-infective treatment in a hospital setting. An important component of ABS interventions is the interdisciplinary approach to infection management. Besides improving infrastructural aspects on a hospital level, including surveillance of the use of anti-infective agents and nosocomial infections, collation and interpretation of statistics on resistance and formulation of local treatment guidelines, ABS teams go to the wards and advise treating physicians on antibiotic therapy. Frequent approaches for optimization are selection of substances, administration route, dosing of medication and duration of treatment. An important overall objective of ABS is the reduction of resistance induction in order to preserve the therapeutic efficiency of antibiotics. A number of studies have shown that this goal can be achieved in different clinical settings without negatively affecting patient outcome. The strategies of ABS can also be applied with no problems to critically ill patients on the intensive care unit.
