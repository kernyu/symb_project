We characterized 182 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates and analyzed the epidemiological data on the corresponding infections. stG6, stG485, and stG6792 were the 3 most prevalent invasive emm types among the 27 different emm types recovered. High rates of antimicrobial resistance were observed for macrolides (26.4%) and tetracycline (34.6%).
