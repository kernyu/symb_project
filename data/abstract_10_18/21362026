There is no existing data on UL97 mutation in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) isolates obtained from individuals who have never been exposed to ganciclovir (GCV). UL97 codons 439 to 645 from 61 CMV isolates from 61 immunocompetent Japanese infants and children were sequenced directly. No known GCV resistance mutations were found, meaning that the UL97 mutation had resulted from the use of GCV. On the other hand, a mutation at codon 605 (D to E) was frequently identified (56/61: 91.8%). This could be a genetic marker for HCMV in East Asian counties, because of its low prevalence in the strains of HCMV circulating in Western countries.
