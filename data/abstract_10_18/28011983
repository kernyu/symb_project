Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare distinct subtype of aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and a notoriously hard to treat entity with a dismal prognosis in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients. Clinicians often face the question of second or third line treatment. As the treatment options with novel agents in lymphomas are rapidly evolving, more and more options beyond standard chemotherapy are available. In connection with a review of treatment options with novel lymphoma agents, we present a case report of a patient with a complete remission after the administration of brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide.
