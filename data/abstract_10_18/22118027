OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) by testing a cohort of clinical ESBL-producing bacterial isolates that were isolated in the Kingdom of Bahrain. METHODS: ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates (based on phenotypic tests) were collected from Microbiology Laboratory of the Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain between January-June 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility to a panel of antibiotics was performed and bla(CTX-M) genes were detected by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: A total of 230 isolates (Escherichia coli, n=180; Klebsiella pneumoniae, n=50) were studied, 98% were CTX-M type. For Escherichia coli isolates, 65 (36.1%) harbored CTXM+TEM combination and 68 (37.8%) had CTX-M alone. In contrast, for Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates only 5 (10.0%) harbored the CTX-M combination, and none had CTX-M only. The bla(CTX-M) gene was found predominantly in urine isolates (n=145/230; 63.0%). Sensitivity to imipenem and nitrofurantoin was 100% and 60%, respectively. CTX-M carriage was associated with the resistance to fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and aminoglycosides. CONCLUSIONS: Our study documentes high prevalence of CTX-M ESBL type among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella from the Kingdom of Bahrain. The apparent dissemination of CTX-M producers could represent a substantial barrier in the treatment of community-acquired infections. The use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, quinolones, and aminoglycosides is compromised, leaving carbapenems as the therapeutic option for severe infections caused by ESBL producers.
