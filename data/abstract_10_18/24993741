BACKGROUND AND AIM: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is reported to be associated with various extragastrointestinal conditions such as insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are attributed to systemic inflammation, leptin or ghrelin changes due to H. pylori infection. Therefore, increasing trends in the management of H. pylori infection are ordered to maintain glycemic control. In this study, we evaluated the effect of H. pylori eradication on insulin resistance in patients with normal blood glucose concentrations. METHOD: A total of 370 patients with successful eradication were included in the study. Patients with H. pylori were given triple eradication treatment. All patients with H. pylori infection were tested for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, glicated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and 6 months after eradication treatment. Also, insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Body mass index was also determined as a metabolic syndrome criteria effecting insulin resistance. RESULTS: There were significant differences in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR values between before treatment and after treatment(P <0.04, <0.01, <0.01, <0.01). The favorable effect of eradication was more significant in patients with BMI>/=25 mg/m(2)(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Eradication treatment has beneficial effects on insulin resistance in patients with normal glucose concentrations.
