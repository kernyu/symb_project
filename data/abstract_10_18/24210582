OBJECTIVE: Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is rapidly evolving, with emerging new drugs. Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody recognizing CD52 antigen approved in the treatment of relapsing-refractory CLL. A frequent side effect is the immunosuppression and patients treated with alemtuzumab risk to develop fungal infections such as aspergillosis. PATIENT AND METHODS: This case report is about a patient who developed an uncommon localization of aspergillosis: prostatic and renal, after a treatment by alemtuzumab monotherapy. During the week 8 of alemtuzumab, the patient presented fever, urinary frequency and urologic symptoms. Persistance of fever with common antibiotherapy led to realize a tomography that showed prostatic and renal abscess (70mm and 29mm). It was decided to realize a prostatic biopsy. RESULTS: Histological findings showed suppurative abscess with ischemic necrosis and fungal proliferation, with branched fungal hyphae. Direct examination was negative. Culture on Sabouraud's agar revealed a mould identified as Aspergillus fumigatus. The organism was susceptible to voriconazole (MIC: voriconazole 0,25ug/mL). CONCLUSION: Because of the main side effect of alemtuzumab is immunosuppression, we have to research fungal infections such as Aspergillosis, particularly in patients with fever resistant to common antibiotherapy.
