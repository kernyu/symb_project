We examined the in vitro activity of minocycline against 103 Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates and found approximately half had susceptible (26%) or intermediate (26%) MICs. For a subset of 35 isolates, susceptibility was highest to tigecycline (71% FDA vs. 20% EUCAST) followed by minocycline (14%) and then doxycycline (6%).
