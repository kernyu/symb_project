The ever-increasing bacterial resistance to clinical antibiotics is making many drugs ineffective and creating significant treatment gaps. This can be only circumvented by the discovery of antibiotics with new mechanisms of action. We report here the identification of a new tetramic acid, ascosetin, from an Ascomycete using the Staphylococcus aureus fitness test screening method. The structure was elucidated by spectroscopic methods including 2D NMR and HRMS. Relative stereochemistry was determined by ROESY and absolute configuration was deduced by comparative CD spectroscopy. Ascosetin inhibited bacterial growth with 2-16 mug ml(-1) MIC values against Gram-positive strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus. It also inhibited the growth of Haemophilus influenzae with a MIC value of 8 mug ml(-1). It inhibited DNA, RNA, protein and lipid synthesis with similar IC50 values, suggesting a lack of specificity; however, it produced neither bacterial membrane nor red blood cell lysis. It showed selectivity for bacterial growth inhibition compared with fungal but not mammalian cells. The isolation, structure and biological activity of ascosetin have been detailed here.
