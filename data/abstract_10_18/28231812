BACKGROUND: In West Africa, penicillin, macrolide and lincosamide resistance among beta-haemolytic streptococci (BHS) isolates has rarely been described. However, such data are critical to detect and track the emergence of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Beta-haemolytic streptococci were cultured from clinical specimens from patients attending the clinic at the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia (n = 217) and kept at -70 degrees C. Of these, 186 were revived and tested for penicillin susceptibility by disc diffusion and E-test methods, and the D-test for determination of constitutive and inducible macrolide-lincosamide (MLSB) resistance phenotypes. RESULTS: The majority of BHS isolates from infections were group A streptococci (GAS) (126/186, 67.7%). Of these, 16% were from invasive disease (30/186). Other BHS isolated included lancefield groups B (19, 10.2%); C (9/186, 4.8%), D (3/186, 1.6%), F (5/186, 2.7%), G (16/186, 8.6%) and non-typeable (8/186, 4.3%). Prevalence of BHS isolated from blood cultures ranges from 0% (2005) to 0.5% (2010). Most (85, 45.7%) of the isolates were from wound infections. Of the 186 BHS isolates, none was resistant to penicillin and 14 (6.1%) were resistant to erythromycin. Of these, 8 (4.3%) demonstrated constitutive MLSB resistance, and 5 (2.7%) were inducible MLSB resistant. All the inducible MLSB isolates were GAS, and majority of the constitutive MLSB isolates (6/8, 75.0%) were non-GAS. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-haemolytic streptococci, predominantly GAS are associated with a wide range of infections in The Gambia. It is reassuring that macrolide and lincosamide resistance is relatively low. However, monitoring of MLSB resistance is necessary with the global spread of resistant BHS strains.
