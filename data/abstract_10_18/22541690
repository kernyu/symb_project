BACKGROUND: Antiviral prophylaxis has been shown to prevent hepatic dysfunction in Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive kidney transplantation recipients (KTRs). However the long-term effects of antiviral prophylaxis on the patient death, graft loss, or hepatic decompensation have not been determined. METHOD: We therefore retrospectively analyzed outcomes in 94 HBV-positive patients, who underwent KT between February 1997 and November 2009 and were followed-up for a mean 75.7 months. Of the 94 KTRs, 56 received antiviral prophylaxis (Group 1), 51 with lamivudine and 5 with entecavir, and 38 did not (Group 2). RESULT: Of the latter group, 20 experienced HBV reactivation and 18 did not (mean 85 months); of those with reactivation, 16 received lamivudine, 2 received entecavir and 2 received no antiviral treatment. Cox-regression analysis showed that antiviral prophylaxis had no benefit on patient death (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.37 - 4.49, p = 0.693), graft failure (OR 1.25, 0.45 - 3.46, p = 0.666) or hepatic decompensation (OR 2.01, 0.35 - 11.57, p = 0.434). Lamivudine resistance occurred in 21 lamivudine-treated Group 1 and 4 lamivudine-treated Group 2 patients (p = 0.243), with mean times of resistance after KT of 82 and 132 months, respectively (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that lamivudine-based antiviral prophylaxis for HBV-positive renal recipients has no long-term clinical benefits.
