Since November 2009 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates have been detected in increasing numbers at the Clinical Centre University of Pecs. Molecular typing was performed for 102 clinical isolates originating from different time periods and various departments of the Clinical Centre. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the predominance of a single clone (101/102), identified as sequence type ST15. PCR and sequencing showed the presence of blaCTX-M-15 and blaVIM-4 genes. The blaVIM-4 was located on a class 1 integron designated In238b. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a blaVIM-4 gene in the predominant CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Hungarian Epidemic Clone/ST15.
