The efficiency of peptides against many species of bacteria, fungi and parasites has been widely described. Recent studies on peptides have also demonstrated their antiviral activity. Some peptides exhibit direct virucidal activity, others disturb attachment of virus particles to the cell membrane surface or interfere with intracellular replication of virus. Due to limited effectiveness of commonly used drugs and emerging resistance of viruses, antiviral peptides may have the potential to be developed as putative therapeutic agents.
