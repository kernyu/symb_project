Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major catechin contained in tea leaves, is known to possess the synergistic anti-staphylococcal activity in combination with various beta-lactam antibiotics and tetracycline. In the present study, we explored the in vitro combinatory effect of EGCG in combination with oxytetracycline against eight standard strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, including erythromycin, methicillin and tetracycline resistant strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution assay and the data were evaluated according to the sum of fractional inhibitory concentrations ( summation operatorFIC). Our results showed synergistic and additive interactions against all S. aureus strains tested ( summation operatorFIC 0.288-0.631), two of which were multidrug resistant. According to our best knowledge, it is the first report on the EGCG synergy with oxytetracycline. Considering its significant synergistic antimicrobial effect and low toxicity, we suggest EGCG as a promising compound for the development of new anti-staphylococcal formulations.
