In 2011, a novel mecA gene homologue, mecC, was reported in isolates from both humans and dairy cattle. The epidemiology of mecC methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in humans is not yet well known. In this retrospective study, we present the epidemiology of human clinical cases with mecC MRSA detected in the southern part of Sweden during the period 2005-2014. A total of 45 patients with an isolate positive for mecC MRSA were included in the study. Twenty-six isolates were found before 2012 and were retrospectively tested for mecC. Nineteen isolates were detected in 2012-2014 through routine testing. Culture results, resistance patterns, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, and spa types were collected from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. Epidemiological data were received from the database at the Regional Centre for Communicable Disease Control and the patient's medical files. The majority of the patients with mecC MRSA were of Swedish origin, had underlying diseases, and lived in rural areas. The median age was 60 years. Of the mecC MRSA, 76 % belonged to spa types t373 and t843. The median minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for oxacillin was 16 mg/L (1-64 mg/L) and only one isolate was resistant to other classes of antibiotics. The most common type of infection was skin and soft tissue infections, most often in an existing skin lesion. The patients with mecC MRSA were colonized for a short time and gave rise to few secondary cases. mecC MRSA in our region appears to have a domestic origin and mainly affects patients with underlying diseases or patients with an existing skin lesion. Our data indicate that it could be a poor colonizer.
