INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance is a serious health threat worldwide. Better understanding of exposure targets that could suppress resistance amplification is necessary to guide the dosing of currently available agents as well as new therapies in the drug development process. Areas covered: This review will discuss studies that focused on predicting development of resistance using the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic approach and how to design dosing regimens that can successfully suppress resistance emergence in Gram-negative bacteria. Expert opinion: Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic targets could provide useful insights to guide antimicrobial dosing to prevent resistance emergence. Exposure targets required for resistance suppression are higher than those for efficacy and might not be clinically feasible. Combination therapy is a possible approach to improve the efficacy and minimize the resistance emergence for difficult-to-treat infections.
