Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis worldwide. Prevalence of levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Germany and associated mutations in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs), as well as serotype distribution and multi locus sequence types (MLST) are shown. 21,764 invasive S. pneumoniae isolates from Germany, isolated in the epidemiological seasons from 2004/05 to 2014/15 were analyzed at the German National Reference Centre for Streptococci (GNRCS) for their levofloxacin resistance by micro broth dilution method. All resistant (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) >/=8mug/ml) and intermediate (MIC >2mug/ml and <8mug/ml) isolates were selected for the present study. Additionally, 29 susceptible isolates were randomly selected. A total of ninety isolates were tested for their levofloxacin-MIC by Etest, their serotype and sequence type, as well as for point-mutations at the QRDRs in the genes parC, parE, gyrA and gyrB. Twenty-five isolates exhibited levofloxacin MICs <2mug/ml (Etest) and no mutations in the QRDRs. Four isolates with MICs=2mug/ml had one mutation in parC; isolates with MICs >2mug/ml all had one or more mutations in the QRDRs. Four of nine intermediate isolates had a mutation in either parC or gyrA, and four isolates had mutations in both parC and gyrB. One isolate had mutations in both parC and gyrA. All isolates with MICs >/=8mug/ml (52) had mutations in both topoisomerase IV and gyrase. Serotypes associated with levofloxacin resistance shifted from a majority of PCV13 serotypes before the introduction of the PCV13 vaccine towards non-PCV serotypes. Resistant isolates were almost exclusively found among adults (98.1%).
