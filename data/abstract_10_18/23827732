SETTING: Although a preventable and treatable disease, tuberculosis (TB) is among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. A consequence of inadequately treated drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) is multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVES: To improve our understanding of the primary drivers of incidence and prevalence of DS- and MDR-TB in China. METHODS: The Tuberculosis Disease Transmission Model (TBDTM) uses historical and current disease epidemiology and transmission trends and treatment effectiveness, and accounts for annual changes to these to estimate future DS-TB and MDR-TB burden. RESULTS: The model shows that in China, by 2050, incidence, prevalence and mortality of DS-TB will decrease by 32%, 50% and 41%, respectively, whereas MDR-TB will increase by respectively 60%, 48% and 35%. Reduction in DS-TB is a result of high treatment and cure rates leading to a decrease in the prevalence of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI), while the increase in MDR-TB is attributed to inappropriate treatment, leading to high transmission of infection and increased LTBI prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a reduction in DS-TB in China over the next 40 years, while MDR-TB will increase. Improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB are needed to counter this threat. The TBDTM tool has potential value in public health practice by demonstrating the impact of interventions and estimating their cost-effectiveness.
