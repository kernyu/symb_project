Staphylococcus aureus VraR, a vancomycin-resistance-associated response regulator, activates a cell-wall-stress stimulon in response to antibiotics that inhibit cell wall formation. X-ray crystal structures of VraR in both unphosphorylated and beryllofluoride-activated states have been determined, revealing a mechanism of phosphorylation-induced dimerization that features a deep hydrophobic pocket at the center of the receiver domain interface. Unphosphorylated VraR exists in a closed conformation that inhibits dimer formation. Phosphorylation at the active site promotes conformational changes that are propagated throughout the receiver domain, promoting the opening of a hydrophobic pocket that is essential for homodimer formation and enhanced DNA-binding activity. This prominent feature in the VraR dimer can potentially be exploited for the development of novel therapeutics to counteract antibiotic resistance in this important pathogen.
