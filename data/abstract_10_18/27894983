Typhoid fever remains a serious problem in many developing countries. Due to resistance to multiple first line drugs, azithromycin has evolved as an important drug in the treatment of typhoid.

We describe an Indian adult with clinical and microbiological failure to azithromycin despite low azithromycin MIC.
