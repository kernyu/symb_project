Antimicrobial susceptibility data for all microorganisms isolated from blood culture were collected from 13 institutions in Korea from June to September 2011. Data were compared with our previous studies performed during 2006-2007 and 2008. The prevalence of MRSA in 2011 has rebounded to 63.7% after a slight decrease in 2008. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium declined to 24.1%. The resistance rates of Acinetobacter baumannii to imipenem and meropenem increased from 25.4% and 28.8% to 55.4% and 37.5%, respectively. Ciprofloxacin resistance of Escherichia coli has increased from 23.9% to 30.8%. The resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ciprofloxacin has increased from 17.7% to 26.5%. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae have also seen increased levels of resistance, from 8.6% to 18.4% and 13.6% to 28.5%, respectively. An overall increase in antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative pathogens has been observed. Continued surveillance and intervention to slow the propagation of resistance are necessary.
