Lysozymes play an important role in host defense by degrading peptidoglycan in the cell envelopes of pathogenic bacteria. Several Gram-negative bacteria can evade this mechanism by producing periplasmic proteins that inhibit the enzymatic activity of lysozyme. The Escherichia coli inhibitor of vertebrate lysozyme, Ivyc and its Pseudomonas aeruginosa homolog, Ivyp1 have been shown to be potent inhibitors of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). Since human lysozyme (HL) plays an important role in the innate immune response, we have examined the binding of HL to Ivyc and Ivyp1. Our results show that Ivyp1 is a weaker inhibitor of HL than Ivyc even though they inhibit HEWL with similar potency. Calorimetry experiments confirm that Ivyp1 interacts more weakly with HL than HEWL. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies revealed that Ivyp1 in solution is a monomer and forms a 30kDa heterodimer with both HL and HEWL, while Ivyc is a homodimer that forms a tetramer with both enzymes. The interaction of Ivyp1 with HL was further characterized by NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments. In addition to the characteristic His-containing Ivy inhibitory loop that binds into the active site of lysozyme, an extended loop (P2) between the final two beta-strands also participates in forming protein-protein interactions. The P2 loop is not conserved in Ivyc and it constitutes a flexible region in Ivyp1 that becomes more rigid in the complex with HL. We conclude that differences in the electrostatic interactions at the binding interface between Ivy inhibitors and distinct lysozymes determine the strength of this interaction.
