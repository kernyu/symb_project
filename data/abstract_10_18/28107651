In this issue of Cell Chemical Biology, Li et al. (2017) report on the biosynthesis of the monobactam sulfazecin by Pseudomonas acidophila and hypothesize a novel mechanism of beta-lactam ring formation. As monobactam antibiotics are unaffected by some emerging resistance mechanisms (particularly metallo-beta-lactamases), this discovery opens prospects to engineer beta-lactam antibiotics against multi-drug resistant pathogens.
