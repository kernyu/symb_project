Although phosphorylation of chloramphenicol has been shown to occur in the chloramphenicol producer, Streptomyces venezuelae, there are no reports on the existence of chloramphenicol phosphorylase in other Streptomyces species. In the present study, we report the modification of chloramphenicol by a recombinant protein, designated as Yhr2 (encoded by SAV_877), from Streptomyces avermitilis MA4680. Recombinant Yhr2 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the cells expressing this recombinant protein were shown to phosphorylate chloramphenicol to a 3'-O-phosphoryl ester derivative, resulting in an inactivated form of the antibiotic. Expression of yhr2 conferred chloramphenicol resistance to E. coli cells up to 25 mug/mL and in an in vitro reaction, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) were shown to be the phosphate donors for phosphorylation of chloramphenicol. This study highlights that antibiotic resistance conferring genes could be easily expressed and functionalized in other organisms that do not produce the respective antibiotic.
