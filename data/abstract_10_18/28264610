BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium species other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae were mostly considered contaminants in the past, but there are reports of their association with wide variety of human infections lately. In this study, we look into Corynebacterium species isolated from breast abscess patients and assess their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and treatment outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pus samples from suspected breast abscess cases were examined from October 2014 to September 2015. Growth of Gram-positive bacilli morphologically resembling Corynebacterium species were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization- time of flight mass spectrometry identifications generated by the Vitek MS system (bioMerieux, France) (MALDI-TOF Vitek MS system) and antimicrobial susceptibility was done. RESULTS: Corynebacterium species were isolated from 10 female breast abscess patients with median age of 36 years (range 25-59 years). Out of the 10 isolates four isolates were identified as C. kroppenstedtii; one isolate as C. striatum and five isolates were identified as C. amycolatum/C.xerosis. Out of four isolates of C .kroppenstedtii, two isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole and one C. striatum isolate was resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and clindamycin. Of the five isolates identified as C amycolatum/C xerosis, all were sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid but resistant to clindamycin. All the patients were treated with incision, drainage and antibiotics based on the sensitivity pattern; eight were cured and two patients did not come for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium species should be considered one of the causative agents of breast abscess and a varied susceptibility profile amongst the different species makes susceptibility testing important. Identification by MALDI-TOF Vitek MS system may not differentiate between C. amycolatum and C. xerosis.
