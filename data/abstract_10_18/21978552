Colloidal nano silver was applied on the surface of cotton fabric and stabilized using 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA). The two properties of antimicrobial activity and resistance against creasing were imparted to the samples of fabric as a result of the treatment with silver nano colloid and BTCA. The antimicrobial property of samples was evaluated using two pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus as outstanding barometers in this field. The durability of applied nanoparticles, color variation, wettability and wrinkle recovery angle of the treated samples were investigated employing related credible standards. The presence of nano silver particles on the surface of treated cotton fabric was proved using EDS spectrum as well as the SEM images. Furthermore, the creation of cross-links was confirmed by the means of both ATR-FTIR and Raman spectra. In conclusion, it was observed that BTCA plays a prominent role in stabilizing silver nanoparticle. Besides, Wettability and winkle recovery angle of finished samples decreased and increased, respectively. In addition, it is noteworthy that no obvious color variation was observed.
