BACKGROUND: Mediastinitis due to Acinetobacter baumannii is rare. METHODS: We report a case of mediastinitis caused by pan-resistant A. baumannii in a patient with multiple comorbidities who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass and we also present a literature review. RESULTS: Successful treatment consisted of surgical debridement plus drainage, and tigecycline administration for three weeks. CONCLUSION: Surgical source control along with effective antibiotics is essential in the treatment of mediastinitis. Tigecycline has the potential to be an option for pan-resistant A. baumannii mediastinitis.
