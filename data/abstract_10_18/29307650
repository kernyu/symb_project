We describe 84 clinical isolates of Prevotella timonensis recovered between January 2007 and November 2016at the University Hospital of Montpellier. They were recovered from a variety of clinical samples, mostly of genital and wound origins. All isolates were isolated from a mixed aerobic and anaerobic microbiota. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 50 isolates showed 56% of beta-lactamase production and 40% of resistance to clindamycin. One strain was resistant to metronidazole.
