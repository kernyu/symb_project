The objective of this study was to investigate effects of different concentrations of tetracycline (TC) on the microbial community and development of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) of sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used to detect the structural changes of the microbial community and the variations of eight TC resistance genes tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), tet(E), tet(M), tet(O), tet(S) and tet(X), respectively. The results indicated that, trace TC could substantially change the structure of the microbial community. Bacteria which could not adapt to environment with TC were gradually replaced by those adapting to tetracycline. Shannon's diversity index (H) and Simpson's index (D) reached maximum values when the concentration of TC was 1 mug L(-1). The resistance genes in the activated sludge proliferated under the pressure of trace TC.
