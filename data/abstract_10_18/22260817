Analysis of mutations I117V and I117M in the neuraminidase of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses showed that I117V confers a mild reduction in oseltamivir sensitivity and has a synergistic effect of further increasing resistance when combined with H275Y. Contrary to recent reports, the I117M mutation does not alter oseltamivir sensitivity.
