Antimicrobial peptide plectasin targeting bacterial cell wall precursor Lipid II has been reported to be active against benzylpenicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae but less potent against vancomycin-resistant enterococci than their susceptible counterparts. The aim of this work was to test plectasin NZ2114 in combination with cell wall targeting antibiotics on vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The activity of antibiotic combinations was evaluated against VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis strain BM4110/pIP816-1 by disk agar-induction, double-disk assay, determination of fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index, and time-kill curve. The results indicated that plectasin NZ2114 was synergistic in combination with teicoplanin, moenomycin, and dalbavancin but not with vancomycin, telavancin, penicillin G, bacitracin, ramoplanin, daptomycin, and fosfomycin. To gain an insight into the synergism, we tested other cell wall antibiotic combinations. Interestingly, synergy was observed between teicoplanin or moenomycin and the majority of the antibiotics tested; however, vancomycin was only synergistic with penicillin G. Other cell wall active antibiotics such as ramoplanin, bacitracin, and fosfomycin did not synergize. It appeared that most of the synergies observed involved inhibition of the transglycosylation step in peptidoglycan synthesis. These results suggest that teicoplanin, dalbavancin, vancomycin, and telavancin, although they all bind to the C-terminal D-Ala-D-Ala of Lipid II, might act on different stages of cell wall synthesis.
