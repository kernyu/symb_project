This study aimed to investigate antimicrobial susceptibility of hospital acquired Burkholderia cepacia infection in Shanxi (China) during August 2009 and December 2012. To characterize an emerging nocosomial infection. The medical records of 112 patients that were tested positive for B. cepacia were retrospectively analyzed. The K-B disk diffusion method was used to determine the drug susceptibility of the isolated strains. A hundred and fifty strains of B. cepacia were isolated from 112 patients. The sensitivity rates of B. cepacia to meropenem, imipenem, cotrimoxazole, minocycline and ceftazidime were 65.7%, 14.3%, 76.0%, 68.1% and 74.1%, respectively. All patients suffered from more than two underlying diseases, 89 (79.5%) from another bacterial infection and 92 (82.1%) with indwelling catheter. All patients were given antibiotics, including 62 patients that received carbapenem antibiotics. The average duration of hospitalization before detection of B. cepacia was 31+/-24 days, after which 65 patients (58.0%) improved, 22 (19.0%) died, 8 (7.1%) quit the therapy, and 17 (15.2%) were discharged after full recovery. The prevalence of hospital acquired B. cepacia infection and drug-resistance in the hospital is reported and risk factor exploration requires further study.
