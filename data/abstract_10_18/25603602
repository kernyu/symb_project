OBJECTIVE: To investigate the Salmonella contamination and its antibiotic resistance spectrum in the whole process of broiler hatching, cultivation, slaughtering, processing, distribution and retail in Shandong Province. METHODS: 2496 samples were collected from the chicken farms, hatching factory, breeding farm, slaughterhouse, large supermarkets and farmers' market in Jinan and Zibo City. All samples were tested according to GB 4789.4-2010 and the antimicrobial susceptibilities by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The positive rate of the hatching process was 2.39%, the breeding process was 12.67%, the slaughter process was 27.00%, the distribution and retail process was 22.72%. There were 32 serotypes, the Indiara and Enteritidis Salmorella accounted for 42.25% and 34.21% respectively. 95.91% of the Salmorella strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic, 71.37% of the strains were resistant to at least three antibiotics, 28.21% of the strains were resistant to at least ten antibiotics, 7 strains were resistant to fourteen antibiotics, all of them are Indiana Salmonella. CONCLUSION: In Jinan and Zibo City, it is seriously contaminated by various aspects of Salmonella in broiler production and processing. The contamination rate of slaughter and Salmonella distribution is higher than the links of hatching process and breeding. The situation of broiler Salmonella is becoming severe.
