Natural products and their derivatives have historically been invaluable as a source of therapeutic agents and have contributed to the discovery of antimicrobial agents. However, today with the development of drug-resistant strains, new scaffolds and new sources of bioactive compounds are needed. To this end, plant derived natural resins are reviewed for their potential application as antimicrobial agents. Natural gums, extracts of the whole resins, as well as specific extracts, fractions, essential oils and isolated compounds from the above resins are discussed in terms of their antifungal, antibacterial, and antiprotozoal activity.
