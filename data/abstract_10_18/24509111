A significantly strengthened Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) is currently operational in India. In this case-based commentary, we describe the plight of a patient who developed extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) despite having received treatment under the RNTCP for a long period. Our aim is to analyse the programmatic management of tuberculosis in India by highlighting and discussing various issues related to the treatment received by the patient. Further, the article explores whether there is a need to incorporate an ethical element into the RNTCP as it stands today.
