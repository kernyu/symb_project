BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remains challenging. Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with a wide spectrum of antitumor activity. Gemcitabine treatment is widely used to treat patients with certain solid tumors and relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies. There are several reports indicating that this compound is active in lymphoid malignancies. In patients with relapsed or refractory HL and NHL, gemcitabine has demonstrated efficacy as a single agent and in combination with other cytostatics. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the efficacy and toxicity of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study evaluated 68 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory HL and NHL. The median age of the patients was 36 years. All the patients received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (gemcitabine monotherapy or gemcitabine in combination with other cytostatics). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 46%. Complete response was achieved by 21% of the patients and partial response by 25%. Out of those who responded to gemcitabine treatment, 26 patients proceeded to autologous stem cell transplant. Toxicities connected with gemcitabine therapy occurred in 44% of the patients and included grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that gemcitabine-based salvage chemotherapy is effective and well tolerated in patients with relapsed/refractory HL and NHL.
