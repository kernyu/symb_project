AIM: Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are commonly seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and are related to antiretroviral therapy. Adiponectin and leptin secreted by adipocytes are both linked to body-fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of insulin resistance and T2D, and their association with adiponectin and leptin, in Afro-Caribbean men and women with HIV infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an unselected sample of 237 HIV-1-infected patients. Clinical and metabolic parameters were measured, including fasting and postload plasma insulin, and circulating adiponectin and leptin levels. Insulin resistance was estimated by homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). Adjusted multiple logistic regressions were used to estimate the association of insulin resistance with adipokine levels and patients' characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 132 men (mean age: 49 years) and 105 women (mean age: 48 years) were included in the study. Prevalences of T2D and insulin resistance were higher in women than in men [16.2% vs 8.3% (P = 0.06) and 24% vs 9.9% (P < 10(-)(3)), respectively]. Abdominal obesity was found in 47% of women and in 7% of men (P < 10(-)(4)). Insulin resistance was independently associated with adiponectin in women and with leptin in men. CONCLUSION: Insulin resistance is frequent in Afro-Caribbean women with HIV infection. Overweight and obesity are major risk factors in such a population. Systematic screening for insulin resistance should be carried out in this population, which has a high prevalence of T2D.
