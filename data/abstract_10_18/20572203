This study was planned to elucidate the efficacy of antibiotics on Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biofilms of S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 were grown on black, polycarbonate membranes placed on tryptic soy agar plates for 48 h at 37 degrees C, and then exposed to vancomycin or amikacin or ciprofloxacin at clinically achievable levels for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The morphology of antibiotic-treated and untreated biofilms was elucidated by SEM. SEM analysis indicated a differential affection of S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 in the center and periphery of biofilm upon treatment with vancomycin. The center of biofilm revealed damaged cells with sparse distribution, smaller size, and irregular shape, whereas cells in the periphery were unaffected. This differential distribution of susceptibility within S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 biofilms was specific for vancomycin only and was not observed on exposure to amikacin or ciprofloxacin. No such response was found in S.aureus ATCC 29213 biofilms. Thus, our study suggests a spatial distribution of vancomycin-induced damage in S. epidermidis biofilms. To our knowledge, this is the first report that indicates a differential affection of S. epidermidis in the center and periphery of biofilm upon treatment with vancomycin. Studies on the factors controlling this differential distribution could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in S. epidermidis biofilms.
