The general secretory pathway has long been regarded as a potential antibiotic drug target. In particular, bacterial type I signal peptidase (SPase) is emerging as a strong candidate for therapeutic use. In this review, we focus on the information gained from the use of SPase inhibitors as probes of prokaryote biology. A thorough understanding of the consequences of SPase inhibition and the mechanisms of resistance that arise are essential to the success of SPase as an antibiotic target. In addition to the role of SPase in processing secreted proteins, the use of SPase inhibitors has elucidated a previously unknown function for SPase in regulating cleavage events of membrane proteins.
