Antibiotics with good therapeutic value and novel mechanism of action are becoming increasingly important in today's battle against bacterial resistance. One of the popular targets being DNA gyrase, is currently becoming well-established and clinically validated for the development of novel antibacterials. In the present work, a series of forty eight quinoline-aminopiperidine based urea and thiourea derivatives were synthesized as pharmacophoric hybrids and evaluated for their biological activity. Compound, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(1-(6-methoxy-2-methylquinolin-4-yl)piperidin-4-yl)thiourea (45) was found to exhibit promising in vitro Mycobacterium smegmatis GyrB IC(5)(0) of 0.95 +/- 0.12 muM and a well correlated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA gyrase supercoiling IC(5)(0) of 0.62 +/- 0.16 muM. Further, compound 45 also exhibited commendable MTB MIC, safe eukaryotic cytotoxic profile with no signs of cardiotoxicity in zebrafish ether-a-go-go-related gene (zERG).
