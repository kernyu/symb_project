A fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance rate of 5.9% is reported in 205 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients presenting to field clinics in Karachi, Pakistan (2006 to 2009). FQ resistance among multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains was 11.1% (5/45), and it was 4.9% (5/103) in M. tuberculosis strains susceptible to all first-line agents. Spoligotyping of resistant strains did not show dominance of one strain type. Our data reflect considerable FQ-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates and the need to consider inclusion of FQ within first-line sensitivity testing in such settings.
