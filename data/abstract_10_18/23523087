Stressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells easily lose respiratory function due to deletions in mitochondrial DNA, and this increases their general stress resistance. Is the loss active? We found that erythromycin (an inhibitor of mitochondrial translation) prevents the loss in control cells but not in the ones expressing mitochondrially-encoded protein Var1 in the nucleus. Var1 is a component of mitochondrial ribosomes; it is hydrophilic, positively charged, and prone to aggregation. Addition of DNase altered Var1 content in a preparation of mitochondrial nucleoids. Our data indicate that Var1 physically interacts with mitochondrial DNA and under stress negatively regulates its maintenance.
