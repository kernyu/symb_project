Wastewater discharged from clinical isolation and general wards at two hospitals in Singapore was examined to determine the emerging trends of antibiotic resistance (AR). We quantified the concentrations of 12 antibiotic compounds by analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), the class 1 integrase gene (intI1), and 16 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that confer resistance to 10 different clinically relevant antibiotics. A subset of 119 antibiotic-resistant isolates were phylogenetically classified and tested for the presence of ARGs encoding resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (blaNDM, blaKPC, blaSHV, blaCTX-M), amikacin [aac(6')-Ib], co-trimoxazole (sul1, sul2, dfrA), ciprofloxacin (qnrA, qnrB), and the intI1 gene. Among these resistant isolates, 80.7% were detected with intI1 and 66.4% were found to carry at least 1 of the tested ARGs. Among 3 sampled locations, the clinical isolation ward had the highest concentrations of ARB and the highest levels of ARGs linked to resistance to beta-lactam (blaKPC), co-trimoxazole (sul1, sul2, dfrA), amikacin [aac(6')-Ib], ciprofloxacin (qnrA), and intI1 We found strong positive correlations (P < 0.05) between concentrations of bacteria resistant to meropenem, ceftazidime, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin and abundances of blaKPC, aac(6')-Ib, sul1, sul2, dfrA, qnrA, and intI1 genes.
