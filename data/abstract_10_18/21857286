Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and routine laboratory monitoring are limited for HIV-1-infected children from sub-Saharan Africa. This trial conducted in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, aimed to describe the biological efficacy, tolerance, and adherence of the combination of didanosine, lamivudine, efavirenz in once-daily administration among eligible HIV-1-infected children. From February 2006 to November 2007, 51 HIV-1-infected children aged from 30 months to 15 years and eligible for ART were enrolled in a phase II open clinical trial with follow-up visits every 3 months. HIV-1 genotype testing was performed in children with plasma viral load (PVL) >1000 copies per milliliter after ART initiation. Children were followed for a median of 13.4 months [interquartile range (IQR) 12.8-14.2]. At enrollment, median CD4 count was 8% (IQR = 4.5-12). PVL was 341,032 (IQR = 127,838-761,539) copies per milliliter. At 12 months, median CD4 increased significantly by +15% (P < 10(-3)), and median PVL decreases significantly by -290,500 copies per milliliter (P < 10(-4)). Hemoglobin and platelets counts increased significantly by +1.05 g/dL (P < 10(-5)) and 108,500 cells per milliliter (P < 10(-3)), respectively. Based on pill count, mean yearly adherence was 97.3%, and 48% of the children had an adherence rate >/= 95% at the four quarterly visits. Adherence was better for girls than for boys independently of other sociodemographic variables or markers of HIV disease progression. Drug-resistant mutations were found in 11 children (21.6%). This once-daily drug combination is associated with excellent virological efficacy, immune reconstitution, and good adherence. However, the high prevalence of drug resistance mutations is a matter of concern.
