In this paper we build a population dynamics of malaria including drug treatment. By taking into account both sensitive and resistant parasites, we want to see the effect of treatments on resistance phenomenon and prevent it from overspreading. Our main results include a new dynamics model, its mathematical properties which are found through analysis, the determination of unknown parameters with help of a data set for malaria from Burkina Faso and the numerical simulations of the fitted model. Based on these results, treatment strategies to reduce drug resistance can be elaborated.
