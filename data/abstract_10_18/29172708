AIMS: The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of the commercial Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampin (MTB/RIF) test for evaluating different types of spinal tuberculosis (TB) tissue specimens. METHODS: Pus, granulation tissue, and caseous necrotic tissue specimens from 223 patients who were diagnosed with spinal TB and who underwent curettage were collected for bacterial culture and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay to calculate the positive rate. Bacterial culture and phenotypic drug sensitivity testing (pDST) were adopted as the gold standards to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert bacterial detection and drug resistance (DR) test. RESULTS: The positive rate (68.61% +/- 7.35%) from the Xpert MTB/RIF assays of spinal TB patients' tissue specimens was higher compared with bacterial culture (44.39% +/- 6.51%, Z = 5.1642, p < 0.01), and the positive rates from Xpert MTB/RIF assays on the three types of specimens were all higher than those of bacterial culture, with statistically significant results for pus and granulation tissue specimens. The positive rates for pus using the two bacteriological tests were higher than those for granulation tissue but were not statistically significant. However, the positive rates obtained from granulation tissue were statistically significantly higher than those obtained from caseous necrotic tissue. With bacterial culture and pDST as the gold standards, the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF assays for MTB was 96.97%, while the sensitivity and specificity of the DR test also remained relatively high. CONCLUSION: For efficient and accurate diagnosis of spinal TB and DR and timely provision of effective treatment, multiple specimens, especially the pus of spinal TB patients, should be collected for Xpert MTB/RIF assays.
