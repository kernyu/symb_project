BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of infection. The roles of bacterial characteristics and glycemic control in diabetic patients with Escherichia coli infection have not been well investigated. The aims of this study were to examine the bacterial characteristics and glycemic control in diabetic patients with E. coli infections arising in the urinary tract. METHODS: A total of 271 E. coli isolates were collected from urine and bloodstream. Phylogenetic groups, the presence of virulence genes, and antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli isolates were determined. RESULTS: There were few differences in E. coli bacterial characteristics between 190 diabetic and 81 nondiabetic patients. In diabetic patients with urosepsis, there was a higher hemoglobin A(1C) level, and the related E. coli strains had more neuA, papG II, afa and hlyA genes, and a lower prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones than those with asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infection. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that increased hemoglobin A(1C) and presence of papG II and afa genes were independent factors associated with development of urosepsis in diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that more virulent E. coli isolates, especially with papG II and afa genes, and poorer glycemic control were important determinants for development of urosepsis in diabetic patients.
