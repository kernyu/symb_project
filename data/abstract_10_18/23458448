Hospital effluents are involved in dissemination of antibiotic-resistant integrons. We describe here a new class 3 integron, In3-5, detected in an Enterobacter cloacae isolate retrieved from a random French hospital effluent sample collected in 2009. In3-5 carries two gene cassettes: the new blaOXA -256 and an aac(6')-Ib variant, respectively conferring resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. In3-5 is located on an IncQ-like backbone plasmid. Class 3 integrons could thus be involved in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in both clinical settings and the environment, and could participate in the exchange of antibiotic-resistance genes between these two ecosystems.
