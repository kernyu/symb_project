Central Nervous System (CNS) infections related to external ventricular derivation are a major complication of patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Antimicrobial treatment of CNS infections should be based not only on the susceptibility of the isolated microorganism, but also on the treatment's pharmacokinetic properties demonstrating the passage of the molecule through the blood-brain barrier. When CNS infections are caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, intrathecal colistin is considered an effective and safe option. We review the literature of intrathecal/intraventricular use of colistin, comprehensive of both pharmacokinetic data and clinical experiences.
