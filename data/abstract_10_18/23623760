The definition of artemisinin resistance is becoming one of a prolonged parasite clearance phenotype, although this variable is a complex function of both host and parasite characteristics. We discuss some of the limitations of this definition of artemisinin resistance, particularly because of its potential global impact. This opinion article reviews the mechanisms underlying parasite clearance after artemisinin treatment and how these might relate to in vitro methods to assay for resistance. It revisits criteria for defining artemisinin resistance that are not currently being applied and suggests the term 'treatment failure of artemisinin combination therapy' (TFACT) as a more accurate description of most cases of 'artemisinin resistance'.
