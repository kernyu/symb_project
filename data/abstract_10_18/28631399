Colonisation of the human skin by Staphylococcus aureus is a precursor for a variety of infections ranging from boils to sepsis and pneumonia. The rapid emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus following the clinical introduction of this antimicrobial drug and reports of resistance to all currently used anti-staphylococcal drugs has added to its formidable reputation. S. aureus survival on the skin and in vivo virulence is underpinned by a remarkable environmental adaptability, made possible by highly orchestrated regulation of gene expression and a capacity to undertake genome remodelling. Depending on the ecological or infection niche, controlled expression of a variety of adhesins can be initiated to facilitate adherence to extracellular matrix proteins, survival against desiccation or biofilm accumulation on implanted medical devices and host tissue. These adherence mechanisms complement toxin and enzyme production, immune evasion strategies, and antibiotic resistance and tolerance to collectively thwart efforts to develop reliable antimicrobial drug regimens and an effective S. aureus vaccine.
