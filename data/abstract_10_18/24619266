INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been successful at decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) among ART-naive patients has been documented to compromise the success of initial therapy. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of HIVDR mutations among newly diagnosed drug-naive HIV-infected individuals in Lebanon. METHODOLOGY: Plasma samples from 37 newly diagnosed participants at various stages of HIV-1 infection were used to determine HIV-1 RNA viral load, isolate viral RNA, and amplify DNA by RT-PCR. Purified PCR products were used to perform genotypic resistance tests. RESULTS: The prevalence of resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRT), and protease inhibitors (PI) were 5.4%, 10.8%, and 8%, respectively. The major mutations detected in the study participants conferred resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs recommended for HIV-1 treatment. No significant relationship between HIV-1 viral load of participants and the mode of HIV-1 transmission or between the occurrence of HIVDR and the mode of transmission was found. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study on HIVDR mutations among newly diagnosed HIV-infected persons in Lebanon. The overall prevalence of HIVDR mutations detected in our study was 16%. Our results are important for evaluating the utility of the standard first-line regimens in use, determining the feasibility of HIVDR testing before the initiation of ART, as well as minimizing the emergence and transmission of HIVDR.
