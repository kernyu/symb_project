Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a virus belonging to the Beta Herpes virus family. Its genome contains many different genes clustered in immediate early, early and late genes. This last cluster includes UL99, a late gene that encodes for a tegument protein called pp28. In immunocompetent patients, HCMV infection occurs asymptomatically, while its reactivation in immunocompromised patients can be a cause of pneumonia, retinitis and gastrointestinal diseases. To prevent or to contrast HCMV infection, several drugs (such as Ganciclovir, Acyclovir, Foscarnet) are available, and their efficiency is evaluated by HCMV DNA load monitoring, as also for antiviral resistance onset that may occur after the therapy. In this study is described the development of a Real Time PCR for the detection and quantification of UL99 transcript and the clearance of this target compared to HCMV DNA, both in vitro and in vivo on bronchoalveolar lavage samples.
