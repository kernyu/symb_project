This study evaluated the efficacy of education versus audit and feedback in decreasing vancomycin utilization. Data were collected prospectively from October 1, 2012-April 30, 2014 over the following 3 periods: baseline, after education and introduction of a late-onset sepsis treatment guideline, and after prospective audit-feedback to physicians. Vancomycin utilization and administration duration >3 days significantly decreased with education and guideline use, but it was not affected by addition of audit and feedback.
