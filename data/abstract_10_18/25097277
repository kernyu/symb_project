OBJECTIVES: The study aimed at examining the role of oxidative stress in cadioprotective effects of oleuropein in a rat model of simultaneous type 2 diabetes and renal hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats including a control group, a diabetic-hypertensive group receiving vehicle, and three diabetic-hypertensive groups receiving oleuropein at 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg/day were used. Blood pressure and glucose, serum malondialdehyde, and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase were measured, and animal's hearts with ischemia/reperfusion injuries were used using Langendorff technique. RESULTS: Blood pressure, blood glucose, serum malondialdehyde, infarct size, coronary effluent creatine kinase-MB, and coronary resistance of diabetic-hypertensive group were significantly higher than those of the control group, while those of the oleuropein-receiving groups were significantly lower than those of the diabetic hypertensive group receiving the vehicle. Erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, left ventricular developed pressure, and rate of rise and rate of decrease of ventricular pressure of diabetic-hypertensive group were significantly lower than those of the control group. These parameters as well as heart rate of oleuropein-receiving groups were significantly higher than those of the diabetic-hypertensive group. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that oleuropein offered cardioprotection, which might be partly mediated by its antioxidant properties.
