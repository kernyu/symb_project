Raw milk has recently been reported as a source of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase genes. We thus investigated the prevalence of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in raw milk in Lebanon in order to assess the risk of transfer of these bacteria to humans. A high prevalence (30.2 %) of CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae was detected in raw bovine milk. Three main K. pneumoniae clones were identified by PFGE and MLST typing. Southern blot experiments revealed that one of these clones carried the blaCTX-M-15 gene chromosomally. Moreover, one OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae ST530 and seven CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli sharing the same ST were also detected. These findings highlight the spread of dominant CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae clones and OXA-48-producing isolates in the food chain. Milk, which is mostly consumed raw in Lebanon, may be a source of human exposure to ESBLs and carbapenemases.
