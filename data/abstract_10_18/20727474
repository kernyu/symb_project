The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial is a global surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline, and several comparators against an array of important Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. In this study, we examined 1591 isolates of Acinetobacter from blood samples collected from 352 centers globally between 2004 and 2008. Tigecycline showed an MIC(90) (1 microg/mL) globally, with a maximum regional value of 4 microg/mL (Middle East) reported. Antimicrobial susceptibility was notably higher among nonintensive care unit (non-ICU) isolates than isolates collected from ICUs. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter were more prevalent in the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia/Pacific rim than in Europe or North America. Tigecycline creep was noted between 2004 and 2007, corresponding closely to changes in MIC(90).
