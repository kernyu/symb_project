Bacterial biofilm profoundly influences the fate of bacteria within and the outcome of related infection, and is closely associated with antibiotics resistance and bacterial persistence. Bacteriophages represent a new promising alternative to combat biofilm-related infection. The interplay between phages and biofilms is complex. Some phages or their components can inhibit the host bacteria biofilm via diverse mechanisms, while other phages can facilitate the host biofilm formation through phage-mediated lysis and extracellular DNA release. In this paper, we summarize the role of bacteriophages in the biofilm formation, and the application of phages to the control of bacterial persisters and infectious biofilms, in particular, the phage-inspired antibiotics discovery.
