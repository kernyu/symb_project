OBJECTIVE: In the few cases of childhood dirrhea that require the antimicrobial therapy, the correct choice of the drug depends on detailed previous knowledge of local strains and pattern of antimicrobial resistance. Shigellosis is one of the most improtant examples of this group of intestinal infections. In order to establish such parameters in Nagpur city, this study was carried out to determine the antimcrobial resistance profile of Shigella flexneri isolated from patients suffering from diahhrea admitted to Various hoapitals in Nagpur district, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 110 stool samples collected from patients during the 3 year period. All the isolates were characterized and confirmed by VITEK(R) 2 GN ID cards and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by VITEK(R) 2 AST test cards. RESULTS: We received 73 positive cultures of S. flexneri out of 110 stool samples during three year periods of January 2009 to January 2012. S. flexneri strains presented a high resistance rate to Ampicillin (100%), Chloramphenicol (76.71%), Trimethoprime-sulfamethaxazole (TMP-SMZ) (68.49%) and low resistance to third- and fourth-generation Cephalosporin. None of the isolates was found to be resistant to Ciprofloxacin (MIC >/= 4), Norfloxacin (MIC >/=12), and Nalidixic acid (MIC >/=30). CONCLUSION: Our results provide data on antimicrobial resistance to choose a proper antibiotic for the treatment of Shigellosis in our country. According to current findings, Quinolones and Cephalosporins are the drug of choice for the diarrheic patients. In conclusion, systematic monitoring is needed to identify changes in the antimicrobial resistance.
