Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of liver damage and hepatic inflammation. Upon infection, effective antiviral responses by CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, Natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes can lead to partial or complete eradication of the viral infection. To date, many studies have shown that the production of inhibitory cytokines such as Interleukin 10 (IL-10), Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), along with dysfunction of the dendritic cells (DCs), and the absence of efficient innate immune responses could lead to T cell exhaustion, development of persistent infection, and inability to eradicate the viral infection from liver. Understanding the immunopathogenesis of the virus could be useful in providing further insights toward novel strategies in the eradication of HBV infection.
