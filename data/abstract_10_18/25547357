We estimated the efficacy of the current single administration of peramivir on the basis of peramivir pharmacokinetics in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and determined the predictive peramivir concentration-time curve to assess its efficacy against viruses with decreased susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors. Serum, nasal swab, or aspiration samples were collected from 28 patients treated with 10 mg/kg body weight peramivir. The sequential influenza viral RNA load and susceptibility after peramivir administration were measured using a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR and neuraminidase inhibition assay. The peramivir concentrations in the serum and URT after a single administration at 10 mg/kg were measured, and the predictive blood and URT peramivir concentration-time curves were determined to assess various administration regimens against resistant variants. The peramivir concentration decreased to <0.1% of the maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) at 24 h after administration. Rapid elimination of peramivir from the URT by 48 h after administration may contribute to an increase in the influenza A viral load after day 3 but not to a decrease in the influenza B viral load, despite the absence of a decrease in the susceptibility to peramivir. A longer maintenance of a high level of peramivir in the URT is expected by divided administration rather than once-daily administration. When no clinical improvement is observed in patients with normal susceptibility influenza A and B, peramivir readministration should be considered. In severe cases caused by resistant variants, better inhibitory effectiveness and less frequent adverse events are expected by divided administration rather than once-daily administration with an increased dosage.
