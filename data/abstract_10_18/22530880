INTRODUCTION: Invasive fungal infections remain a leading cause of infectious morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. There are relatively few effective antifungal agents, and currently available agents all have significant limitations. Isavuconazole is a novel second-generation triazole with broad-spectrum antifungal activity, and a favorable pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile. Isavuconazole is available as an oral and intravenous formulation. Phase III studies that are examining the efficacy of isavuconazole for invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis are currently in progress. AREAS COVERED: This review provides a summary of the pharmacological characteristics of isavuconazole and the potential future use of this agent. The preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are discussed. This review was constructed by searching isavuconazole, triazole, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in PubMed. References and abstracts that were not identified by this method were retrieved from the respective publications. EXPERT OPINION: Isavuconazole has the potential to become an important agent for the treatment of invasive fungal infections, principally because of its relatively broad and potent in vitro antifungal activity, and its favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Further preclinical and clinical studies are required to define the clinical utility of this agent, especially for invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis. Further information is required on the likely drug interactions, and in vitro susceptibility breakpoints for medically important invasive fungal pathogens. Further pharmacokinetic studies are also required in a range of patient populations to quantify the extent and sources of pharmacokinetic variability.
