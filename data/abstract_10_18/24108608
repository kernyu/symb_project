We describe a case of antiviral-resistant cytomegalovirus meningoencephalitis occurring after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Antiviral-resistant cytomegalovirus was identified in blood 16 months earlier. However, wild-type cytomegalovirus was evidenced in blood when the meningoencephalitis was diagnosed. Treatment of meningoencephalitis should be adapted to all previously identified resistance mutations in any compartment.
