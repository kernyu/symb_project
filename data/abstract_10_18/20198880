The stability of marker nptII and target gene of serine proteinase inhibitor BWI-1a (ISP) from buckwheat seeds after agrobacterial transformation in the new foreign genome environment has been investigated. Different vegetative and seed progeny of self-pollinated transgenic tobacco was studied after propagation at selective and nonselective in vitro conditions. For the majority of transgene lines among random sample of independent transgenic plants stable and coupled PCR confirmed inheritance and expression of marker and target genes has been demonstrated after prolonged microcutting and repeated regeneration cycles at unselective in vitro conditions. The most of the seed T1 progeny of the studied lines has maintained Km-resistance too. However all transgenic lines had significant disturbances at the microsporogenesis process. Two lines (C5 and C12) after 4-year microcutting lacked Km-resistance and at the same time lacked their antibacterial activity. Two other clones revealed variability in Km-resistance (line C7) and seedlings size (line C22) that might be a result of more than 1 transgene insertion or chimaeric nature of transgene plants so it require an additional study.
