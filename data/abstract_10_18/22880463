INTRODUCTION: Because of the presence of various fungi and changes in their spectrum in the mycosis of vagina it is necessary to perform periodic overviews including testing their susceptibility to antifungal agents. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate susceptibility of the fungi isolated from vaginas to antifungal drugs and to analyse the fungi responsible for vaginal mycosis in patients referred during a 7-year study MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in a group of patients suspected of vaginal mycosis between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2011. An analysis of the fungi isolated from their vaginas was performed. The susceptibility of the fungi to six antifungals (5-fluorocytosine, amphotericin B, miconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole) was evaluated using a semiquantitative Fungitest. RESULTS: A total of 4775 mycological test results were evaluated. Fungi were present in 30.6% of the material. C. albicans was the most frequently isolated fungal species (80.2%), followed by C. glabrata (5.8%), and S. cerevisiae (5.5%). Itraconazole turned out to be the least effective drug. C. krusei. was the species most resistant to antifungals, including fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: 1. C. albicans is the species most frequently isolated from a vagina. It is highly susceptible to azoles, the antimycotics generally used in the treatment of vaginal mycosis. 2. Out of the azoles under study ketoconazole was the most active against fungi in vitro while itraconazole was the least active. 3. The Candida non-albicans species, and particularly C. krusei, are less susceptible to antimycotics. 4. Amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine are most effective against Candida strains and S. cerevisiae, however they are not used in the treatment of vaginal mycosis because of their high toxicity
