A novel series of 6-(indol-2-yl)pyridine-3-sulfonamides was prepared and evaluated for their ability to inhibit HCV RNA replication in the HCV replicon cell culture assay. Preliminary optimization of this series furnished compounds with low nanomolar potency against the HCV genotype 1b replicon. Among these, compound 8c has identified as a potent HCV replicon inhibitor (EC50=4 nM) with a selectivity index with respect to cellular GAPDH of more than 2500. Further, compound 8c had a good pharmacokinetic profile in rats with an IV half-life of 6h and oral bioavailability (F) of 62%. Selection of HCV replicon resistance identified an amino acid substitution in HCV NS4B that confers resistance to these compounds. These compounds hold promise as a new chemotype with anti-HCV activity mediated through an underexploited viral target.
