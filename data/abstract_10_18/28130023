Stealth-type carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to almost all beta-lactams except imipenem is emerging in Japan. This resistance is mediated by specific variants of the metallo-beta-lactamases (blaIMP-6 or blaIMP-34) that differs by one amino acid from the common variant blaIMP-1. We developed an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR assay enabling rapid, sequence independent, identification of these variants.
