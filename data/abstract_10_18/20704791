OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance of antibiotic resistance of Acinetobacter Baumanii isolated from children in Wuhan between 2006 and 2008. METHODS: Bacterial susceptibility testing was carried out by the Kirby-Bauer method in 679 strains of Acinetobacter Baumanii isolated in Wuhan Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2008. The results were assessed according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (2008). RESULTS: The nonsusceptible rates of Acinetobacter Baumanii to ceftazidime, cefepime and piperacillin/sulbactam increased significantly in 2007 compared with those in 2006 (P<0.05). By comparing the results of 2007, it was suggested that the nonsusceptible rates of Acinetobacter Baumanii to ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/sulbactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and meropenem increased significantly in 2008 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The nonsusceptible rates of Acinetobacter Baumanii to beta-lactam antibiotics in children from Wuhan increased significantly year by year between 2006 and 2008.
