OBJECTIVE: To assess the epidemiologic characteristics of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) among a population in a pediatric hospital in Mexico City and analyze mortality-related risk factors, serotype distribution and antibiotic susceptibility related to S.pneumoniae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of IPD cases at a third level pediatric hospital between 1997-2004. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were included. The mortality rate was 27.5% and was associated with six pneumococcal serotypes: 14, 6B, 23F, 6A, 19F and 19A. There was no relationship between mortality and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. A total of 28.2% of isolates were resistant to penicillin and 24.6% were resistant to cefotaxime. A statistically significant relationship was observed between mortality and previous underlying disease (CI 95%; 2.5-18.3; p< 0.05) using a multivariate logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Our outcomes show that IPD mortality in our population is closely related to underlying disease and to six serotypes, five of which are included in the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
