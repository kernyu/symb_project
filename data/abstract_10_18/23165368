Aryl hydrazides are oxidised to acyl radicals through a mechanism involving diimide intermediates that are prone to nucleophilic acyl substitution. This oxidation occurs regardless of the oxidant involved, however there is no evidence that the acyl radical formed undergoes further oxidation to the corresponding acylium ion, even in the presence of strong oxidants. This study may provide insight into the mechanism of isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
