OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of human aldo-keto reductase 1A1 (AKR1A1) in the resistance to oxidative stress and the metabolism of toxic aldehyde in astrocytoma cells. METHODS: The siRNA was transfected into 1321N1 astrocytoma cells using Lipofectamine(TM); RNAiMax. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were applied to evaluate the knock-down efficiency of AKR1A1. MTT assay was used to examine the cell viability after H2;O2; and 4-hydroxynonenal treatment in AKR1A1 knock-down cells. In addition, the effect of knocking down AKR1A1 on cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the presence of H2;O2; was measured using 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH-DA). RESULTS: Western blotting and qRT-PCR showed that the AKR1A1-specific siRNA inhibited AKR1A1 gene expression by about 70% in 1321N1 cells. Cells with knock-down of AKR1A1 were more sensitive to H2;O2; and 4-hydroxynonenal-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, cellular ROS level in the cells with knock-down of AKR1A1 was much higher than that in the control cells in the presence of H2;O2;. CONCLUSION: The specific siRNA could efficiently inhibit AKR1A1 expression in 1321N1 cells. AKR1A1 could be involved in the metabolism of 4-hydroxynonenal and play a role in the resistance to oxidative stress.
