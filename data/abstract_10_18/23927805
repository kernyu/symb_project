OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of community-acquired urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in children, analyze the risk factors and the susceptibility of antibiotics, thus to provide references to the diagnosis and medication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)-CAUTIs. Mothod Totally 22 cases of PA-CAUTIs were selected in one hospital from Jan, 2006 to Jan, 2012, their clinical information, laboratory results and radiological images were collected, and were compared with the CAUTIs cased by E. coli of those randomly selected over the same period. RESULT: In those 22 cases with PA-CAUTIs, the mean value of protein level was (32.25 +/- 13.81) mg/ml, 19 of them were hospitalized, 6 had urinary operation history, 7 of them had long-term usage of glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive agents, and 20 had underlying diseases. A total of 22 children with 26 PA-CAUTIs episodes were compared to E. coli-CAUTIs. Compared with E. coli-CAUTIs patients, children with PA-CAUTIs more often presented with a lower albumin (P = 0.017), a history of urinary operation(P = 0.03), more cases had a history of urinary operation (P = 0.03), a long-term usage of glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive medication (P = 0.044). Through multivariate logistic regression of variables that were significant in univariate analysis (with hospitalizations, long-term usage of glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive, albumin, underlying disease and urinary operation histories), and it turned out that underlying diseases (odds ratio 8.500, 95% CI 1.513 - 47.761, P = 0.037) and with urinary operation histories (odds ratio 6.196, 95% CI 1.120 - 34.273, P = 0.037) were proved as the independent risk factors for PA-CAUTIs. Those PA bacterial strains had a 36.36% resistance rate to piperacillin, aztreonam and gentamicin, a 31.82% resistance rate to cefepime and ceftazidime, while the resistance rate (4.55%) to carbapenem antibiotics was relatively low, only to bacillosporin all the strains were sensitive. CONCLUSION: Underlying diseases and the urinary operation histories are the independent risk factors of the occurrence of PA-CAUTIs, carbapenem antibiotics and bacillosporin can be considered as the drugs of choice for its treatment.
