Febrile neutropenia is a serious complication of antineoplastic therapy and it is more commonly found in hematologic patients, associated with high mortality rates. Inadequate tissue concentration of antimicrobials has been described as a cause of therapeutic failure which also has been related to a low interstitial concentration for hydrophilic antibiotics. In critically ill patients it may occur an accumulation of compartmental fluids which can be related to an increase in the distribution volume or changes in clearance of antimicrobials. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of antimicrobials are reviewed, which can be used as a tool to optimize the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy in order to avoid failures and resistance selection.
