Antibacterial coatings on catheters for acute dialysis were obtained by an innovative and patented silver deposition technique based on the photo-reduction of the silver solution on the surface of catheter, with consequent formation of antibacterial silver nanoparticles. Aim of this work is the structural and morphological characterization of these medical devices in order to analyze the distribution and the size of clusters on the polymeric surface, and to verify the antibacterial capability of the devices treated by this technique against bacterial proliferation. The structure and morphology of the silver nanoparticles were investigated by using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The antimicrobial capability of the catheters after silver deposition was confirmed by antibacterial tests with Escherichia coli. Both scanning electron microscopy analysis and antibacterial tests were performed also after washing catheters for 30 days in deionized water at 37 degrees C, relating these data to thermogravimetric analysis and to energy dispersive spectroscopy, in order to check the resistance of coating and its antimicrobial capability after the maximum time of life of these devices.
