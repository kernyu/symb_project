BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection is one of the most common infections at all ages. Antimicrobial resistance has increased in the past few years. The aim of this study was to determine the most common etiologic agents of urinary tract infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted. Patients with a urinary tract infection identified over a 1-year period were included. The type of infection, risk condition, antimicrobial treatment, microorganism and antimicrobial susceptibility were recorded. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy four patients with infection, 31.4 % with urinary tract malformation, 56 % with functional abnormalities. 76.4 % were receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Escherichia coli was the most common agent isolated with 67%, followed by Klebsiella spp. 9 %, Pseudomonas spp. 7 % and others less frequently. Escherichia coli resistance to cephalotin was 58.7%, to norfloxacin 51 %, nitrofurantoin 15.5 %, cefuroxime 12.5 %, cefotaxime 15.5 %, cefepime 5 % and to amikacin 0 %. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the most common causative agent, and resistance to quinolones and cephalotin was higher than 50 %. Most patients had urinary tract functional abnormalities and a history of prophylactic treatment use. Options other than quinolones need to be assessed due to the high resistance identified in uropathogens.
