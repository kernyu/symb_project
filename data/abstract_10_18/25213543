BACKGROUND: Dentists are responsible for 9-10% of all antibiotics dispensed in primary care in the UK, many of which may be provided contrary to clinical guidelines. Since antibiotic consumption has been identified as a major cause of antibiotic resistance, dental prescribing may be a significant contributor to this important public health problem.Objective This study aims to explore general dental practitioners' (GDPs) perceptions and attitudes towards antibiotic use and resistance. METHOD: Qualitative interview study with 19 purposively sampled GDPs working in Wales. A set of open-ended questions were developed and amended during semi-structured telephone interviews. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and codes were developed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Perceptions of antibiotic use and resistance varied widely between practitioners, particularly with respect to the prevalence and impact of resistant strains on the management of dentoalveolar infection, and the impact of dental prescribing on the emergence of resistance. GDPs reported that their antibiotic prescribing decisions were driven by both clinical pressures and wider public health considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to enhance the quality of antibiotic prescribing in primary care dentistry should address issues associated with inappropriate prescribing as well as providing education about the causes, prevalence and impact of antibiotic resistance.
