Multidrug resistance has become a problem in the management of tuberculosis, leading to an urgent need for research related to new regimens including the currently available drugs. The objectives of this study were: (i) to study the effect of the following second-choice three-drug combinations against multidrug-resistant (MDR) and drug-susceptible clinical isolates (levofloxacin, linezolid and ethambutol; levofloxacin, amikacin and ethambutol; and levofloxacin, linezolid and amikacin); and (ii) to compare the effect of these combinations with an isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol combination against drug-susceptible clinical isolates. A total of 9 MDR clinical and 12 drug-susceptible isolates (11 clinical isolates and the H37Rv reference strain) were studied using an adaptation of the chequerboard assay. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated as follows: FICI=FIC(A)+FIC(B)+FIC(C)=A/MIC(A)+B/MIC(B)+C/MIC(C), where A, B and C are the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each antibiotic in combination and MIC(A), MIC(B) and MIC(C) are the individual MICs. The FICI was interpreted as synergism when the value was <0.75. The FICI of all the combinations ranged from 1.5 to 3, showing indifferent activity. No differences were found between MDR and drug-susceptible isolates, or between the second-choice combinations and the fourth combination against drug-susceptible isolates. In conclusion, the second-choice drugs are equally effective as the combination of isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol.
