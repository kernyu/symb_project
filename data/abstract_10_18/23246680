American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is a disease where susceptibility or resistance is dependent on T cell response. This is characterized by an increased in CD4(+) T cells, capable of inducing opposite disease profiles, and CD8(+) T cells, that are related to immuno protection. We characterized T lymphocytes from patients before and after treatment, patients that spontaneously healed and controls, also evaluating their production of IL-10, IL-4, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, after stimulation with soluble/insoluble antigenic fractions of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. We observed the production of suppressive cytokines in the early phase of leishmaniasis with significant presence CD4(+) T cells, suggesting their connection with disease progression. After healing, the immune pattern observed was a type 1 response, what seems to be associated with cure and/or protection in the ACL. The results also showed that both fractions induced a specific immune response, contributing to the search for relevant antigens in this disease.
