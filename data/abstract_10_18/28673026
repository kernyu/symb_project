Species from lower invertebrates to a spectrum of mammals show antiaging health benefits of phytochemical(s). Here, we explored the pro-longevity effects of a natural triterpenoid, ursolic acid (3beta-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acid; UA) in Caenorhabditis elegans with maximal life span being evident at 25 microM UA. Similar to eat-2 mutants, UA uptake by worm results in reduced fat storage and attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), independent of superoxide dismutase(s) activation. The genetic requirements for UA-mediated longevity are quite similar to dietary restriction (DR) achieved through SKN-1/NRF-2 exhibiting upregulation of downstream target genes gcs-1 and daf-9. Longevity mechanism was independent of PHA-4/FOXA and attributed to partial dependence on sir-2.1. Altogether, our study suggests differential use of UA-elicited signaling cascades in nutrient sensing for longevity. Both the redox state and the proteostasis of an organism play critical role in aging and disease resistance. Interestingly, we observed a reduction of toxic protein aggregation in transgenic polyglutamine (polyQ) C. elegans model and UA-mediated JNK-1 (c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase) activation in wild-type animals. Thus, our study demonstrates a small extent of prevention against proteotoxic stress by UA coupled with positive aspects of DR-mediated longevity.
