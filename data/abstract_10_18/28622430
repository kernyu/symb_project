Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important components of the innate immune system. Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a food-borne pathogen causing serious diarrheal diseases, must overcome attack by AMPs. Here, we show that resistance of EHEC against human cathelicidin LL-37, a primary AMP, was enhanced by butyrate, which has been shown to act as a stimulant for the expression of virulence genes. The increase of resistance depended on the activation of the ompT gene, which encodes the outer membrane protease OmpT for LL-37. The expression of the ompT gene was enhanced through the activation system for virulence genes. The increase in ompT expression did not result in an increase in OmpT protease in bacteria but in enhancement of the production of OmpT-loaded outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which primarily contributed to the increase in LL-37-resistance. Furthermore, a sublethal dosage of LL-37 stimulated the production of OMVs. Finally, we showed that OMVs produced by OmpT-positive strains protect the OmpT-negative strain, which is susceptible to LL-37 by itself more efficiently than OMVs from the ompT mutant. These results indicate that EHEC enhances the secretion of OmpT-loaded OMVs in coordination with the activation of virulence genes during infection and blocks bacterial cell attack by LL-37.
