OBJECTIVE: To analyze the distribution and drug susceptibility of the pathogenic bacteria in the airway secretions in children with tracheobronchial foreign bodies so as to assist physicians in clinical prescription. METHODS: Sputum specimens of 1 125 children with tracheobronchial foreign bodies were collected in removal of the foreign bodies by rigid bronchoscope, and the drug susceptibility test was performed. RESULTS: Pathogenic bacteria were detected in 218 (19.4%) of 1 125 sputum specimens. Among the pathogenic bacteria, 126 (57.79%) strains were gram-negative bacilli, consisting of 76 (34.86%) strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 (4.59%) strains of Escherichia coli, 7 (3.21%) strains of Sewer enterobacter, 7 (3.21%) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 6 (2.75%) strains of Klebsiella bacillus; and 92 (42.21%) strains were gram-positive bacilli, consisting of 80 (36.69%) strains of Streptococcus pneumonia and 10 (4.59%) strains of Escherichia coli. Most of detected gram-negative bacilli were highly sensitive to cefepime, ceftazidine, imipenem and amikacin, no strains were resistant to meropenem and ciprofloxacin. None of the detected gram-positive bacilli were resistant to cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin and teicoplanin. CONCLUSIONS: The Haemophilus influenzae of gram-negative bacilli and the Streptococcus pneumonia of gram-positive bacilli are the main pathogenic bacteria existing in the airway secretions of children with tracheobronchial foreign bodies. The Haemophilus influenzae were highly sensitive to cephalosporin, imipenem and amikacin, and the Streptococcus pneumonia to cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin and teicoplanin.
