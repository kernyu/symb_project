We retrospectively studied antibiotic resistance rates of H. pylori and their temporal changes in children. Resistance rates were 21.6% for both clarithromycin and metronidazole. There was no overall difference between children with or without migrational background. Resistance rates increased over time, and patients without migrational background showed a significant increase in metronidazole resistance. Our study emphasizes antibiotic resistance monitoring of H. pylori in children.
