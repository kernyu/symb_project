Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is an aggressive T-cell lymphoma. A 63-year-old man was diagnosed with AITL. He received 6 cycles of CHOP therapy, but showed progressive disease. Subsequently, he received ESHAP chemotherapy; however, it was not effective. He received mogamulizumab (an anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody). After 4 cycles, his respiratory condition worsened and he was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. Despite antiviral and antibiotic therapy, he died. We speculate that the combination of progressive lymphoma with mogamulizumab and chemotherapy likely caused CMV pneumonia. Because mogamulizumab therapy causes immunosuppression, if CMV pneumonia is suspected, then rapid treatment should be initiated.
