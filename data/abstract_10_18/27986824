With the alarming rise of antibiotic resistance, clinical professionals are called upon to manage antibiotic therapies using the most relevant and recent clinical and laboratory data. To this end, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs aim to reduce unnecessary or suboptimal use of antibiotics while maximizing outcomes for the patient. For AMS programs to succeed, the active participation of clinical professionals at all levels of patient care is required. Although programs exist to train established clinicians in AMS, there is a paucity of literature on how and when to integrate AMS concepts and skills in pre-clinical and clinical coursework. Here, we discuss the crucial microbiology concepts and proficiencies that are necessary for building and supporting an AMS program. We provide recommendations for key points to include in clinical curricula in order to develop the necessary microbiology interpretation skills to participate in AMS. The influence of AMS programs on local organism susceptibility patterns is emphasized. The importance of antibiograms, rapid diagnostic testing and the practical interpretations of microbiology laboratory reporting are discussed in regard to prioritization in clinical curricula. We also review the current literature on instructional strategies for introducing AMS into clinical programs, and propose concepts that should be included in didactic coursework in order to provide a foundation for AMS education.
