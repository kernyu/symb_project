Antimicrobial resistance was tested in Escherichia coli isolated from feces (n = 660) of red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, European bison, and wild boar shot in regional forests in Poland during two winter hunting seasons. Indicator E. coli (n = 542) was resistant against 11 of 14 tested compounds, mostly sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin, trimethoprim, and tetracycline (1.3-6.6% range). No significant differences were observed between boar and ruminant isolates. Most of deer and bison isolates showed no resistance. Selective screening of wildlife samples revealed 1.7% prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli found mostly in wild boars. They produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-15) and plasmid-mediated AmpC-type cephalosporinase (blaCMY-2). The majority of the isolates originated from boars shot in a narrow time frame and space; therefore, common antimicrobial selection pressure in the environment was assumed. Three E. coli isolates carried plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes (qnrS1/S3). No transferable colistin resistance mechanisms were found in two resistant E. coli. Transferability of resistance was proved in a single pAmpC-positive isolate carrying IncI1-alpha 95 kb plasmid. No cephalosporin-resistant E. coli harbored pathogenicity markers; therefore, they might be considered a vector of resistance determinants, but not a pathogen themselves.
