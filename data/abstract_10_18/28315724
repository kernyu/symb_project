Although a vast majority of Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by E. coli, epidemiological reports have indicated an increasing rate of such infections caused by some other opportunistic organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial susceptibility and pathogenesis mechanisms of P. aeruginosa are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to detect some virulence factor genes and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of P. aeruginosa isolates detected in patients with UTI, in children hospital of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. Eighty-four Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Then, the presence of six virulence genes, in the genome of the isolates was evaluated using PCR amplifications techniques. Finally, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the isolates was determined by disk diffusion method. According to the results, lasB was the most prevalent virulence gene that could be detected in the P. aeruginosa isolates (92.9%) used in this study. This was followed by aprA (81.2%), toxA (69.4%), and algD (60%) genes. Two genes, plcH and plcN, were detected in about 38.8% of the isolates. Additionally, Imipenem was found as the most active agent against the P. aeruginosa isolates used in this research. However, Cefotaxime resistance was observed in most of the isolates. Our P. aeruginosa isolates exhibited a great degree of heterogeneity not only in their virulence genes but also in their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Imipenem therapies tend to be among the best choices in the management of UTI caused by P. aeruginosa. As a conclusion, assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and also analyzing the virulence factors can be highly helpful to develop effective treatment strategies against P. aeruginosa urinary infections.
