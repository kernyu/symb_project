Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the commonest agent causing atypical pneumonia in children. Macrolides have long been used in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia not responsive to beta-lactams alone. In this report, we describe the first locally acquired paediatric patient with severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae, possessing an A-to-G transition at position 2063 of the 23s rRNA gene. In addition, we have detected two more strains of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae out of a total of 10 cases with chest infection that were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Therefore macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounted for 33% (3 out of 10 patients) of the polymerase chain reaction-confirmed cases.
