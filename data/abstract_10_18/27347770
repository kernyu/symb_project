This study was to evaluate the resistance of antimicrobial agents against pathogens from inpatients with nosocomial infection collected in Beijing, China, during 2011-2014. Measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was carried out using the broth microdilution method with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines as the indicator. A total of 5442 Gram-negative and 806 Gram-positive isolates were collected in this study in 2011-2014. Two carbapenem-resistant strains appeared among Escherichia coli (E. coli), while imipenem-resistant isolates increased in proportion from 0% to 8.2% among Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) during 4 year. Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) revealed severe antibacterial resistance to most antimicrobial agents. In contrast, a decreasing trend on resistance had been observed among Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) especially after 2012, range from 1.8% for co-trimoxazole to 13.5% for piperacillin. The resistance of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) also had the lowest resistant to linezolid and vancomycin (0.1%). In summary, antimicrobial-resistant nosocomial pathogens have gradually increased from 2011 to 2014, so improved surveillance of hospital-acquired infections and effective infection-control measures may be the best way to solve the present problem.
