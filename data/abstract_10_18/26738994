Tuberculous meningitis continues to be a serious problem for physicians because it is difficult to make an early diagnosis and the consequences of delaying treatment are severe. The objective of this study is to provide data for the optimization of diagnostic and timely treatment of tuberculous meningitis. Of the 401 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative tuberculous meningitis patients in our study, 332 were found to have an impaired blood brain barrier (82.8%). Nearly 17.0% of patients failed to be timely diagnosed. Headache (53.6%) and fever (48.6%) were the most common features, and Computed Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CT/MRI) detected 96 patients (23.9%) with abnormal meningeal imaging. Cerebrospinal fluid real-time polymerase chain reaction was positive in 73.8% of the tuberculous meningitis patients, whereas, smears and cultures detected only 6.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Further analysis identified striking differences between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible tuberculous meningitis. Patients with drug resistance correlated with grave prognosis. Tuberculous meningitis diagnosis should overall embody clinical symptoms, laboratory and cerebral imaging findings, and more sensitive diagnostic approaches are still warranted. Our data suggest cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for mycobacterial DNA and molecular drug susceptibility testing as routine assays for suspected tuberculous meningitis patients, and observation of the blood brain barrier function could be performed for individual management.
