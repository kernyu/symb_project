OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence, mortality, risk factors, aetiology and the susceptibility to antibiotics of the bacteria responsible for sepsis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single centre, prospective, observational study, involving 200 neonates admitted over 12 months to the NICU of the University Children's Hospital, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina. RESULTS: The crude incidence of all neonatal sepsis was 68.0% (136/200) and that of late-onset sepsis (LOS) was 48.5% (97/200), yelding an incidence density of LOS of 41.6/1000 patient days. LOS represented the most frequent infection and was significantly more frequent than early-onset sepsis (EOS) (71.3% versus 28.7% p<0.001). The overall mortality was 14.0%, and 18.4% among infected neonates. Risk factors associated with LOS were: mechanical ventilation, intravascular catheter, surgical procedures, birth weight </=1500 g, gestational age </= 28 weeks and Apgar score </= 3 at 5 minutes. Culture proven sepsis developed in 43.4% of neonates. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to amikacin, imipenem and meropenem; gram-positive bacteria to vancomycin and amikacin. CONCLUSION: Neonatal sepsis in our NICU showed a high incidence rate, and gram-negative bacteria were predominant. Low gestational age, mechanical ventilation and an intra-vascular catheter were significantly associated with sepsis. It is necessary to develop a multidisciplinary approach for routine surveillance of nosocomial infections, to improve the asepsis of therapeutic procedures, and to implement the more appropriate use of antibiotics.
