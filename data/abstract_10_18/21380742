A 34-year-old woman with discoid lupus erythematosus and lupus profundus was admitted to our hospital showing signs of a fever, malaise, and abdominal swelling. Diagnosis of cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis (CHP) was made based on lobular panniculitis with a hemophagocytosis. Treatment with high doses of prednisolone combined with cyclosporine A (CsA) was not effective enough. However, after changing CsA to tacrolimus (TAC), CHP improved. Our case demonstrates that TAC may be a novel therapy for CHP.
