Twenty-four quinoxaline derivatives were evaluated for their antimycobacterial activity using BacTiter-Glo microbial cell viability assay. Five compounds showed MIC values <3.1 muM and IC50 values<1.5 muM in primary screening and therefore, they were moved on for further evaluation. Compounds 21 and 18 stand out, showing MIC values of 1.6 muM and IC50 values of 0.5 and 1.0 muM, respectively. Both compounds were the most potent against three evaluated drug-resistant strains. Moreover, they exhibited intracellular activity in infected macrophages, considering log-reduction and cellular viability. In addition, compounds 16 and 21 were potent against non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis and compound 21 was bactericidal. Therefore, quinoxaline derivatives could be considered for making further advances in the future development of antimycobacterial agents.
