The expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been reported to be dysregulated in pancreatic cancer. However, its contributions to tumor formation and progression remain to be elucidated. The present study demonstrated that YAP overexpression promoted the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) in a manner associated with pancreatic cancer invasion in vitro. RNA interferencemediated silencing of YAP attenuated cell invasion in vitro. Mechanistically, the present study demonstrated that YAP overexpression fosters pancreatic cancer progression by inducing the EMT in pancreatic cancer cells by activating the AKT cascade, which can counteract the effect of gemcitabine. These data suggested that the YAP acts synergistically to promote pancreatic cancer progression by hyperactivation of AKT signaling. The present study revealed YAP as a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer and a biomarker for predicting gemcitabine treatment response.
