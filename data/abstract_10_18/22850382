Laribacter hongkongensis is a novel emerging pathogen associated with human gastroenteritis. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and genotypic relationship of 199 L. hongkongensis isolates from 690 intestinal samples of fish and frogs. These samples were collected from retail markets in the city of Guangzhou in southern China from October 2008 to September 2009. L. hongkongensis was detected in from 80 (16.3%) out of 490 freshwater fish, and this number included 76 (32.3%) out of 235 grass carp and 4 (14.8%) out of 27 bighead carp. A higher isolation rate of 59.5% (119 out of 200) was observed in edible frogs. The isolation rate was highest in the spring in comparison with other seasons. Notably, 63.8% of the isolates were resistant to at least one class of antimicrobial agents. Analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that the isolates could be grouped into three clusters. Isolates from fish intestines were grouped into two clusters: cluster I and II. Isolates of frog-origin and several fish-origin isolates were grouped into cluster III. Two patient-derived strains could be classed into cluster III. Extensive genetic heterogeneity among the isolates was observed. The results indicate that L. hongkongensis isolates exhibits host tropism, extensive resistance to widely used antimicrobials and diverse biological evolution in an aquatic environment. The frog is more likely than the freshwater fish to be the potential source for human infection with L. hongkongensis.
