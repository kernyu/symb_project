The development of new antibacterial agents has become necessary to treat the large number of emerging bacterial strains resistant to current antibiotics. Despite the different methods of resistance developed by these new strains, the A-site of the bacterial ribosome remains an attractive target for new antibiotics. To develop new drugs that target the ribosomal A-site, a high-throughput screen is necessary to identify compounds that bind to the target with high affinity. To this end, we present an assay that uses a novel fluorescein-conjugated neomycin (F-neo) molecule as a binding probe to determine the relative binding affinity of a drug library. We show here that the binding of F-neo to a model Escherichia coli ribosomal A-site results in a large decrease in the fluorescence of the molecule. Furthermore, we have determined that the change in fluorescence is due to the relative change in the pK(a) of the probe resulting from the change in the electrostatic environment that occurs when the probe is taken from the solvent and localized into the negative potential of the A-site major groove. Finally, we demonstrate that F-neo can be used in a robust, highly reproducible assay, determined by a Z'-factor greater than 0.80 for 3 consecutive days. The assay is capable of rapidly determining the relative binding affinity of a compound library in a 96-well plate format using a single channel electronic pipette. The current assay format will be easily adaptable to a high-throughput format with the use of a liquid handling robot for large drug libraries currently available and under development.
