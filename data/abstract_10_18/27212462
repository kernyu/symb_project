OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), and are one of the key predictors of preterm births. In the light of this fact, present study was conducted to determine the predominant Escherichia coli (E. coli) phylotypes and their associated antibiotic susceptibility patterns, isolated from pregnant mothers with the history of preterm births. METHODS: Forty seven E. coli strains were isolated out of a total of 80 urine samples of pregnant women. The isolates were phylotyped and further screened for the presence of Clonal group A. Moreover, Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and screening for Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) producing strains were also performed. RESULTS: Among the 47 isolates, phylogroup B2 was found to be highly prevalent (45%), followed by group D (23%), B1 (10.64%), A (6.38%), E (6.38%), cryptic clade I (4.25%) and F (2.13%). Two isolates belonged to CgA and 41 (87.23%) isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant. Out of nine antibiotics tested in the study, the isolates displayed high resistance to Ampicillin (82.6%), Sulphamethoxazole (65.22%), Nalidixic acid (60.87%), Sulphamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, Doxycycline and Erythromycin (56.52% each). In total, 8 (17.02%) of the isolates were found to be ESBL positive. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of infections caused by virulent and highly drug resistant E. coli isolates constitute a risk of developing preterm birth complications in pregnant women and requires the selection of appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused during pregnancy.
