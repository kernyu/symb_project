OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of linezolid in the treatment of post-neurosurgical intracranial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) infection. METHODS: The data from 14 patients, admitted to neurological intensive care unit (ICU) of Medical College of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces between March 2009 and November 2011, were retrospectively analyzed. All these cases suffered from post-neurosurgical intracranial infection by MRS and received linezolid treatment. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected before and 7 days and 14 days after treatment for routine and bacteriological examinations to assess clinical efficacy and adverse reactions of linezolid. RESULTS: After 14-day treatment with linezolid, the clinical and laboratory parameters showed significant improvement: glucose (mmol/L) in CSF rose from 1.00 (0.65) to 3.15 (1.60), protein (mg/L) in CSF dropped from 2238.50 (2072.50) to 606.50 (217.30), white blood cell count [x10(6)/L] in CSF fell from 920.00 (1587.50) to 30.00 (40.00), and the number of patients with CSF neutrophil ratio>0.20 was reduced from 14 to 1 (all P < 0.01). In addition, serum procalcitonin level (mug/L) was significantly reduced from 0.65 (1.16) to 0.08 (0.09) after linezolid therapy (P < 0.01). Total effective rate was 85.7% (12/14), and CSF bacterial clearance rate reached 100%. No adverse events were found during the treatment. CONCLUSION: Linezolid could effectively control post--neurosurgical intracranial MRS infection and alleviate the inflammatory responses with safety.
