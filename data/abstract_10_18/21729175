Cryptococcal meningitis is mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, but occasionally other Cryptococcus species and phylogenetically related species are involved. Herein, we present a case of cryptococcal meningitis from China, which was caused by an azole and flucytosine resistant Filobasidium uniguttulatum. In addition, we present an overview of the literature of meningitis caused by Cryptococcus species other than C. neoformans and C. gattii. Eight cases were related to infections of the central nervous system. Leukaemia and cancer were important risk factors in HIV-negative patients. Molecular identification and susceptibility testing are important for proper management of patients because the species involved may differ in susceptibility to antifungal drugs.
