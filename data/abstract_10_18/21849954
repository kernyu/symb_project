The aim of the study was to determine aetiological agents of chronic suppurative inflammation of the middle ear and their susceptibility to antibiotics, which could lead to better therapeutic decisions and consequently avoidance of appearance of resistance to specific antibiotics. Most frequently isolated agents were Staphylococcus aureus (30.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.4%), Klebsiella spp. (10.6%) and Proteus spp. (7.1%). None of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. High sensitivity rates to gentamycin were noted in Staphylococcus and Klebsiella isolates, and moderate ones in Pseudomonas and Proteus isolates. Pseudomonas spp. has shown low prevalence of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, as well as to imipenem and piperacillin.
