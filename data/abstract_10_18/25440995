Extensive use of current anti-coccidial drugs together with drug resistance and residue has raised concerns about public health and poultry development. Here, we studied the anti-coccidial properties of Bidens pilosa. A phytochemical approach was developed for analysis of B. pilosa utilized as a feed additive. The protective effects of B. pilosa supplemented chicken diet were evaluated chickens infected with Eimeria tenella. B. pilosa, at doses of 0.5%, 1% and 5% of the chicken diet, significantly protected against E.tenella as measured by reduction in mortality, weight loss, fecal oocyst excretion and gut pathology in chickens. Finally, drug resistance of E. tenella to B. pilosa was assessed in chickens using the anti-coccidial index. This index showed that B. pilosa induced little, if any, drug resistance to Eimeria in chickens. Collectively, this work suggests that B. pilosa may serve as a novel, natural remedy for coccidiosis with low drug resistance in chickens.
