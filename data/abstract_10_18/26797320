A novel one-dimensional MgFe2O4/MoS2 heterostructure has been successfully designed and fabricated. The bare MgFe2O4 was obtained as uniform nanowires through electrospinning, and MoS2 thin film appeared on the surface of MgFe2O4 after further chemical vapor deposition. The structure of the MgFe2O4/MoS2 heterostructure was systematic investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), and Raman spectra. According to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results, the MgFe2O4/MoS2 heterostructure showed a lower charge-transfer resistance compared with bare MgFe2O4, which indicated that the MoS2 played an important role in the enhancement of electron/hole mobility. MgFe2O4/MoS2 heterostructure can efficiently degrade tetracycline (TC), since the superoxide free-radical can be produced by sample under illumination due to the active species trapping and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement, and the optimal photoelectrochemical degradation rate of TC can be achieved up to 92% (radiation intensity: 47 mW/cm(2), 2 h). Taking account of its unique semiconductor band gap structure, MgFe2O4/MoS2 can also be used as an photoelectrochemical anode for hydrogen production by water splitting, and the hydrogen production rate of MgFe2O4/MoS2 was 5.8 mmol/h.m(2) (radiation intensity: 47 mW/cm(2)), which is about 1.7 times that of MgFe2O4.
