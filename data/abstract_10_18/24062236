Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the potential to achieve resistance to carbapenems via the acquisition of carbapenemase-encoding genes, the downregulation of the OprD porin, the overexpression of efflux systems and the overproduction of cephalosporinases. One hundred and fifty carbapenem-non-susceptible isolates from 2008 to 2010 were screened for carbapenemase production, OprD porin loss, efflux pumps overexpression and inducible AmpC beta-lactamase production. For comparison reasons, the presence of the same mechanisms was also assessed in a previous collection of 30 carbapenem-non-susceptible P. aeruginosa isolated between 2003 and 2005. Results showed the accumulation of various resistance mechanisms among VIM-2 producers isolated between 2008 and 2010 with a parallel considerable increase in imipenem MIC90 and the geometric mean of the MIC values of imipenem and meropenem between the two study groups. The accumulation of carbapenem resistance mechanisms highlights the potential of this formidable pathogen for evolutionary success under antibiotic selective pressure.
