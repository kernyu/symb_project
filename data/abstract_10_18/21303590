There is concern that widespread usage of ertapenem may promote cross-resistance to other carbapenems. To analyse the impact that adding ertapenem to our hospital formulary had on usage of other broad-spectrum agents and on susceptibilities of nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas isolates, we performed interrupted time-series analyses to determine the change in linear trend in antibiotic usage and change in mean proportion and linear trend of susceptibility pre- (March 2004-June 2005) and post- (July 2005-December 2008) ertapenem introduction. Usage of piperacillin-tazobactam (P=0.0013) and ampicillin-sulbactam (P=0.035) declined post-ertapenem introduction. For Enterobacteriaceae, the mean proportion susceptible to ciprofloxacin (P=0.016) and piperacillin-tazobactam (P=0.038) increased, while the linear trend in susceptibility significantly increased for cefepime (P=0.012) but declined for ceftriaxone (P=0.0032). For Pseudomonas, the mean proportion susceptible to cefepime (P=0.011) and piperacillin-tazobactam (P=0.028) increased, as did the linear trend in susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (P=0.028). Notably, no significant changes in carbapenem susceptibility were observed.
