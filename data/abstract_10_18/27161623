A series of colistin-resistant Escherichia coli clinical isolates was recovered from hospitalized and community patients in South Africa. Seven clonally unrelated isolates harbored the mcr-1 gene located on different plasmid backbones. Two distinct plasmids were fully sequenced, and identical 2,600-bp-long DNA sequences defining a mcr-1 cassette were identified. Promoter sequences responsible for the expression of mcr-1, deduced from the precise identification of the +1 transcription start site for mcr-1, were characterized.
