BACKGROUND: Distribution of HIV-1 subtypes, transmitted drug resistance (TDR)/drug resistance mutation (DRM), and their impact on response to combination antiretroviral therapy remain poorly understood in China. METHODS: We analyzed data from our multicenter cohort study with 444 antiretroviral-naive participants recruited between 2008 and 2010. HIV-1 subtype and tropism were determined by V3 sequencing, and TDR/DRM was determined by Pol sequencing. Virologic and immunologic responses were monitored over 96 weeks of follow-up. The initial combination antiretroviral therapy regimen for all patients was nevirapine + lamivudine + zidovudine or stavudine. Analysis 1 included patients who finished 96 weeks of follow-up (n = 379), and analysis 2 included all 444 patients. RESULTS: Subtype B/B' was associated with higher prevalence of TDR/DRM to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Median time to HIV-1 suppression was 18 weeks in all 3 subtype groups. In Cox proportional models for viral suppression, neither viral tropism nor HIV-1 subtypes had any impact on viral suppression; however, subtypes CRF01_AE and C/CRF07_BC/CRF08_BC were associated with lower risk of virologic failure compared with subtype B/B', with adjusted hazard ratio of 0.11 (P = 0.032) and 0.06 (P = 0.036), respectively in analysis 1, 0.42 (P = 0.047) and 0.22 (P = 0.008), respectively in analysis 2. This association was attenuated by adding DRM profiles to multivariate regression models. Neither subtype nor HIV-1 tropism affected immunologic response. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 subtype tended to be associated with virologic but not immunologic response; this effect could be ascribed to baseline DRM.
