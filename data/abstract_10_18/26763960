Using blaZ PCR as the "gold standard," the sensitivities of CLSI penicillin zone edge and nitrocefin-based tests for beta-lactamase production in Staphylococcus aureus were 64.5% and 35.5%, respectively, with specificity of 99.8% for both methods. In 2013, 13.5% of 3,083 S. aureus isolates from 31 U.S. centers were penicillin susceptible.
