Hospital-wide antibiograms provide general susceptibility patterns. Specific antibiograms were created for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates based on infection process and epidemiology. Using clinical microbiology laboratory data and patient profiles, high clindamycin resistance rates were seen for nonskin and soft tissue infections and noncommunity-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates.
