Glutamate-gated chloride (GluCl) channels are pentameric receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter glutamate in invertebrates and are a major target for macrolide anthelmintics. Three amino acids in GluCl channels are reported to render macrolide resistance in nematodes and insects. To examine whether these three amino acids are involved in binding of the antiparasitic agent milbemycin (MLM) to the GluCl channels of the nematode parasite Haemonchus contortus, the equivalent amino acids (L256, P316, and G329) of the Hco-AVR-14B subunit were substituted with various amino acids. cDNAs encoding the wild type and mutants of this subunit were transfected into COS-1 cells for transient expression and analysis of GluCl channels. The abilities of these mutant channels to bind [(3)H]MLM A(4) were remarkably decreased when compared with the wild-type channel. In patch clamp analysis, L256F and P316S mutant channels were 37- and 100-fold less sensitive to MLM A(4) when compared with the wild-type channel, respectively. These findings indicate that amino acid changes in the beta10 strand, the M2-M3 linker, and the M3 region influence MLM A(4) binding to the channel. Homology modeling and ligand docking studies suggest the presence of two potential binding sites for MLM A(4).
