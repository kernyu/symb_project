The current study investigated Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from sputum specimens. Compared with previous studies, we found that A baumannii was drug resistant to 14 common antibiotics listed in Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines (mean drug resistance rate: 80.9%) and was only sensitive to cefoperazone/sulbactam (sensitivity rate: 65.5%). With growing abuse of antibiotics, multidrug-resistant and pandrug-resistant strains of A baumannii have increased steadily and become a leading cause of hospital infections.
