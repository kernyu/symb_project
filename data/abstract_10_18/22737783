Country-specific differences in bacterial antibiotic resistances cause variability in recommendations given in different countries. Mutually approved national expert and hospital-specific practices are therefore beneficial. Selection of the best prophylactic antimicrobial drug and correct timing of drug dosing are of high significance. In the light of our questionnaire survey prophylactic practices are relatively consistent in Finland. Hospitals have operation-specific recommendations on prophylaxis, but adherence to them is scarcely monitored. In fact, hospitals should invest in such monitoring systems.
