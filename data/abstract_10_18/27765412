Although fosfomycin is a treatment option for infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, fosfomycin resistance has been documented. To our knowledge, fosfomycin resistance mechanisms in Klebsiella pneumoniae have not been systematically investigated. A total of 108 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates collected from Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Taiwan, from August 2012 to May 2013 were analysed in this study. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed 64 pulsotypes and six non-typeable isolates, indicating high genetic diversity. Moreover, pulsotypes V (n = 6), VII (n = 11) and LI (n = 4) belonging to ST11 were major types. Among 30 (27.8%) fosfomycin-non-susceptible isolates, 21 (70%) had a MurA amino acid substitution, and seven new variations increased the fosfomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by 8- to 16-fold compared with wild-type MurA in Escherichia coli DH5alpha.strain. Functionless transporters (GlpT and UhpT) with various mutations were found in 29 isolates (97%). No known fosfomycin-modifying enzymes were detected in this study. The major resistance mechanisms to fosfomycin in K. pneumoniae were amino acid variations in the drug target and transporters.
