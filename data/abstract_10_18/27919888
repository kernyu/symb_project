Comparative genome sequencing analysis of a lincomycin-resistant strain of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and the wild-type strain identified a novel mutation conferring a high level of lincomycin resistance. Surprisingly, the new mutation was an in-frame DNA deletion in the genes SCO4597 and SCO4598, resulting in formation of the hybrid gene linR. SCO4597 and SCO4598 encode two histidine kinases, which together with SCO4596, encoding a response regulator, constitute a unique two-component system. Sequence analysis indicated that these three genes and their arrangement patterns are ubiquitous among all Streptomyces genomes sequenced to date, suggesting these genes play important regulatory roles. Gene replacement showed that this mutation was responsible for the high level of lincomycin resistance, the overproduction of the antibiotic actinorhodin, and the enhanced morphological differentiation of this strain. Moreover, heterologous expression of the hybrid gene linR in Escherichia coli conferred resistance to lincomycin in this organism. Introduction of the hybrid gene linR in various Streptomyces strains by gene engineering technology may widely activate and/or enhance antibiotic production.
