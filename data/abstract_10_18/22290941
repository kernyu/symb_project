This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro combination of farnesol and beta-lactams against Burkholderia pseudomallei. A total of 12 beta-lactamase-positive strains were tested according to CLSI standards. All strains were inhibited by farnesol, with MICs ranging from 75 to 150 muM. The combination of this compound with beta-lactams resulted in statistically significant beta-lactam MIC reduction (P </= 0.05). This study provides new perspectives for the use of farnesol combined with beta-lactam antibiotics against strains of B. pseudomallei.
