AIMS: Although baicalin could attenuate obesity-induced insulin resistance, the detailed mechanism of baicalin on glucose uptake has not been sufficiently explored as yet. The aim of this study was to survey if baicalin might facilitate glucose uptake and to explore its signal mechanisms in L6 myotubes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: L6 myotubes were treated with 100, 200, 400muM baicalin for 6h, 12h and 24h in this study. Then 2-NBDG and insulin signal protein levels in myotubes of L6 cells were examined. KEY FINDINGS: We discovered that administration of baicalin enhanced GLUT4, PGC-1alpha, pP38MAPK, pAKT and pAS160 contents, as well as GLUT4 mRNA and PGC-1alpha mRNA levels in L6 myotubes. The beneficial metabolic changes elicited by baicalin were abrogated in myotubes of L6 by P38MAPK or AKT inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that baicalin promoted glucose uptake in myotubes by differential regulation on P38MAPK and AKT activity. In conclusion, these data provide insight that baicalin is a powerful and promising agent for the treament of hyperglycemia via AKT/AS160/GLUT4 and P38MAPK/PGC1alpha/GLUT4 pathway.
