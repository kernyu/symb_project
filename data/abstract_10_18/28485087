WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial misuse has been commonly observed in China. This phenomenon can cause antibiotic resistance. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of an antimicrobial stewardship programme implemented in a tertiary hospital in China from 2011 to 2014. METHODS: The antimicrobial stewardship programme began in 2011. Data on the consumption of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance between 2011 and 2014 were collected. RESULTS: Comparison of the 2011 data with those of 2014 showed that antibiotic defined daily doses/per 100 patient-days decreased from 92.5+/-2.8 to 35.8+/-1.2 (P<.01). The detection rate of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase content of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in 2014 was reduced. The resistance of E. coli and K. pneumonia to amikacin, gentamicin and ceftriaxone was significantly reduced (P<.01). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our study reports positive responses to antimicrobial control measures in a Chinese tertiary hospital. It elucidates that the antimicrobial programme including administrative management, especially information management, was effective in reducing antibiotic consumption and lessening antibiotic resistance.
