The early identification of the subtle signs of increased bioburden in a wound enables timely and appropriate treatment and therefore improved patient outcomes. The rising costs of antimicrobial dressings and the growth in antibiotic-resistant organisms increase the need for correct diagnosis. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a significant contributory factor in bacterial resistance. This article describes a new tool devised by a professional working group of tissue viability nurse specialists which is designed to help healthcare professionals to identify and manage bacterial burden in wounds. It is hoped that this will assist prompt diagnosis and help to reduce patient morbidity with appropriate and timely interventions.
