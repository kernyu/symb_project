We tested 200 clinical Acinetobacter baumannii isolates against imipenem and meropenem using the methods of broth microdilution, disk diffusion, agar dilution, MicroScan/WalkAway automated system. Very major errors were mostly obtained between MicroScan/WA system and disk diffusion test. MicroScan/WA system generated unacceptable errors. Combined disk and modified Hodge tests used for detection of metallo-beta-lactamase production were practical and useful.
