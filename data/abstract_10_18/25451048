Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a major pathogen causing community-acquired pneumoniae (CAP), which is generally treated with macrolides. In recent years, however, although macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has been reported frequently, particularly in China, very little is known about the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection in adults. In this study, we survey the macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae in adults in Zhejiang province and characterize the mechanisms of resistance to macrolide. Six hundred fifty throat swab samples were collected from adult patients with CAP from January 2012 to August 2014. These samples were assayed by nested PCR and then cultivated for M. pneumoniae. All isolates were sequenced to determine the mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. The activities of 10 antibiotics against macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae isolates were also investigated in vitro. Moreover, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the amplified P1 gene was used to type 50 resistant strains. One hundred percent (71/71) of M. pneumoniae strains isolated from adults with CAP were resistant to erythromycin (MIC=128 to >256 mug/ml), clarithromycin (MIC=128 to >256 mug/ml), and azithromycin (MIC=32 to >64 mug/ml). Furthermore, all macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains identified had an A2063G mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Forty-six resistant strains (92.0%) were classified into type I strain on the basis of P1 gene PCR-RFLP analysis. According to these findings, it is suggested that macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection is very prevalence among adults in Zhejiang province. Thus, there is necessary to perform the epidemiological monitoring of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae in the future.
