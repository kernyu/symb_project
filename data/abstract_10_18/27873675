Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in paediatric patients. The alarmingly increasing antimicrobial resistance of contemporary uropathogens in children necessitates the re-evaluation of antibiotic treatment. We evaluated uropathogens isolated from children hospitalised due to a community-acquired UTI over a 5.5-year period in a university hospital of Northern Greece and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The antibiotic susceptibility of uropathogens was compared by patient sex and age. Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed by the automated VITEK((R)) 2 system and the Kirby-Bauer method. Overall, 221 urinary isolates were identified from 218 children with a documented UTI, including 170 (76.9%) Escherichia coli, 17 (7.7%) Proteus spp., 15 (6.8%) Klebsiella spp., 9 (4.1%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 (1.8%) Enterococcus faecalis, 2 (0.9%) Enterobacter spp., 2 (0.9%) Morganella morganii and 2 (0.9%) Serratia fonticola. Comparing antibiotic susceptibilities of E. coli isolates by age [</=2 years vs. >2 years] and sex did not show any significant differences. Only 80 (49.1%) of the 163 tested E. coli isolates were found to be susceptible to ampicillin, whereas susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC), ampicillin/sulbactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin was 78.3%, 78.9%, 75.3% and 96.9%, respectively. Parenteral second- and third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and carbapenems were highly active against almost all uropathogens. We conclude that ampicillin should not be used for empirical therapy of paediatric community-acquired UTIs in our region. AMC and oral second-generation cephalosporins cover ca. 80% of uropathogenic E. coli, whilst nitrofurantoin is an appealing option for UTI chemoprophylaxis.
