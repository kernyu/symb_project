KEY MESSAGE: Overexpression of a cotton defense-related gene GbSTK in Arabidopsis resulted in enhancing pathogen infection and oxidative stress by activating multiple defense-signaling pathways. ABSTRACT: Serine/threonine protein kinase (STK) plays an important role in the plant stress-signaling transduction pathway via phosphorylation. Most studies about STK genes have been conducted with model species. However, their molecular and biochemical characterizations have not been thoroughly investigated in cotton. Here, we focused on one such member, GbSTK. RT-PCR indicated that it is induced not only by Verticillium dahliae Kleb., but also by signaling molecules. Subcellular localization showed that GbSTK is present in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. Overexpression of GbSTK in Arabidopsis resulted into the enhanced resistance to V. dahliae. Moreover, Overexpression of GbSTK elevated the expression of PR4, PR5, and EREBP, conferring on transgenic plants enhanced reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity and oxidative stress tolerance. Our results suggest that GbSTK is active in multiple defense-signaling pathways, including those involved in responses to pathogen infection and oxidative stress.
