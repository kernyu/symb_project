Biotransformation is an economically and ecologically viable technology which has been used extensively to modify the structures of many classes of biologically active products. The discovery of novel antimicrobial metabolites from biotransformation is an important alternative to overcome the increasing levels of drug resistance by plant and human pathogens. Monoterpenes, the main constituents of essential oils, are known for their antimicrobial activities. In 2004, Farooq, Atta-Ur-Rahman and Choudhary published a review on fungal transformation of monoterpenes which covers papers published up to 2002. The present review not only updates the previous one but also discusses the antimicrobial activities (antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral) of biotransformed compounds.
