In recent years, the proportion of nosocomial infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) strains has increased significantly, and its resistance to antibiotics is rising. The resistance mechanisms of Ab are complex, which include the integron formation, inactivating or deactivating enzyme, outer membrane permeability, biofilm formation, drug exocytosis mechanism and so on. The biofilm formation by bacteria leads to high resistance and immune evasion ability. The aim of this study is to investigate the resistance and distribution patterns of Ab isolates, and the biofilm formation related genes in Ab isolates in our hospital.
