Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial compounds is increasing at a faster rate than the development of new antibiotics; this represents a critical challenge for clinicians worldwide. Normally, the minimum inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic, the dosage at which bacterial growth is thwarted, provides an effective quantitative measure for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration is conventionally performed by either a serial broth dilution method or with the commercially available Etest((R)) (Biomerieux, France) kit. However, these techniques are relatively labor-intensive and require a significant amount of training. In order to reduce human error and increase operation simplicity, a simple microfluidic device that can perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing automatically via a broth dilution method to accurately determine the minimum inhibitory concentration was developed herein. As a proof of concept, wild-type (ATCC 29212) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus cells were incubated at five different vancomycin concentrations on-chip, and the sample injection, transport, and mixing processes occurred within five reaction chambers and three reagent chambers via the chip's automatic dispensation and dilution functions within nine minutes. The minimum inhibitory concentration values measured after 24h of antibiotic incubation were similar to those calculated using Etest((R)). With its high flexibility, reliability, and portability, the developed microfluidic device provides a simple method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing in an automated format that could be implemented for clinical and point-of-care applications.
