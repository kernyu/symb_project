Whole-genome sequencing of trimethoprim-resistant Escherichia coli clinical isolates identified a member of the trimethoprim-resistant type II dihydrofolate reductase gene family (dfrB). The dfrB4 gene was located within a class I integron flanked by multiple resistance genes. This arrangement was previously reported in a 130.6-kb multiresistance plasmid. The DfrB4 protein conferred a >2,000-fold increased trimethoprim resistance on overexpression in E. coli Our results are consistent with the finding that dfrB4 contributes to clinical trimethoprim resistance.
