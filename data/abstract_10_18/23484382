Development of new mechanisms of resistance and relatively easy and fast transferring of resistance genes between cells have resulted in emergence of large number of multi-drug resistant bacteria in recent years. Therefore, it is important to intensively search for new, effective compounds possessing antibacterial potential and apply them as active ingredients of medicinal products. This procedure may lead to eradication of clinically relevant, dangerous bacteria. In the twentyfirst century, three new classes of antibacterial agents: oxazolidinones, lipopeptides and pleuromutilins were introduced into the therapy. Compounds from the last group, such as tiamulin, were used previously, but only in veterinary. New 18 antimicrobial compounds, belonging to known therapeutic groups, have been registered since 2000. The largest group among antibacterial chemotherapeutics is quinolones. Group of natural compounds includes: new carbapenems, cephalosporins of V generation and other agents, like telithromycin, tigecycline, telavancin and fidaxomicin. This article is a part of the series associated with searching for new antibacterial agents and it relates to new antibiotics and antibacterial chemotherapeutics approved for the world-wide market since 2000. The next parts of this cycle will be devoted to compounds ongoing the clinical trials.
