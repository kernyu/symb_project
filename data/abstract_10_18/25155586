Intermittent preventive treatment of infants (IPTi) reduces early childhood malaria-related morbidity. While genotypic drug resistance markers have proven useful in predicting the efficacy of antimalarial drugs in case management, there are few equivalent data relating to their protective efficacy when used as IPTi. The present data from an IPTi trial in Papua New Guinea demonstrate how these markers can predict protective efficacy of IPTi for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
