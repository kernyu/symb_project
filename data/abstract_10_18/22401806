In addition to development of vaccines and synthetic antiviral drugs, recent studies have advocated the use of natural substances that inhibit or prevent viral infections. High-molecular-weight poly-gamma-glutamate (HM-gamma-PGA) produced by Bacillus subtilis chungkookjang was evaluated for anti-influenza virus activity. HM-gamma-PGA induced type I interferons (IFNs), which in turn stimulated expression of Myxovirus resistant 1 protein and IFN-related proteins in vitro. In the B6.A2G-Mx1 mouse model, which mimics the innate immune system of humans, treatment with HM-gamma-PGA enhanced the antiviral state of mice and protected them against highly pathogenic influenza A virus. Naturally synthesized HM-gamma-PGA has potent anti-influenza activity and may be a useful means for control of influenza virus.
