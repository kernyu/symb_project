The activity of omadacycline and comparators when tested against a subset of Streptococcus pneumoniae from US and European regions of a 2014 global surveillance program (304 isolates) are reported. These MIC results were compared to those obtained when testing S. pneumoniae from 2010 surveillance (1,834 isolates). The omadacycline MIC50/90 for S. pneumoniae (2014) was 0.06/0.06mug/mL, similar to 2010 (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12mug/mL). The omadacycline MIC90 (0.06-0.12mug/mL) was similar for the penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, -resistant, multidrug-resistance (MDR; >/=3 classes), and ceftriaxone nonsusceptible subgroups. Omadacycline MIC90 values were 0.06-0.12mug/mL for S. pneumoniae from the US and Europe. There was a high degree of resistance with doxycycline, erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in both US and EU. For penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, resistance to doxycycline and tetracycline in US/Europe was 64.2/61.0% and 63.8/60.5%, respectively, erythromycin 91.2/75.1, and ceftriaxone 7.3/4.0%. The potent activity of omadacycline against S. pneumoniae indicates that omadacycline merits further study in bacterial pneumonia, especially where MDR may be a concern.
