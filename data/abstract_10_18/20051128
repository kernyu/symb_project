BACKGROUND: Thalidomide based regimen is an effective and well tolerated therapy in multiple myeloma (MM) patients, however, there were a small number of studies written about the results of thalidomide therapy in non-transplant MM patients. We therefore conducted a retrospective study of 42 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM treated with thalidomide- based induction regimens followed by thalidomide maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Induction regimens with thalidomide and dexamethasone, and the oral combination of melphalan, prednisolone and thalidomide were administrated in 22 and 16 patients, respectively. The remaining 4 patients received other thalidomide- containing regimens. Twenty-nine patients received thalidomide as a salvage regimen. Twenty-three out of 26 patients achieving complete remission (CR) and very good partial remission (VGPR) received thalidomide maintenance. Of the 41 evaluable patients, median time of treatment was 21 months (3- 45 months), ORR was 92.7% with a 63.4% CR/VGPR. With a median follow up of 23 months, 3-year- PFS and 3-year-OS were 58.6 and 72.6%, respectively. Median time to progression was 42 months. While 3-year-PFS and 3-year-OS in non-transplant patients receiving thalidomide maintenance therapy were 67 and 80%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged thalidomide therapy enhanced survival rate and less frequently developed serious toxicity in non-transplant multiple myeloma patients.
