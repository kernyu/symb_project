Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrhea among infants and children in developing countries, as well as among travelers to these areas. The major virulence factors of ETEC are the colonization factor antigens (CFAs) and a heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and/or a heat-stable enterotoxin (ST). Among Israeli recruits serving under military field conditions, 107 of all examined isolates expressed LT or ST, and CFAs could be characterized in 68% of the isolates, in which CFAs of the CFA/II group and CS6 were the most prevalent. Additionally, 31% of the 107 ETEC isolates showed resistance to three or more of the antimicrobial agents examined, and the percentage of resistant isolates expressing LT was significantly higher than those expressing ST or LT+ST. These results may be important for development of an effective vaccine and for facilitation of an empirical choice of antibiotic treatment or prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea in this area.
