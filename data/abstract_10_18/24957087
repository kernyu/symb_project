AIM: This work aimed to investigate the ability of different formulations of bioactive glass (BAG)-S53P4 to interfere with bacterial biofilm produced on prosthetic material by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MATERIALS & METHODS: Antibiofilm activity of three formulations of bioglass was assessed at different time points through two different analyses: Crystal Violet and confocal laser scanning microscopy assays. RESULTS: Significant differences in the whole biofilm were observed between BAG-S53P4-treated and control samples, while no marked changes in antibiofilm activity were observed among the tested formulations. Data from colorimetric assay were confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, which evidenced the significant reduction in biomass and a decrease of total cell volume when both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms were treated with BAG-S53P4. CONCLUSION: BAG-S53P4 can be considered as an excellent adjuvant in the treatment of prosthetic infections related to biofilm.
