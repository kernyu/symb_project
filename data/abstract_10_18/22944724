BACKGROUND: Achromobacter xylosoxidans is an emerging pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients recognised as causal agent of inflammation. The prevalence of infection or colonisation is variable among CF centres. We report here the first epidemiological data about A. xylosoxidans in a French CF centre: Dijon, Burgundy. METHODS: All isolates recovered from the patients affiliated with our centre in 2010 since their first visit were included. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method and E-test. Molecular epidemiology was performed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and compared with repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR, DiversiLab(R)). We also sequenced the constitutive bla-oxa-114 gene. RESULTS: Out of 120 patients, 21 (17.5%) had at least one positive culture with A. xylosoxidans since they started to receive routine care in our CF centre (447 isolates). Median age at first positive culture was 16 years (range 3-34 years). Most patients were colonised by their own strain, cross-contamination was very rare. We observed two cases of intra-family spread. DiversiLab(R) is a useful tool as efficient as PFGE to compare isolates recovered simultaneously from different patients when an outbreak is suspected. However, PFGE remains the reference method for long-term survey of chronically colonised patients. We detected new OXA-114 variants and the new oxacillinase OXA-243 (88% amino acid identity with OXA-114). Acquired resistance to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and carbapenems was frequent. In 2010, 7 patients harboured strains resistant to ceftazidime, 6 patients strains with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems (especially meropenem) and 12 patients strains resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: In our centre, the high prevalence of colonisation is not due to cross-contamination. Our main concern is the high rate of antimicrobial resistance.
