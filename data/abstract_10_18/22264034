A series of ureido derivatives incorporating a highly derivatized quinolone scaffold were prepared by a succession of original steps. The lead molecules of these compounds are the quinolone antibacterials of the nalidixic acid/ciprofloxacin type and they target, similar to these clinically used agents, the DNA gyrase/topoisomerase IV of pathogenic bacteria. These new quinolones are claimed to act as efficient antibacterials against a large number of drug-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacteroides bivius, Burkholderia spp., Chlamydia spp., Chlamydophila pneumoniae.
