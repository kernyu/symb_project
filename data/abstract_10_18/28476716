Amino glycosides, one of the important broad-spectrum antibacterials, treat clinically against various bacterial infections. In the last decade, amino glycoside micro arrays have become one of main technologies for analyzing interactions between antibiotics and therapeutic targets in a high-throughput manner. A series of methods have been developed to immobilize amino glycosides on the functional group-coated glass slides in a micro array format. The amino glycoside micro arrays technology has been widely used for rapid determination of interactions of the amino glycosides with ribosome RNAs (rRNA) and proteins. Several clinically used amino glycosides are mainly exerted by binding to bacterial rRNA, which leads to mistranslation of protein. However, amino glycosides are losing efficacy due to the increased resistance mostly caused by enzymes modification. The micro array-based technology is mainly used in developing novel antibiotics, discovering new RNA targets, and identifying inhibitors of resistance-causing enzymes. This review will focus on the construction of amino glycoside micro arrays, their recent status and applications in biological and biomedical research and some challenges in further research.
