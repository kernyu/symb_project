The proposed research outlines a serious common concern of Salmonella resistance to antimicrobials following prolonged exposure to the disinfectants (biocides). These phenotypes of bacteria could potentially result in hard to treat infections. Typical for avian sources, biocide sensitive S. enterica subsp. enterica serovars: Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Virchow and Zanzibar and their isogenic biocide-tolerant variants were studied in order to investigate bacteriostatic effect of two commercially available biocide formulations: potassium peroxymonosulfate (P) and dodecylamine based structure (triamine, D). We found that cultivating of the bacteria in the medium supplemented with a blend containing P did not influence their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. In contrast, tolerance of bacteria to D compound resulted in resistance to co-trimoxazole, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin of which two cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin are used commonly for the treatment of invasive Salmonella infections in humans. The dependency between OMP patterns and the level of Salmonella survival in media containing the biocides was observed merely in serovar Typhimurium. In conclusion, these results suggest that Salmonella strains challenged by prolonged treatment with the disinfectants become resistant to antibiotics, however it depends on Salmonella serovar and the chemical used. This paper also highlights the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a technique that offers great benefits to microbiological detecting of Salmonella species in the samples.
