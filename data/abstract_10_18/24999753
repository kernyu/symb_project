Hepatitis C infection represents a major health problem in Egypt; only 20% of patients undergo spontaneous clearance of the virus and around 25% of all patients progress to develop cirrhosis. More than 90% of Egyptian patients have hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-4. Combined pegylated interferon and oral ribavirin are the current standard therapies for HCV-4. The aim of the work is to evaluate the predictive power of the rs12979860 IL28B SNP and rs12980275 IL28B SNP for treatment response in Egyptian patients infected with HCV genotype 4. One hundred eleven HCV patients receiving combined treatment were studied for rs12979860 and rs12980275 polymorphisms by the restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. The rs12979860 CC and rs12979860 AA genotypes were significantly associated with sustained virological response (p=0.001). Our results suggest that studying IL28B polymorphisms contribute to proper prediction of response to standard therapies in Egyptian patients, optimizing cost effectiveness, and minimizing unneeded adverse effect of therapy.
