Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) can be reliably differentiated by flow cytometry when labeled with nucleic acid dyes. The purpose of this study was to determine if this differentiation can be achieved while labeling with a S. aureus-specific anti-staphylococcal protein A antibody instead of nucleic acid dyes. A total of 103 S. aureus isolates were incubated for 4 h at 37 degrees C in Mueller Hinton broth with and without oxacillin, then stained with anti-staphylococcal protein A antibody, and analyzed by flow cytometry using the Micro PRO instrument. Dot plots (side scatter vs. fluorescence intensity) of isolates exposed to oxacillin were examined to define two gates encompassing the majority of MSSA and MRSA signal events, respectively. The ratio of signal event counts in the two gates was called the gate signal count ratio (GSCR), and its performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The GSCR could differentiate MRSA from MSSA with 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity using a cut-off of 0.6868 when the two gates were defined as follows: gate 1, fluorescence intensity 2-10, side scatter 5-70; gate 2, fluorescence intensity 7-700, side scatter 70-500. MRSA and MSSA can be accurately detected and differentiated by flow cytometry after 4 h of oxacillin exposure when labeled with anti-staphylococcal protein A antibody.
