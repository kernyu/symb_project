Cytomegalovirus infection in kidney transplantation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality through direct and indirect effects. International guidelines had been recently updated, focusing on diagnostic, prevention strategies and curative treatment. Cytomegalovirus-specific immune response plays also an important function in controlling the virus. Here, we propose to present the different components of this specific immune response and the advantages of immune monitoring for patient's management: identification of patients who require a treatment, adaptation of curative treatment length, guidance for resistance genotypic testing.
