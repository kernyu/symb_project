Among a number of laboratory strains of Listeria monocytogenes used in experimental infection, strain LO28 is highly capable of inducing robust beta interferon (IFN-beta) production in infected macrophages. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the IFN-beta-inducing ability of LO28 by comparing it with that of strain EGD, a low-IFN-beta-inducing strain. It was found that LO28 secretes a large amount of IFN-beta-inducing factor, which turned out to be cyclic di-AMP. The secretion of cyclic di-AMP was dependent on MdrT, a multidrug resistance transporter, and LO28 exhibited a very high level of mdrT expression. The introduction of a null mutation into mdrT abolished the ability of LO28 to induce IFN-beta production. Examination of genes responsible for the regulation of mdrT expression revealed a spontaneous 188-bp deletion in tetR of LO28. By constructing recombinant strains of LO28 and EGD in which tetR from each strain was replaced, it was confirmed that the distinct ability of LO28 is attributable mostly to tetR mutation. We concluded that the strong IFN-beta-inducing ability of LO28 is due to a genetic defect in tetR resulting in the overexpression of mdrT and a concomitant increase in the secretion of cyclic di-AMP through MdrT.
