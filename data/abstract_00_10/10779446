The redox properties of iron make this metal a key participant in oxygen-mediated toxicity. Accordingly, L5178Y (LY) mouse lymphoma cell lines, which display a unique inverse cross-sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), are a suitable model for the study of possible differences in the constitutive control of intracellular iron availability. We report here that the level of iron in the cytosolic labile iron pool (LIP), ie, potentially active in the Fenton reaction, is more than 3-fold higher in IR-resistant, H(2)O(2)-sensitive (LY-R) cells than in IR-sensitive, H(2)O(2)-resistant (LY-S) cells. This difference is associated with markedly greater content of ferritin H-subunits (H-Ft) in LY-S than in LY-R cells. Our results show that different expression of H-Ft in LY cells is a consequence of an up-regulation of H-Ft mRNA in the LY-S mutant cell line. In contrast, posttranscriptional control of iron metabolism mediated by iron-responsive element-iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) interaction is similar in the 2 cell lines, although IRP1 protein levels in iron-rich LY-R cells are twice those in iron-deficient LY-S cells. In showing that LY cell lines exhibit 2 different patterns of intracellular iron regulation, our results highlight both the role of high LIP in the establishment of pro-oxidant status in mammalian cells and the antioxidant role of ferritin.
