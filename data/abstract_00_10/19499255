Staphylococci are a leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and bacteremia in France, a country with a high prevalence of oxacillin resistance. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin compared with reference compounds against 445 Staphylococcus aureus and 53 coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) collected during two large nationwide studies performed in 2006 and 2007. The percentage of oxacillin resistance among S. aureus was 13.6% (SSTIs) and 30.7% (bacteremia). Daptomycin showed lower MIC(90) levels compared to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid (0.19 mg/L vs. 2, 1.5, and 1 mg/L, respectively), irrespective of oxacillin susceptibility. Amongst the CNS, 64.2% of the isolates originated from clinical bacteremia were resistant to oxacillin and 24.5% to teicoplanin; all but one Staphylococci were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC = 1.5 mg/l). As with linezolid, daptomycin seems to constitute an alternative option to treat some staphylococcal infections in the French context of high oxacillin resistance prevalence and high glycopeptides MIC.
