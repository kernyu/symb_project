The aim of the study was to evaluate whether IFN-alpha/beta-inducible MxA protein expression in children receiving anticancer treatment can be used as an indicator for virus infections during the febrile episodes. Twenty-six children with mainly hematological malignancies entered the study. Children with laboratory-confirmed virus infections had clearly elevated MxA protein levels compared to their counterparts with bacterial or unknown etiology. MxA protein expression increased moderately following the administration of cytostatic agents, even though these children had no clinical signs of infection.
