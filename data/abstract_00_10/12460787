Sixteen children and young adults were treated with high-dose cyclosporin combined with a combination of cytotoxics (epirubicin, vincristine and etoposide) (EVE) known to be influenced by P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR). Tumour types were neuroblastoma 3, Ewing's sarcoma 2, rhabdomyosarcoma 5, osteosarcoma 3, desmoplastic small round cell tumour 1, nephroblastoma 1, T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 1. All had progressed or relapsed following at least two of the drug types included in EVE. Acute reactions to cyclosporin and myelosuppression were the major toxicities documented. Renal and hepatic toxicity was rarely severe and always transient. Partial responses (PR) were observed in 2 patients (1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1 Ewing's sarcoma). We conclude that this combination is tolerable in heavily pretreated patients and may be suitable for further evaluation in untreated poor risk tumours.
