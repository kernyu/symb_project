This paper provides the biochemical evidence for physical interactions between the outer membrane component, TolC, and the membrane fusion protein component, AcrA, of the major antibiotic efflux pump of Escherichia coli. Cross-linking between TolC and AcrA was independent of the presence of any externally added substrate of the efflux pump or of the pump protein, AcrB. The biochemical demonstration of a TolC-AcrA interaction is consistent with genetic studies in which extragenic suppressors of a mutant TolC strain were found in the acrA gene.
