The main problems of etiotropic therapy for typhoid fever lie in underestimate of the characteristic features of its pathogenesis and particularly in development of typhoid granulomas and their histogenesis, as well as in wide spread of typhoid fever pathogenic strains resistant to the routine chemotherapeutics, i.e. polyresistant strains. Some problems are due to incorrect choice of the antimicrobials and their combinations, optimal doses, administration routes and pathogenetic therapy. In the XXth centure an increase in the emergence and a change in the nature of the typhoid fever pathogen resistance to antimicrobials were observed. It was shown that from the pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic viewpoints the highest efficacy of typhoid fever therapy should be provided by the following antimicrobials: fluoroquinolones (except for norfloxacin), 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, aminopenicillins, chloramhenicol (levomycetin), combinations of 2nd and 3rd generation aminoglycosides with biseptol, aminopenicillins or doxycycline, as well as chloramphenicol combinations with aminopenicillins or 2nd to 4th generation cephalosporins. Practical recommendations for the etiotropic therapy of patients with typhoid fever during its outbreak or epidemic are presented.
