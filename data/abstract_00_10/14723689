AIMS: The changes in structure and composition of faecal coliforms and enterococcal populations in sewage from different treatment plants, and the elimination of vancomycin- and erythromycin-resistant enterococci (VRE and ERE, respectively) in these treatment plants was analysed to determine any selective reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Faecal coliforms, enterococci, VRE, ERE and spores of sulphite-reducing bacteria were enumerated using standard methods. Samples were enriched where necessary in order to isolate antibiotic resistant strains. The structure and composition of these bacterial populations were determined by biochemical fingerprinting and clustering analysis. High diversity and similarity indexes were detected among all the bacterial populations in raw and treated sewage, independently of their origin and the treatment processes employed. Antibiotic resistant strains were detected in all sewage tested and no selective reduction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The faecal coliforms and enterococci populations did not differ in the sewage samples studied. The vancomycin and erythromycin resistances of the enterococcal populations were similar in the sewage samples. Resistance to both antibiotics persisted after the treatment process independently of raw sewage flow, faecal origin or size of the human population contributing to sewage. However, sewage of mixed origin (human and animal) presented a lower similarity index for the two bacterial populations compared with that of the other human sewage analysed. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although a significant reduction in bacterial populations was observed, the persistence of VRE and ERE strains in the same proportions in sewage suggests that there is no selective elimination of bacterial populations during the treatment processes. The ability of antibiotic resistance strains to survive sewage treatment systems should be considered in certain water reuse programmes.
