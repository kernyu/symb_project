In order to expand current knowledge of the types of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains circulating in central Asia, six MRSA strains collected from hospitals in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia during 2000-2002 were examined. Three strains possessed a staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element of type IV c, were sequence type (ST) 154 according to multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and contained lukS-lukF (Panton-Valentine leukocidin). Another three strains contained a SCCmec element of type III and were MLST type ST 239. Using automated ribotyping, the six MRSA strains were divided into four different EcoRI ribotypes, and two groups of isolates were distinguished by means of SmaI-macrorestriction patterns. In comparison to other countries, the incidence of MRSA in Mongolia is low.
