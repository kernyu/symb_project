Sustained CD4+ cell count increases as a result of potent anti-HIV therapy have been credited with a steep drop in many HIV-related conditions. Indeed, the most recent guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections (OIs) reflect the growing practice of stopping preventive and maintenance therapies. While the risk of developing OIs or having them reappear still exists only after therapy fails, the possibility of stopping OI therapy after achieving an improved immune response is promising for many. Unfortunately, despite success with many OIs, declines in the rate of the fungal infection candidiasis have not been observed.
