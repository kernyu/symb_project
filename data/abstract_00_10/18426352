BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection of the colon is a common and well-described clinical entity. Clostridium difficile enteritis of the small bowel is believed to be less common and has been described sparsely in the literature. METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: We describe a patient who had undergone total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis who was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and contracted C. difficile refractory to metronidazole. The enteritis resolved quickly after initiation of combined oral vancomycin and metronidazole. A literature review found that eight of the fifteen previously reported cases of C. difficile-associated small-bowel enteritis resulted in death. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for physicians who treat acolonic patients to be aware of C. difficile enteritis of the small bowel so that it can be suspected, diagnosed, and treated.
