Electrical resistance across human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was measured using an electrical cell sensor system. The transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value was used to estimate the permeability through endothelial cells in vitro. Decrease in the TEER value was associated with increase in the passage of albumin through endothelial cells in the albumin permeability assay. The effects of cytokines and dengue virus infection on the permeability of HUVECs were examined by measuring the TEER value. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) at 1 and 0.1 microg/ml decreased the TEER value, but TNF-alpha at lower dose did not. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) at 1 microg/ml also decreased the TEER value. In contrast, interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10) or interferon-beta (IFN-beta) did not decrease the TEER value. The decrease in the TEER value was associated with the morphological changes of HUVECs. Dengue virus infection at a multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) of 5 pfu/cell decreased the TEER value. Infection at an m.o.i. of 0.5 pfu/cell did not decrease the TEER value; however, addition of 0.01 microg/ml of TNF-alpha to these infected endothelial cells decreased the TEER value. The results suggest that TNF-alpha and dengue virus infection decrease synergistically the TEER value of endothelial cells. The TEER method is easy, reliable and can be applicable to further analysis of the increase in the permeability of endothelial cells in vitro induced by inflammatory cytokines and dengue virus infection.
