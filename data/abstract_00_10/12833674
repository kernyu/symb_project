The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated at the "Hospital de Ninos de Cordoba". The strains were collected from inpatients between January 1996 and July 2000. A total of 150 ESBL producer isolates were detected. During 1996 the prevalence of ESBL producer K. pneumoniae was 20%, but since 1998 the values have increased to approximately 60%. Phenotypic analysis such as isoelectric point (pl) and antibiotyping performed in 32 randomly selected isolates showed two different enzyme profiles: 81% had ESBL with pl = 7.9 and preferential activity against cefotaxime, while 19% showed ESBL with pl = 5.4 and preferential activity against ceftazidime. No isolates resistant to imipenem or ciprofloxacin were detected. Susceptibility to other antimicrobial agents varied, but resistance to gentamicin was strongly associated with ESBL producer isolates. Resistance determinants could be transferred to Escherichia coli by conjugation assays.
