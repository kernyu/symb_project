OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of resistance among 83 Helicobacter pylori isolates cultured from biopsies taken during routine endoscopies in 1998-1999. METHODS: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of amoxicillin, tetracycline, clarithromycin and metronidazole were determined by Epsilometer test. RESULTS: Forty-seven strains (57%) were resistant to metronidazole, and 27 (32.5%) were resistant to clarithromycin. Twenty of the 27 strains resistant to clarithromycin were also resistant to metronidazole. None of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin or tetracycline. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of patients from Bahrain were infected with resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori. Antibiotic resistance monitoring is very important and unified national treatment policies are needed.
