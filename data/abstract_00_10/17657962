Two hundred and seventy-eight M. tuberculosis DNA samples taken from patients with clinically confirmed pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis were studied. Mutations of the rpoB, inhA, katG, and ahpC genes were analyzed by using multiple drug-resistant (MDR) biochips. A hundred and twenty-nine (46%) rifampicin- and isoniazid-sensitive strains and 149 (54%) resistant ones were detected. Out of the 149 drug-resistant strains, resistance to one drug (rifampicin or isoniazid) was revealed in 7 (4.7%) and 48 (32.3%) cases, respectively. The strains simultaneously resistant to both drugs were detected in 94 (63%) cases. In the Republic of Kyrghyzstan, patients with drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis were observed to have more commonly multidrug-resistant strains (63%) than the strains resistant to one drug (rifampicin or isoniazid). In this republic, the main cause of rifampicin resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the Ser531-Leu mutation of the rpoB gene in codon 531 and the Ser315-->Thr of the katG gene in codon 315.
