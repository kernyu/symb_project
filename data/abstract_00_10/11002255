HSV infections are treated efficiently and prevented by acyclovir, although resistant strains have been reported. Resistance to acyclovir involves mainly mutations in the viral gene encoding thymidine kinase; mutations may lead to an altered or, more frequently, deficient TK. These acyclovir-resistant TK deficient strains are not able to reactivate from a latent infection in an experimental model, compared to TK positive strains. A case is reported of a bone marrow transplant child who developed HSV infection at 11 days post-transplantation. Acyclovir-resistant HSV 1 was isolated on day 19 post-transplantation. The patient was cured of his infection. A resistant virus was detected 20 months later that harboured the same TK gene mutation as the first resistant virus. This mutation is an insertion of one guanine in a homopolymer repeat of seven guanines located at codon 146 of TK. It has previously been reported and associated with the expression of a deficient TK activity and the ability to reactivate in mice. These results corroborate the clinical relevance of this mutation, which is associated with acyclovir-resistant recurrent infections in humans.
