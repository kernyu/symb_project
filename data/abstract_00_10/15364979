Three strains of cefotaxime (CTX)-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, FM0209680, FM0300106, and FM0301433, were isolated from transtracheal aspirate cultures of three patients with probable nosocomial infections in a neurosurgery ward in Japan. The CTX MICs for these isolates were greater than 128 microg/ml but were drastically reduced in the presence of 4 microg of clavulanic acid per ml. These strains were also resistant to ceftriaxone, cefpodoxime, and aztreonam but were susceptible to ceftazidime and imipenem. The profile of resistance to various broad-spectrum beta-lactams was transferred by conjugation. Strain FM0209680 was not eradicated from case patient 1 by administration of imipenem, ceftazidime, and levofloxacin, even after a 6-month hospitalization period. Strains FM0300106 and FM0301433 were isolated from case patients 2 and 3 during the sixth week following admission, respectively, and then each patient was colonized for 3 weeks. Eradication of FM0300106 was successfully obtained from case patient 2 by imipenem treatment, while administration of imipenem was continued to prevent pneumonia. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy was discontinued in case patient 3 because of the lack of pneumonic symptoms, and FM0301433 disappeared after the discontinuation of antimicrobial chemotherapy. All three strains carried the bla(CTX-M-2) gene, and the appearance of colonies in the growth-inhibitory zones around disks of CTX and aztreonam in double-disk synergy tests suggested inducible beta-lactamase production in these A. baumannii strains. The ribotyping investigation suggested that all these strains belong to the same clonal lineage. The plasmids harbored by A. baumannii had the same restriction profile as those harbored by Proteus mirabilis strains previously isolated in a urology ward of the Funabashi Medical Center.
