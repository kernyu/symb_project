BamHI, SalI, PstI, and KpnI fragments of pPM1 (B. pseudomallei 12.95 kb plasmid) were cloned in E. coli. The recombinant clones carrying a 7.55 kb KpnI fragment of pPM1 were highly resistant to several aminoglycosides (streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamycin) and fluoroguinolones (perfloxacin, ofloxacin). Two outer membrane proteins (23 and 27 kDa) absent in E. coli and capable to form 120 kDa oligomer complex were detected by the Western blot method in the strain carrying recombinant pS19 plasmid. The integration of a cloned 7.55 kb sequence in the chromosome was observed by the dot and Southern hybridization analysis in the clones carrying recombinant plasmids pS12 and pS14.
