The inappropriate use of antibiotics has contributed to the worldwide problem of antimicrobial resistance. Information on the knowledge, understanding and training of dental practitioners in the use of antibiotics in clinical practice is scarce. This study assessed the level of knowledge of general dental practitioners and the need for educational initiatives. An anonymous postal questionnaire was sent to National Health Service dental practitioners working in 10 Health Authorities in England (1544) and four Health Boards in Scotland (672). Each correct answer to the questionnaire was given a score of one mark; there were 84 questions. The scores for each section of the questionnaire were compared. Responses were received from 1338 (60.4%) of practitioners, of whom 22.1% had attended postgraduate courses in the previous 2 years on antibiotic prescribing. Practitioners who had attended courses had a significantly greater knowledge of antibiotic use (P < 0.05) than those who had not. There was no significant difference in knowledge between all age groups under 60 years of age. There were significant differences in knowledge between dentists practising in English Health Authorities and Scottish Health Boards (P < 0.01). Knowledge was good for clinical signs that are indicators for prescribing antibiotics and for a number of non-clinical factors, e.g. patient expectation. Knowledge of therapeutic prescribing for commonly presenting clinical conditions and prophylactic prescribing for medically compromised patients, however, was generally poor. This study has shown that an urgent review of dental undergraduate and postgraduate education in antibiotic prescribing is required. Provision of prescribing guidelines may improve knowledge and encourage the appropriate use of antibiotics in clinical dental practice.
