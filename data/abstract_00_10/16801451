Retapamulin (SB-275833), the first pleuromutilin to be developed for human topical use, was tested against a selected population of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci. The MIC90 results for retapamulin were 0.12 microg/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and < or = 0.03 microg/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes; no cross-resistance was observed for organism subsets resistant to oxacillin, erythromycin, or mupirocin.
