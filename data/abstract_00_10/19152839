In the recent past, we have found ourselves in need of truly novel antifungal drugs as drug resistance in fungi has been evolving. Moreover, effective therapy has become particularly important as the number of immuno-compromised patients with life-threatening fungal infections increases. Fortunately, during the last few years, virulence factors of fungi and their inhibitors have, at least to some extent, been discovered and characterized. This should provide new options for the development of potential antifungal therapeutics. Inhibitors of the secreted aspartic proteinase of Candida albicans might turn out to be particularly rewarding.
