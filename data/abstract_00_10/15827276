The importation of drug-resistant malaria is a growing public health problem in non-endemic countries. The combination of atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone) has become established as an agent of choice to prevent and treat chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in travelers. We describe the first reported case in North America of genetically confirmed atovaquone/proguanil-resistant P. falciparum malaria. Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of the primary and recrudescent isolates confirmed the acquisition of a point mutation (Tyr268Ser) in the cytochrome b gene of the recrudescent isolate known to confer high-level resistance to atovaquone. Suboptimal therapy may have played a contributory role in the emergence of resistance.
