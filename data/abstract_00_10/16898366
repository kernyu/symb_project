Timely diagnosis and effective, safe treatment are essential to reduce transmission and improve outcomes for patients with tuberculosis. Aside from laboratory methods, many programmatic factors influence the overall turnaround time (TAT) in diagnosing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We measured each step in the overall TAT required for MDR-TB in two of five health districts of Lima, Peru. The total TAT, from initial sputum specimen to diagnosis and appropriate treatment, was 5 months, almost twice as long as the bacteriological procedures per se. Expensive investments in laboratory technology may yield low returns unless the programmatic aspects of the diagnostic process are streamlined at the same time.
