The structure for the complex of nonnucleoside inhibitor TMC125 and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been determined and validated through computation of resistance profiles using Monte Carlo/free-energy perturbation calculations. The good quantitative agreement between the computed and experimental anti-HIV activities for TMC125, nevirapine, and efavirenz with wild-type RT and four common mutants (L100I, K103N, Y181C, and Y188L) confirms the correctness of the predicted structure and provides insights into the improved potency of this novel NNRTI. The blue shading in the figure indicates basic residues.
