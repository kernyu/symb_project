The authors describe a patient successfully treated with unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) for chemotherapy-resistant progressive Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). An 8-month-old boy had LCH diagnosed based on the histologic examination of skin lesions. Despite intensive chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the disease was progressive, with organ dysfunction. He received unrelated CBT after a conditioning regimen consisting of total body irradiation, etoposide, and melphalan. He was in complete remission 12 months after the transplantation. The authors suggest that CBT could be considered in the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-resistant progressive LCH, especially if there are no available human leukocyte antigen-matched family donors.
