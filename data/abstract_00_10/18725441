We evaluated the in vitro activities of tigecycline and 10 other antibiotics against clinical isolates of nonpigmented rapidly growing mycobacteria. Fifteen collection strains and 165 clinical isolates were included in the study. Tigecycline showed the highest activity among all antibiotics studied: all the strains were inhibited by 1 mg/liter.
