The objective of the present work was to study microflora in the middle ear of 100 patients aged from 30 to 70 years presenting with chronic purulent otitis media (CPOM) by microbiological and genetic (PCR) methods. An important role of persistence factors, pathogenicity, and microbial antibiotic resistance in the development of CPOM was demonstrated. The frequency of occurrence of herpes and papilloma viruses was estimated. The most common form of the mixed infection was two-component virobacterial associations (46.2%). Three-component associations of viruses with bacteria (Chlamydiae or Mycoplasmas) formed less frequently (34.6%). In 19.2% of the cases, yeast-like fungi of the genus Candida were identified in these associations.
