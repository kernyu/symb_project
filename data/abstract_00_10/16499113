The study was undertaken to define the main causes of nosocomial infection and the possible ways of its prevention in a resuscitation and intensive care unit (RICU). In 1999 to 2004, intensive therapy was performed in 408 patients (244 males and 163 females) aged 18 to 60 years (54%) and above 60 years (45%) who had severe surgical infection (severe sepsis). Most patients aged over 60 years had one concomitant disease or more. Wound biopsy specimens were bacteriologically tested for the microflora. If there were clinical indications, cavitary puncture specimens, urine and blood samples were also bacteriologically tested. Wound discharges were cultured on liquid and solid nutrient media. Microbial sensitivity to antibacterial agents was estimated by the agar diffusion method using standard paper disks. Bacteriological monitoring was made in 408 patients with surgical infection in RICU in 1999 to 2004. The task of this monitoring was to analyze changes in the microbial picture and to determine the antimicrobial activity of antibacterial agents, and to detect resistant strains of the microflora. Analysis of the results of the bacteriological monitoring makes it possible to develop effective starting and programmed antibacterial therapy and to prevent the development of nosocomial infection in patients in RICU.
