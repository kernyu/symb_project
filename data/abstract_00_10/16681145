A rapid and simple microdilution technique on 96-well microplate based on turbidimetry was optimized and validated for screening of antimicrobial activity against erythromycin-resistant bacterial strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus simulans isolated from Finnish patients. Using S. pyogenes ATCC 12351 as reference strain the developed method was evaluated by reproducibility measurements and using parameters typically employed for screening methods, i.e. signal-to-background, signal-to-noise and a screening-window coefficient, the Z' factor. The method was further used for screening a group of natural compounds and their synthetic derivatives against resistant bacterial strains. Of these, octyl and dodecyl gallates, and usnic and ursolic acids were the most active. The described method is a rapid, homogeneous, cost-effective and easy-to-perform system for screening of new potential antimicrobial agents in drug discovery.
