BACKGROUND/AIMS: The rapid decline in hepatitis C virus RNA is crucial for determining the outcome of therapy in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. However, the variables influencing the early phase of viral decay are still largely unexplored. We aimed to assess which pre-treatment variable may predict rapid virologic response (RVR) and sustained virologic response (SVR). METHODS: We evaluated 90 consecutive non-diabetic patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C without cirrhosis, treated with peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin. Viral load (COBAS Amplicore, Roche) was measured at 1, 4 and 12 weeks after starting treatment, and then 24 weeks after the end of treatment. RESULTS: The overall SVR was 47%. The SVR in patients with RVR was 100%. Age, GGT levels, viral load, steatosis, fibrosis and HOMA-IR were significantly associated with RVR in univariate analysis. After logistic regression, HOMA-IR proved to be the strongest independent predictor of RVR (OR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16-0.89; p=0.027), whereas fibrosis had a weaker independent association with RVR (OR 0.32, 95% CI: 0.1-1.04; p=0.057). Among the eight pre-treatment variables, both BMI and steatosis were significantly associated with HOMA-IR, either in univariate or in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that insulin resistance is strongly associated with RVR, thus reflecting the important role played by metabolic factors in the early phase of viral kinetics. HOMA-IR would appear to be a useful tool in predicting RVR and should be evaluated at baseline in all chronic hepatitis C patients before initiating antiviral treatment.
