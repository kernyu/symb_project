The need for salvage treatment is related to the imperfection of current antiretroviral therapy. Sequential therapy with suboptimally suppressive regimens results in a need for this intervention. The aim of salvage treatment is as yet uncertain; virological suppression; immunoenhancement or stability or avoidance of clinical disease. Therapeutic options are constantly improving and the knowledge base concerning individual agents and different combinations comprising highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) regimens increases daily. The utility of new agents in salvage appears vital with numbers of new or recycled agents to which no demonstrable resistance exists is a major predictive factor of a positive outcome in this setting. Patient commitment, physician knowledge and an informed supportive environment are also conducive to success in salvage treatment.
