OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility in neonates with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected from 1173 neonates with LRTL between January 2005 and December 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed after bacteria had been identified. RESULTS: A total of 707 pathogenic strains (60.3%) were identified, including 521 (73.7%) Gram-negative bacilli, 106 (15.0%) Gram-positive bacilli, and 80 (11.3%) fungi. E Coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacilli were common cultured Gram-negative bacilli. Most strains of Gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, the fourth generation cephalosporin, cebfoperazone/sulbactam and amikacin. Staphylococcus aureus and coagula-negative staphylococci (CNS) were common in the cultured Gram-positive bacilli. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS were susceptible to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam but were resistant to Penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli predominate the pathogens of LRTI in neonates. E Coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are major pathogens.
