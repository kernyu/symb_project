This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Chinese food products. The prevalence of these pathogens was 3.46%, 5.79%, 7%, 0.24%, and 0%, respectively. Raw meats were mainly contaminated with Salmonella (39/365, 10.7%), L. monocytogenes (26/365, 7.1%), and S. aureus (40/365, 11%), while cooked food products were mainly contaminated with L. monocytogenes (45/384, 11.7%) followed by S. aureus (12/384, 3.1%), and raw milk was mainly contaminated with S. aureus (34/209, 16.3%) and Salmonella (4/209, 1.9%). Antimicrobial resistance was evaluated in Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus. Antimicrobial resistance for L. monocytogenes was most frequently observed for cefotaxime (51/72, 70.8%) followed by furazolidone (40/72, 55.6%). Multiple resistance (resistance to >or=2 antibiotics) was observed for 63.9% (46/72) of L. monocytogenes isolates. Resistance of Salmonella was most frequently observed to amoxicillin (11.6%), ticarcilline (11.6%), cephalothin (11.6%), and cefuroxime (11.6%). Multiple resistance was observed for 16.3% (7/43) of the Salmonella isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to penicillin (93.1%) followed by tetracycline and oxacillin COAG (49.4% and 37.9%, respectively). About 79% (69/87) of S. aureus isolated demonstrated multiple resistance. The data showed that raw meat, cooked food products, and raw milk were most commonly contaminated with foodborne pathogens and many pathogens were resistant to different antibiotics. The study provided useful information for assessment of the possible risk posed to Chinese consumers, which has significant public health impact in China.
