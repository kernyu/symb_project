AIM: We studied tuberculosis drug-resistance cases related to risk factors involved, in Mures district. METHODS: We used clinical files of 91 patients with tuberculosis drug resistance from 2006 at all, diagnosed during 2002-2006 at the Ambulatory department of Tuberculosis Clinic in Tg. Mures town and cities nearby. RESULTS. Mycobacterium drug resistance is more frequent at men (96.8%), because of multiple tuberculosis risk factors involved, also is more frequent in rural areas (52.8%) because of low access to medical services. Drug resistance rate have a direct growing related to number of treatments made before, at patients with therapeutic failure and chronic cases. In our study, first year was dominated by single drug resistance to NIH, with a decrease in 2004 and no cases in 2006; and also multi-drug resistance was placed on the first place by frequency in 2006. CONCLUSIONS: We sustain the needs to intensify the general efforts on tuberculosis early diagnosis, also to increase the medical education on all levels, government financial support and trained staff a good monitoring program during tuberculosis evolution in specific centers of diagnostic and treatment of multi-drug resistance cases in Mures district.
