The threat of antibacterial resistance continues to increase globally, and therapeutic options for the treatment of some serious infectious diseases are diminishing. The carbapenems are a potent class of broad-spectrum drugs, and their stability against hydrolysis by many important beta-lactamases make them an important weapon in the treatment of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial pathogens. This review focuses on four carbapenems of clinical importance in the USA: imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem and doripenem. After a historical review of carbapenem development, these four carbapenems are evaluated based on their mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, potency, pharmacodynamics, clinical pharmacokinetics, clinical profiles and toxicity issues.
