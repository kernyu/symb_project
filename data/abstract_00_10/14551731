A highly efficient and reproducible transformation system for rice ( Oryza sativa L. cv. Taipei 309) was developed using microprojectile bombardment of highly regenerative, green tissues. These tissues were induced from mature seeds on NB-based medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and high concentrations of cupric sulfate under dim light conditions; germinating shoots and roots were completely removed. Highly regenerative, green tissues were proliferated on the same medium and used as transformation targets. From 431 explants bombarded with transgenes [i.e. a hygromycin phosphotransferase ( hpt) gene plus one of a wheat thioredoxin h ( wtrxh), a barley NADP-thioredoxin reductase ( bntr), a maize Mutator transposable element ( mudrB) or beta-glucuronidase ( uidA; gus) gene], 28 independent transgenic events were obtained after an 8- to 12-week selection period, giving a 6.5% transformation frequency. Of the 28 independent events, 17 (61%) were regenerable. Co-transformation of the second introduced transgene was detected in 81% of the transgenic lines tested. Stable integration and expression of the foreign genes in T(0) plants and T(1) progeny were confirmed by DNA hybridization, western blot analyses and germination tests.
