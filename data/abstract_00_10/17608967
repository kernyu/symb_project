Resistance to the benzimidazole class of anthelmintics in nematodes of veterinary importance has a long history. Research into the mechanisms responsible for this resistance is subsequently at a more advanced stage than for other classes of anthelmintics. The principal mechanism of resistance to benzimidazoles is likely to involve changes in the primary structure of beta-tubulins, the building blocks of microtubules. Specifically, point mutations in the beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene leading to amino acid substitutions in codons 167, 198, and 200 of the protein have been associated with resistance in nematodes. These single nucleotide polymorphisms offer a means of detecting the presence of resistance within populations. In this mini-review, we focus on the prevalence and importance of these polymorphisms in three groups of nematodes: trichostrongylids, cyathostomins, and hookworms. A brief overview of existing strategies for genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms is also presented. The CARS initiative hopes to exploit these known polymorphisms to further our understanding of the phenomenon of BZ resistance.
