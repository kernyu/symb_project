T-3811ME (BMS-284756) is a new des-F(6)-quinolone with high levels of activity against gram-positive bacteria, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) strains. T-3811, the free base of T-3811ME, exhibited potent activity against 28 clinical strains of PRSP isolated clinically (MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited, 0.0625 microg/ml). After the intravenous dosing of T-3811ME (20 mg/kg of body weight as T-3811) in rabbits with meningitis caused by PRSP, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of T-3811 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 5.79 microg. h/ml and was 4.5-fold higher than that of T-3811in the CSF of rabbits without meningitis. In addition, the AUC/MIC for T-3811ME (20 mg/kg as T-3811) in CSF was 185, which was 4.3-fold higher than that for ceftriaxone (administered intravenously at 100 mg/kg). After the administration of any dose of T-3811ME (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg as T-3811), the viable cell counts in CSF decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In particular, after dosing of 20 mg/kg (as T-3811), the viable cell counts in CSF were significantly less than those in the nontreated group (P < 0.01). By histopathological evaluation, 6 h after the administration of T-3811ME (20 mg/kg as T-3811), the thickening of the cerebral meninx and the infiltration of neutrophils into the cerebral meninx were less severe in the treated group than in the nontreated group. T-3811ME (BMS-284756) may be expected to be evaluated for the management of meningitis caused by highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
