This was a retrospective, multi-center study of patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, after failing to respond to >2 days of outpatient macrolide therapy. 122 cases, treated between 2000-2004, were enrolled from 31 North American sites between January 2004 - March 2005. Non-susceptible isolates (predominately low-level resistance: erythromycin MICs of 1-16 mcg/ml) were recovered from 87 patients (71%). Bacteremia was present in 63 patients (52%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 5.7 %; all 7 patients who died were bacteremic, 6 had a non-susceptible isolate. We report here the largest series of macrolide failures published to date. The patients were notable for their high rates of macrolide resistance, bacteremia, and mortality. High-level macrolide resistance remains rare among US patients failing outpatient macrolides. The majority of cases and virtually all of the mortality occurred in patients with low-level resistant strains.
