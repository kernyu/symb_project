Lipid A deacylase PagL, which detoxifies endotoxin, is latent in Salmonella enterica. This study determined the biological significance of this latency. PagL latency was beneficial for bacteria in producing a robust permeation barrier through lipid A modifications under host-mimetic conditions that induced the modification enzymes, including PagL.
