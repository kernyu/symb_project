Lamivudine (Epivir, GlaxoSmithKline) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis B in 1998, and has since been shown to be of benefit to selected patients with chronic hepatitis B. Drug resistance is the main issue encountered during therapy, with lamivudine resistant mutants emerging at a rate of approximately 15 to 30% per year of therapy. These mutants are associated with relapse of hepatitis, and occasionally hepatic decompensation. Despite this, therapeutic indications and guidelines for lamivudine therapy have now been drawn up, which indicate that lamivudine will be the first line therapy for hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B patients, although its role in hepatitis B e antigen-negative patients remains controversial.
