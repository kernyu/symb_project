We describe a 58-year-old male diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) who failed to have a cytogenetic response to interferon-alpha and hydroxyurea. On subsequent therapy with imatinib mesylate he failed to have any cytogenetic response but also developed a complex clonal evolution with an additional Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and trisomy 8 respectively in two Ph-positive subclones. The addition of cytosine arabinoside to imatinib resulted in reversion to single Ph-chromosome positivity with the disappearance of the previous additional clonal abnormalities. The case demonstrates the efficacy of combined treatment with imatinib and cytarabine in the management of CML resistant to single agent imatinib.
