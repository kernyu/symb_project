Approximately 10% of hospital in-patients in the UK acquire nosocomial infection, with an increasing number of these infections caused by multiresistant organisms. It is essential to halt the development and spread of antibiotic resistance among hospital pathogens. The relationship between antibiotic use and the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms is a subject of ongoing controversy and research. However, there is a general acceptance that control of antibiotic prescribing within hospitals is fundamental to controlling the development of nosocomial antibiotic resistance. In order to achieve this, there is a need to design and successfully implement targeted antibiotic policies based on local patterns of resistance. Traditional educational methods used alone for executing such policies have not been shown to be effective. Computer-based technology shows great promise but will require considerable resource allocation for its installation. Of equal importance, the Infection Control Team must be given a high profile. Robust surveillance systems to gather epidemiological data on local prescribing practices, hospital infection control policy compliance, antibiotic resistance and hospital infection rates need to be set up within individual hospitals. The appointment of an anti-infective pharmacist should be considered. Delivery of an integrated antibiotic and infection control service requires a co-ordinated, multidisciplinary team approach with clear leadership. Finally, in order for any strategy to be successful, the full support of hospital management is essential.
