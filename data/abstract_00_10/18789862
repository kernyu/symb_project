A series of new amino functionalized 1,2,4-trioxepanes 8-16 and ester functionalized 1,2,4-trioxepanes 17-19 have been synthesized and evaluated against multi-drug resistant Plasmodium yoelii in Swiss mice. Amino functionalized trioxepanes 14, the most active compound of the series, showed 100% clearance of parasitaemia by oral route on day 4 and 75% protection to the treated mice beyond day 28.
