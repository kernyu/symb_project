The resistance rates of ampicillin/sulbactam 2:1 against imipenem-susceptible and -resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were 23.5 and 30%, respectively. Ceftazidime/sulbactam combination showed significant reduction of resistant rates against Enterobacter cloacae, A. baumannii, ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae. MIC90 of cefoperazone against E. cloacae, Serratia marcescens, A. baumannii and ESBL K. pneumoniae were > 128 mg/l. Addition of sulbactam enhanced the antimicrobial activities significantly. When imipenem was combined with sulbactam, the resistant rates against imipenem-resistant A. baumanni were significantly reduced. Cefepime/sulbactam combination was active against imipenem-resistant A. baumanni. The resistance rates of aztreonam/sulbactam combination against E. cloacae, imipenem-sensitive and resistant A. baumannii, ESBL K. pneumoniae were lowered significantly. The cefotaxime/sulbactam combination showed a significant improvement of activities against E. cloacae, S. marcescens, A. baumannii and ESBL K. pneumoniae.
