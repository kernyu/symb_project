Antibiotic resistance poses a serious threat to the successful treatment of hospitalized patients. Micro-organisms that produce carbapenamases, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenamases (KPCs) represent the next step in the continuously emerging problem of antibiotic resistance. Restrictions on antibiotic use plus optimal adherence to infection control measures will be crucial to limit the spread of KPC in hospitals in the Netherlands in the coming years.
