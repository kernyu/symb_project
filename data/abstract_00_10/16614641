The patient was a 38-year-old man. He had been suffering from hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) for approximately 20 years. He had active lesions at both axillas, hip, scrotum, and perineum, and inactive lesions located behind the ears, lower abdomen, and posterior neck. He was monitored and treated at different branches; he continuously used antibiotics and was given steroids at times. Antibiotic resistance developed subsequently. His general situation was bad; vital signs were poor; and he was in a state of sepsis and preshock, so this case was regarded as life-threatening. Total excision was performed first on the lesion at the right axilla, then on the lesion at the left axilla, and the parascapular fasciocutaneous flap was reversed. A skin graft was applied to the triangular defect on the scapula. No relapse occurred. Then the lesions at the hip were managed. Broad excision was used twice with the patient under general anesthesia; because the lesions spread to the retrococcygeal and gluteal muscles, coccyx resection and partial gluteal muscle resection were implemented. The defect was eliminated with a progressive flap. At the intergluteal sulcus, small lesions emerging at the median line were debrided with the patient under local anesthesia, and together with secondary recovery, the disease was completely managed. Lesions at the perineum and scrotum and at both inguinal areas were broadly excised and grafted. No lesion has relapsed so far. One year later, Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed, and the patient was treated with chemoradiotherapy easily, because there was no infective focus. The disease is in remission now. The patient weighs 110 kg, is healthy, and is working again.
