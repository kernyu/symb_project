Drug susceptibility tests were performed with a series of Candida spp. in media supplemented with serum or bile. The azole susceptibilities of several medically important Candida spp., including C. albicans but not C. parapsilosis, were significantly reduced in supplemented media. These findings have important implications for the mechanisms of acquired azole resistance in pathogenic fungi.
