Infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are among the most difficult to treat, Efforts toward the development of cephalosporin antimicrobial agents with activity against MRSA have been ongoing for the last decade. In spite of advancement of several potential drugs into clinical trials no such drugs are available for anti-MRSA therapy yet. The recent emergence of MRSA strains resistant to vancomycin, which is the treatment of choice for MRSA infection, has made the clinical need for new effective drugs even more pressing. In the present review structure-activity relationships are discussed with an emphasis on anti-MRSA activity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in animal models. Clinical trial status of promising drug candidates is also provided where available.
