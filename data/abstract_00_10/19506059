Screening of Salmonella mutants for the ability to increase beta-lactam resistance has led to the identification of a mutation in hns, which codes for the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS). In this study, we report that H-NS modulates multidrug resistance through repression of the genes that encode the AcrEF multidrug efflux pump in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
