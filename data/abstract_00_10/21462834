In Romania, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates are currently typed by antimicrobial resistance profiles and phage typing, as part of the national laboratory-based surveillance system of human enteric infections. The aim of the present study was to assess the added value of complementing this approach with molecular fingerprinting, namely pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA). Thirty-six S. Typhimurium isolates received by the Reference Center for Human Salmonella Infections for confirmation and typing from the Microbiology Departments of three Public Health Authorities, were selected for this study. Phage typing revealed that 14 isolates (39%) were nontypeable (NT). Twenty-two isolates were assigned to 5 phage types: DT193 (11 isolates), U302 (7 isolates), DT116 (2 isolates), DT41 (1 isolate) and DT86 (1 isolate). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that all the NT and DT116 isolates were multidrug resistant and extended-spectrum betalactamase producers. All the examined isolates were typeable when using the molecular approach. Both methods gave conclusive and comparable results, documenting the genetic relatedness and discriminating the outbreak isolates from sporadic cases. We conclude that in order to improve outbreak investigation and surveillance of salmonellosis in Romania, the current routine typing of Salmonella isolates should be complemented with at least one of these DNA fingerprinting methods.
