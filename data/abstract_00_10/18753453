This study was conducted to compare the presence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Campylobacter, Salmonella spp., and other enteric bacteria between chickens and guinea fowls. Birds were reared on enclosed concrete floor housing covered with pine wood shavings litter material. Chicken (n = 40) and guinea fowl (n = 40) carcasses, drinking water (10 mL; n = 40), and litter (10 g; n = 40) were aseptically collected randomly from a poultry farm and analyzed within 1 h of collection. Individual pens served as experimental units and were replicated twice. Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and other enterobactericeae were isolated and identified using standard selective media and biochemical tests. Isolates were tested for sensitivity to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and colistin using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test. Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. were isolated from 28 and 35% of whole carcass rinses of chickens and from 18 and 23% of whole carcass rinses of guinea fowl, respectively. Although only Salmonella spp. were recovered from drinking water, both Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. were recovered from litter material. Campylobacter upsaliensis was recovered only in the guinea fowl, whereas Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter sakazakii were recovered only in chickens. Although no antibiotic resistance was determined in Campylobacter upsaliensis, most Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli isolates from both chickens and guinea fowl were resistant to antibiotics such as ampicillin, kanamycin, erythromycin, and nalidixic acid.
