We describe the synthesis and antibacterial properties of a novel antimicrobial peptidyl derivative, (2S)-2-(Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-arginyl-leucylamido-1-[(E)-cinnamoylamido]-3-met hylbutane, structurally based upon the inhibitory centre of the human cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin C. The derivative, here called Cystapep 1, displayed antibacterial activity against several clinically important gram-positive bacteria. It displayed minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of about 16 microg/ml for both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In radial agar diffusion assays, groups A, B, C and G streptococci as well as staphylococci were generally susceptible to the action of Cystapep 1, whereas pneumococci and enterococci were less susceptible. No activity against gram-negative bacteria was observed. Cystapep 1 also showed high activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and multiantibiotic-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), suggesting that its mechanism of action differs from those of most currently used antibiotics.
