MICs were determined for an investigational ketolide, CEM-101, and azithromycin, telithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, clindamycin, and linezolid against 36 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 5 Mycoplasma genitalium, 13 Mycoplasma hominis, 15 Mycoplasma fermentans, and 20 Ureaplasma isolates. All isolates, including two macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae isolates, were inhibited by CEM-101 at < or = 0.5 microg/ml, making CEM-101 the most potent compound tested.
