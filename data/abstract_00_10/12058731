We investigated the in vitro activity of terbinafine against fresh veterinary isolates of Microsporum canis and the potential of this organism to develop resistance in vivo during oral therapy. Dermatophyte cultures (n = 300) were obtained from naturally infected cats and dogs undergoing oral therapy with terbinafine or griseofulvin. M. canis comprised 92% of isolates; other species included Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of terbinafine and griseofulvin were determined by broth macrodilution assay. Terbinafine was highly active against all three species with MIC90< or =0.03 microg ml(-1), in agreement with published data. However, terbinafine exhibited primary cidal activity against 66% of Microsporum isolates (n = 275) in contrast to the almost complete cidal effect in Trichophyton (n = 18). Griseofulvin was significantly less active than terbinafine (MIC90 = 4 microg ml(-1)) but had a primary cidal action on about 40% of the isolates. The data were analysed for changes in MIC and MFC during the course of therapy, which could be indicative for development of acquired resistance. Oral treatment of 37 animals with terbinafine for up to 39 weeks caused no increase in MIC or MFC of terbinafine, either in individual patients or in the whole group.
