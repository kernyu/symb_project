The question of whether levofloxacin includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa in its spectrum of clinical activity is discussed by reviewing the major findings on this issue, mainly those published in Italy. The in vitro activity of levofloxacin against P. aeruginosa is now documented on thousands of strains worldwide. The pharmacodynamic properties of levofloxacin allow for the treatment of pseudomonal infections. The levofloxacin clinical results extrapolated from published studies document the efficacy of levofloxacin in the treatment of infections sustained by P. aeruginosa.
