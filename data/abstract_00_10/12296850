A T helper (Th) 1 immune response is important for host defense against tuberculosis. The multidrug resistance protein (Mrp) 1 is constitutively present at low levels on Th2 lymphocytes, and is expressed on Th1 lymphocytes upon activation. To determine the role of Mrp1 in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, Mrp1 deficient (-/-) and normal wild type mice were intranasally infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. At 2 weeks after infection, Mrp1(-/-) mice had reduced levels of the Th1 cytokine interferon-gamma and an impaired granuloma formation in their lungs. At 5 weeks postinfection, M. tuberculosis outgrowth was enhanced in lungs and livers of Mrp1(-/-) mice. A more prolonged observation of these mice, up to 4 months, revealed no differences in survival or mycobacterial outgrowth. These data suggest that Mrp1 plays an early but dispensable role in the protective immune response to pulmonary tuberculosis.
