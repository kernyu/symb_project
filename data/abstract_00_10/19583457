Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of vancomycin (VCM) and teicoplanin (TEIC) were measured using a novel susceptibility test based on the chemiluminescence assay method (CA) (Rapid-Lumi Eiken; Eiken Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) against 84 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, consisting of 82 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) from clinical isolated, S. aureus Mu3 involving beta-lactam antibiotic induced vancomycin (VCM) resistant MRSA (BIVR) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ATCC 29213. The results were in good accordance with the values determined by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI): i.e., 100% (84/84) of consistency for VCM and 95% (80/84) for TEIC, respectively. In addition, BIVR strains were properly estimated from the results of the CA method and using the BIVR detection method with Mu3 agar (Mu3 Agar method), even though the incubation times was very short (2-4 h). In conclusion, it was found that the new method is reliable and rapid to detect BIVR strains in clinical laboratories.
