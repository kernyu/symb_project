Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Selection of mutant Plasmodium falciparum malaria strains under drug pressure has led to the development of drug resistance. There is a pressing need for effective, safe, practicable drug combinations that hve lower selection pressure. A review of the mein drug combinations, which are recently registered or are still under development, was undertaken, with special attention to the atovaquone-proguanil and artemether-lumefantrine combination.
