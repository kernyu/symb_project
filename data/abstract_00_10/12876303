Both insulin resistance and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to play essential pathophysiological roles in cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. However, the mechanistic link between ROS, such as H2O2 and insulin resistance in the vasculature, remains undetermined. Akt, a Ser/Thr kinase, mediates various biological responses induced by insulin. In this study, we examined the effects of H2O2 on Akt activation in the insulin-signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In VSMCs, insulin stimulates Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. Pretreatment with H2O2 concentration- and time-dependently inhibited insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation with significant inhibition observed at 50 microM for 10 min. A ROS inducer, diamide, also inhibited insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation. In addition, H2O2 inhibited insulin receptor binding partially and inhibited insulin receptor autophosphorylation almost completely. However, pretreatment with a protein kinase C inhibitor, GF109203X (2 microM), for 30 min did not block the inhibitory effects of H2O2 on insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that protein kinase C is not involved in the inhibition by H2O2. We conclude that ROS inhibit a critical insulin signal transduction component required for Akt activation in VSMCs, suggesting potential cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance, which would require verification in vivo.
