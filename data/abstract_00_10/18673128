Cefepime is a semi-synthetic fourth generation cephalosporin with broader Gram-positive and excellent Gram-negative bacterial coverage. Its extended anti-microbial activity and infrequent tendency to develop resistance makes it popular for treatment of infections due to multi-drug resistant organisms. It has good efficacy against beta-lactamase and ESBL (extended spectrum beta-lacatamase)-secreting pathogens, and it has shown great promise in management of children with severe and nosocomial infections. It possesses superior bactericidal action compared to other cephalosporins and is a cheaper and safe alternative to the carbapenems. It is well-tolerated but needs dose adjustments in newborns, and in children with renal insufficiency. Cefepime is a valuable antibiotic but it should be used judiciously as unnecessary, improper and prolonged use may lead to emergence of cefepime-insensitive bacteria and risk of drop in the efficacy of cefepime. Various recent patents of cefepime have been launched which deal with improvements in its preparation, and with its combinations with beta-lactamase inhibitors and newer antibiotics such as linezolid. These developments may further augment the usefulness of cefepime in pediatric infections.
