Three mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance predominate in bacteria: antibiotic inactivation, target site modification, and altered uptake by way of restricted entry and/or enhanced efflux. Many of these involve enzymes or transport proteins whose activity can be targeted directly in an attemptto compromise resistance and, thus, potentiate antimicrobial activity. Alternatively, novel agents unaffected by these resistance mechanisms can be developed. Given the ongoing challenge posed by antimicrobial resistance in bacteria, targeting resistance in this way may be our best hope at prolonging the antibiotic era.
