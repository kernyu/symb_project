Periprosthetic infections are life-threatening complications that occur in about 6% of medical device insertions. Stringent sterile techniques have reduced the incidence of infections, but many implant patients are at high risk for infection, especially the elderly, diabetic, and immune compromised. Moreover, because of low vascularity at the site of the new implant, antibiotic prophylaxis is often not effective. To address this problem, we designed a covalent modification to titanium implant surfaces to render them bactericidal. Specifically, we aminopropylated titanium, a widely used implant material and extended a tether by solid phase coupling of ethylene glycol linkers, followed by solid phase coupling of vancomycin. Vancomycin covalently attached to titanium still bound soluble bacterial peptidoglycan, reduced Staphylococcus aureus colony-forming units by 88% +/- 16% over 2 hr, and retained antibacterial activity upon a repeated challenge.
