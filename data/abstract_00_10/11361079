In the present study we report that 4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopentan-1-one (DHCP), which is derived from heat-treatment of uronic acid or its derivatives, has antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The compound causes complete growth inhibition at 350 microM concentration. We have cloned a gene from E. coli, which confers DHCP resistance when present in multicopy. The putative protein encoded by this gene (dep- DHCP efflux protein) is a transmembrane efflux protein with a high homology to other antibiotic-efflux proteins including those for chloramphenicol, bicyclomycin and tetracycline. However, the Dep protein does not confer cross-resistance to any of the antibiotics tested.
