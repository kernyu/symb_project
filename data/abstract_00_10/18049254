Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and certain gram-negative bacilli, are transmitted most frequently in acute care facilities. However, these MDROs have important infection control implications for care provided in the home setting. Little is known about the actual occurrence of MDROs among home care and hospice patients. To date, no published reports have described transmission of an MDRO from care provided in the home setting. Nonetheless, all providers of care in the home should be aware of MDROs and the potential for their transmission from one patient to another. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Guideline on the Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings, 2006 provides recommendations for preventing and controlling the transmission of MDROs. This article discusses the Guideline's recommendations and how they may be implemented in the home setting by home health agencies, home infusion providers, hospices, and providers of durable medical equipment.
