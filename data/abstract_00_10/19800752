Data from an 800-bed hospital showed an increase in the incidence density of ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli, from 13.1 to 21.7 per 100 000 inpatient days over a 4-year period. Detailed testing performed on 54 E. coli isolates showed bla(CTX-M) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes (n = 37) and bla(CMY-like)ampC genes (n = 15). Typing data showed only limited clonal transmission in isolates with ESBL.
