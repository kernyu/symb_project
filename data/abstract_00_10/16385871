New and potent drugs are urgently needed for the salvage therapy of HIV-infected patients. The protease inhibitors Tipranavir and TMC114, which have high potency against multidrug-resistant viral strains, are the most promising drugs for the near future. How important they will be in salvage therapy cannot be predicted at this time. New points of attack in the viral replication cycle have been defined. Substances belonging to the groups of integrase and maturation inhibitors are in the early stages of clinical development.
