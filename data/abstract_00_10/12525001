Dysbiotic manifestations in the gastrointestinal tract are widely spread. They are characterized by a prolonged, persistent course with the tendency to transition to the chronic form and poorly respond to corrective treatment. The occurrence of high concentrations is 70% for Klebsiella oxytoca, while for K. pneumoniae--within the limit of 30%. The most topical problem is colonization of the intestinal mucosa in children aged up to 1 year by Klebsiella, the seeded bacteria retaining their capacity for growth for up to 2-3 years despite the use of probiotics. As shown in this study, the occurrence of Klebsiella and the level of the antilysozyme and "antiinterferon" activity of these bacteria, their resistance to antimicrobial preparations increase, correlating with the level of dysbiotic disturbances.
