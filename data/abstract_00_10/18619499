The Red recombinase system of bacteriophage Lambda has been used to inactivate chromosomal genes in bacteria using PCR products. In this study, we describe the replacement of the ampicillin resistance marker of helper plasmids pKD46 and pCP20 by a gentamicin resistance gene to disrupt chromosomal genes and then to eliminate FRT flanked resistance gene in multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica strains.
