This observational study enrolled adult patients with bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) who were treated at the emergency department of a teaching hospital from 2001 to 2007. MRSA isolates with type IV and type V staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) genes (SCC IV/V-MRSA) were included in the final analysis. Healthcare-associated SCC IV/V-MRSA (HA-SCC IV/V-MRSA) and community-acquired SCC IV/V-MRSA (CA-SCC IV/V-MRSA) were defined as the identification of an SCC IV/V-MRSA isolate from a patient with and without healthcare-associated risk factors, respectively. Thirty-four cases of CA-SCC IV/V-MRSA (20 SCCmec type IV, 14 SCCmec type V) and 81 cases of HA-SCC IV/V-MRSA (59 SCCmec type IV, 22 SCCmec type V) bacteremia were identified. Vascular device-associated infections were a significant infection source in HA-SCC IV/V-MRSA bacteremia cases. SCCmec type IV HA-SCC IV/V-MRSA isolates (3.4%) were significantly less likely to carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene than SCCmec type IV CA-SCC IV/V-MRSA isolates (35.0%, p = 0.001). The 90-day cumulative probability of survival was 76% for patients with CA-SCC IV/V-MRSA bacteremia and 66% for patients with HA-SCC IV/V-MRSA bacteremia (p = 0.247, by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Significant differences in antimicrobial susceptibility were observed between bacterial isolates from patients with CA-SCC IV/V-MRSA bacteremia and HA-SCC IV/V-MRSA bacteremia.
