Seventy-four isolates of multiresistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. recovered during a 3-year period and 17 control strains with genotypically identified beta-lactamases were tested for the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) by using the Etest and the VITEK 1, VITEK 2, and Phoenix automated instruments. The use of the Etest was evaluated by investigating its accuracy in detecting the ESBLs of the control strains and by comparing interpretation results of laboratory technicians and experts. The accuracy of the Etest was 94%. With the Etest as the reference for the clinical strains and the genotype as the reference for the control strains, the automated instruments detected the ESBLs with accuracies of 78% (VITEK 2), 83% (VITEK 1), and 89% (Phoenix). No significant difference between the systems with regard to the control strains was detected. The VITEK 2 did, however, perform less well than the Phoenix (P = 0.03) on the collection of clinical isolates, mainly because of its high percentage of indeterminate test results (11%). No significant difference between the performances of the VITEK 1 and either the VITEK 2 or the Phoenix was found. However, because of its associated BDXpert system the Phoenix showed the best performance. The Etest was found to be an accurate test but was limited by its indeterminate results (4%), its inability to differentiate between K1 hyperproduction and ESBLs, questionable guidelines concerning mutants inside the inhibition zones, and the inability of the technicians to recognize subtle zone deformations.
