The induction of an antiviral state by type I interferons (IFN) was evaluated in primary trigeminal ganglion cell cultures using herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Cells treated with mouse IFN-beta consistently showed the greatest resistance to HSV-1 infection in comparison to cells treated with IFN-alpha1, IFN-alpha4, IFN-alpha5, IFN-alpha6, or IFN-alpha9. The antiviral efficacy was dose-dependent and correlated with the induction of the IFN-inducible, antiviral genes, 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. In trigeminal ganglion cells deficient in the downstream effector molecule of the OAS pathway, RNase L, the antiviral state induced by IFN-beta was lost.
