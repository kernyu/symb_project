Darunabir, formerly TMC114, is a new protease inhibitor (PI) under clinical development designed to be active against HIV strains resistant to currently available PI. The virological and immunological response to ritonavir-boosted darunabir was assessed in four heavily antiretroviral-experienced patients who had failed enfuvirtide and two or more previous ritonavir-boosted PI regimens, including tipranavir in one instance. All four patients reached undetectable plasma HIV-RNA levels within 8 weeks of therapy and experienced significant CD4 cell count gains.
