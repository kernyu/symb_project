SARI (Surveillance of Antibiotic Use and Bacterial Resistance in Intensive Care Units) provides data on antibiotic use, resistance rates (RR) and resistance densities (RD) in 47 interdisciplinary, medical and surgical intensive care units in Germany. Mean total antibiotic use was 1170 defined daily doses per 1000 patient days (pd). RD of MRSA has remained stable since 2001 in contrast to a continuous increase in the RD of 3rd generation cephalosporins E. coli (4.3 and 1.4, respectively, resistant pathogens/1000 pd in 2007). Local data of antibiotic use and bacterial resistance are important for the antibiotic and quality management of the individual ICUs. Pooled data of antibiotic use and bacterial resistance allow trends and extrapolations for Germany, which are relevant for future strategies.
