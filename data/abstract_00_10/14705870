Plant natural resistance to potential parasites is regulated by two fundamental mechanisms: the "nonhost" and the "gene-for-gene" resistance, respectively. The latter is relevant when a cultivar resistant (R) gene product recognizes an avirulence gene product in the attacking pathogen and triggers an array of biochemical reactions that halt the pathogen around the site of attempted invasion. To cope with virulent pathogens, plants may benefit by some temporary immunity after a challenge triggering such an array of defense reactions, following a localized necrotizing infection as a possible consequence of a hypersensitive response (HR). This process, mediated by accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA), is called systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and provides resistance, to a certain extent even against unrelated pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, for a relatively long-lasting period. SAR may be more potently activated in plants pretreated with chemical inducers, most of which appear to act as functional analogues of SA. This review summarizes the complex aspects of SAR as a way to prevent crop diseases by activating the plants' own natural defenses. The following outline is taken: (1) introduction through the historical insight of the phenomenon; (2) oxidative burst, which produces high levels of oxygen reactive species in a way similar to the inflammation state in animals and precedes the HR to the pathogen attack; (3) SAR as a coordinate action of several gene products leading to the expression of defenses well beyond the time and space limits of the HR; (4) jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene as other endogenous factors mediating a different pathway of induced resistance; (5) pathogenesis related proteins (PR proteins) de novo synthesized as specific markers of SAR; (6) exogenous inducers of SAR, which include both synthetic chemicals and natural products; (7) the pathway of signal transduction between sensitization by inducers and PR expression, as inferred by mutageneses, a process that is still, to a large extent, not completely elucidated; (8) prospects and costs; (9) final remarks on the state-of-the-art of the topic reflecting the chemical view of the author, based on the more authoritative ones expressed by the authors of the reviewed papers.
