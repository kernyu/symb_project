The objective of this study was (1) to estimate the prevalence of recalcitrant Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection in a UK genitourinary medicine clinic; (2) to use a case series and literature review to suggest an algorithm for management of recalcitrant TV (rTV). A retrospective review of laboratory records, case-notes and literature review was conducted. Fifteen patients were studied, representing 1.16% of the cases presenting during the study period. A wide variety of therapeutic agents was used, the treatment regimen differed for each patient. No treatment was universally effective in achieving cure, but the use of acetarsol pessaries vaginally appeared to be the most frequently successful strategy. Based on these results, an algorithm for treatment of rTV is presented, although clinical trials will be needed to elucidate the best clinical approaches to this problem.
