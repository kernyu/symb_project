INTRODUCTION: In the last years, the increase of antibiotic resistances of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is an important therapeutic problem. The antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, was evaluated against 750 bacterial isolates from 30 centers in Spain. METHODS: Multicenter and retrospective study. In 2005, thirty laboratories participated in this study. Data collected in this study included antimicrobial susceptibilities for S.aureus resistant to methicillin (MRSA), ESBL- E. coli or ESBL- K. pneumoniae, E. coli resistant to quinolons (E.coli- QR), Klebsiella spp and E. faecalis. Trains were obtained of the each Hospital s collection (5 strains of each microorganisms). The susceptibility determinations were performed locally by each laboratory following the standard method usually performed. The tigecycline susceptibility determinations were performed with E/test. RESULTS: Tigecycline was the most potent agent against MRSA, E. faecalis, E.coli-QR and ESBLs enterobacteriaceae; with MIC50-MIC90 values of: 0.125-0.25 g/ml; 0.125-0.5 g/ml; 0.25-0.75 g/ml and 0.38-1.5 g/ml; respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm the excellent in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including multirresistant microorganisms.
