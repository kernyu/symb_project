Bisquinoline heteroalkanediamines were structurally modified in order to study the effects of enhanced bulkiness and rigidity on both their activity on strains of Plasmodium falciparum expressing different degrees of chloroquine (CQ) resistance and their cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. While cyclization yielded molecules of greater rigidity that were not more active than their linear counterparts, they were characterized by an absence of cytotoxicity. Alternatively, dimerization of these compounds led to tetraquinolines that are very potent for CQ-resistant strains and noncytotoxic.
