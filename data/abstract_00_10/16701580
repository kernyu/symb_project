Mastoiditis (M) is the most common intratemporal complication of otitis media. The incidence of M has decreased since the advent of antimicrobial agents. In the last decade, however, there has been a marked increased in the incidence of acute M in several communities, sometimes in association with the growing resistance of pneumococci. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophillus influenzae are the most common organisms recovered in acute M. Several recent studies demonstrated the predominance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this infection. However, because P. aeruginosa colonizes the ear canal it can contaminate specimens obtained through the non-sterile ear canal. P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria are the most common isolates in chronic M. Anaerobes predominate in studies where adequate methods for their isolation are employed. Management of uncomplicated M requires the administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tube placement. If no improvement occurs within 48 h, surgical intervention and drainage may be necessary. The procedure generally employed is simple mastoidectomy, and tympanostomy tube placement. Radical mastoidectomy is performed only if there is no improvement after simple mastoidectomy.
