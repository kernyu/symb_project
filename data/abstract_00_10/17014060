OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of protease inhibitors (PIs) as antiretroviral therapy in comparison with other antiretroviral (non-PI) medications on glucose tolerance, lipid metabolism, and body fat distribution in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected young patients. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional clinical study in an outpatient HIV clinic. The study population consisted of 21 patients (15 female and 6 male) who had had at least 6 months of antiretroviral treatment. The mean age of the patients was 11.9 years (range, 6 to 16.5). RESULTS: Fifteen patients treated with PIs and 6 patients treated with non-PIs were enrolled in the study. We found no significant differences in the lipid panel and insulin resistance, as determined by using the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index formula, in the PI group in comparison with the non-PI group. Lipodystrophy was observed in 47% (7 of 15) of the PI group and 33% (2 of 6) of the non-PI group (P = 0.66). In the presence of lipodystrophy, serum triglyceride levels were higher in the PI group than in the non-PI group (P = 0.046). No such difference was found between the treatment groups when no lipodystrophy was present. There was no significant difference in insulin resistance between the treatment groups in the presence or absence of lipodystrophy. CONCLUSION: Our study found the presence of lipodystrophy in HIV-infected young patients regardless of whether they were taking PIs or not. In the patients who had lipodystrophy, those treated with PIs had higher serum triglyceride levels than those not treated with PIs.
