BACKGROUND: Infusion or inhalation of prostaglandins PGE1 and PGI2 is used to reduce vascular resistance. PGE1 and PGI2 are dissolved in ethanol and glycine buffer, respectively. Each vehicle may cause dose-dependent haemodynamic and respiratory side effects. This study was performed to examine the role of low-dose ethanol and glycine buffer as used for the infusion and inhalation of PGE1 and PGI2. METHODS: Two groups of pigs (ethanol and glycine group, n = 9 each) were anaesthetised and ventilated mechanically. Ethanol was given at 0.14 mg/kg/min by infusion and 0.12 mg/kg/min as aerosol, glycine buffer was infused at 3.8 microg/kg/min and inhaled at 3.1 microg/kg/min, respectively. Haemodynamic and respiratory data were recorded before and after application. RESULTS: Neither infusion nor inhalation of ethanol or glycine buffer caused significant changes in systemic and pulmonary haemodynamics, right heart function, oxygenation or ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of inhaled or intravenously infused PGE1 and PGI2 is not influenced by their preparations containing ethanol or glycine buffer.
