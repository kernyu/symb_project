A total of 186 Helicobacter pylori isolates and 532 gastric biopsies recovered from 532 patients with varying degrees of gastroduodenal pathology are subjected to in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing using the disc-diffusion method, Etest (MIC breakpoints) and molecular testing using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the isolates studied, antibiotic resistance was as follows: piperacillin (72%), amoxicillin (66%), erythromycin (78%), tetracycline (100%) and metronidazole (95%). All isolates were sensitive to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. None of the 245 amplicons (positive for H. pylori) from the biopsies were digested with the Bbs1 and Bsal restriction enzyme used in the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique, showing sensitivity to clarithromycin. However, a 238 bp fragment from H. pylori chromosomal DNA (corresponding to the quinolone resistance determining region [QRDR]) of the gyrA gene was amplified successfully. Twelve (4.9%) of the 245 strains studied had the described mutation at position 91, from asparagine (Asn) to glycine (Gly). The study showed that all the H. pylori strains were sensitive to clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin. It also highlighted PCR as a potential tool for faster diagnosis and determination of antibiotic susceptibility (within 24 h) of H. pylori from biopsies and/or isolates recovered from peptic ulcer and gastritis patients.
