Inducible resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin requires expression of vanH, vanA and vanX, controlled by a two-component regulatory system consisting of a receptor histidine kinase, VanS, and a response regulator, VanR. The identity of the VanS receptor ligand has been debated. Using a synthesized vancomycin photoaffinity probe, we show that vancomycin directly binds Streptomyces coelicolor VanS (VanSsc) and this binding is correlated with resistance and required for vanH, vanA and vanX gene expression.
