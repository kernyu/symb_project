The Etest was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations(MICs) of five antifungal agents for 30 C. albicans clinical isolates. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA(RAPD) analysis was established and was used to type 30 epidemiological unrelated strains of C. albicans. The relationship between genotype of C. albicans and its resistance to antifungal was analysed by dendrogram according to RAPD patterns. The results were that there were 2 of 30 isolates of C. albicans against fluconazole and their RAPD profiles had high similarity. These results suggest that a high degree of genetic correlation exists between fluconazole-resistant patterns and RAPD profiles of C. albicans.
