The aims of this study were to describe anthropometric data and glycemic and lipidic profiles of HIV-infected patients treated or not with antiretrovirals (ARV) drugs, and to assess association between these drugs and body composition changes, lipid and glucose homeostasis disturbances. There were 176 patients included (133 ARV-treated patients and 43 ARV-naive). The patients were submitted to clinical evaluation, laboratorial analysis, ultrasonographic measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis and skin folds thickness measurements. The ARV-treated group showed higher waist-to-hip ratio (p= 0.0002), higher intra-abdominal fat thickness measured by ultrasonography (p= 0.003) and lower bicipital (p= 0.01) and tricipital (p= 0.0002) skin folds. This group also showed higher triglyceride (p= 0.0002), total cholesterol (p= 0.00007), HDL cholesterol (p= 0.009), glucose measurements one hour (p= 0.01) and two hours (p= 0.001) after dextrose load, higher levels of fasting insulin (p= 0.03) and higher HOMAR index (p= 0.02). The antiretroviral drugs are associated with increased visceral fat and decreased peripheral fat pads. Beside that, these drugs are associated with atherogenic lipid profile and insulin resistance, two independent risk predictors of cardiovascular disease.
