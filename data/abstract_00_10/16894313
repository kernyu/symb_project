OBJECTIVE: Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), an important mediator for the host's innate antiviral defense system, has been approved for the treatment of persistent viral infections. We investigated whether two functional polymorphisms in genes involved in IFN-alpha signaling and effector functions are associated with the natural outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the responsiveness of chronic hepatitis C patients to IFN-alpha therapy. METHODS: Forty-four individuals who had resolved HCV infection spontaneously and 147 patients who developed chronic hepatitis C were analyzed for functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and myxovirus resistance protein-1 (MxA) genes at positions -300 and -88, respectively. RESULTS: With regard to -300 IRF-1 or -88 MxA genotype distributions or minor allele frequencies, individuals who spontaneously resolved the infection displayed no significant difference compared with those with chronic infections. Among patients with chronic infections, however, the -300AA IRF-1 genotype, associated with a higher IRF-1 transcriptional activity, was absent in patients with chronic HCV genotype 3a infections, with one exception. In contrast to expectations, -300AA IRF-1 individuals with HCV genotype 3a infection were not represented in higher numbers among those with self-limited infections. Regarding IFN-alpha therapy, -300AA IRF-1 chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients tend to respond more often than those with the other IRF-1 genotypes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the possibility that the -300AA IRF-1 genotype is associated with outcome in patients with HCV genotype 3 infection. In addition, in HCV genotype-1-infected patients, this genotype appears associated with response to therapy.
