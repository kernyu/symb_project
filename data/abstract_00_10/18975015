Based on the report that the introduction of the biosynthetic precursor of lincomycin, propylproline, could increase the production of lincomycin (Bruce et al. in US Patent 3,753,859, 1973), a mutant strain pro10-20, with resistance of feedback suppression of proline (an analog of propylproline) was thus selected and lincomycin production increased by 10%. The addition of three amino acids (L-proline, L-tyrosine, L-alanine) which are the precursors of propylproline to the fermentation medium was found to enhance the accumulation of L-dopa through different pathways and was favorable to lincomycin biosynthesis. The production of lincomycin was increased by 23, 10, 13%, respectively, with the addition of 0.05 g L(-1) L-proline at 60 h, 0.005 g L(-1) L-tyrosine and 0.1 g L(-1) L-alanine directly in the medium.
