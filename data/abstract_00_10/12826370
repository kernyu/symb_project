Recent epidemiologic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that in the human population human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is a relatively new pathogen that arose by zoonotic transmission from chimpanzees. In humans the morbidity and mortality figures due to HIV infection are extremely high. In a very small percentage of the human population, however, individuals have been identified who were infected for more than 20 years and have no evidence of disease progression. In contrast to most infected humans, almost all chimpanzees appear to be resistant to the pathologic effects caused by lentiviruses such as HIV-1. Here we review the characteristics of the HIV-1-specific cell-mediated immune responses mounted by chimpanzees, and we postulate the mechanisms that have evolved that facilitate their resistance to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
