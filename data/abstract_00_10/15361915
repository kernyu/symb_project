We report the first case, to our knowledge, of a proven Fusarium dimerum soft-tissue infection in a stem cell transplant recipient treated successfully with voriconazole. There is a well-documented increase in the incidence, diversity and antifungal resistance of invasive mould infections in the immunocompromised patient population. The management of these infections is changing as new, more efficacious and less toxic antifungal agents become available. We present the case of a 19-year-old female diagnosed with a proven F. dimerum soft-tissue infection of the foot and possible pulmonary infection with the same organism 10 days following a sibling allogeneic stem cell transplant for severe aplastic anaemia. The infection developed despite treatment with 3 mg/kg AmBisome for a concurrent chest infection. She was treated successfully with voriconazole.
