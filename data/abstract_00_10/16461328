A 7-year retrospective analysis of candidemia in patients with hematologic malignancies demonstrated that ten patients, who received itraconazole and fluconazole during neutropenia, developed breakthrough fungemia caused by fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans (C. albicans) with decreased susceptibility to voriconazole. Eight of these ten patients died of candidemia despite amphotericin B administration. Karyotype analysis of C. albicans isolates revealed that all isolates were genetically unrelated? Our findings suggest that blood isolates of C. albicans in neutropenic patients receiving azoles could be azole cross-resistant, and that the patients should be treated by other antifungals such as echinocandins.
