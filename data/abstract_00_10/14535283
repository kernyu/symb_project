As part of its ongoing mission to inform and support trustees and staff of health foundations and corporate giving programs, Grantmakers In Health (GIH), in conjunction with the Health and Environmental Funders Network (HEFN), held a day-long Issue Dialogue on two important environmental health issues: antibiotic resistance and systemic contaminants. Experts and advocates from many organizations came together to discuss concerns and opportunities, as well as current and potential roles for health philanthropy. This Issue Brief brings together key points from the day's discussion with factual information on environmental health drawn from a background paper prepared for the participants.
