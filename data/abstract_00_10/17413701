We assessed the long-term safety, effectiveness and quality of a fixed-dose combination of nevirapine, stavudine and lamivudine (triomune). HIV-1-infected adults initially enrolled in a one-year, open-label, single-arm, multicentre trial in Cameroon were followed for 2 years. Our results support the safety and effectiveness of the triomune combination for first-line treatment of HIV infection. Virological effectiveness appeared to wane somewhat during the second year of treatment, however, and plasma nevirapine concentrations were relatively high.
