In a population-based case-control study of community acquired Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD), we matched 1,233 cases to 12,330 controls. CDAD risk increased 3-fold with use of any antimicrobial agent and 6-fold with use of fluoroquinolones. Prior use of antimicrobial agents did not affect risk for CDAD after 6 months.
