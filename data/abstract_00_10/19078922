During September 28-November 29, 2008, influenza activity remained low in the United States. Of the few influenza viruses characterized thus far this season, most are antigenically related to the strains included in the 2008-09 influenza vaccine. Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) viruses have been detected, but currently available data are insufficient to predict their prevalence for the 2008-09 season. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity since the last update and reviews new influenza vaccine recommendations for the current season.
