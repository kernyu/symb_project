AFP-producing gastric carcinoma (AFPGC) is a highly malignant variant of gastric cancer. An effective chemotherapy is needed to improve on the poor outcome of this disease. Survival signals activated by intracellular kinase networks could be involved in chemoresistance in malignant tumors. We investigated the role of a pivotal kinase pathway, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, in the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents in three AFPGC cell lines (GCIY, FU97 and Takigawa) as well as in four cell lines of conventional-type gastric carcinoma (CGC). AFPGC cells were generally resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin, while CGC cells were generally sensitive. Downstream targets of mTORC1, including p70S6K and 4EBP1, were phosphorylated in all cell lines. Interestingly, cisplatin virtually abolished phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1 in CGC cells, while phosphorylation was maintained in cisplatin-treated AFPGC cells. The addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1, diminished the remaining activity of mTORC1 and significantly intensified the cytotoxic action of cisplatin in AFPGC cells. These results suggested that persistent activity of mTORC1 signals in cisplatin-treated AFPGC cells is involved in the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in AFPGC. Finally, combined treatment of rapamycin and cisplatin significantly suppressed the subcutaneously implanted GCIY cells. In conclusion rapamycin may be a potential supplemental agent for the treatment of AFPGC when used in combination with cisplatin.
