The annual meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) was recently held in Brussels, Belgium, and gathered world experts in pediatric infectious diseases, vaccinology, epidemiology, microbiology and public health, among others. Among nonvaccine related topics that were discussed, emphasis was given to the continuous surveillance of the most common pathogens causing noninvasive and invasive infectious diseases, other organisms that cause disease, and nosocomial outbreaks by resistant organisms. However, despite the availability of newer antimicrobial therapies for fighting infections in childhood, effective common-sense preventive measures such as hand hygiene can impact positively on the decrease of incidence, and spread of drug- and multidrug-resistant organisms.
