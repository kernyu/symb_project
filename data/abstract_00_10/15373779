Cytokine resistance is a well-established feature of melanoma cell progression and represents also a major obstacle in immunotherapy of patients with metastatic melanoma. To check whether suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) play a role in cytokine resistance and tumor progression of melanoma, we investigated the expression and regulation of SOCS-1, an established negative regulator of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon (IFN) signalling. In vitro SOCS-1 transcripts were detectable by RT-PCR in 8 out of 8 human melanoma cell lines derived from different tumor stages. Normal human melanocytes also expressed SOCS-1 mRNA in the presence or absence of artificial growth factors. Both IL-6 and alpha-IFN induced rapid and transient SOCS-1 mRNA expression in WM35 and WM9 melanoma cells. At the protein level, SOCS-1 was undetectable in normal human melanocytes whereas uniformly expressed in all tested melanoma cell lines. The aberrant SOCS-1 protein expression in melanoma cells was recapitalized in situ as shown by immunohistochemical analysis. SOCS-1 immunoreactivity was closely related to tumor invasion (Clark level), tumor thickness according to Breslow, and stage of the disease. In contrast, melanocytes in normal skin or melanocytic nevi lacked SOCS-1 protein expression. Our findings show that melanoma cells express a member of the SOCS family, SOCS-1, in vitro and in situ. SOCS-1 is a progression marker of human melanoma and may downregulate biological responses by endogenous and/or therapeutically administered cytokines.
