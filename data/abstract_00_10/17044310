The application of antimicrobial finishes to textiles can prevent bacterial growth and might reduce the risk of infection resulting from textiles that are contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms in hospitals. The main aim of this study was the determination of the antibacterial activities of chemical treatments applied to textiles. Comparison of testing methods assessing antibacterial efficiency was conducted. These studies were performed in order to select the right methods of evaluating the bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity of antibacterial modified textiles. Antibacterial modified polyester fibres and fabrics made from cotton (100%) applied with quaternary ammonium salts were tested. Textiles treated with bacterial agent were compared with reference samples (not treatment with the disinfectant). The Standards ISO/DIS 20645/2002 andAATCC 147/ 1998 suitable for assessment of bacteriostatic activity were applied. For assessment of bactericidal activity ATCC Test Method 100-1998 were applied. The bacterial strains recommended by the above standards such as: Klebsiellapneumoniae (ATCC 4352),Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Escherichia coli (ATCC 11229) was tested. Additionally Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) was examined. Tested fibres did not show antibacterial activity. Samples of antibacterial textiles were washed through laboratory laundering cycles. Residual antimicrobial activity was measured after washes. The fabric showed antibacterial activity against K. pneumonia and S. aureus. The examined specimens showed no bacteriostatic activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The results obtained in two applied quality methods were comparable in assessing antibacterial activity of finishes. Reduction of bacteria in quantitative method was 90%. In quality method ISO/DIS 20645/2002 effectiveness of the treatment against K. pneumonia was retained up to five laundering cycles and against S. aureus--twenty laundering cycles.
