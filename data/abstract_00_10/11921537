A case of persistent infestation of the scalp due to Dermanyssus gallinae.--Infestation due to Dermanyssus gallinae, the common red mite of poultry, in a country-woman aged 69 years from Crevalcore (Emilia-Romagna region, Northern Italy), is described. The case was unusual either for its location, the scalp, and for its persistence, 9 months. Specimens of the mite were also found in the henhouse adjacent to the patient's house. Apparently the woman recovered by means of daily washing of camomile tea.
