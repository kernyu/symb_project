The purpose of this study is to formulate in situ implants containing doxycycline hydrochloride and/or secnidazole that could be used in the treatment of periodontitis by direct periodontal intrapocket administration. Biodegradable polymers [poly (lactide) (PLA) and poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)], each polymer in two concentrations 25%w/w, 35%w/w were used to formulate the in situ implants. The rheological behavior, in vitro drug release and the antimicrobial activity of the prepared implants were evaluated. Increasing the concentration of each polymer increases the viscosity and decreases the percent of the drugs released after 24 h. PLA implants showed a slower drugs release rate than PLGA implants in which the implants composed of 25% PLGA showed the fastest drugs release. The in vitro drug release and antimicrobial activity results were compared with results of Atridox. Results revealed that the pharmaceutical formulation based on 25% PLGA containing secnidazole and doxycycline hydrochloride has promising activity in treating periodontitis in comparison with Atridox.
