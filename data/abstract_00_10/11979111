Treatment of HIV infected patients with antiretroviral drugs often results in the emergence of virus variants with reduced sensitivity to these drugs. However, the viral load often remains partially suppressed below pretherapy levels, which might be explained by a reduced fitness of the drug resistant viral population. This review describes the effects of antiretroviral resistance development on the fitness of the viral population and its clinical implications.
