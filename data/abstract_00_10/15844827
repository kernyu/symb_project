Successful control of foodborne pathogens requires placement of chemical and physical hurdles in the preharvest and postharvest food production sectors. Pathogens may also encounter indigenous antimicrobials in foods including certain botanical compounds that have historically been used for flavor enhancement as well as preservation. Chemical additives have traditionally included organic acids to control microbial contamination in foods and feeds. However, there is some concern that continuous application of certain chemical antimicrobials can lead to a buildup of microbial resistance. This creates problems if foodborne pathogens survive and develop resistance to a variety of environmental stressors encountered in pre- and postharvest animal production. To expand the diversity of potential antimicrobials that have practical application to food animal production requires exploring the interaction between the food matrix and foodborne pathogens. There is potential for isolating antimicrobial compounds that exhibit mechanisms unrelated to conventional antimicrobial compounds. However, understanding the potential for novel antimicrobial compounds in foods and feeds will require the physiological examination of foodborne pathogen response under experimental conditions comparable to the environment where the pathogen is most likely to occur. Research on foodborne Salmonella pathogenesis is extensive and should provide a model for detailed examination of the factors that influence antimicrobial effectiveness. Analysis of pathogen response to antimicrobials could yield clues for optimizing hurdle technologies to more effectively exploit vulnerabilities of Salmonella and other foodborne pathogens when administering antimicrobials during food and feed production.
