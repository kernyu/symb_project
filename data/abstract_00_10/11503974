Poly(inosinic) and poly(cytidylic) acids (Poly I:Poly C) have been used to induce the production of endogenous interferon or release preformed interferon in mammals. Interferon increases the resistance of the cells. Sixty guinea pigs were used to investigate whether Poly I:Poly C gave protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity. The animals were divided into six equal groups. Group 1 were controls; group 2 received gentamicin intramuscularly; group 3 received gentamicin and 12 h later frusemide; group 4 received gentamicin and 12 h later 1-deamino-8-D-argine vasopressin (DDAVP) intramuscularly; group 5 received subcutaneously Poly I:Poly C; group 6 received Poly I:Poly C and 24 h later gentamicin. Frusemide in group 3 potentiated gentamicin nephrotoxicity while DDAVP in group 4 ameliorated gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Poly I:Poly C itself had no toxic effect on renal tissue, while Poly I:Poly C followed 24 h later by gentamicin indicated a protective effect from the gentamicin nephrotoxicity as the functional and histological investigations indicated.
