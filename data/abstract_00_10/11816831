BMS is investigating a series of cephalosporins for potential use in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection [274213]. In vitro activity tests resulted in a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1 to 8 microg/ml against MRSA 1274213]. A series of C(3) benzoyloxymethyl cephalosporins exhibited in vitro activity against MRSA and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with MIC values ranging from 0.007 to 2 microM, and improved in vivo stability in human plasma [258890].
