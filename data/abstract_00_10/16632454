Hospital acquired infections are transmitted to patients by hospital personnel and other patients, or they may arise from patient's own endogenous flora. Children are one of the most susceptible subjects associated in the hospital-acquired infections and have a higher prevalence rate for infections. This problem is at its extremes in developing countries like Pakistan where in most of cases the severity depends on the hygienic conditions of the Hospitals and lack or lapse of infection control measures. To have a surveillance type of data in this regard, one hundred and twenty four isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa/Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA) and Klebsiella species, that are commonest among the nosocomial infection causing organisms, were collected from pediatric hospital settings in Karachi. A study of incidence and resistance pattern by Kirby Baur disc diffusion method, with selected antimicrobials, was carried out. These isolates were resistant against most antimicrobials tested. Drugs like mmipenem, meropenem, amikacin, vancomycin (especially in MRSA or BRSA), Fucidic acid (for burns and other infections) and some of the 3rd generation cephalosporins were found quite effective.
