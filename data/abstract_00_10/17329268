OBJECTIVES: To date, very little is known about lincosamide resistance plasmids in staphylococci with only a single lnu(A)-carrying staphylococcal plasmid having been sequenced completely. The aim of this study was to characterize small lnu(A)-carrying plasmids isolated from bovine coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). METHODS: Nine CoNS isolates with MICs of the lincosamide pirlimycin of 1-4 mg/L were tested for the presence of the lnu(A) gene. Its location was determined by Southern-blot hybridization. The lnu(A)-carrying plasmids were transformed into Staphylococcus aureus RN4220 and compared by restriction mapping and subsequent sequencing. Selected plasmids were investigated for their copy number and their lnu(A) gene expression via RT real-time PCR. RESULTS: The lnu(A) gene was detected on plasmids in all isolates. Sequence analysis revealed that these plasmids carried a rep gene, coding for the replication initiator protein, and the resistance gene lnu(A), coding for a lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase. While the Lnu(A) proteins were closely related (91.3-100% amino acid identity), the Rep proteins differed distinctly (27.4-100% amino acid identity), but showed similarity (81.4-98.5%) to Rep proteins of other small staphylococcal resistance plasmids. Sequence features of rolling-circle plasmids, such as the single-strand (ssoA) and double-strand (dso) origins of replication, were identified. For two plasmid types detected, the lincosamide resistance level varied with regard to the amounts of lnu(A) transcripts detected. CONCLUSIONS: Structurally different lnu(A)-carrying plasmids were detected in various CoNS species. The detection of the same lnu(A) gene in different plasmid backbones suggested the exchange of the gene via interplasmid recombinational events.
