Bacteria have developed sophisticated and successful genetic mechanisms to evade the action of antimicrobials. Bacterial multiresistance has caused serious problems in the treatment of nosocomial infections. Integrons and gene cassettes are considered the main genetic elements in the evolution of plasmids and transposons that actively participate in the mobilization of genes, codifying different bacterial resistance mechanisms. This article reviews the historical and structural aspects of integrons and resistance gene cassettes and the presence of these structures in gram negative bacteria isolated from Chilean hospitals in the last ten years.
