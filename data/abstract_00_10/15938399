We studied closely related Azospirillum brasilense strains Sp7 and Cd. For probing of their genomes, the fragments of 85-MDa (p85) and 120-MDa (p120) from A. brasilense Sp245 plasmids were hybridized with 115-MDa (p115) and 90-Mda (p90) plasmids of strain Sp7, respectively. Strain Cd was found to lose the 115-Mda plasmid and one of the two EcoRI restriction fragments of the total DNA (localized within p115 and the chromosome) that was homologous to an EcoRI-generated p85 fragment of 2.4 kb. On the contrary, in the total DNA of strain Sp7-S, in spite of the previously established disappearance of the 115-Mda replicon, two fragments homologous to p85 were revealed, as with strain Sp7. It is suggested that the Sp7-S genome contains the total p115 DNA or at least a certain part of it. Strains Sp7 and Cd were found to differ in size and morphology of colonies on solid and semisolid media, in the levels of resistance to a cation surfactant cetavlon, and in the antigen structure of lipopolysaccharides.
