Salmonellosis is a major foodborne infection in Spain, and strains that are resistant to a great variety of antibiotics have become a major public health concern. The aim of this study was to determine the level of antibiotic resistance in 133 Salmonella isolates obtained from a poultry slaughterhouse in Zaragoza (NE Spain). Antimicrobial resistance testing was performed by disk diffusion method using 19 antibiotics. Results were interpreted following the NCCLS criteria. Overall, the highest percentage of resistance was found to the following antimicrobial agents: sulfadiazine (96.2%), neomycin (53.4%), tetracycline (21.8%), and streptomycin (11.3%). All isolates were found to be resistant to one or more of the antibiotics tested. Multiple resistance was observed in 87 strains (65.4%). We found 23 different patterns of resistance in Salmonella Enteritidis. Resistance to sulfadiazine was the most common single resistance. The most frequent patterns of multiresistant strains were neomycin+sulfadiazine and neomycin+tetracycline+sulfadiazine. S. 4,5,12:b: showed the highest percentages of resistance to the tested drugs, with five different resistance patterns found. Ampicillin+chloramphenicol+streptomycin+sulphonamides+tetracycline (ACSSuT) resistance pattern, commonly associated with S. Typhimurium DT 104, was not detected in strains of the same phage type from broilers. The appearance of substantial multiresistance in foodborne Salmonella isolates suggests the need for more prudent use of antibiotics by farmers, veterinarians, and physicians.
