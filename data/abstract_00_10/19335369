Multidrug resistance in Gram-positive pathogens emerged as a major therapeutic challenge over two decades ago. The worldwide spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and other resistant Gram-positive pathogens had a major impact on antibiotic policies, and prompted the discovery and development of new antibiotics to combat difficult-to-treat infections caused by such pathogens. Several new antibiotics active against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens have recently been introduced into clinical practice, and the antibiotic pipeline contains additional anti-Gram-positive drugs at an advanced stage of development, including new glycopeptides (dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin), new anti-MRSA beta-lactams (ceftobiprole), and new diaminopyrimidines (iclaprim). This article provides a brief overview of these upcoming agents, partially based on the material presented at the ESCMID Conference entitled 'Fighting infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-positives' (Venice, Italy, 29-31 May 2008) and on the most recent literature.
