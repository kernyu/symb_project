We report co-infection with two phenotypically and genotypically distinct strains of Bordetella pertussis in an infant male hospitalized with a 2-week history of cough, paroxysms and vomiting. Colonies from the two B. pertussis phenotypes were isolated and evaluated by PFGE profile analysis, gene sequence typing and PCR-RFLP of a portion of the 23S rRNA gene. These results demonstrated simultaneous infection with two different strains of B. pertussis.
