We report a case of small cell lung cancer in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The patient was a 51-year-old man diagnosed 8 years previously as seropositive for HIV, who was admitted to our hospital for re-evaluation of antiretroviral medications due to multidrug resistance. Chest radiograph revealed an abnormal hilar shadow subsequently confirmed to be small cell lung cancer. He received chemotherapy concurrently with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and lived for 14 months after the diagnosis. The prognosis of lung cancer in HIV-seropositive patients is very poor, and adverse effects of chemotherapy occur more frequently than in other patients. However, the simultaneous antiretroviral agents and combination chemotherapy was successful. Such treatment may be effective despite an otherwise poor prognosis, including HIV infection.
