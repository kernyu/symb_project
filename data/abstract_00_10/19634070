Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) we have previously described the occurrence and possible dissemination of a clone of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MDRSE) in 2 hospitals in northern Sweden during 2001-2003. The aims of the present study were to investigate if this clone still persisted, 7 y later, in these 2 hospitals and whether this specific clone was detectable among clinical isolates from 9 other hospitals, 6 Swedish as well as a Norwegian, Danish and a German hospital. In total, 173 clinical isolates of MDRSE isolated during 2003 to 2008 were analysed using PFGE, of which 22 isolates were also characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Two dominating PFGE types (types A and B) were identified, consisting of 56 (32%) and 38 (22%) isolates, respectively. Type A, which was detected in the Norwegian and all Swedish hospitals, proved indistinguishable to the clone previously identified in 2001-2003 and corresponded with a novel sequence type (ST215). Type B was discovered in the German, Danish and in 7 Swedish hospitals and corresponded with ST2. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the occurrence, persistence and potential dissemination of 2 MDRSE genotypes, including a novel sequence type (ST215), within hospitals in northern Europe.
