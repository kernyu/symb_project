The INNO-LiPA Rif.TB assay is designed for the detection of rpoB gene mutations causing rifampin resistance in isolates. We applied the method directly to 60 Lithuanian and Danish clinical specimens to detect rifampin resistance rapidly. Results were obtained in 78.3% of clinical specimens, and all were concordant with those obtained by BACTEC 460. The assay could have major impact on the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
