INTRODUCTION: The retrospective analysis of frequency of drug resistant tuberculosis XDR (XDR = MDR + resistance to: fluoroquinolones + amikacin and/or capreomycin) in Poland have been tested. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pattern of resistance to first, second and third line drugs has been tested among new and treated patients. The total number of 10 913 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from the same number of the patients surveyed in 1997-2004 in WHO programme Drug resistance surveillance countrywide study. RESULTS: One HIV-negative patient (43 years old men) was infected by XDR (0,4% among new and treated MDR cases). Molecular analysis of the XDR strain by spoligotyping has been shown the T11558 cluster. Three others tuberculosis patients living in the same region of Poland excreted the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains belonged to the same T11558 cluster, but they had not pattern of XDR resistance. In the same T11558 molecular cluster 13/15 - 87% strains have been isolated from polish patients. CONCLUSIONS: In Poland Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to fluoroquinolones, capreomycin and amikacine among MDR strains has been observed very rarely.
