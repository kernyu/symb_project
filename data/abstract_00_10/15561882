The lactoferrin-derived peptide hLF(1-11), but not its control peptide, was highly effective against five multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains in vitro (3 to 4 log reduction) and against four of these strains in an experimental infection in mice (2 to 3 log reduction). Therefore, this peptide is a promising candidate as a novel agent against infections with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.
