Helicobacter pylori eradication using the three antibiotic regimen of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole often fails, making it imperative to find substitutes. The following study made use of 72 H. pylori isolates derived from pyloric antrum mucosa biopsies of gastritis and chronic dyspepsia patients treated at the Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital and three private hospitals in Jakarta. Testing for H. pylori sensitivity to various antimicrobials was conducted using the disk diffusion method (Kirby Bauer) and procedures determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Intitute (CLSI)/NCCLS. The resistance rates of the isolates were 100% for metronodazole, 27.8% for clarithromycin, 19.4% for amoxicillin, 6.9% for ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin, 2.8% for sparfloxacin and gatifloxacin, and 1.4% for levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Fluoroquinolons have the lowest resistance compared to amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole.
