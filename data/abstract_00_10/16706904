AIMS: To test the suitability of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (AMT) method with Paecilomyces fumosoroseus, a fungal pathogen that causes diseases in a wide range of insects including whiteflies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Conidia of P. fumosoroseus were successfully transformed to hygromycin B resistance using the hph gene of Escherichia coli as the selectable marker. Transformation frequencies were 58.3 +/- 18.5, 98.3 +/- 24.8 and 169.7 +/- 35.5 (+/-SEM) transformants per 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) target conidia respectively. After confirmation by PCR, transformants were subjected to Southern analysis, and the results revealed that 45% (four of nine) of the transformants contained single-copy integration of the T-DNA. CONCLUSIONS: In our AMT system, we efficiently transformed conidia of P. fumosoroseus. The employment of this method circumvents time-consuming protoplast preparation and allows the isolation of transformants containing single-copy integration of the T-DNA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Considering the efficiency of Ag. tumefaciens-mediated transformation, this method represents a useful tool for insertional mutagenesis to characterize genes that are important for the pathogenicity of P. fumosoroseus.
