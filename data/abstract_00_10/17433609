Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is a classic opportunist infection affecting AIDS patients. However it is less frequent since systematic prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapies. Treatment resistance is rare in France. We report the case of a severe Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia with treatment resistance to standard treatment and fatal outcome. The different causes of treatment resistance, notably the role of CMV co-infection, were reviewed and discussed.
