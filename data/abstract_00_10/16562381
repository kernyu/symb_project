The presence of class 1, 2, and 3 integrons was investigated in four pediatric isolates of Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). A class 1 integron was detected in one S. Typhimurium strain, the only one that also showed resistance to various aminoglycoside antibiotics. This integron, called InJR06, and the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were located in pS06, a large (> or = 55 kb) conjugative plasmid. A single mobile cassette (encoding the aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase ANT(3'')-Ia) was detected in the variable region of InJR06, while the architecture of the attI1 and attC sites was conserved.
