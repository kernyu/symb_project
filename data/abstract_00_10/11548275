The role of transport activity of Acholeplasma laidlawii plasmatic membrane in the development of resistance to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was investigated. It was shown that one of the important steps of resistance development in acholeplasms is a complex of adaptation metabolic reactions providing limited antibiotic accumulation by the cells. In the case of ciprofloxacin resistance metabolism changes concerning transport systems took place before mutations in target genes. Development of tetracycline resistance of mollecutes after incubation in the medium with enhancing antibiotic concentrations and not connected with the presence of tet(M) determinant was demonstrated for the first time.
