Genetic modification of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is highly valuable for their exploitation in basic science and therapeutic applications. Here we developed lentiviral vectors (LVs) constitutively expressing a reporter and a selectable marker to enable high and homogeneous transgene expression within polyclonal hESCs. LVs carrying GFP and a downstream puromycin resistance gene, linked by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or poliovirus internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), allowed homogeneous GFP expression after antibiotic selection. The GFP-expression levels were higher with the EMCV IRES. We also developed dual-promoter vectors harboring a reporter and an antibiotic resistance gene under the regulation of human EF1alpha and PGK1 promoters, respectively. Optimal efficiency was obtained when: (1) the reporter cassette was upstream rather than downstream of the selectable marker cassette, (2) the puromycin rather than the neomycin resistance gene was used, (3) a 5' deletion (314 bp) was created in the PGK promoter, and (4) two copies of a 120-bp element derived from the hamster Aprt CpG island were introduced upstream of the EF1alpha promoter. In summary, we developed bicistronic and novel dual-promoter LVs that enable high and homogeneous expression of transgenes by polyclonal hESCs after antibiotic selection. These vectors may provide important tools for basic and applied research on hESCs.
