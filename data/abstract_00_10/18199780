From November 2006 to April 2007, nine nonrepetitive isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility or resistance to carbapenems were recovered from clinical specimens from separate patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital. The imipenem-EDTA synergy test was positive for all isolates. PCR, sequencing, and transferability experiments revealed the novel bla(VIM-12) metallo-beta-lactamase gene, which was plasmid mediated and located in a class 1 integron. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated a single macrorestriction pattern, indicating the clonal spread of VIM-12-producing K. pneumoniae.
