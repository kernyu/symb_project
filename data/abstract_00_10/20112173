Antiretroviral drug resistance is one of the complications of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Second-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are being developed for use in patients infected with HIV-1 because of the enhanced activity of these inhibitors against viruses that are resistant to the first-generation NNRTIs. IDX-899 (GSK-2248761), under development by Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc and ViiV Healthcare, is an aryl phosphinate-indole second-generation NNRTI that potently and selectively inhibits wild-type and NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 in vitro. Preclinical data for IDX-899 suggest a significantly greater barrier to resistance compared with that of the first-generation NNRTI efavirenz. Two pathways of resistance have been identified for IDX-899 in vitro that include Glu138Lys and Val90Ile/Tyr181Cys mutations. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that IDX-899 exhibits linear, dose-proportional and food-dependent pharmacokinetics; Cmin concentrations achieved with this drug allow once-daily dosing. In phase I clinical trials, IDX-899 reduced HIV-1 RNA and increased CD4+ cell counts in treatment-naive patients infected with HIV-1. At the time of publication, a phase II clinical trial of IDX-899 was being conducted.
