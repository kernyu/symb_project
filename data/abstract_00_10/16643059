Two new, 5-heptadeca-8'Z,11'Z,16-trienylresorcinol (1) and 5-heptadeca-9'E,11'Z,16-trienylresorcinol (2), and six known 5-alkylresorcinols (3-8) were isolated from the mushroom Merulius incarnatus. Compound 2 is the first 5-alkylresorcinol derivative that contains a trans-cis conjugated double bond system. Compounds 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were found to inhibit methacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with IC(50) values of 2.5, 15, 9.5, 8.0, 5.0, and 6.5 microg/mL, respectively. Compound 1 was also active against leishmania, with an IC(50) value of 3.6 microg/mL, and showed no cytotoxicity in our Vero cell test up to a concentration of 25 microg/mL. The structures of these isolates were determined by spectroscopic data including 1D and 2D NMR.
