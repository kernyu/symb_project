A novel class A beta-lactamase (SCO-1) encoded by an 80-kb self-transferable plasmid from Escherichia coli is described. The interaction of SCO-1 with beta-lactams was similar to that of the CARB-type enzymes. Also, SCO-1 exhibited a 51% amino acid sequence identity with the RTG subgroup of chromosomal carbenicillinases (RTG-1, CARB-5, and CARB-8).
