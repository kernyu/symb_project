INTRODUCTION: Gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine) (GEM) has been demonstrated to be active in the salvage setting of ovarian cancer (OC) patients. CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old woman, with a diagnosis of FIGO Stage IIIC clear cell OC, judged inoperable to optimal residual tumor, was administered neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel/topotecan, and cytoreduction. After 5 months the patient progressed, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was started with rapid progression. GEM (1,000 mg/m2, d1,8,15, q28) was then started, and a complete clinical response was documented after seven cycles of treatment, and was maintained for 9 months; at progression fourth line carboplatin was attempted but 1 month after the last course of carboplatin, progression occurred, and the patient was re-challenged with GEM obtaining a partial response, of 6 months duration. Currently, the patient is still under treatment, without any complaints relative to her quality of life/specific symptoms. CONCLUSION: We described the case of a drug resistant clear cell ovarian cancer showing a selective susceptibility only to GEM at first administration and at re-challenge. Moreover, this case expressed a molecular profile very likely to support high tumour cell sensitivity to GEM.
