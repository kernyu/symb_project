PURPOSE: To describe a patient who developed oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endophthalmitis after insertion of a ganciclovir intraocular implant. METHOD: Case report. RESULTS: A 42-year-old man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and a history of cytomegalovirus retinitis was admitted with right-sided eye pain and decreased visual acuity 10 days after receiving a second ganciclovir intraocular implant in the right eye. A therapeutic vitrectomy, right eye, was performed on the day of admission. A vitreal tap produced frank pus and white, fluffy debris. Cultures of the vitreal fluid grew oxacillin-resistant S aureus, sensitive only to vancomycin, rifampin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient was successfully treated with removal of both ganciclovir implants in the right eye and a 4-week course of vancomycin and rifampin. However, the infection left the patient blind in the infected eye. CONCLUSION: Bacterial endophthalmitis is an infrequent but serious complication of the ganciclovir intraocular implant.
