BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of food poisoning due to their ability to produce enterotoxins which if ingested in sufficient amounts results in sickness. Food handlers carrying enterotoxin-producing S. aureus in their noses or hands can contaminate food leading to food poisoning. We characterized 200 S. aureus obtained from food handlers in different restaurants for antibacterial resistance and the carriage of virulence genes. FINDINGS: Susceptibility to antibacterial agents was determined by disk diffusion and Etest. PCR was used to detect genes for accessory gene regulator (agr); capsular polysaccharide (cap) 5 and 8, staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). Isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In total 185 (92.5%) of the 200 isolates expressed resistance to antibacterial agents. They were resistant to penicillin G (82.0%), tetracycline (19.0%), erythromycin (2.5%), clindamycin (2.0%), trimethoprim (7.5%), kanamycin (2.5%), streptomycin (1.5%), ciprofloxacin (1.5%), fusidic acid (1.0%) and cadmium acetate (68.0%). Seventy-six (38.0%) and 114 (57.0%) isolates had type 5 and type 8 capsular polysaccharides respectively. The agr types I, II and III alleles were detected in 50.5%, 20.0% and 23.5% of the isolates respectively. They contained genes for SEI (38.5%), SEG (24.0%), SEC (23.0%), SEB (12.5%), SEH (21.5%), SEA (11.0), SED (1.5%), SEE (1.5%), TSST-1 (4.0%) and PVL (9.0%). CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high prevalence of antibacterial resistance and virulence determinants in S. aureus from food handlers in Kuwait restaurants justifying the screening of food handlers to detect and treat carriers and protect restaurant customers from staphylococcal food poisoning.
