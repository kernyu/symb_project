Nadifloxacin is a potent, broad-spectrum, quinolone agent approved for topical use in acne vulgaris and skin infections in Japan. As exposure of pathogenic and colonising bacteria to antibiotics results in drug resistance, it is not desirable to use an important, broad-spectrum antibiotic, which belongs to a class of agents widely used systemically to treat a wide variety of infections, as a topically applied preparation. On this basis, nadifloxacin is not a good option for topical treatment of acne when other effective non-antibiotic treatments are available. Nadifloxacin has potential as a topical agent for short-term treatment of skin infections. The arginine salt of its (-)-(S)-isomer is being developed as a parenteral agent based on its potency against methicillin and quinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
