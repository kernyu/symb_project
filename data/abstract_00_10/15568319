Sixty-eight BALB/c mice were infected with the intravenous injections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT), a clinical strain resistant to streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, and kanamycin. The mice were divided into 5 groups: Groups 1 and 2 were control (intact and infected without being treated, respectively). Group 3 mice were treated with isoniazid; Group 4 received isoniazid in combination with intraperitoneal dissolved ozone (pO3); and Group 5 was given pO3. The animals began to die at month 4 of infection. By month 5, mice died all, except for intact and pO3-treated ones. On inoculation of MBT from the lung, there was a reduction in isoniazid resistance in the pO3-treated groups. The lesion was least when isoniazid was used in combination with pO3. The mechanism responsible for that pO3 lowers drug resistance in MBT and whether it is expedient to co-administer isoniazid and pO3 in undetected drug resistance in MBT are under discussion.
