The present study was to investigate antimicrobial resistance profiles of Escherichia coli O26 and O111 from cattle and to characterize the virulence genes of the resistant isolates. This paper reports the high prevalence of antimicrobial resistant E. coli O26 and O111 from cattle. Among 37 E. coli O26 and 25 E. coli O111 isolates from the fecal specimens obtained from cattle, 26 (70%) and 15 (60%) were resistant to at least one antibiotic, respectively. Forty (98%) of the 41 resistant isolates were resistant to two or more antibiotics. Among the 22 antibiotics tested in this study, ampicillin was the most common antibiotic that the isolates were resistant to, followed by tetracycline and streptomycin. None of the isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin, and to ceftriaxone, amikacin and imipenem. Eighteen different resistant types among the 41 isolates were observed by the cluster analysis. The most frequent antibiotic-resistance type was ampicillin-tetracycline-streptomycin-cephalothin-sulfisoxazole-ticarcillin-kanamy cin-minocycline-piperacillin-chloramphenicol, which accounted for 9 (22%) of the resistant isolates. The observation of frequent and multiple resistances to antibiotics highlights the need for their careful use if their benefits are to be preserved. PCR analysis of the EHEC virulence markers showed that 25 of the resistant E. coli O26 and O111 isolates tested positive for stx2 or both stx1 and stx2. This suggests that the majority of these isolates can cause serious diseases in humans and may complicate the future therapeutic options under development.
