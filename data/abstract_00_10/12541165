INTRODUCTION: For the therapy of acute cholangitis complete biliary drainage and antibiotic therapy is needed. The aim of the current study was to compare intravenous therapy of acute cholangitis with Ceftriaxone or Levofloxacin in a prospective and randomized fashion. METHODS: Patients with biliary obstruction and clinical signs of infection received in addition to 1.5 g Metronidazole either 500 mg Levofloxacin/die or 2 g Ceftriaxone/die. Early on during ERCP, bile was aspirated via the cannulation catheter and cultured for bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the respective antibiotics were determinate for each isolate. The clinical course was followed for at least 6 days with clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: 60 patients with clinical signs of acute cholangitis were randomised. In 40 patients (66 %) biliary colonization with bacteria could be identified. In all bacterial species Levofloxacin showed significantly lower rates of in-vitro resistance as compared to Ceftriaxone. However, the percentage of patients with a clinical cure or significant improvement was the same in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical effect of Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone in patients with acute cholangitis showed no significant differences. Because of improved in-vitro efficiency, a calculated therapy with Levofloxacin might be advantageous.
