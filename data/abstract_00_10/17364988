Increasing the intensity of induction chemotherapy has generated considerable recent interest in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Achieving complete remission is a sine qua non condition for prolonged disease-free survival and may affect long-term outcome. In this setting, administering a repeat course of induction shortly after completion of the first course, known as timed-sequential chemotherapy (TSC), has been tested and may lead to an improved long-term outcome. Whether these results are due to the biologic recruitment of cell cycle-specific agents is unknown. However, this strategy to intensify induction may lead to more profound myelosuppression and to potential toxicities. Here we review the results of timed-sequential chemotherapy, used as induction regimen in de novo, relapsed or refractory AML or used as post-remission therapy, and compare them with those from other types of regimens.
