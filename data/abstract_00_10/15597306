The diluted essential oil of Mentha longifolia (L.) var. chlorodictya Rech F. foliage enhanced the bactericidal activity of nitrofurantoin decreasing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of nitrofurantoin for nitrofurantoin-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of the essential oil detected a fraction (R(f) = 0.35, UV lambda(max) of 232.5), which was the most effective in enhancement of nitrofurantoin activity. Using gas liquid chromatography and known standards, the active fraction was identified as piperitone. 1 microl of the piperitone fraction decreased the MIC of nitrofurantoin 3-20 fold for the different strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested.
