The relevance of H. pylori to the pathogenesis of gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcers has been proposed for about the past 25 years; the presence of this bacterium is now established as the main risk factor in the development of stomach carcinomas and lymphomas. Antibiotic treatment does not always inhibit or kill H. pylori because of the potential side effects of antibiotic resistance. Previous research has indicated that red wines have therapeutic benefits against this bacterium. The purpose of our study was to determine the potential of Italian red wines to inhibit H. pylori in a laboratory medium and to compare their antimicrobial activity with that of red grape juice and with isolated procyanidins. The antiradical capacity of Italian red wines was also determined. In conclusion, a novel approach is offered coupling antioxidant benefits of red wines with synergistic effectiveness.
