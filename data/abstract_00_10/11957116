The ermB and mefE genes are important in terms of their responsibility for macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. We investigated the distribution of the ermB and mefE genes in erythromycin A-resistant S. pneumoniae isolated in our hospital during the period 1995-1998. All amoxicillin-low-susceptible isolates were considered to be resistant to erythromycin A. All isolates with resistance to erythromycin A (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs], > or =0.5 microg/ml) possessed ermB or mefE genes. The MICs of erythromycin A for most mefE-positive isolates ranged from 0.5 to 2 microg/ml. On the other hand, approximately 85% of ermB-positive isolates demonstrated high-level resistance to erythromycin A (MICs, > or =4 microg/ml) while the others showed low-level resistance (MICs, 0.5 to 2 microg/ml). In ermB-positive isolates with low-level resistance, high-level resistant mutants were selected with a frequency of 3.1 x 10(-6)-1.8 x 10(-3) on agar containing 4-32 MIC of erythromycin A, whereas in mefE-positive isolates, no high-level resistant mutants were detected. Mutants from ermB-positive isolates with low-level resistance showed reversibility and heterogeneity. Our data indicated a wide distribution of erythromycin A-resistant isolates with mefE or ermB genes among amoxicillin-low-susceptible S. pneumoniae in Japan. In addition, it is likely that ermB-positive isolates with low-level resistance show heterogeneous high-level resistance.
