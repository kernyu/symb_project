The genes for multidrug efflux pump OqxAB, which is active on fluoroquinolones, were found in human clinical isolates on a plasmid in Escherichia coli and on the chromosome of Klebsiella pneumoniae. IS26-like sequences flanked the plasmid-mediated oqxAB genes, suggesting that they had been mobilized as part of a composite transposon.
