Mupirocin is a unique antibiotic that is produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens, and is available for elimination of nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, there have been many reports that high level mupirocin resistant S. aureus were discovered in Europe, South or North American countries. In Japan, mupirocin has been only available for nasal ointment of MRSA eradication since 1996. After introduction of mupirocin, we have screened mupirocin resistance routinely in our hospital. On January 1998, we had high level mupirocin-resistant MRSA isolated from a nose of a neonate with severe nephrotic syndrome. The mupA was detected by PCR and the mupirocin-resistance could transfer to S. aureus RN2677 by filter-mating with co-transfer of gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin and erythromycin. This strain was eradicated after prophylactic use of vancomycin for her nephrectomy. To our knowledge, this is the first isolate of high level mupirocin-resistant MRSA in Japan.
