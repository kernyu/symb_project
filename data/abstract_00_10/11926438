Changing patterns of pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility present clinicians with difficult choices for antimicrobial prescribing. In particular, multiresistant staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci present problems in many settings. The number of predictably active antimicrobials is decreasing in many centres, with significant consequences for both patients and society as a whole. New antimicrobial options have been few in recent years and several promising quinolones have been compromised by formulation and/or toxicity issues. Nevertheless, the recent introduction of linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin provides clinicians with valuable new options against Gram-positive cocci. These options should further increase with the likely introduction of daptomycin, oritavancin and tigilcycline. A range of surveillance programmes helps monitor the ever-changing patterns of resistance and thus guides clinicians in their empirical prescribing. Empirical use of powerful newer agents may be justifiable in seriously ill patients in those settings, units and countries where there is a substantial background rate of resistance.
