BACKGROUND: The success rate of current anti-Helicobacter pylori triple therapies in now generally 80% or less. Sequential therapy has proved superior. AIM: To test a new sequential therapy for H. pylori eradication. METHODS: This was a pilot study of a sequential therapy consisting of 40 mg of esomeprazole and 1 g amoxicillin t.d.s., for 12 days. On days 6 through 12 gatifloxacin (400 mg in the morning) was added. Outcome was accessed 4 or more weeks after ending antibiotic therapy. Both naive and treatment failures were eligible. RESULTS: Thirty patients were entered in the study. One was lost to follow-up and one stopped early because of side effects. The success rate intention-to-treat was 80% (95% CI: 61-92%). The per-protocol eradication rate was 85.7% (95% CI: 67-95%); two of the four failures had pre-treatment gatifloxacin-resistant H. pylori. Side effects were reported by 13 patients (46%) and were generally mild with diarrhoea being most common (n = 6). Only one patient stopped medicine because of side effects of dizziness (severe) and diarrhoea (mild). CONCLUSIONS: Sequential therapy using the combination of a high dose of proton-pump inhibitor and amoxicillin followed gatifloxacin was effective, but pre-treatment susceptibility testing may become necessary as fluoroquinolone resistance increases.
