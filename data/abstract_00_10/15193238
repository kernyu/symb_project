AIM: To construct regulable DNA vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum by using tetracycline(Tet) regulable system. METHODS: Eukaryotic expression vectors pTL-8/apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) (tTA) and pTL-8/AMA-1(rtTA) gene which express trans-activator (tTA) or reverse trans-activator(rtTA), respectively, and AMA-1 gene of Plasmodium falciparum were constructed. BALB/c mice were immunized with these plasmids and doxycycline (dox) was administered to regulate the expression of AMA-1. For some mice immunized with pTL-8/AMA-1(rtTA), pUHS6-1, a plasmid containing trans-silencer (tTS) to suppress basal expression of AMA-1 from pTL-8/AMA-1(rtTA), was injected into these mice together with pTL-8/AMA-1(rtTA). The sera of the mice were isolated at 2,4,6 and 8 weeks post-immunization and the antibodies specific to AMA-1 were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: pTL-8/AMA-1 and pTL-8/AMA-1(rtTA) were constructed successfully. The mice immunized by pTL-8/AMA-1(tTA) with dox or by pTL-8/AMA-1(rtTA) without dox (at these conditions, AMA-1 was expressed at basal level)developed significant antibodies against AMA-1. Mice immunized by pTL-8/AMA-1(rtTA) and pUHS6-1 without dox did not develop significantly antibodies against AMA-1. In contrast, the mice immunized by pTL-8/AMA-1(rtTA) and pUHS6-1 with dox produced high level of antibodies. CONCLUSION: pTL-8/AMA-1(rtTA) combined with pUHS6-1 is a good regulable DNA vaccine candidate against Plasmodium falciparum.
