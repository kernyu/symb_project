Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is an international surveillance study designed to assess the in vitro activity of tigecycline and 11 comparators against a range of important clinical pathogens from both the community and the hospital. The updated data obtained from the TEST program are integrated in a database server and available with a web application. The website has been designed to disseminate data collected from the international TEST program to the medical community and has been developed to be user-friendly. The use of this program-specific website can be made in a timely manner to extract antimicrobial resistance data of major microorganisms based on chosen selection criteria. This article describes how to use this web-based program for different analyse-types and the multiple options to display search results. Data can be presented in a table or as a graph or diagram, according to the source of the isolate, type of unit, resistance pattern of the pathogen. The website also allows the user to compare the data of antimicrobial testing at a national or regional level. It provides within a few minutes details on the activity of tigecycline and 11 comparators against clinical isolates collected all around the world. Main results of the TEST program on the in vitro activities of tigecyline against more 65,000 clinical isolates throughout the world are presented. The internet gives infectious diseases specialists and microbiologists the opportunity to have immediate access to continuously updated surveillance data. The TEST website should be helpful to clinicians to better select agents in severe infections, particularly for empirical treatment, that is at a time when the choice of the most appropriate antibiotic is essential for the outcome of the patient.
