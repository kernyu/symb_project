A fusidane triterpene, 16-deacetoxy-7-beta-hydroxy-fusidic acid (1), was isolated from a fermentation of the mitosporic fungus Acremonium crotocinigenum. Full unambiguous assignment of all (1)H and (13)C data of 1 was carried out by extensive one- and two-dimensional NMR studies employing HMQC and HMBC spectra. Compound 1 was tested against a panel of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains and showed minimum inhibitory concentration values of 16 microg/ml.
