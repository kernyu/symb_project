The resistance of pathogenic bacteria to current antibiotics has become a crucial public health problem. To combat this resistance, there is a constant need for antibacterial drugs with new modes of action on therapeutic targets. Recent data have shown that a variety of cellular processes essential for bacterial survival and virulence are regulated by the phosphorylation of certain endogenous proteins catalyzed by specific tyrosine kinases. In this article, I highlight a selection of recent findings that confirm the central role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the control of bacterial physiology. Based on this knowledge, potential applications in the discovery of novel antibiotics are proposed.
