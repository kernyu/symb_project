A household survey was conducted in 21 villages of Kwale district, Kenya, to assess farmers' trypanocidal drug use characteristics for treatment of bovine trypanosomosis and their relationship to drug effectiveness. Descriptive statistical tools were used to summarize the farmers' drug use patterns. The chi-square test was the done to establish the relationship between proper drug use and recovery. The results indicate that the farmers had considerable knowledge about trypanocidal drugs with 82% (n = 65) having used these drugs within 6 months preceding the survey. Cases of incorrect drug use were reported. This study established that there was no significant relationship between correct drug use and recovery of the treated animals, suggesting the presence of drug resistance in Kwale district.
