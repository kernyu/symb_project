Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that a virus could undergo rapid mutation in a host deficient in Se, leading to a normally avirulent virus acquiring virulence due to genome changes. Once these mutations occur, even a host with adequate Se-nutriture is susceptible to the newly virulent virus. What influence does the deficiency in Se have on the immune response of the host? Infection with myocarditic strains of coxsackievirus induces an inflammatory response in the cardiac tissue. It is this immune response that induces the heart damage, rather than direct viral effects on the heart tissue. Chemokines are chemo-attractant molecules that are secreted during an infection in order to attract immune cells to the site of the injury, and have been found to be important for the development of coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis. We found that a deficiency in Se influences the expression of mRNA for the chemokine monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1, which may have implications for the development of myocarditis in the Se-deficient host. Expression of mRNA for interferon-gamma was also greatly decreased in the Se-deficient animal. Thus, a deficiency in Se can have profound effects on the host as well as on the virus itself. How the alteration of the immune response of the Se-deficient animal affects the development of the virulent genotype remains to be answered.
