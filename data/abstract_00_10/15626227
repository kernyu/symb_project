Among the population of an alpaca breeding farm, 5 alpacas (22 days to 14 months old) developed focal swellings in the subcutaneous tissues of the head or neck. Infection with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis was confirmed on the basis of results of microbial culture of abscess material and a serum hemolysis inhibition assay to detect C. pseudotuberculosis toxin. The dams of the affected alpacas were seronegative for C. pseudotuberculosis toxin. The affected alpacas underwent surgical excision of the abscesses and were isolated from herdmates for 90 days; treatment was successful, and no other alpacas in the herd became infected. Common risk factors for sources of infection in the affected alpacas included housing in a maternity barn and a pasture. Also, the infection potentially originated from new alpacas introduced into the herd during the preceding 3 months. Infection with C. pseudotuberculosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for camelids with peripheral lymphadenopathy or abscesses in subcutaneous tissues.
