Zymocin, a three-subunit (alpha beta gamma) toxin complex from Kluyveromyces lactis, imposes a cell cycle block on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Phenotypic analysis of the resistant kti10 mutant implies a membrane defect, suggesting that KTI10 represents a gene involved early in the zymocin response. Consistently, KTI10 is shown here to be allelic to PMA1 encoding H(+)-ATPase, a plasma membrane H(+) pump vital for membrane energization (Delta Psi). Like pma1 mutants, kti10 cells lose viability at low pH, indicating a pH homeostasis defect, and resist the antibiotic hygromycin B, uptake of which is known to be Pma1 and Delta Psi sensitive. Similar to kti10 cells, pma1 mutants with reported H(+) pump defects survive in the presence of exozymocin but do not resist endogenous expression of its lethal gamma-toxin subunit. Based on DNA sequence data, kti10 cells are predicted to produce a malfunctional Pma1 variant with expression levels that are normal. Intriguingly, zymocin protection of kti10 cells is suppressed by excess H(+), a scenario ineffective in bypassing resistance of chitin or toxin target mutants. Together with unaltered zymocin docking and gamma-toxin import events in kti10 cells, our data suggest that Pma1's role in zymocin action is likely to involve activation of gamma-toxin in a step following its cellular uptake.
