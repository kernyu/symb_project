Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 192 group B streptococcal isolates from patients with invasive disease demonstrated that 31 (16%) were resistant to erythromycin and 17 (9%) were resistant to clindamycin. One isolate demonstrated high-level resistance to streptomycin, but none was highly resistant to gentamicin. Erythromycin and clindamycin are no longer reliable empirical alternatives to penicillin for the treatment and prevention of group B streptococcal infections.
