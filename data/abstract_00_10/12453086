There has been an increasing interest in the use of mycophenolate as an immunomodulatory drug in neuromuscular diseases. We report five consecutive patients with treatment-resistant chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy or multifocal motor neuropathy who were treated with mycophenolate. None showed clinically significant benefit. The use of mycophenolate did not result in the reduction in the dose of corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive agents in any patient. Side-effects, although not serious, were troubling enough for two patients to stop mycophenolate.
