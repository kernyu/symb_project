The study addressed the ability of the transgenic strain (TM) B. subtilis 2335/pBMB 105 (KmrInf+) to form biofilms on the surface of liquid media of various compositions, inoculated with vegetative cells and spores. The morphological features of these biofilms do not differ from those of the films formed by the recipient strain (WT) B. subtilis 2335 (Kms). However. the TM and the natural one differ in the dynamics of biofilm formation and the cellular composition of the films. Biofilms of the TM are formed earlier, develop at a higher rate, but decompose later than the films of the WT. When the medium is inoculated with vegetative cells, sporulation in the biofilms of both strains undergoes glucose repression; no such effect is observed when the medium is inoculated with spores. The TM does not form films when the medium is inoculated with spores and supplemented with glycerin and kanamycin.
