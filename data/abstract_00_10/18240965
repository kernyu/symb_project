High adherence rates to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy are associated with increased durability of viral suppression and decreased rates of drug resistance. The requirement of twice-daily subcutaneous self-administration of enfuvirtide (ENF) has raised concerns about adherence. This study assesses adherence to ENF and an optimized background (OB) of ARVs and its impact on virological and immunological responses during the TORO trials. Eighty-eight percent of patients in the OB arm reported > or = 85% adherence versus 87% of patients in the ENF + OB arm. Higher overall adherence was associated with improved virological and immunological response in both treatment arms at 48 weeks. In patients with > or = 85% adherence, 33% of patients in the ENF + OB arm achieved HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ml, versus 13% in the OB arm (p < 0.0001). Similarly, patients with > or = 85% adherence in the ENF + OB arm achieved a mean increase in CD4 cell count of 104 cells/mm(3) compared with 58 cells/mm(3) for patients in the OB arm (p < 0.001). None of the demographic factors explored (age, gender, race) or baseline characteristics (CD4 count, viral load, or baseline sensitivity score) was significant in predicting adherence to ENF when analyzed by multiple regression. Importantly, a history of intravenous drug use (IDU) was not associated with a significant decrease in adherence (mean adherence for IDU 96% versus mean adherence for non-IDU 96%; p = 0.825). Adherence was high in patients receiving the self-injectable ARV enfuvirtide. In addition, the inclusion of ENF did not negatively impact adherence to the ARV regimen as a whole.
