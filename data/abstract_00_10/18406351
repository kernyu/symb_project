Cell-based treatments for insulin-dependent diabetes (IDD) may provide more physiologic regulation of blood glucose levels than daily insulin injections, thereby reducing the occurrence of secondary complications associated with diabetes. An autologous cell source is especially attractive for regulatory and ethical reasons in addition to eliminating the need for immunosuppression. This study uses non-beta-cells, genetically modified for physiologic insulin secretion. Enteroendocrine L-cells, exhibit regulated secretion in response to physiologic stimuli and their endogenous products are fully compatible with prandial metabolism. Murine GLUTag L-cells were transfected with a plasmid co-expressing human insulin and neomycin resistance and the stable cell line, GLUTag-INS, was established. Secretion properties of GLUTag-INS cells were investigated in vitro through induced secretion tests using meat hydrolysate or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and forskolin as secretagogues. GLUTag-INS cells rapidly co-secreted recombinant insulin and endogenous glucagon-like peptide in response to metabolic cues from the surrounding medium and demonstrated efficient processing of proinsulin to insulin.
