The long term use of antiretroviral therapy is associated with metabolic and morphological abnormalities named lipodystrophy. The understanding of its epidemiology is in progress. NRTIs and Pls are involved in the origin of these abnormalities. So, NRTIs inhibit mitochondrial gamma polymerase and induce body fat distribution disorders. PIs interfere with lipid metabolism, leading to hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance symptomatology. The diagnosis is made by clinical (far wasting or accumulation, or mixed syndrome) and biological signs (hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperlactacidaemia). Radiological exams can quantify morphological abnormalities. The management consists in drug substitution, diet and exercise, and corrective drugs. Plastic surgery can be useful.
