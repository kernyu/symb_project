Two mutants (BAYr1 and BAYr2) that are 100-fold and >3000-fold resistant, respectively, to the helicase-primase inhibitor (HPI) BAY 57-1293 were derived from a plaque-pure parental strain, HSV-1 SC16 cl-2. BAYr1 has two substitutions in the HSV-1 helicase (UL5) protein (A4 to V; K356 to Q) and BAYr2 has one (G352 to R). It was shown reproducibly that BAYr1 grows to higher titres in tissue culture while BAYr2 grows more slowly than wild-type. Marker transfer experiments confirmed that K356Q and G352R are the drug-resistance mutations and that they are directly associated with differences in virus growth in tissue culture. When BAYr1 was tested in a murine infection model, this virus was shown to be fully pathogenic. We present evidence that single mutations close to a predicted functional domain of an essential HSV-1 replication enzyme (helicase) are associated with drug resistance and virus growth characteristics.
