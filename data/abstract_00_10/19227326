In recent years, the penitentiaries of Russia have tended to show some stabilization of some tuberculosis indices. In 2006, its morbidity and mortality versus 1999 decreased by 3 times and amounted to 1387 and 79 per 100,000, respectively. The spread of its drug-resistant forms has a considerable impact on the deterioration of the tuberculosis epidemic situation. At present the number of patients with primary drug resistance of the total number of bacterial-discharging persons is more than 50%; multidrug resistance is observed in more than 20% of cases. The use of chemotherapy regimen IIb using fluoroquinolones in the intensive-phase chemotherapy in the treatment of destructive pulmonary tuberculosis allowed Mycobacterium tuberculosis polyresistance to isoniazid and rifampicin in combination with other first-line antituberculous agents and multidrug resistance to be overcome in 87 and 79.5% of cases, respectively.
