Campylobacterjejuni is one of the most common causes of bacterial foodborne infection in the United States, and there are reports of resistance of Campylobacter spp. to antimicrobial agents used for the treatment of gastroenteritis. The purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Campylobacter spp. isolated from hog, beef, and chicken carcasses from provincially inspected abattoirs in Ontario. The agar dilution method was performed to measure antimicrobial resistance of the isolates. Antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter isolates from hogs (n = 401), beef (n = 21), and chicken (n = 435) to ampicillin, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and tetracycline was determined. Resistance of chicken, hog, and beef isolates was 14.3, 18.2, and 9.5% to ampicillin; 17.9, 67.3, and 38.1% to azithromycin; 0, 0.5, and 0% to chloramphenicol; 3.7, 1.2, and 0% to ciprofloxacin; 2.3, 46.6, and 4.8% to clindamycin; 6.7, 43.6, and 4.8% to erythromycin; 0.2, 0, and 0% to gentamicin; 5.1, 10.7, and 0% to nalidixic acid; 13.6, 57.4, and 4.8% to streptomycin; and 52.6, 44.1, 42.9% to tetracycline, respectively. The hog isolates had the greatest resistance to seven of the ten antimicrobials tested. Results of this study confirm the existence of antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter to various antimicrobial agents,especially ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, commonly used for treatment of campylobacteriosis in humans.
