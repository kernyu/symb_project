In December 2006, three human specimens were received that were suspected positive for influenza A(H5N1). The specimens were tested using real time PCR. And the presence of A(H5N1) virus was confirmed in 2 patients (16F and 26M), The NA sequence from A(H5N1) positive specimens collected before and after antiviral therapy revealed a mutation (N294S) (N295S according to N1 numbering), previously associated with resistance to oseltamivir. When tested with NA inhibition assays, the two N294S viruses from Egypt exhibited from 57 to 138-fold reduction in susceptibility to oseltamivir, depending on the assay. To our knowledge, this is the first time oseltamivir resistance has been detected in A(H5N1) infecting a human prior to treatment.
