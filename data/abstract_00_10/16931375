The zoonotic potential of Mycobacterium spp has been well documented and has been implicated in cutaneous and subcutaneous nodular disease in humans. Treatment of the infected reptiles is often not recommended, because of the zoonotic potential. Moreover, the often-advanced nature of the disease when diagnosed, the lengthy and expensive treatment regimens, and lack of a reported successful treatment regimen for reptiles usually warrant euthanasia in these patients. Strict attention must be paid to cage hygiene and sanitation to minimize exposure and eliminate the organisms.
