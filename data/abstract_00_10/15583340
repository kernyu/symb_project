From June to October of 2002, a cluster of Escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) was detected in Stockholm. The isolates were grouped into two clones, one of which had already circulated in the same area before the outbreak. CTX-M-type ESBLs and coresistance to ciprofloxacin were identified in the strains.
