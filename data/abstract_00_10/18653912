BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Epidemics of cholera caused by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 (Bengal strain) represent a major public health problem in most developing countries. In view of the reported shift in epidemiology and pattern of antibiotic resistance in this was study carried out to assess the development of resistance to essential drugs like fluoroquinolones during treatment of cholera and cholera like cases in Delhi. METHODS: Faecal specimens collected from 1184 patients with cholera and cholera like illness between 2001-2006 admitted to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, East Delhi were subjected to culture isolation. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of V. cholerae isolates was done by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 1184 faecal samples examined, 670 (56.6%) were positive for V. cholera from 2001- 2006. V. cholerae El Tor Ogawa (54.6%) was more common than serotype Inaba (32.5%). During 2004-2006 V. cholerae Inaba emerged as the predominant serotype. Resistance to nalidixic acid, furazolidone and co-trimoxazole was constantly high (100%). Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) V. cholerae O1 Inaba isolates exhibited increased resistance to ciprofloxacin with MIC >4 microg/ml, but largely all remained susceptible to other antibiotics like, gentamicin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: V. cholerae have a permanent existence in the environment and during the quiescent period, their survival in water bodies allows dissipation of resistance patterns to different serotypes or strains of V. cholerae O1 and therefore there is need for constant observation.
