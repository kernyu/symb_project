Azole resistance in Candida albicans can be due to upregulation of multidrug transporters belonging to ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters (CDR1 and CDR2) or major facilitators (CaMDR1). Upregulation of these genes can also be achieved by exposure to fluphenazine, resulting in specific upregulation of CDR1 and CDR2 and by exposure to benomyl, resulting in specific CaMDR1 upregulation. In this study, these two different states of gene upregulation were used to determine coregulated genes that often share similar functions or similar regulatory regions. The transcript profiles of a laboratory strain exposed to these drugs were therefore determined and compared with those of two matched pairs of azole-susceptible and -resistant strains expressing CDR1 and CDR2 (CDR strains) or CaMDR1 (MDR isolates). The results obtained revealed that, among 42 commonly regulated genes (8.6% of all regulated genes) between fluphenazine-exposed cells and CDR isolates, the most upregulated were CDR1 and CDR2 as expected, but also IFU5, RTA3 (which encodes putative membrane proteins), HSP12 (which encodes heat shock protein), and IPF4065 (which is potentially involved in stress response). Interestingly, all but HSP12 and IPF4065 contain a putative cis-acting drug responsive element in their promoters. Among the 57 genes (11.5% of all regulated genes) commonly regulated between benomyl-exposed cells and MDR isolates, the most upregulated were CaMDR1 as expected but also genes with oxido-reductive functions such as IFD genes, IPF5987, GRP2 (all belonging to the aldo-keto reductase family), IPF7817 [NAD(P)H oxido-reductase], and IPF17186. Taken together, these results show that in vitro drug-induced gene expression only partially mimics expression profiles observed in azole-resistant clinical strains. Upregulated genes in both drug-exposed conditions and clinical strains are drug resistance genes but also genes that could be activated under cell damage conditions.
