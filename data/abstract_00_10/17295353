The resistance of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine represents an emerging problem since neither mode of drug action nor mechanisms of resistance are fully elucidated. We describe a protein expression profiling approach by SELDI-TOF-MS as a useful tool for studying the proteome of malarial parasites. Reproducible and complex protein profiles of the P. falciparum strains K1, Dd2, HB3 and 3D7 were measured on four array types. Hierarchical clustering led to a clear separation of the two major subgroups "resistant" and "sensitive" as well as of the four parasite strains. Our study delivers sets of regulated proteins derived from extensive comparative analyses of 64 P. falciparum protein profiles. A group of 12 peaks reflecting proteome changes under chloroquine treatment and a set of 10 potential chloroquine resistance markers were defined. Three of these regulated peaks were preparatively enriched, purified and identified. They were shown to represent the plasmodial EXP-1 protein, also called circumsporozoite-related antigen, as well as the alpha- and beta- (delta-) chains of human hemoglobin.
