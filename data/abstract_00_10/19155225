OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to compare the efficacies of telavancin and vancomycin against glycopeptide-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) and heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) in a neutropenic murine bacteraemia model. METHODS: Immunocompromised mice (female non-Swiss albino, 18-30 g) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10(7) cfu/mL of GISA (strain HIP-5836 or Mu50) or hVISA (strain Mu3). Infected mice received a subcutaneous dose of telavancin (40 mg/kg) or vancomycin (110 mg/kg) at 4 and 16 h post-inoculation. Control animals received a subcutaneous dose of vehicle at 4 h post-inoculation only. Blood and spleen bacterial titres were quantified in drug-treated mice at 16, 28 and 52 h post-inoculation. RESULTS: Telavancin was 8-fold more potent than vancomycin against HIP-5836 (MIC 1 versus 8 mg/L), 16-fold more potent against Mu50 (MIC 0.5 versus 8 mg/L) and 8-fold more potent against Mu3 (MIC 0.25 versus 2 mg/L). Telavancin produced significant (P < 0.05) and sustained reductions in blood and spleen titres from pre-treatment levels in mice infected with HIP-5836, Mu50 or Mu3. Vancomycin lowered blood and spleen HIP-5836 counts transiently, but did not lower blood or spleen Mu50 or Mu3 counts significantly at any timepoint. Reductions in blood and spleen HIP-5836 and Mu3 titres and in spleen Mu50 titres at 52 h post-inoculation were significantly greater with telavancin than vancomycin (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin was more efficacious than vancomycin in clearing infections caused by GISA strains HIP-5836 and Mu50 and hVISA strain Mu3 in a neutropenic mouse bacteraemia model. Further evaluation of telavancin for GISA and hVISA bacteraemia is warranted.
