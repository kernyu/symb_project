This paper reports the synthesis and the antiviral activities of new double-prodrugs against HIV based on the known mixed SATE (S-acyl-2-thioethyl) prodrug approach. The monophosphate of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) d4T was masked with one SATE group and one aromatic group through which a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) was linked. Double-prodrug 1 was a hybrid between d4T monophosphate and the known NNRTI MKC-442, which were linked through a labile p-hydroxybenzoyl protection group in the N-3 position of MKC-442. Double-prodrugs 2 and 3 were conjugates between d4T monophosphate and the new NNRTIs 15 and 19 linked through a stable phenolic linker that was a part of the N-1 substituents of the NNRTIs. The double-prodrugs 1, 2, and 3 all had good activities against wild-type HIV-1, Y181C mutant, and also against a HIV-2 strain that was resistant to NNRTIs.
