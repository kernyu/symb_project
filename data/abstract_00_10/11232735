Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Bacterial pathogens are implicated in about half the episodes of AECB. Empirical antibacterials have a significant benefit in AECB; however, several recent developments have considerably complicated antibacterial choice for this condition. New fluoroquinolone antibacterials introduced in the last decade are theoretically well suited for the treatment of AECB, as the in vitro antimicrobial spectrum of these drugs includes all the major pathogens involved. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the new fluoroquinolones are superior to many other antibacterials used to treat AECB. In trials, clinical success with the new fluoroquinolones was equivalent and bacteriological success was occasionally superior to nonfluoroquinolone comparators. However, these clinical trials did not assess several potentially important end-points for which the theoretical superiority of the fluoroquinolones may translate into differences in outcome. Rare but serious adverse effects with some of the new fluoroquinolones have shaken the confidence of prescribing physicians in this class of drugs. Emergence of the resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to fluoroquinolones has raised concerns about indiscriminate and widespread use of the new agents for trivial infections. Patients with AECB are a heterogeneous population who should be stratified in order to appropriately choose empirical antibacterial therapy. Highly efficacious antibacterial therapy, such as the new fluoroquinolones, is appropriate as a first-line choice for patients who have risk factors for a poor outcome or are in intensive care units. Such selected use of the new fluoroquinolones balances individual benefit with societal concerns of the use of these agents for AECB.
