Candidaemia is increasingly important in intensive care units (ICUs). Compared with Candida albicans fungaemia, the impact of C. glabrata fungaemia on ICU patients is not well-known. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features, the antifungal susceptibility and the treatment outcomes of C. glabrata fungaemia in ICU patients. The medical records of ICU patients with candidaemia between 2000 and 2005 were reviewed retrospectively, and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed for isolates of C. glabrata. Among 147 episodes of candidaemia occurring in adult ICUs, C. glabrata was the second most common species and accounted for 45 (30%) episodes of candidaemia. The incidence of C. glabrata fungaemia was 1.3/1000 ICU admissions. Fluconazole resistance was found in 11% of C. glabrata isolates. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 58%. Therapeutic regimens containing amphotericin B were associated with better outcome. Despite higher fluconazole resistance, C. glabrata candidaemia was not associated with greater mortality than non-glabrata candidaemia in the ICU setting.
