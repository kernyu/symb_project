BACKGROUND: The primary treatment regimen for Helicobacter pylori infection for Kuwaitis does not contain metronidazole, but that for expatriates does. There is also increasing failure of antimicrobial therapy. AIM: To determine the susceptibility of H. pylori from upper gastrointestinal biopsies of Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis to find out if differences existed in the susceptibilities of the isolates from the two different populations. METHODS: The susceptibilities of 96 H. pylori isolates were tested against metronidazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and tetracycline by the E test. The rdxA gene was analysed from selected metronidazole-susceptible and metronidazole-resistant strains to find out polymorphism and the basis of metronidazole resistance. RESULTS: Approximately, 70% of isolates from both populations were metronidazole resistant with 65% isolates showing high minimum inhibitory concentration values of >256 mug/mL. No resistance to the other three antimicrobials was found. There were novel nonsense and missense mutations with no deletion in the rdxA gene by insertion of mini-IS605. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and level of metronidazole resistance in H. pylori in the two populations was high with no difference, in spite of different treatment regimens. Metronidazole resistance in this transitional country appeared to be independent of prior metronidazole use for treatment of H. pylori infection.
