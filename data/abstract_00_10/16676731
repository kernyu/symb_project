An active surveillance for nosocomial infections has been lead in a Thoracic Surgery with the intention, first to point out their frequency and characteristics, and then to outline all the measures to remove the main risk factors checking the results obtained. A prospective incidence study has been promoted in a Thoracic Surgery in the years 2000, 2001, 2002. The analysis has been lead weekly gathering all necessary data from the health records and making laboratory tests to look for microbes growth in the air of Thoracic Surgery Operating Rooms. A nosocomial infections incidence of 13.3% among surgically treated patients has been registered in 2000. Deep surgical site infections were the most frequent localizations, and microbes isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus with an high oxacillin resistance (70.6%-76.5%). From the observation of the risk factors the sterilization system has been modified and the assistance and environmental protocols have been improved. In the further evaluation period, a global reduction of nosocomial infections incidence (7.1%), of surgical site infections (from 10.1% to 4.5%) (p = 0.007), of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus isolations have been obtained even if short results in antibiotic resistances have been registered. Thoracic Surgery has to be considered an area at medium-high risk of nosocomial infections. The quite high incidence of nosocomial infections recorded at the beginning of the study in presence of prevalent deep surgical site infections from staphylococci with an high oxacillin resistance compelled to promote corrections. These lead to a remarkable decrease in incidence of nosocomial infections even if the same results can not be reached in antibiotic resistances.
