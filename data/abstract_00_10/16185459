OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecule epidemic for 7 genes interrelated penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin resistance of isolated Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) in children at Suzhou area. METHODS: (1) Thirty-one pneumococcal isolates were collected from respiratory tract secretions of children with respiratory diseases from Nov 2002 to Apr 2003 at the Children's Hospital of Suzhou University (reference strain ATCC49619). (2) Penicillin susceptibility was determined by E-test, while erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin were determined by K-B disk. (3) The detecting of pbp2B, ermA/B, mefA, tetM, vanA, vanB genes by PCR, Sequencing pbp2B genes, Contrasting pbp2B DNA sequences among pneumococcal isolates and SP R6 [penicillin sensitive (www.ncbi.nlm.gov/nucleotide, NC-003098)]. RESULTS: Of thirty-one isolates studied, the results were shown as follows; (1) Penicillin sensibility 38.7% (n = 12), penicillin resistance 61.3% (n = 19), pbp2B mutation 64.5% (n = 20); (2) Erythromycin sensibility 9.7% (n = 3), erythromycin resistance 90.3% (n = 28), ermA/B 71% (n = 22), mefA 32.1% (n = 10), ermA/B + mefA 87.1% (n = 27); (3) Tetracycline sensibility 9.7% (n = 3), tetracycline resistance 90.3% (n = 28), tetM 90.3% (n = 28); (4) Vancomycin sensibility 100% (n = 31), vanA, vanB all 0%. CONCLUSION: Among pneumococcal isolates at our area, penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline resistance were high, vancomycin was sensitive. Detecting 7 genes interrelated penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin resistance expressed genotypies for antibiotic resistances in pneumococcal isolates.
