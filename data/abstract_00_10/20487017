We report a Serratia marcescens and an Escherichia coli isolate simultaneously detected in the same patient. Both isolates showed susceptibility patterns suggestive of harbouring a plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (pACBL) and a plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance (PMQR). PCR-based replicon, MOB typing, plasmid profile and Southern hybridization analyses revealed that both isolates coharboured bla(DHA-1) and qnrB genes on the same IncL/M-MOB(P13) plasmid approximately 70 kb in size. Together with the fact that both plasmids were conjugative in the laboratory, these results strongly suggest that a horizontal transfer event could take place in vivo. This is the first report of an isolate of S. marcescens harbouring a pACBL. The only phenotypic method that suggests the presence of a pACBL in an isolate harbouring an inducible chromosomal AmpC enzyme is the observation of scattered colonies near the edge of the inhibition zones of some beta-lactams. The presence of both resistance genes on the same plasmid and the reported increase in PMQR could perhaps explain the widespread distribution of bla(DHA-1) genes.
