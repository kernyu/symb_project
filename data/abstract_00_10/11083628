The early bactericidal activity of the aminoglycoside paromomycin (aminosidine) in doses of 7.5 and 15 mg/kg of body weight was measured in 22 patients with previously untreated smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. The fall in log(10) CFU per milliliter of sputum per day during the first 2 days of treatment for 7 patients receiving a paromomycin dosage of 7.5 mg/kg/day was 0.066, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.216 and confidence limits from -0.134 to 0.266, and that for 15 patients receiving 15 mg/kg/day was 0.0924, with an SD of 0.140 and confidence limits from 0.015 to 0.170. The difference between the mean and zero was not significant for the 7. 5-mg/kg dose group but was significant for the 15-mg/kg dose group (t = 2.55, P = 0.023). Since paromomycin has no cross-resistance with streptomycin and has no greater toxicity than other aminoglycosides, these results suggest that it has the potential to substitute for streptomycin in antituberculosis regimens and may be a particularly valuable addition to the drug armamentarium for the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
