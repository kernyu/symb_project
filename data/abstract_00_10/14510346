A retrospective analysis was done of the resistance pattern of urinary tract pathogens isolated over a 4 months period in a tertiary care hospital. There were a total of 871 clinical isolates comprising of 793 gram negative bacilli and 78 gram positive cocci obtained from 5477 consecutive urine samples. Extended spectrum beta lactamase production was observed in 71.5% of the gram negative bacilli; of these 6.18% were also inhibitor resistant. High level aminoglycoside resistance was observed in 70.17% of Enterococcus isolates while methicillin resistance was documented in 23.8% of the Staphylococcus isolates. A high level of resistance was also noted for ciprofloxacin. Multidrug resistance is a common problem in hospitals which emphasizes the need for judicious use of antimicrobial agents and their continuous in vitro monitoring.
