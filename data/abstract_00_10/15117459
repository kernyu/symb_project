Genetic sequence alignment of the transmembrane region from HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 isolates was performed to examine their potential susceptibility to fusion inhibitors enfuvirtide (T-20) and T-1249. A high genetic diversity within the HRI and HR2 domains was found, which should compromise any antiviral effect of T-20 on HIV-2 and HIV-1 group O viruses. However, conserved sequences in the gp41 regions from HIV-1 group O involved in T-1249 susceptibility might result in a much broader antiviral effect of T-1249 on HIV-1 variants. In contrast, genetic diversity in those regions make unlikely any activity of these compounds on HIV-2.
