Garenoxacin is a new des-F(6)-quinolone with broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. We used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to characterize the time course of antimicrobial activity of garenoxacin and determine which pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) parameter best correlated with efficacy. Serum drug levels following three fourfold-escalating single-dose levels of garenoxacin were measured by microbiologic assay. In vivo postantibiotic effects (PAEs) were determined after doses of 16 and 64 mg/kg of body weight. Mice had 10(6.5) to 10(6.7) CFU of Streptococcus pneumoniae strain ATCC 10813 or Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 33591 per thigh when they were treated for 24 h with garenoxacin at a dose of 4 to 128 mg/kg/day fractionated for 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-hour dosing regimens. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which PK-PD parameter best correlated with the measurement of CFU/thigh at 24 h. Pharmacokinetic studies yielded peak/dose values of 0.2 to 0.3, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/dose values of 0.1 to 0.5, and half-lives of 0.7 to 1.6 h. Garenoxacin produced in vivo PAEs of 1.4 to 8.2 h with S. pneumoniae ATCC 10813, 7.6 to >12.4 h with S. aureus ATCC 25923, and 0 to 1.5 h with Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816. The 24-h AUC/MIC ratio was the PK-PD parameter that best correlated with efficacy (R2=71 to 90% for the two organisms compared with 43 to 56% for the peak/MIC ratio and 47 to 75% for percent time above the MIC [% T>MIC]). In subsequent studies we used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to determine if the magnitude of the AUC/MIC ratio needed for efficacy of garenoxacin varied among pathogens (including resistant strains). Mice had 10(5.9) to 10(7.2) CFU of 6 strains of S. aureus (2 methicillin resistant), 11 strains of S. pneumoniae (5 penicillin susceptible, 1 penicillin intermediate, and 5 penicillin resistant, and of the resistant strains, 3 were also ciprofloxacin resistant), and 4 gram-negative strains per thigh when treated for 24 h with 1 to 64 mg of garenoxacin per kg every 12 h. A sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the doses (mg/kg/24 h) required to achieve a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h. MICs ranged from 0.008 to 4 microg/ml. The free drug 24-h AUC/MIC ratios for each static dose (2.8 to 128 mg/kg/day) varied from 8.2 to 145. The mean 24-h AUC/MIC ratios +/- standard deviations for S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and gram-negative strains were 33 +/- 18, 81 +/- 37, and 33 +/- 30, respectively. Methicillin, penicillin, or ciprofloxacin resistance did not alter the magnitude of the AUC/MIC ratio required for efficacy.
