Nosocomial infection causes substantial morbidity and mortality among neonates treated in the neonatal intensive care setting. Colonization and subsequent infection of central venous catheters leading to catheter-related bloodstream infection is among the most common causes of nosocomial sepsis in this patient population. Prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection is a major challenge and numerous strategies have been attempted in this context with varying success. Given the dynamic epidemiology of nosocomial infection among neonates and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, novel prevention strategies are urgently required.
