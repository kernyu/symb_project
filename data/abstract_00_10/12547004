Large-scale comparative analysis of drug-target polymorphism structures enables the rational design of next generation 'super drugs'--drugs that are less prone to development of drug resistance or that work for the largest possible fraction of the patient population. Furthermore, knowledge of the drug-target-shape repertoire that exists within the patient population enables predictions of likely clinical trial outcomes and response rates for drug efficacy. This gives information on the optimal drug candidates before the initiation of clinical trials. The economic impact of incorporating pharmacogenomics insights early on in the drug discovery process will be substantial and will afford significant competitive advantages to companies that successfully incorporate this technology.
