This study represents the first beta-tubulin sequence from a trematode parasite, namely, the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica. PCR of genomic DNA showed that at least one beta-tubulin gene from F. hepatica contains no introns. A number of amino acids in the primary sequence of fluke tubulin are different from those described previously in various nematode species and the cestode, Echinococcus multilocularis. beta-Tubulin is an important target for benzimidazole anthelmintics, although (with the exception of triclabendazole) they show limited activity against F. hepatica. The amino acid differences in fluke beta-tubulin are discussed in relation to the selective toxicity of benzimidazoles against helminths and the mechanism of drug resistance.
