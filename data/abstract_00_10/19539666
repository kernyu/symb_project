A competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique called Tetra primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR was adapted to identify a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in beta-tubulin gene of Botrytis cinerea. Over the 35 isolates analyzed, six of them showed a SNP in that gene, which was readily identified by the technique and in the six cases correspond to the resistant strain.
