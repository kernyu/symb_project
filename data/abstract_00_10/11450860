160 Salmonella strains were isolated from children at the paediatrics department of Ankara University. 48.1% of the isolates were Salmonella enteritidis, 41.9% Salmonella typhimurium and 10% other serotypes. For the analysis of data, the study period was divided into 2 periods: 1993-95 and 1996-99. A decline in the isolation rate of S. typhimurium (from 63.1% to 30.1%) and rapid rise in S. enteritidis (from 31.6% to 57.3) was observed during the review period. However, for S. typhimurium isolates, the 5-drug (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline and sulfonamides) pattern of resistance was increased from 13.5% to 38.7% in the second period. Since S. enteritidis and 5-drug-resistant S. typhimurium have also increased in other countries, their pandemic spread in humans indicates the continuing importation and exportation of these pathogens.
