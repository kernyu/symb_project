OBJECTIVE: To present the first documented case of acute infectious gastroenteritis caused by high-level ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium in Kuwait. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Isolation from stool specimen and species identification of current enteric pathogen was carried out according to standard methods. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by the disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured with E-test strips. The production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was studied by the double disc synergy method and E-test ESBL strips. Plasmid DNA isolation was performed by the rapid alkaline lysis method. Plasmid DNA was transferred by conjugation to a recipient strain of Escherichia coli. RESULTS: The isolate of S. enterica serotype typhimurium was resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC >256 mg/l), cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and produced ESBL. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime resistance were co-transferred on a 3.2-kb plasmid to the E. coli recipient strain. Loss of the 3.2-kb plasmid from the transconjugant resulted in the co-loss of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime resistance confirming the carriage of ceftriazone resistance on the 3.2-kb plasmid. CONCLUSION: Plasmid-mediated high-level resistance to ceftriaxone and ESBL production in Salmonella serotype typhimurium is an emerging problem among Salmonella that requires closer monitoring of antimicrobial resistance among these bacterial species.
