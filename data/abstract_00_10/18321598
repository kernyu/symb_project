OBJECTIVE: To describe a consecutive series of children with refractory tympanostomy tube otorrhea treated with linezolid and document its clinical effectiveness and adverse effects. DESIGN: Retrospective, single institution case series. METHODS: The records of children treated with linezolid for refractory gram-positive otorrhea from 2003 to 2007 were analyzed for causative organisms, antimicrobial sensitivities, history of prior medical treatments, time to cessation of otorrhea, adverse effects of linezolid and recurrence of infection. RESULTS: Ten episodes of refractory gram-positive otorrhea treated with linezolid were documented among eight children during the study period. Seven were caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and three by multiple-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Prior treatment regimes included clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole/rifampin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and/or a third-generation cephalosporin. Seven of eight children had failed extended courses of fluoroquinolone ear drops. All children were free of otorrhea by the 14th day of twice-daily treatment with oral linezolid at 20mg/kg/day. One child developed two additional episodes of S. aureus otorrhea three and 10 months after initial treatment. Each was successfully controlled with linezolid. There were no adverse effects from linezolid treatment. CONCLUSION: Oral linezolid is highly effective in the treatment of refractory otorrhea caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus and multiple drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. It has a low risk of serious side effects. It is one of only a few oral agents with activity against these organisms and is very expensive. Linezolid should be used only when otorrhea cannot be treated with conventional agents or when complications of otitis media pose a risk to life or function.
