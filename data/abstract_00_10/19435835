PURPOSE: In vitro data suggest that down-regulation of thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) expression from TXR1 is associated with resistance to taxane-based chemotherapy. The prognostic and predictive value of tumoral expression of both genes was evaluated in patients with lung adenocarcinoma treated with first-line docetaxel and gemcitabine. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor samples from 96 patients, with stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) or IV lung adenocarcinomas, were analyzed for TXR1 and TSP1 mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR, from microdissected cells derived from patients' primary tumors. RESULTS: The mRNA levels of the two genes were inversely correlated (Spearman's test = -0.49; P < 0.0001). Patients with low TXR1 mRNA levels experienced a longer median time to tumor progression (TTP; P < 0.0001) and median overall survival (mOS; P = 0.001) when compared with patients with high TXR1 expression. Patients with high TSP1 expression presented longer TTP (P = 0.002) and mOS (P < 0.0001) when compared with patients with low TSP1 expression. Moreover, patients with high TSP1 and low TXR1 expression (n = 36) presented higher prolonged TTP (P = 0.009) and mOS (P < 0.0001) compared with patients with high TXR1 and low TSP1 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that high TXR1/low TSP1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for decreased TTP (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.27; P = 0.016) and mOS (hazard ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-4.15; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: These data confirm the in vitro model of TSP1 and TXR1 effect on taxane resistance in lung adenocarcinomas and merit further evaluation.
