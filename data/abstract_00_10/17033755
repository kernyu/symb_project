Candida endophthalmitis accounts for the majority of fungal endophthalmitis. Despite its clinical relevance there are no controlled trials on different treatment regimens. We report a case of endogenous endophthalmitis caused by azole-resistant Candida albicans following abdominal surgery in an otherwise healthy woman, and review the literature concerning treatment recommendations. In consideration of the serious outcome with loss of sight in insufficiently treated endophthalmitis we like to increase awareness to this disease entity and the possibility of azole-resistance, even in treatment-naive patients.
