5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is known to modulate expression of particular genes, and eventually arrest cell division in mammalian and yeast cells. To study a molecular basis for these phenomena, we adopted a genetic approach with a yeast cell system. We screened multicopy suppressor genes that confer resistance to BrdU with a thymidine-auxotrophic strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One of such genes was found to encode Ham1 protein, which was originally identified as a possible triphosphatase for N-6-hydroxylaminopurine triphosphate. Consistent with this, overexpression of the HAM1 gene reversed growth arrest caused by BrdU, and blocked incorporation of BrdU into genomic DNA. On the contrary, disruption of the gene sensitized cells to BrdU. A crude extract from Ham1-overproducing cells showed a high activity to hydrolyze BrdUTP to BrdUMP and pyrophosphate in addition to abnormal purine nucleotides. Purified recombinant Ham1 protein showed the same activity. These results demonstrate that Ham1 protein detoxifies abnormal pyrimidine as well as purine nucleotides.
