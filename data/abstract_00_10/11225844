Spontaneous and induced cancers are rare in non-isogeneic or inbred amphibians. Neoplastic cells become immortalized through loss of a normal capacity to die by apoptosis. Mature lymphocytes of mammals require activation and entry into the cell cycle in order to become susceptible to apoptosis. Whether Xenopus lymphocytes differ from mammalian lymphocytes in this regard is examined. In vitro exposure of PMA, or its analogue, MPMA, to adult splenocytes of Xenopus laevis was used to affect apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis of FITC-Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence (apoptosis) and BrdU uptake (DNA synthesis) were assayed concurrently in the same lymphocyte population over time. Significant increases in apoptotic levels were induced throughout a 72 hour period in PMA-treated cells only. Lymphocytes were also separated by size for analysis. Several subpopulations of lymphocytes were identified, the most interesting of which was small and apoptotic within 4 hours, after PMA exposure. PMA-induced DNA synthesis did not become elevated until after 24 hours. "Direct" apoptosis, i.e. without cell cycle entry, was found only in these small, mature lymphocytes. Since small lymphocytes make up the vast majority of those being analyzed, "direct" apoptosis may be a determining mechanism in the resistance to neoplasia observed in Amphibia. Cells that die more readily are less likely to transform into neoplastic cells.
