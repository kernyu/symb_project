A comparative study of the in vivo sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to amodiaquine versus chloroquine has been made among children in Agou (south Cote d'Ivoire). In case of resistance to these drugs, the association of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was administered and followed by a J14 checking. We have noticed: (1) 8.47% of amodiaquine resistance versus 36.96% of chloroquine resistance (all these resistances are from type II), (2) a good clinical efficiency of the 4 amino quinolines. Only 1.69% of the subjects having resistant stocks to amodiaquine have gone feverish down to J7 whereas 10.47% of subjects have clinically resisted to chloroquine, (3) a good tolerance of drugs and an excellent clinical and parasitological efficiency of the second intention treatment. These data are in favour of using first the 4 amino quinolines (particularly the amodiaquine) in the treatment of simple bout of malaria to Plasmodium falciparum in this region. In case of resistance to these drugs, we recommend the combination sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
