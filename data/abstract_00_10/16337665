Plasmodium falciparum in-vitro susceptibility to chloroquine (CQ), monodesethylamodiaquine, quinine and dihydroartemisinin was investigated in Rwandan patients with a parasitaemia of at least >or=4000/microl. The study was carried out in November-December 2003. Dihydroartemisinin was the most potent (GM IC(50)=2.6nmol/l, 95% CI 2.2-3.2) among the drugs tested. Resistance to chloroquine was 45% (33/74) and that to monodesethylamodiaquine 7% (5/74). All the tested isolates were susceptible to quinine. The mean IC(50) of monodesethylamodiaquine, quinine and dihydroartemisinin was significantly higher for chloroquine-resistant than for chloroquine-sensitive strains (P<0.05). The IC(50) of each drug was significantly and positively correlated to that of the other three drugs (P<0.005), and this correlation was higher between CQ and monodesethylamodiaquine (r=0.8). In-vitro CQ resistance is linked to that of the other drugs tested. Most worrying is the positive correlation between the IC(50) of dihydroartemisinin and the other drugs, more particularly with CQ, suggesting an increased tolerance of the parasites to all drugs.
