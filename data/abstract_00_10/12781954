The effect of several biocides and thermal treatments on the viability of four Lactobacillus delbrueckii phages was investigated. Time to achieve 99% inactivation of phages at 63 and 72 degrees C in three suspension media (Tris Magnesium Gelatin (TMG) buffer, Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) broth and reconstituted nonfat dry skim milk (RSM)) was calculated. Thermal resistance depended on the phage considered, but a marked heat-resistance was exhibited by one phage (Ib(3)) since its high titre suspensions were completely inactivated only after 45 min at 72 degrees C or 15 min at 90 degrees C. A clear protective effect of the milk was revealed when the three suspension media were compared. As regards to the effects of biocides on phages, only peracetic acid was found to be effective for inactivating high titre suspensions. Ethanol, even at a concentration of 100%, was not suitable to assure no surviving phage particles and isopropanol turned out to be less effective than ethanol. Sodium hypochlorite at 200-400 ppm inactivated the phages completely, except phage Ib(3), which was only destroyed after treatments with 1200 ppm. The diversity observed in the heat and biocide resistance of L. delbrueckii phages is useful to establish a basis for adopting the most effective thermal and chemical treatments for inactivating them in dairy plants and laboratory environments.
