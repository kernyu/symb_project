During the past decade, liposomal amphotericin B has been used with increasing frequency to treat visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The World Health Organization convened a workshop to review current knowledge and to develop guidelines for liposomal amphotericin B use for VL. In Europe, liposomal amphotericin B is widely used to treat VL. In Africa and Asia, the VL disease burden is high and drug access is poor; liposomal amphotericin B is available only through preferential pricing for nonprofit groups in East Africa. Clinical trials and experience demonstrate high efficacy and low toxicity for liposomal amphotericin B (total dose, 20 mg/kg) in immunocompetent patients with VL. Combination trials in areas with antileishmanial drug resistance, and treatment and secondary prophylaxis trials in VL-human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected patients, are important to safeguard the current armamentarium and to optimize regimens. The public health community should work to broaden access to preferential liposomal amphotericin B pricing by public sector VL treatment programs.
