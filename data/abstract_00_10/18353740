Urinary tract infections are more frequent in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics, or take a more severe course. The difference is more pronounced in women both in symptomatic infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria. The spectrum of pathogens is similar to that of non-diabetic patients. In case of cystitis, the treatment strategy the same that is recommended in non-diabetic patients (due to lack of clinical trials) but because of the more frequent renal involvement a highly effective antibiotic therapy is suggested. In pyelonephritis, parenteral therapy and close observation are recommended that may require hospitalisation. The administration of doxycycline or cotrimoxazole is not recommended in empiric therapy because of the high resistance rate of E. coli , but even the choice of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or a fluoroquinolone is questionable for empiric therapy in severe infections. At present, the most effective oral antibiotics are the 3. generation cephalosporins. Routine screening of bacteriuria is not recommended in diabetic patients, the administration of antibiotic does not prevent the further symptomatic episodes.
