Data on the use of antibiotics were collected by means of a questionnaire from 49 hospitals in south-western France. Use was expressed as a usage density rate: number of defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 patient-days. The average use of antibiotics amounted to 402 DDDs per 1000 patient-days and varied between 60 and 734. In acute-care wards, the amount of antibiotic use increased with the size of the hospital: 461 DDDs per 1000 patient-days for group A (<100 beds), 510 DDDs per 1000 patient-days for group B (more than 100 and less then 300 beds) and 676 DDDs per 1000 patient-days for group C (>300 beds). The rate of use differed among different types of hospital areas and varied from 58 for psychiatry departments to more than 1273 DDDs per 1000 patient-days for the infectious diseases departments. Broad-spectrum penicillins were the most frequently prescribed antibiotics. Fluoroquinolone and third-generation cephalosporin use were relatively uniform in the three size categories. This study shows that it is possible for a hospital to benchmark its consumption with other hospitals that are similar in size. In this way, surveillance of antibiotic use can aid hospitals in targeting infection control efforts.
