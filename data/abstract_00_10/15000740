The treatment of systemic infections, especially meningitis, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae nonsusceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, is extremely difficult due to the paucity of therapeutic options. The main objective of this study was to characterize isolates of S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime (MICs, > or = 1 microg/ml) by different typing methods and to evaluate whether clonal dissemination of this pathogen had occurred among Latin American medical centers. A total of 46 isolates collected from respiratory tract specimens, blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, eye, and other sources were analyzed. The isolates were collected from Latin American medical centers located in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay through two multicenter surveillance programs, in 1997 and 1998. Isolates were serotyped and molecular typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and automated ribotyping. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined to 19 drugs by reference broth microdilution methods. Ten isolates (21.7%) had cefotaxime MICs > or = 2 microg/ml, whereas 36 (78.3%) had cefotaxime MIC results at 1 microg/ml. All isolates were susceptible to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. The isolates were distributed among five major serotypes (%): 23F (39.1%), 14 (32.6%), 19F (23.9%), 9V (2.2%), and 6B (2.2%). However, distinct molecular patterns were detected among isolates with a unique serotype. Six and four PFGE patterns were identified among isolates with serotype 23F and 19F, respectively. When PFGE and automated ribotyping analyses were combined, four clusters were identified. The largest cluster (10 isolates) was represented by isolates with ribotype 18-2, major PFGE pattern I, and serotype 14. ATCC 700671 (international clone Spain 9V-3) also showed ribotype 18-2. This clone was detected in four countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. A second cluster (8 isolates) were characterized by isolates with ribotype 17-4, PFGE type D, and serotype 23F, similar to ATCC 700669 (international clone Spain23F-1). Isolates from this cluster were identified in three countries: Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. Our results indicated that clonal dissemination of S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime has occurred in Latin America mainly among serogroups 14, 19F, and 23F.
