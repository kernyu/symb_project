Qnr determinants have now been found worldwide. In 2008, among 6150 Enterobacteriaceae, 12 isolates belonging to different bacterial species showing an unusual quinolone resistance pattern on Vitek2 system were investigated. Of 12, 11 harbored a qnr gene. Without QRDR modifications, qnr genes can be detected based on a Vitek2 resistance phenotype.
