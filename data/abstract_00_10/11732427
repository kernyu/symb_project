The Ad hoc Group of experts on antimicrobial resistance of the Office International des Epizooties has developed a guideline on the standardisation and harmonisation of laboratory methodologies used for the detection and quantification of antimicrobial resistance. The existing methods (disk diffusion [including concentration gradient strips], agar dilution and broth dilution) are reviewed, including a comparison of their advantages and disadvantages. The definitions of resistance characteristics of bacteria (susceptible, intermediate and resistant) are addressed and the criteria for the establishment of breakpoints are discussed. Due consideration has to be given to these aspects in the interpretation and comparison of resistance monitoring or surveillance data. The use of validated laboratory methods and the establishment of quality assurance (internal and external) for microbiological laboratory work and the reporting of quantitative test results is recommended. Equivalence of different methods and laboratory test results is also recommended to be established by external proficiency testing, which should be achieved by the means of a reference laboratory system. This approach allows the comparison of test results obtained using different methods generated by laboratories in different countries.
