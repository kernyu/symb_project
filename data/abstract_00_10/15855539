The florfenicol/chloramphenicol resistance gene floR was found to be part of the novel 4,284-bp transposon TnfloR from Escherichia coli. TnfloR consists of the gene floR, a putative regulatory gene, and the transposase gene tnpA. A circular form of TnfloR was detected and suggested the potential mobility of this transposon.
