There is worldwide concern about the development of antimicrobial resistance [1]. Selective pressure by antimicrobial drugs is by far the most important driving force for the development of resistance. Antimicrobial drugs are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in hospitals. In developed countries, some 30% of the hospitalized patients will be treated with these drugs. It is generally accepted that antimicrobial prescribing is often suboptimal, even in a country like the Netherlands, where both antibiotic consumption and microbial resistance rates are low [2,3]. The major problem with inappropriate prescribing is because of insufficient education in infectious diseases and antimicrobial therapy. Often, the prescription of these drugs with little toxicity is unjustified because of insecurity about the diagnosis of the clinician; 'drugs of fear' [4]. In our surveys, some 15% of the antibiotic prescriptions in surgical and internal medicine wards were considered unjustified [5,6]. Many prescribers are not yet fully aware that their justified or unjustified prescription adds to the resistance problem. In this paper, aspects of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing in the hospital setting will be discussed.
