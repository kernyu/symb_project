Although there are ever increasing reports of extraintestinal human infections caused by Aeromonads, in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients, respiratory tract infections remain uncommon. We describe a case of aspiration pneumonia in an immunocompetent patient with multiple sclerosis, caused by a community acquired, multidrug resistant strain of Aeromonas hydrophila sensitive only to meropenem. The case highlights the clinical significance of Aeromonas hydrophila as a respiratory pathogen, as well as the community origin of multidrug resistance and the utility of newer carbapenems in such cases.
