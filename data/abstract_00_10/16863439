The multi-drug resistance protein 2 (MRP2; ABCC2) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter playing an important role in detoxification and chemoprotection by transporting a wide range of compounds, especially conjugates of lipophilic substances with glutathione, glucuronate and sulfate, which are collectively known as phase II products of biotransformation. In addition, MRP2 can also transport uncharged compounds in cotransport with glutathione, and thus can modulate the pharmacokinetics of many drugs. The other way around, its expression and activity are also altered by certain drugs and disease states. Unlike other members of the MRP/ABCC family, MRP2 is specifically expressed on the apical membrane domain of polarised cells as hepatocytes, renal proximal tubular cells, enterocytes and syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta. Several naturally occurring mutations leading to the absence of functional MRP2 protein from the apical membrane have been described causing the human Dubin-Johnson syndrome associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Experimental mutation studies have revealed critical amino acids for substrate binding in the MRP2 molecule. This review is, therefore, focused on the structure and function of MRP2, the substrates transported and the clinical relevance of MRP2.
