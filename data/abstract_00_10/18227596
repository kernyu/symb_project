PURPOSE: A retrospective analysis was done to note changes in prevalence, distribution of biotypes, serotypes, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and phage types of Vibrio cholerae isolated in Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram over a period of 16 years. METHODS: A total of 535 strains of V. cholerae were isolated from 10,406 stool samples and rectal swabs from January 1990 to December 2005. These comprised of serogroups O1 - 427 (79.89%), O139 - 86 (16.07%) and non O1, non O139 - 22 (4.11%). No classical V. cholerae was isolated. RESULTS: Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 serotype Ogawa was the predominant isolate till 1992. During 1993, serogroup O139 became the main isolate; however, it completely disappeared during 1995-1996 only to reappear in 1997. Serotype Inaba in our area was conspicuous by its absence with only two strains being isolated till June 1999, but during July-December 1999, 11 out of 15 V. cholerae O1 isolates were El Tor Inaba. T4 was the predominant phage type till 1990, T2 during 1991-1994 and T27 (as per the new scheme) thereafter. Resistance to tetracycline varied between 2 and 17% for V. cholerae O1. CONCLUSIONS: The paper reports on the changing epidemiological markers of V. cholerae isolated from a rural hospital over a period of 16 years.
