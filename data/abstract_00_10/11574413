Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are believed to induce insulin sensitization by modulating gene expression via agonistic stimulation of the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). We have shown earlier that the TZD troglitazone inhibits mitochondrial fuel oxidation in isolated rat skeletal muscle. In the present study, rat soleus muscle strips were exposed to TZDs to examine whether the inhibition of fuel oxidation is mediated by PPAR-gamma activation. Our findings consistently indicated direct, acute, and PPAR-gamma-independent TZD action on skeletal muscle fuel metabolism. Rapid stimulation of lactate release by 20 micromol/l troglitazone within 30 min suggested that direct TZD action on skeletal muscle in vitro does not rely on changes in gene expression rates (12.6 +/- 0.6 [control] vs. 16.0 +/- 0.8 micromol. g(-1). h(-1) [troglitazone]; P < 0.01). This conclusion was supported by the failure of actinomycin D and cycloheximide to block the effects of troglitazone. Mitochondrial fuel oxidation was consistently inhibited by six different TZDs (percent inhibition of CO(2) production from palmitate after 25 h: troglitazone, -61 +/- 2%; pioglitazone, -43 +/- 7%; rosiglitazone, -22 +/- 6%; BM13.1258, -47 +/- 9%; BM15.2054, -51 +/- 4%; and T-174, -59 +/- 4% [P < 0.005 each]), but not by PPAR-gamma agonistic compounds not belonging to the TZD class (JTT-501, -5 +/- 7% [NS]; prostaglandin J(2), 17 +/- 7% [P < 0.05]), which further argues against dependence on PPAR-gamma activation. In summary, our findings provided good evidence that direct inhibition of mitochondrial fuel oxidation in isolated skeletal muscle is a group-specific effect of TZDs and is independent of PPAR-gamma-mediated gene expression.
