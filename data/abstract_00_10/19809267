Of 143 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae collected from Korean non-tertiary hospitals, 24 (16.8%) showed an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive phenotype. PCR and sequence analysis revealed the presence of TEM-116 (n=13), CTX-M-3 (n=5), CTX-M-14 (n=2), CTX-M-15 (n=3), and SHV-12 (n=16). Each of the 24 isolates encoded more than one beta-lactamase, and seven isolates (29%) harbored two different SHV-type beta-lactamase genes (blaSHV-11 and blaSHV-12) bounded by insertion sequence IS26 in a single transferable plasmid.
