This study presents the results of the italian "Severe infections project" involving bacteria that can be considered rare causes of disease. we isolated 30 uncommon human pathogens from a total of 60 strains (1.2% of all the isolates). The most frequent sources of uncommon human pathogens were primary bloodstream infections (48.3%) and pneumonia (20%). Species such as Comamonas testosteroni, Enterococcus hirae, Kluyvera ascorbata, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Leclercia adecarboxylata and Ochrobactrum anthropi were recovered from bacteremia patients. Clinically useful antimicrobial agents were tested against each isolate. Resistance to 4 or more antibiotics tested was found in Achromobacter xylosoxidans, O. anthropi, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Citrobacter braakii, Enterobacter sakazakii, K. ascorbata, Proteus penneri and Serratia plymuthica. About 16% of the Gram-negative species were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 28.6% of the staphylococci were oxacillin-resistant. the results from this study offer indications for empirical therapy for severe infections from uncommon human pathogens.
