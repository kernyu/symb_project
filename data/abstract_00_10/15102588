The treatment of pneumococcal meningitis remains a major challenge, as reflected by the continued high morbidity and case fatality of the disease. The worldwide increase of penicillin-resistant pneumococci and more recently cephalosporin- and vancomycin-tolerant pneumococci has jeopardised the efficacy of standard treatments based on extended spectrum cephalosporins alone or in combination with vancomycin. This review provides a summary of newly developed antibiotics tested in the rabbit meningitis model. In particular, newer beta-lactam monotherapies (cefepime, meropenem, ertapenem), recently developed quinolones (garenoxacin, gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin) and a lipopeptide antibiotic (daptomycin) are discussed. A special emphasis is placed on the potential role of combination treatments with some of the new compounds, which are of interest based on the background of increasing resistance problems due to their often synergistic activity in the rabbit model of pneumococcal meningitis.
