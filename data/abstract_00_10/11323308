It is well recognized that drug resistance is the most significant obstacle to gaining effective malaria control. Despite the enormous advances in the knowledge of the biochemistry and molecular biology of malaria parasites, only a few genes determining resistance to the commonly used drugs have been identified. The idea that rodent malaria parasites should be exploited more widely for such work, in view of the practical problems of studying this subject experimentally in human malaria, is presented.
