In a previous study, we found an antifungal effect on human pathogenic fungi by the cell-penetrating peptide Tat (47-58) derived from HIV-1. Tat (47-58) immediately entered into the fungal nucleus and affected some physiological changes on the intracellular condition. In this study, Tat (47-58) showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria including bacterial clinical isolates. To improve resistance against proteases for use in vivo, we synthesized an analog of Tat (47-58) by substituting the L-amino acid for the D-amino acid. The D-enantiomer of Tat (47-58) also exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at almost the same level of L-Tat (47-58) concentration. Unlike L-Tat (47-58), D-Tat (47-58) showed a significant proteolytic resistance against all proteases tested and antimicrobial activities in the presence of trypsin. Moreover, D-Tat (47-58) inhibited MRSA infection in human HeLa cells whereas L-Tat (47-58) partially allowed MRSA infection, and the results were due to the proteolytic resistance of D-Tat (47-58).
