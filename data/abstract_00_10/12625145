A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in 104 hospitalized patients with acute, uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria was performed in West and Central Africa from March to July 2001. Patients were randomized to receive simultaneous dosing (artesunate 200 mg/d plus mefloquine 250 mg/d from the first to the third day [investigational group]) or sequential dosing (artesunate 200 mg/d for 3 d plus mefloquine 250 mg on the second and 500 mg on the third day [reference group]). Patients were followed-up for 28 d, and clinical and parasitological outcomes were assessed. The 14-d cure rate was 100% in the investigational group and 98% in the reference group with no recrudescence until day 28. Mean times to fever and parasite clearance were similar between the 2 groups (32 h vs. 26 h and 45 h vs. 48 h) and tolerability was good in both groups. The number of patients with vomiting was statistically significantly lower in the investigational group compared to the reference group (3.8% vs. 19.2%, P = 0.014). A 3-d once-daily co-administration of artesunate and mefloquine starting on day one offers a practical dosing regimen, which is highly effective and well tolerated in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
