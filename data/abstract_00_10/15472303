We describe here the development and evaluation of MRSA ID, a new chromogenic agar medium for the specific isolation and identification of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We used S. aureus ID (bioMerieux, La Balme Les Grottes, France) and supplemented it with various antimicrobials, including cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, oxacillin, and methicillin. Cefoxitin proved to be superior to the other antimicrobials for the selection of MRSA from other strains of S. aureus. MRSA ID (consisting of S. aureus ID supplemented with 4 mg of cefoxitin/liter) was evaluated by the use of 747 swabs from various clinical sites. All specimens were also cultured on CHROMagar MRSA and oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB) and in selective mannitol broth (SMB). A total of 85 MRSA strains were isolated by a combination of all methods. After 22 to 24 h of incubation, 80% of the MRSA strains were isolated as green colonies on MRSA ID, compared with 59 and 62% of the strains that were isolated as colored colonies on CHROMagar MRSA and ORSAB, respectively. After 48 h of incubation, 89, 72, and 78% of the MRSA strains were isolated on MRSA ID, CHROMagar MRSA, and ORSAB, respectively. Sixty-five percent of the strains were isolated by growth in SMB. The specificities of MRSA ID, CHROMagar MRSA, ORSAB, and SMB were 99.5, 99.3, 97.9, and 92.8%, respectively, after 22 to 24 h of incubation. We conclude that MRSA ID is a sensitive and specific medium for the isolation and identification of MRSA.
