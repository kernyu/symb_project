The susceptibility patterns of 2724 uropathogens isolated in 9 Spanish regions during 2002, and 3013 obtained in 2004 were determined. The antibiotics tested were fosfomycin trometamol, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefixime, cefuroxime-axetil, pipemidic, ceprofloxacin, trimethoprim plus sulphamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin. Escherichia coli was the main pathogen in both studies (73% vs. 68.3%) followed by Proteus mirabilis 7.2% vs. 6.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.4% vs. 5.2%). Enteroccocus spp. (4.7% vs. 6.8%), Streptoccocus agalactiae (1.7% vs. 3.1%) and Staphyloccocus saprophyticus (0.7% vs. 1.3%)were the most frequent Gram-positive pathogens. 31.3% of E. coli in 2002 and 32% in 2004 were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Around 40% of E. coli were resistant to a single agent. 21.6-24.1% were resistant to two antibiotics. 35.4% of first period isolates, and 37.6% of second period ones were resistant to two or more classes of antibiotics. Fosfomycin (2.1- 2.8%) and nitrofurantoin (3.5-5.7%) had the lowest resistance rates for E. coli. Amoxicillin (58.2-58.7%), co-trimoxazole (30.8-33.8%) and ciprofloxacin (22.6-22.7%) showed the highest resistance rates, and their suitability as empiric treatments for UTI should probably be re-evaluated.
