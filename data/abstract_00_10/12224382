Enterococcus faecalis was isolated at a frequency of 70% and was chiefly isolated from secondary infections due to ulcer/decubitus. Seven sole/predominant E. faecalis were isolated. Penicillins were more effective against E. faecalis and the sensitivities of E. faecalis to antimicrobials were higher than those of E. faecium. Some nonpredominant E. faecalis strains were sensitive to erythromycin probably due to less resistant mechanisms. The characterization of Enterococcus spp. is especially important when choosing appropriate antimicrobials for therapy.
