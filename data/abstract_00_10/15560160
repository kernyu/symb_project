To determine an antimicrobial action of lactoferrin on bacterial flora of ejaculate in chronic prostatitis, we examined 124 patients with various diseases of male reproductive system at the age between 17 and 56. A total of 280 strains were used as test microorganisms (MO). Sensitivity of the latter to lactoferrin was studied with a human lactoferrin apoform. MO isolated from patients with marked dysbiosis were resistant to lactoferrin (94%). MO, not leading in cenosis, were more sensitive to lactoferrin than MO of the main colonies grown after seeding. Reproductive dysfunction was accompanied by higher occurrence of strains resistant to lactoferrin. The least sensitivity to lactoferrin was registered in asthenozoospermia. Lactoferrin resistance of MO may raise MO pathogenicity. When lactoferrin-resistant strains predominate in microbiocenosis, it is an unfavourable prognostic sign in relation to development of complications, primarily subfertility.
