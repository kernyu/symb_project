Brief history of the discovery of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is presented along with data on the occurrence of this organism, its genetic properties, virulence, and influence on human organs. The role of Hp in the induction and development of various diseases (chronic gastritis, ulcer disease, gastric cancer and maltoma) is discussed. Eradication therapy recommended by the Maastricht consensus 1-3a and alternative strategies are described with emphasis on their negative consequences. Problems of Hp resistance to medication, reinfection, and diagnosis of Hp-associated conditions are considered along with results and prospects of their control.
