NPR1 is a key regulator of the salicylic acid (SA) dependent pathogen resistance pathway in plants. In this issue of Cell, Mou and Dong demonstrate that Arabidopsis NPR1 undergoes activation from an inactive oligomer to the active monomer as a result of cellular redox changes induced by SA during systemic acquired resistance.
