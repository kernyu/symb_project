The fitness cost associated with the evolution of resistance to rifampin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis may be different in clinical isolates compared to in vitro-generated mutants. An atypical Beijing strain (attenuated phenotype) demonstrated the ability to spread despite acquiring resistance to rifampin. Transmission was linked to human immunodeficiency virus coinfection (P = 0.029), raising concern for the spread of drug resistance in vulnerable populations.
