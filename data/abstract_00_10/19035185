OBJECTIVE: To investigate the contamination of Staphylococcus aureus isolates in ice cream by phenotypic typing and molecular typing. METHODS: The Staphylococcus aureus isolates were separated from ice cream, filler, cutter, salves and material. The separated isolates were characterized by drug-resistance, staphylococcal enterotoxin (SEA-E), SE (A-E, G-J) genes and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types. RESULT: Two Staphylococcus aureus isolates were separated, one from ice cream, another from cutter. Their characteristics of drug-resistance, staphylococcal enterotoxin (SEA-E), SE (A-E,G-J) genes and PFGE type were the same. CONCLUSION: The two Staphylococcus aureus isolates were the same clone. The contaminated Staphylococcus aureus isolates could be traced to the contaminated cutters.
