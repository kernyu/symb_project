In pediatric patients, Kluyvera spp. has emerged as a cause of disease ranging from soft tissue infections to sepsis with multiorgan failure. Successful treatment options include third-generation cephalosporins, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, but resistance to first- and second-generation cephalosporins persists. Clinicians should be aware of the spectrum of disease and increasing clinical importance associated with this emerging pathogen.
