The influence of the exometabolites of the fungus S. boulardii, contained in the probiotic preparation "Enterol", on the biological properties of opportunistic and pathogenic enterobacteria of fecal microflora (inactivation of lysozyme, colicin production, hemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance) was studied. The study revealed that the supernatants of S. boulardii decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) in lactose positive (lac+) and lactose negative (lac-) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella strains, but produced no influence on ALA in Salmonella. In response to the action of S. boulardii exometabolites colicin production in E. coli (lac+) was found to increase, while in E. coli (lac-) colicin production was suppressed. An increase in the sensitivity of lactose negative E. coli to cefazolin and cefotaxime under the action of S. boulardii supenatants was noted. The results obtained in this study show the probable mechanism of the corrective action of "Enterol" on intestinal biocenosis, which should be taken into consideration in the differentiated selection of probiotics for the treatment of intestinal dysbacteriosis.
