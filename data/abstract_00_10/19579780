Formation of fungal biofilms in patients with implanted biomedical prosthesis constitutes very serious clinical problems. The biofilm can lead to dysfunction of implanted material and can be a reservoir for chronic and systemic infections. Numerous investigations demonstrated differences in quantity and structure of biofilms that had been formed by various species of fungi belonged to Candida genus. Stages of biofilm formations had been examined carefully in in vitro conditions. Biofilm formation begin with adhesion of fungi to the surface, microcolonies are formed subsequently. At the end of the process, extracellular material is excreted, and its formula, that is various in different fungi Candida species, contribute to its resistance to antifungal drugs. Farnesol and tyrosol are two quorum-sensing molecules. They are acting inversely, regulating formation of "germ tubes" and influencing morphogenetic conversion between yeast and filamentous forms, which plays a very important role in pathogenicity and formation of biofilm. Drug resistance of fungi from Candida has been shown to create a very important clinical problem. Many experiments in vitro confirm significantly lower activity of antifungal drugs toward Candida biofilm than toward Candida, in the form of planctonic cells. Surprisingly, some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can inhibit biofilm formation.
