The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the mutant prevention concentrations (MPCs) of garenoxacin (GRNX), were compared to those of levofloxacin (LVFX), and moxifloxacin (MFLX) against 78 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from otorhinolaryngological infections in Japan during the period January 2007 to June 2007. The MIC and MPC for 90% of the isolates (MIC90 and MPC90) of GRNX were 0.06 and 0.12 microg/mL, respectively, and were the lower values than LVFX and MFLX MIC90s and MPC90s. The ratios of MPC/MIC of GRNX were the lower values than those of LVFX and MFLX.
