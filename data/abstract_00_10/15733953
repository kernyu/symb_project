Drug therapy is a vital component of the care required to promote quality of life for individuals who are afflicted with HIV or AIDS. Issues including weight loss and gain, heart disease, insulin resistance, and even increased bone metabolism must be considered when determining appropriate pharmacologic therapy. New complications often arise with new treatments; living longer may not always mean living better. However, it is the responsibility of nurses to promote the best care possible. Management of appropriate drug therapy and the related implications are critical nursing responsibilities in the care of individuals who have HIV or AIDS.
