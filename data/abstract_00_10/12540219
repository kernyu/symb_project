Antibiotics to treat endodontic infections are routinely prescribed based on previously published susceptibility tests. There is increased concern that bacteria have increased resistance to the currently recommended antibiotics. The purpose of this investigation was to perform antibiotic susceptibility tests on a panel of bacteria recently isolated from endodontic infections. The bacteria in this study were aseptically aspirated with a needle from endodontic abscesses, cultivated, and identified at the species level. Each of the 98 species of bacteria was tested for antibiotic susceptibility to a panel of six antibiotics using the Etest. The antibiotics were penicillin V, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, clindamycin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin. The percentages of susceptibility for the 98 species were penicillin V: 83/98 (85%), amoxicillin: 89/98 (91%), amoxicillin + clavulanic acid: 98/98 (100%), clindamycin: 94/98 (96%), and metronidazole: 44/98 (45%). Metronidazole had the greatest amount of bacterial resistance; however, if it is used in combination with penicillin V or amoxicillin, susceptibility of the combination with penicillin V or amoxicillin increased to 93% and 99%, respectively. Clarithromycin seems to have efficacy, but it is still considered an antibiotic under investigation because the minimum inhibitory concentration has not been established.
