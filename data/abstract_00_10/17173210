The relationship between prior fluoroquinolone use and levofloxacin resistance in Helicobacter pylori infection is unknown. Among 125 enrolled patients, 8.8% had H. pylori isolates that were resistant to levofloxacin. Levofloxacin resistance was associated with any prior fluoroquinolone use over the previous 10 years and with the total number of fluoroquinolone courses prescribed (P<.001).
