A study was conducted to determine the efficacy of albendazole after it had been withdrawn from use due to the development of resistant strains of nematodes about ten years ago. The study also aimed to determine the present efficacy of levamisole, which had been recommended to replace albendazole. On one farm, the sheep and goats were divided into two groups, one group of each serving as the untreated control, while the other was treated with levamisole. The sheep on the other farm were divided into three groups, one serving as the untreated control group, the second being treated with levamisole and the third being treated with albendazole. Faecal samples were collected one day before treatment, and again 10 days after treatment. Anthelmintic efficacy was determined by the faecal egg count reduction test. Ten days after treatment, the sheep treated with levamisole on the first farm had a 98% reduction in faecal egg count, with a 95% confidence limit of 76%. The goats on the same farm had a 97% reduction in faecal egg count, with a 95% lower confidence limit of 81%. At the second farm, 10 days after treatment, sheep treated with levamisole had a 99.4% reduction in faecal egg count, with a 95% lower confidence limit of 88.9%, whereas the sheep treated with albendazole only had a 59.4% reduction in faecal egg count, with a 95% lower confidence limit of -19.6%. The study indicated that the gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep at the Department of Animal Science and Production farm were still resistant to albendazole about ten years after this anthelmintic had been withdrawn from use. A reduced efficacy of levamisole was suspected.
