To investigate the phenotype and genotype variation between the Fluconazole resistant C. albicans isolates and the corresponding susceptible ones, our research established a resistance-induction mode in vitro. Comparisons were done on drug resistance maintainability, metabolic profile and the doubling time in the logarithmic growth phase. Genotypes were determined by ERIC-PCR. The Fluconazole resistant isolates appeared in strain 435, A06, B07 and C01 from total 22 clinical Fluconazole susceptible isolates after being incubated for 45-80 days in YEPD broth with increasing Fluconazole concentration. The parent isolates had a same metabolic profile and a similar growth doubling time to their filial generation. The same ERIC-PCR profiles were also found between the susceptible parents and their resistant filial isolates. The resistant isolates maintained drug resistance for 24 days after growing on drug-free medium. It was supposed that candida albicans had a latent capacity to evolve resistance to azoles under a certain antifungal drug selective pressure, and the acquired resistance could maintain in drug-free media for a certain period. The resistant isolate with no adaptive cost may be prone to vogue among people. ERIC-PCR could be used in epidemiological study as a stable marker.
