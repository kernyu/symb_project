The cytokine interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) has substantial activity in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is the nontransplant standard of care for chronic-phase disease. When used as front-line therapy, IFN-alpha induces a state of tumor dormancy and delays progression to advanced phase. Unfortunately, IFN-alpha is associated with substantial toxicity at therapeutic doses. The introduction of pegylated IFN-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha), a modified form of the protein that permits weekly administration, may alleviate some of the problems observed with IFN-alpha. Combination regimens of IFN-alpha with other drugs such as cytarabine (Ara-C) appear to enhance efficacy and are currently under investigation. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ) (formerly STI571) also is efficacious in chronic-phase CML, with a low toxicity profile. However, its potential to cure CML remains unknown even though it achieves frequent cytogenetic responses. To enhance treatment outcome, a combination of IFN-alpha and imatinib mesylate therapies is proposed. Low-dose IFN-alpha may be given after imatinib mesylate-induced remission as a specific immune stimulant to consolidate the remission. Recent data showing a possible additive effect of imatinib mesylate and IFN-alpha suggest that concurrent use of these agents may also be more effective than single use, particularly in advanced stages of CML where imatinib mesylate has activity but resistance develops.
