INTRODUCTION: Information about whether Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are acquired during foreign travel has previously been incomplete. We collected such information systematically for 2008. METHODS: Information from all laboratory-confirmed cases of Salmonella and Campylobacter-cases from three laboratory catchment areas were prospectively collected by telephone interviews. RESULTS: Of the overall 3,675 cases of Salmonella infection in 2008, information about recent travel was obtained in 3,152 (86%). Among these, 61% of S. Enteritidis, 6% of S. Typhimurium, and 34% of individuals infected with other serotypes were acquired abroad. Among the isolates that were tested for antimicrobial drug sensitivity, 21% of the isolates acquired during foreign travel were resistant and 9% were multidrug-resistant compared with 7% and 2%, respectively, of the indigenous strains. Nearly a quarter of the 3,455 registered Campylobacter cases were included in the survey, and information about recent travel was obtained from 82%. Among these, 33% were acquired abroad. DISCUSSION: The proportion of Salmonella infections acquired abroad varies by serotype. S. Enteritidis used to be the most frequent serotype, predominantly acquired from contaminated Danish egg, but S. Enteritidis is today primarily an imported infection. By contrast, S. Typhimurium is predominately acquired in Denmark. The latter observation should be interpreted on the background of the unprecedented large outbreaks of S. Typhimurium in 2008. There was a clear association between a history of foreign travel and the risk of acquiring an infection with a drug-resistant strain.
