The genetic diversity of the mtDNA ND4 gene in 11 Teladorsagia circumcincta populations from France and Morocco was assessed by sequencing. Some of these nematode populations were resistant to benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintics, while others were susceptible. The nucleotide diversity in all populations studied was very high, probably due to a high mutation rate in nematodes, but there was no significant difference between them. This suggests that no strong, recurrent bottlenecks occur during the acquisition of BZ resistance by a worm population. The conservation of genetic variations during the acquisition of BZ resistance is probably due to the fact that anthelmintic treatments do not kill all the susceptible adult worms and to the presence of numerous free-living larvae that are not submitted to this anthelmintic pressure. There was no genetic subdivision between worm populations on a small geographical scale (less than 200 km), but significant F(ST)s were found on a larger geographical scale. This kind of subdivision cannot be explained by different genetic flows between populations because all these populations were isolated from each other. This subdivision is probably due to the breeding management practices and the large size of these worm populations, which limit genetic drift.
