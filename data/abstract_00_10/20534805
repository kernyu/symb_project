We assessed the ability of three commercial systems to infer carbapenem resistance mechanisms in 39 carbapenemase-producing and 16 other carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The sensitivity/specificity values for "flagging" a likely carbapenemase were 100%/0% (BD Phoenix), 82 to 85%/6 to 19% (MicroScan), and 74%/38% (Vitek 2), respectively. OXA-48 producers were poorly detected, but all systems reliably detected isolates with KPC and most with metallo-carbapenemases.
