There are now exactly 20 anti-HIV drugs licenced (approved) for clinical use, and > 30 anti-HIV compounds under (pre)clinical development. The licensed anti-HIV drugs fall into five categories: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs: zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir and emtricitabine); nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate); non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs: nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz); protease inhibitors (PIs: saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, atazanavir and fosamprenavir); and fusion inhibitors (FIs: enfuvirtide). The compounds that are currently under clinical (Phase I, II or III) or preclinical investigation are either targeted at the same specific viral proteins as the licensed compounds (i.e., reverse transcriptase [NRTIs: PSI-5004, (-)-dOTC, DPC-817, elvucitabine, alovudine, MIV-210, amdoxovir, DOT; NNRTIs: thiocarboxanilide, UC-781, capravirine, dapivirine, etravirine, rilpivirine], protease [PIs: tipranavir, TMC-114]) or other specific viral proteins (i.e., gp120: cyanovirin N; attachment inhibitors: AIs, such as BMS-488043; integrase: L-870,812, PDPV-165; capsid proteins: PA-457, alpha-HCG); or cellular proteins (CD4 downmodulators: CADAs; CXCR4 antagonists: AMD-070, CS-3955; CCR5 antagonists: TAK-220, SCH-D, AK-602, UK-427857). Combination therapy is likely to remain the gold standard for the treatment of AIDS so as to maximise potency, minimise toxicity and diminish the risk for resistance development. Ideally, pill burden should be reduced to once-daily dosing so as to optimise the patient's compliance and reduce the treatment costs.
