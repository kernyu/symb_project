In this paper we describe our structure-based ligand design, synthetic strategy, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies that led to the identification of thiocarbamates (TCs), a novel class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), isosteres of phenethylthiazolylthiourea (PETT) derivatives. Assuming as a lead compound O-[2-(phthalimido)ethyl]phenylthiocarbamate 12, one of the precursors of the previously described acylthiocarbamates (Ranise, A.; et al. J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 768-781), two targeted solution-phase TC libraries were prepared by parallel synthesis. The lead optimization strategy led to para-substituted TCs 31, 33, 34, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, and 50, which were active against wild-type HIV-1 in MT-4-based assays at nanomolar concentrations (EC50 range: 0.04-0.01 microM). The most potent congener 50 (EC50 = 0.01 microM) bears a methyl group at position 4 of the phthalimide moiety and a nitro group at the para position of the N-phenyl ring. Most of the TCs showed good selectivity indices, since no cytotoxic effect was detected at concentrations as high as 100 microM. TCs 31, 37, 39, 40, and 44 significantly reduced the multiplication of the Y181C mutant, but they were inactive against K103R and K103N + Y181C mutants. Nevertheless, the fold increase in resistance of 41 was not greater than that of efavirenz against the K103R mutant in enzyme assays. The docking model predictions were consistent with in vitro biological assays of the anti-HIV-1 activity of the TCs and related compounds synthesized.
