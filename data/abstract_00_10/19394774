This review of pediatric bacterial meningitis was presented in the 17th French Consensus Conference of antimicrobial chemotherapy. It should contribute to the elaboration of guidelines for the treatment of this disease. The incidence of bacterial meningitis rates is 44/100,000 in children under 1 year of age and 6.9/100,000 for children between 1 and 4 years of age (in 2002). Neisseria meningitidis was the most frequently identified bacterium (53.7%) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (32.5%), group B streptococci (5.8%), and H. influenzae (3.2%). Group B streptococci predominated in children 28 days to 2 months of age (49.4%) and S. pneumoniae in children 2 to 12 months of age (45.2%). In children older than 1 year of age, N. meningitidis was the most frequently identified bacterium (69.7%). All N. meningitidis strains were susceptible to cefotaxim and ceftriaxone, one-third had decreased susceptibility to penicillin. Ten percent of S. pneumoniae strains were resistant to penicillin G in 2001, but this decreased to 3% in 2005. No strain was resistant to cefotaxim, while 6% had decreased susceptibility to cefotaxim in 2005 and highest MIC was 2 microg/ml. Using new conjugate vaccines and selective pressure on bacterial strains exhibited by antibiotics use have probably changed the epidemiology of pediatric bacterial meningitis in France.
