Sixty-two Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Derby isolates from slaughter pigs and meat products isolated in Southern Brazil were analyzed for their genomic relationships and for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes. Twenty-four S. Derby isolates were indistinguishable by their subtracted restriction fingerprinting (SRF) pattern, XbaI- and BlnI-macrorestriction patterns, phage type, plasmid profile, and resistance pattern. In contrast to the BlnI-macrorestriction patterns, the XbaI-macrorestriction patterns were in good agreement with the results of SRF analysis and phage typing. Among the four phage types detected, PT10 and PT21 were the most common. The combination of all typing methods revealed a great diversity among the S. Derby isolates. All strains carried plasmids and the 60 resistant isolates showed at least tetracycline resistance. The resistance genes found were sul1 and/or sul2 (sulfonamide resistance), aadA2 (streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance), tet(A) (tetracycline resistance), tet(B) (tetracycline/minocycline resistance), bla(TEM) (ampicillin resistance), and dfrA14 (trimethoprim resistance). A correlation of the geno- and phenotypic characteristics with the origin of the isolates revealed a substantial temporal variation in the occurrence of specific S. Derby isolates in different independent pig production lines in Southern Brazil. The large number of resistant isolates underlined the potential risk that S. Derby isolates can pose to human health when they enter the food chain.
