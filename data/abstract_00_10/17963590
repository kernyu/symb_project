We report on the first recorded outbreak of cholera in Namibia. From December 2006 to February 2007, more than 250 cases of cholera were reported from the Omusati and Kunene provinces of Namibia. However, only nine bacterial isolates were obtainable for analysis. Isolates were all identified as Vibrio cholerae O1 serotype Inaba biotype El Tor. All isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, augmentin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, kanamycin, imipenem, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime; and they all showed resistance to trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and streptomycin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of bacteria incorporating either SfiI or NotI digestion revealed an identical fingerprint pattern for all isolates. These data together with results indicating identical antimicrobial susceptibility profiles for all isolates determined that the outbreak was caused by a single strain of V. cholerae.
