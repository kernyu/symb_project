Multiplex allele-specific PCRs detecting katG codon 315 and mabA (bp -15) mutations could specifically identify 77.5% of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in the South China region. One clinical isolate harboring InhA Ile194Thr was characterized to show strong association with isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
