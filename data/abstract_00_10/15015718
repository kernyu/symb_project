In order to limit the onset of adverse effects and the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, the prescription of antibiotics must be reserved strictly for situations where their efficacy has been demonstrated. The French Health Products Safety Agency (Afssaps) has updated recommendations concerning the use of antibiotic treatment in odontology and stomatology. The general strategy for the prescription of antibiotics proposed by the present recommendations relies on a professional consensus. The full-length, discussed and referenced text is available at the web site of Afssaps (http://www.afssaps.sante.fr) in the 'Documentation et publications' rubric'.
