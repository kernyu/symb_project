During the BfT-GermVet monitoring program, Pseudomonas (P) aeruginosa from dogs and cats (n = 99) as well as Arcanobacterium (A.) pyogenes from cattle and swine (n = 90) were examined for their antimicrobial susceptibility. In general, P. aeruginosa is known to be resistant against many antimicrobial agents whereas A. pyogenes is thought to be susceptible to most agents in-vitro. However, representative and actual minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values are missing for both veterinary pathogens. In the present study, MIC values were determined and categorized according to the recommendations given in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) documents M31-A2 and M31-S1. For susceptibility testing of A. pyogenes, the CLSI methodology was slightly modified. Specific breakpoints were not available for most of the antimicrobial agents tested. P. aeruginosa isolates from infections of the skin, ear and mouth as well as the urinary and genital tract of dogs and cats were either resistant or exhibited high MIC values to most antimicrobial agents tested. However, gentamicin resistant isolates were observed in only 27% and 11% (intermediate isolates 29% and 39%), respectively. For the same bacterium/host animal/organ system combinations, enrofloxacin resistance was detected in only 24% and 11% of the isolates (intermediate isolates 49% and 61%). For A. pyogenes, resistance was most prevalent against tetracycline (33%-56%, bovine and porcine isolates) and sulfonamides (26%-40%, bovine isolates).
