Susceptibility of Mycobacterium bovis strains to antituberculous drugs (isoniazid and rifampin) was detected by radiometric BACTEC 460TB system. M.bovis strains were isolated from tissue samples showing tuberculous lesions collected at an abbattoir from cattle belonging to 47 tuberculosis outbreaks occurring in Northern Italy in 1995-1999. Forty-six out of 61 strains (75.4%) resulted susceptible to both isoniazid and rifampin. Thirteen strains (21.3%) were resistant to isoniazid only. No strains showed resistance to rifampin only. Two strains (3.3%) resulted resistant to both drugs, showing antituberculous multidrug-resistance. Given the compulsory eradication program of bovine tuberculosis by elimination of infected animals and the ban on antituberculous drug treatments in animals, detection of resistant M. bovis strains appears of great interest.
