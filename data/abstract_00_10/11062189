The growth-promoting antibiotic flavomycin (also called bambermycin, flavophospholipol and moenomycin) has a complex spectrum of activity against enterococci, with some species being naturally resistant and others susceptible. In this study, proteins added to Mueller-Hinton II medium had a strong deleterious effect on the activity of flavomycin, glucose had no effect and starch decreased the activity of flavomycin. The fatty substances Tween 80 and tributyrin increased the activity of flavomycin for several enterococcal species. Slight differences in the composition of the susceptibility test medium affected the MIC results obtained, indicating that strict standardization of the test medium is necessary.
