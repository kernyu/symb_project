We performed epidemiologic study of 109 strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which were detected in our hospital. Of these strains, 6 strains showed resistant to Teicoplanin (TEIC) which MIC level were between 4 to 8microg/mL. All of them showed some phenotype, such as type II of coagulase, type A of enterotoxin, and were producing TSST-1. Genotype analysis by PFGE also showed that those strains ware identical. From analyzing the spreading rout of these TEIC resistant MRSA, we speculate that they first were in ICU ward, then spread all over the hospital carried by the stuff cross-working ICU and other units of hospital.
