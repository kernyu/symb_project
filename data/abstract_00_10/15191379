The GLOBAL (Global Landscape On Bactericidal Activity of Levofloxacin) Surveillance programme monitored antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the key respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis collected in Brazil during 1997-1998, 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. Penicillin and azithromycin resistance among S. pneumoniae strains increased from 1997-1998, reaching 7.9% and 9.5%, respectively, in 2001-2002. Although decreasing by 4.9% since the previous study, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole resistance remained high at 33.7%. Concurrent resistance to penicillin, azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was seen in 2.9% of the S. pneumoniae isolates collected. Levofloxacin remained extremely active against S. pneumoniae, with 0.3% resistance reported in 1997-1998 and 0% resistance in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. beta-Lactamase production in H. influenzae was > 10% in all three studies, with correspondingly high rates of ampicillin resistance. Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was the least active agent tested against H. influenzae, with resistance rates of > 40% recorded in all three studies. All H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, azithromycin and levofloxacin. Of the M. catarrhalis isolates, 98.0% in 1997-1998, 98.0% in 1999-2000 and 81.8% in 2001-2002 were beta-lactamase-positive. The continued high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Brazil underscores the importance of current surveillance initiatives. Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone prescribed widely for respiratory tract infections, continued to show potent activity against key respiratory pathogens.
