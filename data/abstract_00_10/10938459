The role of metallothionein (MT) in free radical regulation and scavenging was investigated using two fish cell lines, the rainbow trout gonadal (RTG-2) cell line and the chinook salmon embryonic (CHSE-214) cell line. Exposure of RTG-2 cells to H(2)O(2) resulted in upregulation of both MT mRNA and MT protein and was also demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, confirming that MT was regulated by free radicals. We then compared the H(2)O(2) resistance in RTG-2 and CHSE-214 cells following metal treatment with Zn or Cd to induce MT. Comparison of survival of control cells and metal-exposed cells showed that metal treatment, which induced MT, significantly raised the H(2)O(2) tolerance in a dose-dependent manner in RTG-2 cells, while no increased H(2)O(2) resistance was observed in CHSE-214 cells. Transient over-expression of MT in CHSE-214: 59 cells also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in resistance to H(2)O(2) exposure. The raised resistance against H(2)O(2) in metal treated RTG-2 cells as well as transfected CHSE-214: 59 cells strongly demonstrate that MT is involved in the protection against H(2)O(2) and suggest a physiologically important function for MT when cells or whole organisms are exposed to oxidative stress.
