Approximately 90% of all upper respiratory infections are caused by viruses, yet antibiotics are prescribed for 50% to 70% of patients who seek medical care for these conditions (Neiderman, Skerrett, & Yamauchi, 1998). Prescribing antibiotics for conditions for which there is no proven benefit is not a harmless practice; it contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance (Ware, 2000). This article will discuss the magnitude of the problem of antibiotic resistance as it relates to pediatric outpatient upper respiratory tract infection and otitis media, analyze practitioner prescribing practices that contribute to widespread antibiotic use, and suggest provider and patient intervention to improve the rational use of antibiotics.
