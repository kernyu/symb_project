Three Annonaceous acetogenins exhibited in vitro antimalarial activities on a chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain, with IC50s ranging from 5 to 10 microM. Structure-activity relationships showed that maximal antimalarial activity occurred in the presence of at least one tetrahydrofuran moiety and a synergistic action with chloroquine was observed. These acetogenins partially inhibited the P. falciparum adenylate translocase.
