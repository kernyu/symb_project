BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aim was to compare the crosslink stability and calcification behavior of porcine tissue (cusp and wall), treated with a new antimineralization process (ADAPT) with that of commercially prepared Freestyle and Prima Plus bioprosthetic tissues. METHODS: Porcine aortic roots were divided into two groups: (i) tissue zero pressure-fixed with 0.625% glutaraldehyde (GA) for seven days and stored in 0.25% GA (as control); and (ii) tissue exposed to the ADAPT process for four days and stored in 0.25% buffered GA. These groups were compared with Freestyle and Prima Plus tissues (cusp and wall). Crosslink stability was assessed by shrinkage temperature and resistance to pronase degradation. Calcification behavior was assessed histologically (Von Kossa staining) and by atomic absorption spectrophotometry of explanted tissue after eight weeks. in a subcutaneous rat model. RESULTS: Crosslink stability and calcification potential of ADAPT-treated porcine valve cusps were comparable to those of Freestyle and Prima Plus cusps (p = NS). ADAPT-treated porcine wall tissue showed improved crosslink stability (p <0.05) and significantly (p <0.001) reduced calcification (-95.95%) compared to control (-0.00%), Freestyle (-47.87%) and Prima Plus (-51.95%) tissues. CONCLUSION: The ADAPT process is effective in reducing calcification in both porcine cusp and wall tissues in a subcutaneous rat model, and further suggest that enhanced crosslinking plays an important role in minimizing aortic wall calcification.
