Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE were studied in 30 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Ten isolates showed a mutation in parE that was significantly associated with an increase in the MIC for fluoroquinolones.
