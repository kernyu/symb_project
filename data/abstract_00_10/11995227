PROBLEM: Infections with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are reported increasingly in intensive care unit and ward, that means not only a dangerous disease but also a considerable expenditure factor. METHODS: In trauma surgery we could observe the Linezolid treatment of 2 patients with a MRSA infection. After treatment with Vancomycin and further evidence of MRSA the application of Linezolid was continued during 3 weeks accompanied by further microbiologic investigations. RESULTS: In a 73 year old man with humerus shaft fracture the MRSA osteomyelitis was eradicated with Linezolid (600 mg/day per os over 3 weeks) after radical debridement and reosteosynthesis. The MRSA pneumonia in a 14 year old girl was treated successfully by Linezolid (600 mg/day i.v. over 3 weeks) and pneumotherapy. Follow up excluded further MRSA infection. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid represents an efficient new reserve antibiotic. In case of pneumonia, severe skin and soft tissue infections good results can be expected. The treatment of osteomyelitis has been reported only in single cases.
