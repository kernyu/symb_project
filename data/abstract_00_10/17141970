Ever since antimicrobial therapy was introduced, two phenomenons have been observed: drug resistance and host toxicity. Mutation(s) in microbes leads to the earlier, while off target effects of therapy cause the latter. Neither of these problems have yet to be resolved. All Microbes express specific antigens, against which monoclonal antibodies can be generated ex vivo. If these specific antibodies are conjugated with antimicrobial drugs, it would lead to an increase in the specificity of antimicrobial chemotherapy agents. Moreover, the antibodies also work as anti-infective agents by directing the human immune response to the pathogen. As a result, antibody conjugated antimicrobial chemotherapy may have lower side effects, higher potency and efficacy.
