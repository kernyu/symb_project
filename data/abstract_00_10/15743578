INTRODUCTION: In the last years, we have verified the increasing emergence of bacteria, specially Escherichia coli, that produce expanded spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), enzymes which confer resistance to all cephalosporins (except cephamycins) and aztreonam. These bacteria are frequently resistant also to non-beta-lactam antibiotics, a fact which poses an important clinical problem. METHODS: Descriptive study of ESBL-producing strains of E. coli isolated in all kind of specimens in two hospitals of Southern Alicante (Spain), throughout a period of 57 months (January 1999 to September 2003), paying a close attention to their origin (outpatients or admitted patients), co-resistance to non beta-lactam antibiotics and evolution of their incidence. RESULTS: Respectively, 3% and 2.25% of E. coli strains isolated in each hospital produce ESBL (3.83% and 2.85% of strains from admitted and 2.74% and 2.1% from outpatients). 30.73% and 24.58% of strains ESBL were isolated in admitted patients. We found in both hospitals much higher percentages of co-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and trimetoprim-sulfamethoxazole in ESBL-producing strains. CONCLUSION: The percentage of ESBL-producing E. coli is high in our environment, but it is even more noteworthy its clear trend to increase. It is very remarkable the high percentage of ESBL-producing strains isolated from outpatients. Finally, we emphasize the high percentages of co-resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics.
