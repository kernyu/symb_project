Vibrio alginolyticus, a marine bacterium, is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing vibriosis with high mortality to fishes in the South China Sea. Stress resistance is very important for its survival in the natural environment and upon infection of the host. RpoS, an alternative sigma factor, is considered as an important regulator involved in stress response and virulence in many pathogens. In this study, the rpoS gene was cloned and characterized to evaluate the role of RpoS in V. alginolyticus. The predicted protein showed high identity with other reported rpoS gene products. The in-frame deleted mutation of rpoS in V. alginolyticus led to sensitivity of the strain to ethanol, hyperosmolarity, heat, and hydrogen peroxide challenges. Further studies showed that extracellular autoinducer 2 level, four of seven detected protease activities, and cytotoxicity of extracellular products were markedly decreased in the rpoS mutant compared with that in the wild-type strain. The results indicated that the global regulator RpoS was part of the regulatory networks of virulence and LuxS quorum sensing system.
