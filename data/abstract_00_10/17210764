A rare clinical isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae, highly resistant to telithromycin, contained erm(B) with a truncated leader peptide and a mutant ribosomal protein L4. By transformation of susceptible strains, this study shows that high-level telithromycin resistance is conferred by erm(B), wild type or mutant, in combination with a (69)GTG(71)-to-TPS mutation in ribosomal protein L4.
