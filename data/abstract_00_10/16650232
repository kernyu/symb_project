Pediculosis capitis is a worldwide problem and a growing concern because of resistance to pediculicides. In the present study, we investigated whether albendazole could be used in the treatment of pediculosis capitis in combination with 1% permethrin or alone. A total of 150 children were randomly divided to five groups of 30 each. Group 1 got albendazole in a single dose (400 mg), group 2 got albendazole at 400 mg for 3 days, group 3 was given 1% permethrin, group 4 took 1% permethrin and albendazole in a single dose (400 mg), and group 5 got 1% permethrin and albendazole in a dose of 400 mg for 3 days. Groups given albendazole were also given another 400 mg dose of albendazole after 1 week. The success rate of treatment at the 2-week follow-up for all groups was 61.5%, 66.6%, 80.0%, 84.6%, and 82.1%, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups. The results of this study suggest that albendazole is effective against pediculosis capitis and there is no synergistic effect between albendazole and 1% permethrin.
