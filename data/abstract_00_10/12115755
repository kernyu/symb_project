Although antibiotic-loaded hydroxyapatite blocks have been used for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis, their long-term potential for releasing antibiotic into human bones is not well known. Five patients with chronic osteomyelitis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection were effectively treated with local implantation of vancomycin-loaded hydroxyapatite blocks. Blocks were removed during the following reconstructive surgeries when the releasing capability of the blocks, and the bacteriocidal activity of the remaining vancomycin in these blocks could be evaluated. Vancomycin was rapidly released within 1 month after implantation, and by 3 months 90% of vancomycin had leaked from the blocks. At 18 months vancomycin still remained in a bacteriocidal form in the hydroxyapatite blocks, though the blocks had no releasing potential or the eluted vancomycin had been changed to a different form. Vancomycin-loaded porous hydroxyapatite blocks would be useful for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis or implant-associated osteomyelitis due to MRSA.
