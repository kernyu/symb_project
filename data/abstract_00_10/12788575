The Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRASP) monitors trends in antimicrobial resistance in consecutive gonococcal isolates from 26 genitourinary medicine clinics in England and Wales. In 2002, 2204 gonococcal isolates were tested, and the overall prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =1 mg/L) was 9.8%, compared with 3.1% in 2001 and 2.1% in 2000. Between 2001 and 2002, prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance increased two to three-fold, irrespective of recent sexual contact overseas, sex, or residence within or outside of London. These findings suggest that national and local treatment guidelines need to be reviewed urgently.
