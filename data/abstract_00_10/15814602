Owing to the persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the selection of drug-resistant mutants, a new concept of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B relies on the combination of nucleoside analogues. In experimental models of HBV infection, several key points concerning these combinations were addressed. (i) Is it possible to achieve a synergic antiviral effect with polymerase inhibitors? (ii) Is it possible to impact on intracellular viral covalently closed circular DNA? (iii) What is the impact of the cross-resistance patterns of the different nucleoside analogues? (iv) What is the effect of viral load suppression on the restoration of specific antiviral cellular responses? The clinical impact of these key issues is discussed in the perspective of new clinical trials.
