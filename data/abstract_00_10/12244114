The expression and drug efflux activity of the ATP binding cassette transporters Cdr1p and Pdh1p are thought to have contributed to the recent increase in the number of fungal infections caused by Candida glabrata. The function of these transporters and their pumping characteristics, however, remain ill defined. We have evaluated the function of Cdr1p and Pdh1p through their heterologous hyperexpression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain deleted in seven major drug efflux transporters to minimize the background drug efflux activity. Although both Cdr1p- and Pdh1p-expressing strains CDR1-AD and PDH1-AD acquired multiple resistances to structurally unrelated compounds, CDR1-AD showed, in most cases, higher levels of resistance than PDH1-AD. CDR1-AD also showed greater rhodamine 6G efflux and resistance to pump inhibitors, although plasma membrane fractions had comparable NTPase activities. These results indicate that Cdr1p makes a larger contribution than Phd1p to the reduced susceptibility of C. glabrata to xenobiotics. Both pump proteins were phosphorylated in a glucose-dependent manner. Whereas the phosphorylation of Cdr1p affected its NTPase activity, the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of Pdh1p, which was necessary for drug efflux, did not. This suggests that phosphorylation of Pdh1p may be required for efficient coupling of NTPase activity with drug efflux.
