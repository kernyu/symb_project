AIM: To test whether in vitro incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with interferon (IFN) could efficiently decrease hepatitis C virus-RNA (HCV-RNA) amount and to analyze whether this effect was associated with clinical response to IFN. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis C were given intravenous administration of 6 million units (MU) IFN-beta daily for 6 weeks followed by three times weekly for 20 weeks. PBMC collected before IFN therapy were incubated with IFN-beta and HCV-RNA in PMBC was semi-quantitatively determined. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients completed IFN therapy. Eight patients (32%) had sustained loss of serum HCV-RNA with normal serum ALT levels after IFN therapy (complete responders). HCV-RNA in PBMC was detected in all patients, whereas it was not detected in PBMC from healthy subjects. In vitro administration of IFN-beta decreased the amount of HCV-RNA in PMBC in 18 patients (72%). Eight of these patients obtained complete response. On the other hand, none of the patients whose HCV-RNA in PBMC did not decrease by IFN-beta was complete responders. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the decrease of HCV-RNA amount in PBMC by IFN-beta was the only independent predictor for complete response (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The effect of in vitro IFN-beta on HCV in PBMC reflects clinical response and would be taken into account as a predictive marker of IFN therapy for chronic hepatitis C.
