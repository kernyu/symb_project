BMS 284756, a novel des-fluoroquinolone with an expanded potency versus Gram-positive pathogens, demonstrated potent activity against a wide range of 3,541 ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC, > or = 2 microg/ml) Gram-positive cocci. These strains were selected from more than 24,000 isolates gathered as part of the 1999 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Further clinical development appears warranted.
