Progressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is often complicated by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), which in some cases may be refractory to conventional therapy such as corticosteroids, rituximab and splenectomy. We report here on 5 patients (median age 66 years, range 59-69) with advanced B-CLL, all of whom developed severe transfusion-dependent AIHA resistant to conventional therapy and received subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 antigen as salvage treatment for AIHA. Alemtuzumab was well tolerated with only minor 'first dose' reactions. All 5 patients responded with a >or=2.0 g/dl rise in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, in the absence of further transfusions, after a median time of 5 weeks (range 4-7), and the mean Hb increased from 7.2 g/dl at baseline to 11.9 g/dl at end of treatment. All patients remained stable, without further AIHA episodes, after a median follow-up time of 12 months with a mean Hb of 12.5 g/dl (range 12.2-12.9). For patients with severe, refractory CLL-related AIHA, who have not previously responded to conventional therapy, alemtuzumab is an effective agent.
