Oral fungal infections frequently develop in individuals with advanced cancer. This study examined the oral mycological flora of 207 patients receiving palliative care for advanced malignant disease. Demographic details and a clinical history were documented from each participant. A tongue swab was collected and cultured on CHROMAgar Candida (CHROMAgar Paris, France). All yeasts were identified by germ tube test, API ID 32C profiles and, for Candida dubliniensis, by species-specific PCR. Susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole was determined by a broth microdilution assay according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). At time of sampling, 54 (26%) of the 207 subjects had clinical evidence of a fungal infection and yeasts were isolated from 139 (67%) individuals. In total, 194 yeasts were isolated, of which 95 (49%) were Candida albicans. There was a high prevalence of Candidia glabrata (47 isolates) of which 34 (72%) were resistant to both fluconazole and itraconazole. All nine isolates of C. dubliniensis recovered were susceptible to both azoles. No relationship was established between anti-fungal usage in the preceding three months and the presence of azole resistant yeasts. This study of patients with advanced cancer has demonstrated a high incidence of oral colonization with non-C. albicans yeasts, many of which had reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole. The role of improved oral care regimes and novel anti-fungal drugs merits further attention, to reduce the occurrence of fungal infection in these patients.
