In vitro random mutagenesis is a powerful tool for altering properties of enzymes. We describe here a novel random mutagenesis method using rolling circle amplification, named error-prone RCA. This method consists of only one DNA amplification step followed by transformation of the host strain, without treatment with any restriction enzymes or DNA ligases, and results in a randomly mutated plasmid library with 3-4 mutations per kilobase. Specific primers or special equipment, such as a thermal-cycler, are not required. This method permits rapid preparation of randomly mutated plasmid libraries, enabling random mutagenesis to become a more commonly used technique.
