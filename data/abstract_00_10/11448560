The in-vitro activity of fluconazole against 46,831 yeast isolates collected over a two-year period from 57 laboratories in 33 countries worldwide was assessed using a disc diffusion method. Candida albicans was the organism isolated most frequently, accounting for 68.6% of the total number of isolates. C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C parapsilosis and C. krusei and Cryptococcus neoformans represented 9.9, 4.7, 4.3, 1.9, and 1.4% of isolates respectively during the 2 year period and rates varied markedly between countries. In 1999 data blood isolates represented 4.9% of all isolates and intensive care unit isolates represented 9.9%. In both the 1998 and 1999 data, 99% of C. albicans were fully susceptible (S) to fluconazole, and 95.6% of all species of yeasts tested were S or susceptible-dose dependent (S-DD) to fluconazole. No emerging trends of resistance were noted with any of the Candida spp. tested as 96% of all isolates retained susceptibility (S or S-DD) to this agent.
