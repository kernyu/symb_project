OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci from animal farms and the potential relation of resistance to antimicrobial use. METHODS: Enterococci from faecal samples from 18 beef cattle, 18 dairy cattle, 18 swine, 13 chicken, and eight turkey farms were prospectively evaluated over a 6 year period from 1998 to 2003. RESULTS: We evaluated 1256 isolates of Enterococcus faecium and 656 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis. None was vancomycin resistant. Quinupristin/dalfopristin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin resistance rates in E. faecium were 2%, 0% and 55% in beef cattle, 8%, 7% and 47% in dairy cattle, 21%, 1% and 47% in swine, 85%, 12% and 23% in chicken, and 52%, 13% and 24% in turkey isolates, respectively. For E. faecalis, gentamicin resistance rates were 0% in beef cattle, 24% in dairy cattle, 37% in swine, 32% in chicken, and 29% in turkey isolates, whereas 12%, 9%, 21%, 64% and none of isolates from beef, dairy, swine, chicken, and turkey farms, respectively, were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance in E. faecium was more common on chicken and turkey farms using virginiamycin (P<0.0001 for both) compared with farms not using a streptogramin, gentamicin resistance was more common on dairy farms using gentamicin (P<0.0001) compared with farms not using this antibiotic, and ciprofloxacin resistance was more common on turkey and dairy farms using enrofloxacin compared with those with no enrofloxacin use (P=0.02 and P=0.04, respectively). For E. faecalis, gentamicin resistance was more frequently detected on dairy and swine farms using gentamicin (P<0.0001 and P=0.0052, respectively) and ciprofloxacin resistance was more common on beef farms using enrofloxacin (P<0.0001) compared with farms not using these antimicrobials. PFGE showed multiple strain types with some clones common between animals of the same animal species. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the presence of a significant reservoir of antibiotic-resistant enterococci among farm animals. Resistance was more common on farms using antimicrobial agents.
