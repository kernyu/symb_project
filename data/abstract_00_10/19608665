This study was made to find the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to identify the risk factors associated with the acquisition of these organisms. Risk factors associated with ESBL-producing E. coli and/or K. pneumoniae acquisition status of neonates were assessed. Of 253 neonates admitted, 238 entered the active surveillance system. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was responsible for 7 infections and 51 colonizations while ESBL-producing E. coli was responsible for 9 infections and 88 colonizations. Concurrent isolation of both the organisms occurred in 30 neonates. The logistic regression model identified 'length of stay in the NICU' as the single independent risk factor. Imipenem, cefepime and amikacin can be suggested as the drugs of choice in our study.
