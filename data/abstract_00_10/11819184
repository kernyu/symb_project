BACKGROUND: The efficacy of treatment containing nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) could be compromised in NNRTI-naive patients already harboring a virus resistant to NNRTIs. On the contrary, hypersusceptibility to NNRTIs in patients having failed nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-containing regimens has been described and has been associated with improved outcome. METHOD: We assessed the prevalence of NNRTI resistance-associated mutations or polymorphisms in 146 antiretroviral-naive patients and in 181 HIV-infected patients who were given an NNRTI-based regimen. We phenotypically evaluated the NNRTI susceptibility of 41 strains presenting with amino acid substitutions at positions involved in NNRTI resistance. RESULTS: In the 268 genotypically analyzable samples, the overall prevalence of NNRTI resistance-associated mutations was 2% (6/268 patients). The prevalence of strains with amino acid substitutions at reverse transcriptase (RT) gene positions (A98, K101, K103, V106, V108, V179) involved in NNRTI resistance was 15%. Hypersusceptibility to NNRTI was rare (2%, 1/41) in those samples. RT substitutions at positions involved in NNRTI resistance were not associated with a significantly worse virologic outcome in NNRTI-treated patients. Our understanding of small shifts in IC50 values (higher or lower) toward NNRTI is very limited. The significance of many RT mutations on NNRTI susceptibility is not clear. CONCLUSION: In contrast to resistance mutations, RT substitutions at positions involved in NNRTI resistance are frequent. They are not associated with a worse virologic outcome or with decreased phenotypic susceptibility to NNRTIs. It may be prudent not to rule out the use of NNRTIs in patients with small shifts in IC50 values or poorly understood mutations.
