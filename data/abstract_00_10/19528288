Antibiotic resistance and virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria are phenotypically associated, but the underlying genetic linkage has not been known. Here we show that PknG, a eukaryotic-type protein kinase previously found to support survival of mycobacteria in host cells, is required for the intrinsic resistance of mycobacterial species to multiple antibiotics.
