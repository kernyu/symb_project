A 44-year-old woman with multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis was admitted to our hospital in August 1998. She had been treated with the anti-tuberculosis agents isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RFP), pyrazinamide and streptomycin (SM) for two months. However, tubercule bacilli found in a sputum culture on admission showed resistance to INH, RFP and SM, and so these agents were replaced with kanamycin (KM), ethionamide, cycloserine and levofloxacin. Unfortunately, the bacilli persisted in the sputum smears, and the patient complained of prolonged pain in the sites of intramuscular injection of KM. In January 1999, inhalation of KM was begun, resulting in the disappearance of the bacilli from the sputum and in improvements in chest radiographs. Inhalation of KM could be an effective therapy, with fewer adverse effects, in cases of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis.
