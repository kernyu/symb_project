OBJECTIVE: To study the trends of antimicrobial resistance pattern of Vibrio cholerae in Thailand between 2000 and 2004. MATERIAL AND METHOD: All isolates of Vibrio cholerae from 28 hospitals across Thailand between 2000 and 2004 were tested for their susceptibility to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, norfloxacin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole by the disk diffusion method (Kirby Bauer). The relevant data were collected and analyzed by the WHONET software program supported by the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: V. cholerae O1, serotype Inaba was much more common than serotype Ogawa. The most frequent type of clinical specimens that V. cholerae isolated was the stool. There was no trend of increasing resistance of all V. cholerae both O1 and non O1. Over all average rates of tetracycline resistance of V. cholerae O1, Inaba and Ogawa were 0.9% and 16.3% respectively and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance were 0.4% and 60.5% respectively. The strains were not resistant to norfloxacin. CONCLUSION: In Thailand, V. cholerae O1 were still susceptible to tetracycline and norfloxacin which were the most frequently antimicrobial used for the treatment of cholera. The trend of increasing resistance during the study period was not detected.
