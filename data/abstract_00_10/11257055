The Tn1546-related elements of 48 Van glycopetide-resistant enterococci were compared. Ten distinct Tn1546 types were identified with variation primarily due to IS1542 and IS1216V-like insertions. Clonal isolates frequently differed in their Tn1546 type, indicating instability of Tn1546-related elements. A putative hybrid promoter was identified, generated upstream of vanR by the insertion of IS1542. The presence of this hybrid promoter was associated with constitutive expression of the van genes and elevated teicoplanin resistance.
