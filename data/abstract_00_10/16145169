A case of failure of cefepime treatment of a bloodstream infection with AmpC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae is reported. The failure was attributed to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) acquisition by the isolate, possibly during therapy. Problems encountered with ESBL detection in AmpC-producing isolates are discussed.
