Biofilm forming multidrug resistant Staphylococcus spp. are major reservoirs for transmission of ophthalmic infections. They were isolated from ocular patients suffering from conjunctivitis. In this study we analyzed biofilm forming ability, antibiotic resistance profile of the Staphylococcus spp. isolated from clinical ocular patients, and their phylogenetic relationship with other community MRSA. Sixty Staphylococcus spp. strains isolated from clinical subjects were evaluated for their ability to form biofilm and express biofilm encoding ica gene. Among them 93% were slime producers and 87% were slime positive. Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were dominant strains among the isolates obtained from ocular patients. The strains also exhibited a differential biofilm formation quantitatively. Antibiotic susceptibility of the strains tested with Penicillin G, Ciprofloxacin, Ofloxacin, Methicillin, Amikacin, and Gentamicin indicated that they were resistant to more than one antibiotic. The amplicon of ica gene of strong biofilm producing S. aureus strains, obtained by polymerase chain reaction, was sequenced and their close genetic relationship with community acquired MRSA was analyzed based on phylogenetic tree. Our results indicate that they are genetically close to other community acquired MRSA.
