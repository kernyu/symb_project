BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is a common complication of S. aureus infection. There are few pediatric studies defining the incidence and associated morbidity and mortality of S. aureus bacteremia and no such New Zealand studies. We conducted a prospective study of S. aureus bacteremia in children in New Zealand. METHODS: From July 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998, we included all children < 16 years of age with S. aureus bacteremia in Auckland and Christchurch. Relevant information regarding patient demographics, clinical course and outcome and laboratory results was recorded. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five cases of true S. aureus bacteremia were identified. There were 4 deaths within 30 days of the onset of bacteremia. Fourteen (11%) of the children were < 1 month of age. Maori children (relative risk, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 3.2) were twice as likely and Pacific Island children (relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.8) 2.5 times as likely as white children to acquire S. aureus bacteremia. The peak incidence of S. aureus bacteremia was observed in Pacific Island children < 1 year of age (105 cases/100,000 children/year). Twenty-seven percent of cases were related to intravenous catheters. Seventy percent of cases were community-acquired. Ninety-eight percent of non-catheter-related cases in children > 1 month of age were community-acquired. There was a low rate of methicillin resistance (6%). CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus bacteremia is largely community-acquired in children in New Zealand and is more common in Pacific Island and Maori populations. Although there is a low associated mortality, a significant number are potentially preventable cases secondary to intravenous catheters.
