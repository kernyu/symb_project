The prevalence of urinary catheterization in the community ranges from 0.02% to 0.07%. Despite the generalized use of closed systems, the risk of bacteriuria in patients with urethral catheters is 3%-10% per day and its presence is universal when the device remains in place for 30 days or longer. Although most of these episodes of bacteriuria are asymptomatic, up to 30% of them lead to clinical symptoms and complications, including severe sepsis and death. The microorganisms infecting the urine of catheterized patients frequently belong to species less susceptible to antibiotics and form biofilms on both the device's surfaces and probably also on the urothelium. Biofilm formation greatly hampers eradication of the involved flora by antibiotics, probably favors the development of resistance and, in some instances, constitutes the substrate on which crystal precipitates are deposited, eventually resulting in blockage of the catheter lumen. Due to the scarce number of controlled studies, there are still many gaps in our knowledge of important issues concerning the clinical management of patients with indwelling urinary catheters in the community. The present study reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, microbiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of catheter-related urinary tract infections in the community setting.
