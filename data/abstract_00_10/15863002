An allosteric reaction has been found in a variety of instances where an inverted parabolic relationship between biological activity and hydrophobicity is apparent, that is the activity first decreases as hydrophobicity increases and after a certain point, activity begins to increase. This could be attributed to the ligands causing a change in the receptor structure. In this report, the role of hydrophobic properties of chemicals in promoting allosteric reactions have been discussed in term of hydrophobicity (logP) by the formulation of a total number of 50 QSAR equations. The QSAR model of this type may be represented by Eq. I.
