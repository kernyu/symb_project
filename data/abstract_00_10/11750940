The biological evaluation of mononucleotide prodrugs (pronucleotides) of various nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as zidovudine (AZT), zalcitabine (ddC) and lamivudine (3TC) was reported in human T-lymphoid MOLT-4/8 cells which were grown continuously for more than 1 year in a medium containing cytarabine (Ara-C). In this cell line, expression of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) was decreased in comparison to parental cells (3.8 and 2.9-fold, respectively). The lower mRNA level of TK1 correlated significantly with lower enzyme activity, whereas no dCK activity was detectable. In Ara-C-resistant cells, anti-HIV-1 effects of ddC, 3TC and AZT were more than 100-fold lower compared with parental cells. In contrast, the corresponding mononucleoside phosphotriesters bearing S-acyl-2-thioethyl (SATE) groups as biolabile phosphate protection retained anti-HIV-1 activity due to their ability to bypass the first monophosphorylation step catalyzed by dCK or TK1. The results demonstrate that in vitro selection of T-lymphoid cells in the presence of Ara-C results in cross-resistance to deoxycytidine (ddC, 3TC) and thymidine (AZT) analogs and that these cellular resistance mechanisms can be bypassed by the use of bis(SATE) pronucleotides.
