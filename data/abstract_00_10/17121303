Heterogeneous, intermediate-vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) represents a threat of an incurable infection since the first report in 1997. The method used to detect hVISA isolates is a population analysis profile (PAP); however, it is impractical for routine laboratory analysis. We therefore tested a simple, reliable and inexpensive method for the detection of hVISA. Eighteen isolates of hVISA and 22 of vancomycin-sensitive S. aureus (VSSA) were included. The organisms were tested by the disk diffusion method, using 15-microg vancomycin disks on four different media: Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA), MHA plus 2% NaCI (MHAS), Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHA), and BHA plus 2% NaCl (BHAS). In addition, two different inoculum sizes, bacterial suspensions adjusted to 0.5 and 2.0 McFarland, were tested. The inhibition zone was read independently by three medical technologists after incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 and 48 hours. The use of MHAS with an inoculum size of 2.0 McFarland and 48-hour incubation period yielded the highest sensitivity (94.4%), specificity (81.8%), positive predictive value (80.9%), and negative predictive value (94.7%). The disk diffusion test with 15-microg vancomycin disk is simple and may be used as a screening method for the detection of hVISA.
