UNLABELLED: RESISTANCE TO IMIPENEM: The increase in the prevalence of A. baumannii resistance is worrying because of the diversity of the enzymes implicated in the resistance and its epidemic diffusion that is always difficult to handle. BROAD SPECTRUM BETA-LACTAMASE: Still rare in Acinetobacter, a broad spectrum beta-lactamase has been demonstrated in a strain isolated during a urinary infection and at the origin of an outbreak. RISK FACTORS: Other than the classic risk factors, a survey regrouping the data from 28 Spanish hospitals showed that hospitalisation in an intensive care unit and the administration of an inappropriate antibiotherapy are two risk factors of mortality during Acinetobacter infections. DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCTION OF SLIME: An antibiotherapy must be administered earlier in strains producing slime than in strains that do not. TO FIGHT ACINETOBACTER: It is essential to break the epidemic chain. In addition to this priority measure, a policy of correct antibiotic use must be installed.
