In this study, we demonstrate that human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells transfected with human tyrosine hydroxylase isoform 1 (SH + TH cells) were substantially more resistant to cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide and 6-hydroxydopamine when compared to wild-type SH-SY5Y cells (SH cells). SH + TH cells exhibit increased levels of dopamine (DA) compared to SH cells. Incubation with hydrogen peroxide or 6-hydroxydopamine (10-100microM) for 24 h caused a significant reduction in cell viability and increased apoptosis in both cell types. However, these effects were significantly reduced in the SH + TH cells when compared to the SH cells. The SH + TH cells showed an improved ability to detoxify peroxide, which correlated with an increase in glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities, while catalase activity was unchanged. Our data suggest that a preconditioning-like mechanism linked to higher DA levels increased the resistance of SH + TH cells against oxidative insults, which is at least in part related to an augmentation in the activity of glutathione-related antioxidant enzymes.
