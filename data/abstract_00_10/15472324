Three hundred seventy-five consecutive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates recovered between 1998 and 2002 at the Nuestra Senora de Candelaria University Hospital in Tenerife, Spain, were analyzed by molecular fingerprinting techniques to determine MRSA clonal types and their prevalence over time. After determining antibiotic susceptibility, we used SmaI-digested genomic DNA separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to characterize MRSA isolates and to establish PFGE types. Additionally, several selected isolates representative of each major PFGE type were tested by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and by a multiplex PCR method capable of identifying the structural type of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), generating the corresponding sequence type (ST)-SCCmec types. Results of PFGE, supported by those of MLST and SCCmec typing, allowed us to identify six MRSA clones within the five major PFGE types and document temporal shifts in the prevalence of these MRSA clones from 1998 to 2002. Four of the clones were the pandemic "Iberian" (designated ST247-MRSA-IA), EMRSA-15 (ST22-MRSA-IV), EMRSA-16 (ST36-MRSA-II), and the so-called pediatric (ST5-MRSA-IV) clones, while the other two (ST125-MRSA-IVA and ST146-MRSA-IVA) clones could be derived from the pediatric one. The most striking temporal shift in the dominance of MRSA clones was the replacement of the multidrug-resistant and highly epidemic Iberian clone by the so-called British EMRSA-16 clone during the 5-year surveillance period. Our results are in accordance with previously stated findings showing the worldwide hospital dominance of relatively few pandemic and presumably virulent MRSA clones. We report for the first time the detection in Spain of the British EMRSA-15 and pediatric clones, as well as the abrupt replacement of the Iberian by the EMRSA-16 as the major MRSA clone.
