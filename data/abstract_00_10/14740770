Since 1917, only 11 new endoparasiticides have been developed for the horse, of which five chemical classes are in common use. The selection pressure of frequent administration of deworming doses for parasite control programs has been associated with the development of resistance of small strongyle parasites to the effects of benzimidazoles and pyrantel salts. Against the background of the inevitability of the occurrence of ivermectin/moxidectin resistance, responsible use of equine anthelmintics based on the clinical pharmacology of the compounds and the biology/epidemiology of intestinal parasites is a major issue for equine clinicians. The evidence base for the recommendations for treatment and control of equine intestinal parasites is sparse, however, and few robust data exist from controlled clinical trials to validate current guidelines.
