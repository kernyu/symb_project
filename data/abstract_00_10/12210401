The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are an obvious target for HIV therapies. Two compounds, T-22 and AMD-3100, have been shown to inhibit infection of CXCR4-using HIV-1 isolates. The specificity of T-22 and AMD-3100 was further confirmed by their ability to block entry of HIV-1 in GHOST-CXCR4 transfected cells with no effect on viral entry in the GHOST-CCR5 cells. The ability of T-22 to block replication of diverse HIV-1 isolates (group M, subtypes A, B, D, E, and F as well as group O) and HIV-2 primary isolates with varying coreceptor specificities ranging from exclusive CCR5 usage to multiple coreceptor usage was examined in detail. T-22 was found to be highly effective (>90%) at blocking infection of diverse HIV-1 (subtypes A-F, and group O) and HIV-2 isolates that use multiple coreceptors in human PBMCs homozygous for a 32-bp deletion in CCR5 (CCR5-/-), but less effective in CCR5 +/+ PBMCs. Additionally, sequential primary HIV-1 isolates obtained from a longitudinal cohort who had switched from single coreceptor usage to a broad range of multiple receptors could be blocked effectively by both T-22 and AMD-3100 in CCR5-/- PBMCs. Our data suggest that CXCR4 antagonistic compounds are highly effective in blocking the entry of X4-tropic HIV-1, and that these compounds could be a useful additive to current anti-retroviral therapy for clinical management of HIV disease.
