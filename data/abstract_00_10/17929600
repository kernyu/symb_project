Today, the Russian North and Siberia has become a region with a great number of ecological and social problems with negative influences on the health state of their population, especially of the children. We made the evaluation of the health state of children aged less than three years using the cell-molecular parameters of the erythrocytes membrane. We revealed the peculiarities of the structural and functional characteristics of the cell membrane, especially in membranous structural phospholipids. We estimated the resistance of the membrane structure to damaging influences and revealed that regulator systems on the level of cell membrane had become in 65% of children--with Northerners less stable against loading states. We studied iododeficiency diseases in the Basin of the Enysei River and found a region of heavy iododeficiency in the Tuva Republic. We revealed the most distinctive signs of metabolic reactions in the blood of non-indigenous children. We studied ethnic peculiarities of disease development. In total, we revealed that the pathology formed in Native and strange populations, in children and adults, depended on ecological conditions and ethnicity.
