In the last decade, a significant increase in the antimicrobial resistance of clinical specimens of Propionibacterium acnes to first line antibiotics used for acne treatment, has been informed in Europe and in the USA. No information about strains isolated from Latin-American countries is available. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 53 strains of P. acnes isolated from skin specimens of inflammatory acne patients, at the clinical Hospital University of Chile was tested. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, minocycline, and nadifloxacin. Erythromycin and clindamycin resistance was found in 3.8 and 1.9% isolates respectively. Resistance to lymecycline was observed in one isolate, which was intermediate to tetracycline and doxycycline.
