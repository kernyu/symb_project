Emergence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains necessitates discovery of novel antimalarial drugs, especially if the agents can be synthesized from commercially available, inexpensive precursors via short synthetic routes. While exploring structure-activity relationships, we found a gallium(III) complex, [(1,12-bis(2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzyl)-1,5,8,12-tetraazadodecane)-gallium(III)](+) [Ga-5-Madd](+), 1, that possessed antimalarial efficacy. Like previously reported complexes, the crystal structure of 1 revealed gallium(III) in a symmetrical octahedral environment surrounded by four secondary amine nitrogen atoms in equatorial plane and two axial oxygen atoms. In contrast to a previously reported complex, [Ga-3-Madd](+), this novel metallo-antimalarial 1 possessed modest efficacy against chloroquine-sensitive HB3 Plasmodium lines. Thus, slight variation in the positions of methoxy functionalities on the aromatic rings of the organic scaffold dramatically altered specificity thereby suggesting a targeted (e.g., transporter- or receptor-mediated) rather than non-specific (e.g., pH or other gradient-mediated) mechanism of action for these agents.
