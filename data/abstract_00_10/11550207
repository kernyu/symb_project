BACKGROUND: We determined whether treatment of metastatic prostate cancer cells with doxorubicin (DOX) and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) prevented the emergence of highly undifferentiated tumor cells. METHODS: The state of cell differentiation was determined by analysis of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), E-cadherin, keratin, and vimentin. RESULTS: Human prostate cancer LNCaP-LN3 cells growing in culture as multicell spheroids expressed higher levels of E-cadherin and E-cadherin-associated beta-catenin than LNCaP-LN3 cells growing as monolayers. Treatment of cells with DOX downregulated PSA, E-cadherin, and keratin, and upregulated expression of vimentin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA. While treatment of cells with IFN-alpha did not alter gene expression, the addition of IFN-alpha to cultures treated with DOX produced synergistic toxicity and abrogated the changes in gene expression observed in cells treated with DOX alone. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IFN-alpha and DOX should be further explored as a therapeutic strategy for androgen-insensitive prostate cancer.
