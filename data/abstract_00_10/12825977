We present two cases of nosocomial urinary tract infection due to Trichosporon asahii in intensive care unit patients with bladder catheter from two hospitals in Santiago, Chile. Both patients had an several catheters and bacterial infections that required the use of antibiotic therapy. One strain showed in vitro resistance to amphotericin B. Both strains were susceptible to fluconazole, but presented MIC with dose-dependent susceptibility to ketoconazole and itraconazole. This is the first report showing T. asahii as urinary tract infection agent in Chile.
