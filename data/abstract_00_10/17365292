The objective of this study was to evaluate the abiotic transformation rate of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) by manganese oxide. Sorption and desorption characteristics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on manganese oxide were also investigated in the presence of 4-CP. Results show that manganese oxide is effective for the transformation of 4-CP and initial reaction rate is the first-order with respect to the 4-CP and manganese oxide. Also, 4-CP transformation rates by manganese oxide are highly dependent upon solution pH and concentration of humic acid. At pH near the point of zero charge (PZC) of manganese oxide, the maximum reaction rate of 4-CP was observed. Sorption of phenanthrene on manganese oxide is significantly increased as a result of 4-CP transformation and subsequent generation of byproducts. Also, sorbed phenanthrene on manganese oxide in the presence of 4-CP showed high degree of desorption resistance.
