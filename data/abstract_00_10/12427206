Bacterial resistance to antibiotics in community-acquired respiratory tract infections is a serious problem and is increasing in prevalence world-wide at an alarming rate. Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the main organisms implicated in respiratory tract infections, has developed multiple resistance mechanisms to combat the effects of most commonly used classes of antibiotics, particularly the beta-lactams (penicillin, aminopenicillins and cephalosporins) and macrolides. Furthermore, multidrug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae have spread to all regions of the world, often via resistant genetic clones. A similar spread of resistance has been reported for other major respiratory tract pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. To develop and support resistance control strategies it is imperative to obtain accurate data on the prevalence, geographic distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens and how this relates to antibiotic prescribing patterns. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing longitudinal national and international surveillance programs to monitor antibiotic resistance, such that the prevalence of resistance and underlying trends over time are now well documented for most parts of Europe, and many parts of Asia and the Americas. However, resistance surveillance data from parts of the developing world (regions of Central America, Africa, Asia and Central/Eastern Europe) remain poor. The quantity and quality of surveillance data is very heterogeneous; thus there is a clear need to standardize or validate the data collection, analysis and interpretative criteria used across studies. If disseminated effectively these data can be used to guide empiric antibiotic therapy, and to support-and monitor the impact of-interventions on antibiotic resistance.
