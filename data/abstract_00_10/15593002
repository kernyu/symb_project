Molecular analysis of 63 Escherichia coli urine isolates showed that pyelonephritis (n=23) and prostatitis (n=17) isolates exhibited more virulence factors (VFs) among the 35 sought than did cystitis isolates (n=23). Several nontraditional VFs--including bmaE (M fimbriae), gafD (G fimbriae), fyuA (yersiniabactin receptor), ireA and iroN (novel siderophore receptors), cvaC (colicin [microcin] V), traT (serum-resistance associated), ibeA (invasion of brain endothelium), ompT (outer membrane protease T), and malX (pathogenicity island marker)--either differentiated significantly between syndromes (despite small numbers of isolates and possible multiple-comparison artifacts) or were broadly prevalent. Thus, interventions that target conserved uro-VFs may be possible, despite the likely existence of syndrome-specific pathogenetic mechanisms and/or host defense systems.
