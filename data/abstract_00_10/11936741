SETTING: Tuberculosis clinic in a referral hospital. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of risk factors on the outcome of retreatment in relapse and defaulter pulmonary tuberculosis patients. DESIGN: A total of 57 retreatment tuberculosis patients treated and monitored in our centre between January 1997 and June 1999 were evaluated with respect to treatment outcome. Factors which have on effect on treatment outcome were investigated. RESULTS: Of 57 patients, 37 (64.9%) were classified as relapse cases and 20 (35.1%) as defaulters. The treatment success rate was 71.9% (68.4% cure rate and 3.5% completion rate). Failure was encountered in 22.8%. Twenty-six patients (45.6%) exhibited resistance to at least one drug, namely rifampicin. The multidrug-resistance (MDR) rate was 18.5%. Treatment success rates were 100% and 50%, respectively, in patients in whom susceptibility to all drugs and resistance to at least one drug were detected. Successful outcome was possible in 68.8% of patients with any rifampicin resistance and in 20% of patients with MDR tuberculosis. Retreatment resulted in failure in 80% and 100%, respectively, of patients whose sputum cultures remained positive at the end of the second and third months. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance proved the most important factor affecting treatment outcome. Success rates in retreatment of patients with any rifampicin resistance or MDR tuberculosis are low. Conversion to negative sputum results at the end of the second and third months of retreatment seems to be a significant parameter for a successful outcome.
