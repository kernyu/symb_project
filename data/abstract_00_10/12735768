[reaction: see text] Gramicidin S is a potent decapeptide antibiotic with high hemolytic activity but is unlikely to provoke microbial resistance. Here we demonstrate that gramicidin thioesterase (GrsB TE) correctly cyclizes immobilized linear decapeptide precursors into head-to-tail products, indicating its suitability for parallel solid-phase synthesis of gramicidin analogues from linear precursors on solid support. This chemoenzymatic method will enable the optimization of the therapeutic index of the natural product to fight microbial resistance.
