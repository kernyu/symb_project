The resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) to fluoroquinolones is associated with the mutations concentrated in the gyrA gene that is a structural gene of a gyrase A subunit. Detection of mutations in this portion of the gene allows the sensitivity of MBT to this group of drugs to be rapidly determined.
