Triclosan MIC determination showed that recent Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates (n = 100) were highly susceptible to triclosan, with a 50% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC(50)) of 0.12 microg/ml and a MIC(90) of 0.25 microg/ml. Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates (n = 96) were less susceptible, with a MIC(50) of 0.12 microg/ml and a MIC(90) of 8 microg/ml. Decreased susceptibility to triclosan was more prevalent among methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis than among methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis isolates.
