AIDS caused by HIV-1, is a major threat to human being. An anti-HIV formulation from Chinese herbs, so called "Qu Du Zeng Ning", have been recently developed. In this work, the pharmacodynamics of the formulation in vitro was studied. The results showed that Qu Du Zeng Ning inhibit the replication of HIV-1 efficiently in all cell-based assay, with IC50 at 105.2, 70.7, 77.4 microg mL(-1), separately. A significant synergy between the formulation and zidovudine (AZT) was observed, and it also showed a potent activity against HIV-1 drug-resistant mutant.
