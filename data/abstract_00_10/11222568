Resistance to macrolides among group A streptococci is an increasing problem worldwide. We examined 496 strains phenotypically and genotypically for resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin. Strains were isolated in five different geographical areas representing about 45% of the total Quebec population. The overall resistance rate was 4.6% but varied from 0% in rural areas to 9.4% in Montreal. Of the 23 strains showing resistance to erythromycin, 15 (65%) had an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern, were of serotype M28T28 and harboured the erm(TR) gene, suggesting the spread of a single clone. Of the remaining eight strains, two strains had the erm(B) gene, five had the mef gene and one with a different serotype also had the erm(TR) gene.
