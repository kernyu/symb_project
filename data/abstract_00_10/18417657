In this study, the use of isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) for differentiation between methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MIC determination was evaluated. It was possible to differentiate between MRSA and MSSA within 4 h, whereas the standard method required 24 h. The MICs of cefoxitin were successfully determined for MRSA and MSSA by using IMC.
