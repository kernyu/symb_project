The tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) resistance gene Pto confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato carrying the avirulent gene avrPto. Overexpressing Pto under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter constitutively activates defense responses in the absence of pathogen infection and nonspecifically enhances disease resistance. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this resistance, we isolated cDNAs corresponding to transcripts that accumulated in 35S::Pto plants. By using suppression subtractive hybridization, we isolated 82 unique cDNA clones, most of which corresponded to differentially expressed transcripts. Most of the genes examined were also induced by pathogen inoculation. Sequence analysis showed that a large number of genes encode defense-related proteins, and most had not been previously isolated from tomato. The isolated cDNAs also include those with a putative role in the oxidative burst, proteolysis, the hypersensitive response, signal transduction, and a number of genes with unknown functions. The isolation of these cDNAs of diverse functions will assist in the characterization of defense pathways activated during disease resistance.
