Novel oxazolidinone derivatives of the lead compound RBx 8700, containing methylene oxygen- and methylene sulfur-linked substituents at the C5-position, were synthesized. Antibacterial screening of these compounds against a panel of resistant and susceptible Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative bacteria gave compounds 2 and 4 as new antibacterial agents.
