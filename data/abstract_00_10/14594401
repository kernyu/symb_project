A total of 391 respiratory isolates of Staphylococcus aureus in Sivas (Turkey) were studied between January 1999-2002. The organisms were cultured from the following specimens: throat (43%), sputum (28%), transtracheal/endotracheal aspirates (27%), and bronchial lavage (2%). The isolates were tested against 11 different antibiotics by a disk diffusion method or standardized microdilution technique. Methicillin-resistant isolates constituted 76.9% of all isolates. Most of the methicillin-resistant isolates (95.1%) were isolated from inpatients. The rate of methicillin-resistant isolates in throat, sputum, and tracheal aspirates was 17.2%, 60.1%, and 68.9%, respectively. The resistance of methicillin-resistant isolates in throat to teicoplanin was 3.4%. The methicillin-sensitive isolates were susceptible to most agents tested, while most methicillin-resistant isolates were resistant to these agents. Overall resistance to erythromycin was 61.9%, tetracycline 56.6%, gentamicin 50.7%, ofloxacin 42.0%, rifampin 40.8%, clindamycin 38.9%, chloramphenicol 19.0%, co-trimoxazole 10.2%, and vancomycin 0%.
