Several imipenem-susceptible and -resistant Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria isolates with different morphologies and antimicrobial susceptibilities recovered from bile samples of a patient with cholangitis were analysed. These isolates belonged to the same clone and the imipenem-resistant strains showed overexpression of the imiS gene, encoding a chromosomal carbapenemase. These results should make clinicians aware of the possible emergence of multidrug-resistant A. veronii biovar sobria, perhaps as a consequence of previous treatment of a urinary tract infection with amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid.
