Among the many different structurally distinct classes of beta-lactams, the carbapenem class is regarded as that which is most potent and which has the widest spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Rapidly bactericidal, and demonstrating time-dependent killing, carbapenemes have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity that includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Their in-vitro activity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens and carbapenems are currently considered to be the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. However, isolates acquiring resistance under treatment have been reported. Imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem are licensed in the European Community and panipenem and biapenem are also available in Japan and South Korea. Other carbapenemes are under development.
