We previously associated the emergence of carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii with the loss of an outer membrane (OM) protein designated CarO. CarO was found essential for L-ornithine uptake: CarO-deficient strains were specifically impaired to grow only on L-ornithine, and failed to incorporate L-[(14)C] ornithine from the medium. L-arginine, and histidine and lysine to a lower extent, could effectively compete for L-[(14)C] ornithine uptake. L-ornithine also reduced A. baumannii sensitivity to imipenem, suggesting that both compounds compete for uptake. The overall results indicate that CarO participates in the selective uptake of L-ornithine, carbapenems, and other basic amino acids in A. baumannii.
