Many beta-lactam antimicrobials were developed between the 1960s and 1980s, with continuing development driven by the emergence of microbial resistance. Penems form a discrete class of beta-lactams that comprises structural hybrids of penicillins (penams) and cephalosporins (cephems). The chemistry and microbiology of the representative penems MEN 10700, ritipenem, CGP 31608, sulopenem, BRL 42715, and faropenem are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on faropenem, which is in late clinical development.
