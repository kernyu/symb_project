A genetic screen for resistance to ethanol intoxication in Caenorhabditis elegans isolated mutants of the gene slo-1. slo-1 encodes the pore-forming subunit of a large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel previously shown to limit excitatory neurotransmitter release in C. elegans. Electrophysiological data recorded in vivo are consistent with a model in which ethanol potentiation of SLO-1 produces intoxication in C. elegans by reducing excitatory neurotransmitter release.
