The most frequent bacteria responsible for acute bacterial meningitis, after the neonatal period, are meningoccoci and pneumococci, very rarely Haemophilus influenzae and Listeria monocytogenes. The microbiological diagnosis is based on cell count, Gram stain, and culture of cerebrospinal fluid. Antigen detection and DNA detection are useful to identify the bacteria in cases of negative cultures, because of the fragility of some bacterial species (meningococci), or a prior antibiotic administration, before a lumbar puncture. Some tests for screening antimicrobial resistances are needed, such as those for detection of resistance to betalactam agents in pneumococcal isolates. Blood cultures, serum samples, skin rash biopsies also contribute to the diagnosis.
