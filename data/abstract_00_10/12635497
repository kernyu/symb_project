Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a highly sensitive and specific method for detection and quantification of specific nucleic acids from a clinical sample. With its use, genetic, infectious, neoplastic, and autoimmune diseases can be diagnosed and managed with a high level of sensitivity, accuracy, and rapidity. This technique exactly reproduces unlimited copies of DNA, even if only a small amount are present initially. PCR assays can detect presence of fastidious and slow-growing microorganisms, such as chlamydia, mycoplasmas, mycobacterias, and viruses directly from clinical specimens and also can detect antimicrobial resistance. The value of viral load measurement by nucleic acid amplification in the management of patients with HIV infection or hepatitis C has also been well established. From the point of view of a clinician, the applications of PCR are focused mainly in the amplification and detection of diagnostic DNA segments from the genomes of both pathogens and patients.
