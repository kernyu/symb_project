OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of cyclosporine (CyA) monotherapy in steroid resistant (SRNS) and steroid dependent (SDNS) nephrotic syndrome in children. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary kidney care center for children at Bangalore. METHODS: Forty-one children with SDNS and SRNS with normal renal functions were treated with CyA at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day initially and maintained at 3 to 4 mg/kg/day if remission was sustained. The dosage was adjusted according to the CyA blood levels in non-responders. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 93 months (range 48-936) months. Thirteen children had minimal change disease (MCNS), 10 had mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (GN). Ten had membrano-proliferative (GN) (MPGN) and 8 had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Median age at onset of disease and median time for CyA usage from disease onset was 22 months and 16 months respectively. Median duration of CyA therapy was 24 months (range 6-72) months. The data was analyzed to determine significance of variables on the outcome. Median follow up was 71 months (range 20-205) months. Eleven children were CyA resistant. Of the remaining 30 who were CyA responders, 22 (73.33%) were CyA dependent. Seven children developed chronic renal failure (CRF). CONCLUSIONS: The predictors for CyA non-responsiveness were steroid resistance, non MCNS on biopsy and longer duration between onset of nephrotic syndrome and CyA usage, irrespective of the age of onset of the disease. There was a higher incidence of CyA dependence among young responders. Patients with CyA resistance are at high risk for significant infections and CRF.
