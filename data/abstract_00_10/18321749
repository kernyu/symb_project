Acquired immunity against infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is dependent on CD8(+)T cells. Here, to develop a vaccine strategy taking advantage of activated CD8(+)T cells, we constructed a DNA vaccine, designated pGFP-TSA1, encoding a fusion protein linking GFP to a single CTL epitope of TSA1, a leading candidate for vaccine against T. cruzi. C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with this plasmid showed suppressed parasitemia and prolonged survival. Vaccination with pGFP-TSA1 enhanced epitope-specific cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma secretion by CD8(+)T cells. Furthermore, the depletion of CD8(+)T cells prior to challenge infection with T. cruzi completely abolished this protection, indicating that CD8(+)T cells are the principal effector T cells involved. When mice deficient in the proteasome activator PA28alpha/beta or the immunoproteasome subunits LMP2 and LMP7 were used, the protective immunity against infection was profoundly attenuated. Our findings clearly demonstrate that vaccination with pGFP-TSA1 successfully induces protection dependent on CD8(+)T cell activation, in which immunoproteasomes play a crucial role. It is noteworthy to document that physical binding of the epitope and GFP is required for induction of this protection, since mice vaccinated with pTSA1-IRES-GFP failed to acquire resistance, probably because the epitope and GFP are separately expressed in the antigen-presenting cells.
