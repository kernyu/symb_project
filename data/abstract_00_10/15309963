The objective of this study was to compare the concentration and duration of fecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 between calves fed milk replacer with or without antibiotic (oxytetracycline and neomycin) supplementation. Eighteen 1-wk-old Holstein calves were orally inoculated with a strain of E. coli O157:H7 (3.6 x 10(8) cfu/calf) made resistant to nalidixic acid (NA). Rectal samples were obtained three times weekly for 8 wk following oral inoculation. Fecal shedding of NA-resistant E. coli O157:H7 was quantified by direct plating or detected by selective enrichment procedure. Eight weeks after inoculation, calves were killed, necropsied, and tissues (tonsils, retropharyngeal and mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches) and gut contents (rumen, omasum, abomasum, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum) were sampled to quantify or detect NA-resistant E. coli O157:H7. The percentage of calves shedding NA-resistant E. coli O157:H7 in the feces in the antibiotic-fed group was higher (P < 0.001) early in the study period (d 6 and 10) compared with the control group fed no antibiotics. There was no difference between treatment and control groups in the concentration of E. coli O157 in feces that were positive at quantifiable concentrations. A comparison of the duration of fecal shedding between treated and untreated calves showed no significant difference between groups. At necropsy, E. coli O157:H7 was recovered from the rumen and omasum of one calf in the control group and from retropharyngeal lymph node and Peyer's patch of two calves in the antibiotic group. Supplementation of milk replacer with antibiotics may increase the probability of E. coli O157:H7 shedding in dairy calves, but the effect seems to be of low magnitude and short duration.
