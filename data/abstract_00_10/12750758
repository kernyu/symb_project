Streptococcus pyogenes is an important human pathogen. Betalactams are still the drug of choice for the treatment of infections caused by this microorganism. In recent years an increase in the use of macrolides for initial treatment in respiratory infections has been observed; consequently, the number of macrolide-resistant isolates has also increased. We investigated the susceptibility of S. pyogenes to penicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and clindamycin in Cordoba during 2000, 2001 and the first 6 months of 2002. We obtained 100 isolates of S. pyogenes from 1232 pharyngeal exudates, all of which were susceptible to penicillin and 39 of which were resistant to erythromycin and clarithromycin. Twenty-six of these 39 isolates were susceptible to clindamycin.
