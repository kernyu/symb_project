The new GenoType Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance second line (MTBDRsl) assay (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) was tested on 106 clinical isolates and directly on 64 sputum specimens for the ability to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones, injectable drugs (amikacin or capreomycin), and ethambutol in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. A total of 63 strains harboring fluoroquinolone, amikacin/capreomycin, or ethambutol resistance and 43 fully susceptible strains were comparatively analyzed with the new MTBDRsl assay, by DNA sequencing, and by conventional drug susceptibility testing in liquid and solid media. No discrepancies were obtained in comparison with the DNA sequencing results. Fluoroquinolone resistance was detected in 29 (90.6%) of 32, amikacin/capreomycin resistance was detected in 39/39 (84.8%/86.7%) of 46/45, and ethambutol resistance was detected in 36 (69.2%) of 52 resistant strains. A total of 64 sputum specimens (42 smear positive, 12 scanty, and 10 smear negative) were tested with the new MTBDRsl assay, and the results were compared with those of conventional drug susceptibility testing. Fluoroquinolone resistance was detected in 8 (88.9%) of 9, amikacin/capreomycin resistance was detected in 6/7 (75.0%/87.5%) of 8, and ethambutol resistance was detected in 10 (38.5%) of 26 resistant strains. No mutation was detected in susceptible strains. The new GenoType MTBDRsl assay represents a reliable tool for the detection of fluoroquinolone and amikacin/capreomycin resistance and to a lesser extent also ethambutol resistance. In combination with a molecular test for detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance, the potential for the detection of extensively resistant tuberculosis within 1 to 2 days can be postulated.
