Totally 1427 patients with tuberculosis were investigated in Kaunas Romainiai Tuberculosis Hospital. All patients belonged to the first category (new cases positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis, or severe tuberculosis). Infiltrated and disseminated tuberculosis were the most frequent clinical forms. The frequency of infiltrated tuberculosis ranged from 57.36 to 68.8%, and disseminated tuberculosis ranged from 18.52 to 30.36%. The most frequent complications were bleeding from the lungs and chronic cor pulmonale. The resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin was investigated. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis did not exceed 1%. We suggest that so few cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis are due to implementation of WHO treatment standards.
