The total DNA isolated from MBC-resistant and MBC-sensitive isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz (C.g.M) of mango were used as templates in PCR amplification using consensus oligo nucleotide primers designed according to the known sequence data of beta-tubulin-encoding gene (tub 1 and tub2) of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomene (C. g. A). Only the primers designed according to C. g. A tub2 amplified specific fragments. These amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced. The results showed that these fragments have 1344bp and deduced 447 amino acid, which were highly homologous to C.g.A tub2. MBC-resistant isolates did not carry the allelic mutation at amino acid codes 198 and 200 of beta-tubulin gene in comparison with the sensitive isolates. However, the amino acid altered in codes 181, 237 and 363.
