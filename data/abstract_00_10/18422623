The plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance qnr genes in clinical isolates in adults have been described in different countries; however, the frequency of their occurrence has not been detected in pediatric patients. A total of 410 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, identified as producers of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), or AmpC beta-lactamase, were collected from five children's hospitals in China during 2005-2006. The isolates were screened for the presence of the qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS genes, and then the harboring qnr gene isolates were detected for a bla gene coding for the TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and plasmid-mediated ampC gene by a PCR experiment. Ninety-two isolates (22.7%) were positive for the qnr gene, including 10 of qnrA (2.4%), 25 of qnrB (6.1%), and 62 of qnrS (15.1%). Eighty-one of the 92 (88.0%) qnr-positive isolates carried at least one bla gene for TEM, SHV, CTX-M, or DHA-1. The ciprofloxacin resistance increased 16-256-fold and oflaxacin resistance increased 2-32-fold in transconjugants, respectively. These results indicated that the plasmid-mediated qnr quinolone resistance gene was qnrS, followed by qnrB and qnrA. Most of the isolates also carried a bla gene coding ESBL or ampC gene coding DHA-1 among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from Chinese pediatric patients.
