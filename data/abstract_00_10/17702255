Finegoldia magna is a species of strictly anaerobic gram-positive cocci, arranged in pairs, tetrads, and clusters. These organisms are components of the normal flora of the skin, gastrointestinal and genitourinary female tracts, and oral cavity. They are asaccharolytic and their major energy sources are aminoacids and peptones. The species is usually isolated in polymicrobial cultures from abscesses, soft tissue infections, bone and joints. In the case herein presented, F. magna was recovered in pure culture from a nonpuerperal breast abscess, which adds to the two reported cases in related literature. Species identification was performed by special potency disks, standard bacteriological anaerobic tests, and production of saccharolytic and proteolytic enzymes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by using the epsilometric test. The agents assayed and MICs (microg/ml) values were: penicillin, 0.064; cephalotin, 1; metronidazole, 0.25; minocycline, < 0.016; azithromycin, 4; claritromycin, 2. We would like to highlight the importance of identifying anaerobic gram-positive cocci at species level, and of determining the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, when they are isolated in pure culture from appropriate samples, as in the case presently reported.
