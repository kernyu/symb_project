We have been investigating the potential utility of engineered cell lines as surrogates for primary islet cells in treatment of type 1 diabetes. To this end, two strategies that have emerged for procuring cell lines with resistance to immune-mediated damage are 1) selection of cytokine-resistant cell lines by growth of INS-1 insulinoma cells in iteratively increasing concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta + gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), and 2) stable overexpression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 in INS-1 cells. Herein, we show that bcl-2-overexpressing cells are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), but are only modestly protected against high concentrations of IL-1beta + INF-gamma, whereas the converse is true in cytokine selected cells. We also found that the combination of bcl-2 expression and cytokine selection confers a broader spectrum of resistance than either procedure alone, such that the resultant cells are highly resistant to cytokines and ROS/RNS, with no impairment in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. INS-1-derived cells with combined bcl-2 expression and cytokine selection are also more resistant to damage induced by coculture with mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Surprisingly, application of the cytokine selection procedure to bcl-2-overexpressing cells does not result in impairment of nuclear factor-kappaB translocation, iNOS expression, and NO production, as clearly occurs upon application of the selection procedure to cells without bcl-2 overexpression. Further investigation of the diverse pathways involved in the development of cytokine and ROS/RNS resistance may define simplified and specific strategies for preservation of beta-cell mass.
