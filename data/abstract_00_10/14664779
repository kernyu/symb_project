PURPOSE: Surveillance for patients with meningitis is a high priority in order to determine the etiology of disease and design prevention strategies. This study presents data on the causes of bacterial meningitis among children <6 years of age treated in a network of hospitals throughout Egypt. METHODS: Training was provided to standardize the collection of clinical information and optimize recovery of bacterial pathogens. Bacterial isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance patterns using Kirby Bauer disk diffusion, E-test and/or Beta-lactamase (BL) testing methods. RESULTS: Patients with culture-confirmed bacterial meningitis (228 children<6 years) were identified including 89 (39%) patients with H. influenzae (HI), 68 (30%) with Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), 30 (13%) with N. meningitidis (NM), 18 (8%) with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and 23 (10%) with other bacteria. The overall case fatality ratio was high (24%) and increased among children with TB meningitis (56%). The susceptibility for HI to ampicillin (AMP), chloramphenicol (C) and ceftriaxone (CRO) was 21%, 13%, and 100% respectively. The susceptibility for SP to C and CRO was 79% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HI and SP are the leading causes of bacterial meningitis among children in Egypt. The majority of HI strains tested were resistant to AMP or C suggesting the need for routine use of CRO as first line therapy. Among older children TB emerges as a significant cause of bacterial meningitis in Egypt.
