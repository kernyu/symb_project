A total of 326 high vaginal swabs from infertile women attending the Institute of Reproductive Medicine were cultured from June 1999 to May 2000. Candida species was isolated from 42(12.88%) patients. Candida albicans (40.47%) followed by Candida glabrata (38.09%) were the most common isolates. Other species included Candida tropicalis (14.28%) and Candida krusei (7.14%). All isolates were tested for sensitivity by disc diffusion method on Yeast Nitrogen Agar base towards four antifungals. Seven (16.7%) candida strains showed resistance to Fluconazole and 19(45.23%) of the strains showed resistance to Itraconazole, and 4(9.5%) strains showed resistance to Nystatin. There was no resistance to Amphotericin B. Of the 7 strains resistant to Fluconazole, 3 were Candida krusei, 3 were Candida glabrata and 1 was Candida tropicalis.
