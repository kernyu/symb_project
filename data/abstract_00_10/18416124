The first part of the study presents the resistance profiles of 14 selected antibiotic agents for 180 clinical E. faecalis strains. Distribution of virulence factors for tested strains were characterized using PCR method. The results proved that clinical fluoroquinolone resistant E. faecalis strains possess MDR (multidrug-resistant) phenotype and presence of 7-8 tested virulence determinants.
