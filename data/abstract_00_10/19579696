Invasive candidiasis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Differences in the virulence and susceptibility of the various Candida spp. to antifungal drugs make the identification and rapid MIC determination very important for clinical management. The aim of this study was to improve the turnaround time (TAT) for antimicrobial test generation by susceptibility testing directly from the bottle of blood culture positive for yeasts, circumventing the isolation process and thereby generating an accurate antifungal MIC determination as quickly as possible. Sensititre YeastOne was used by direct inoculation from positive blood culture bottles in 40 cases of candidaemia. All the results were compared with those obtained using standard laboratory procedures after subculturing from a positive bottle onto solid media. The results obtained from direct inoculation of Sensititre YeastOne compared with tests carried out using standard procedures show that out of a total of 40 strains tested no very major errors or major errors and only 4 minor errors occurred (98% agreement rate out of a total of 240 drug/bug combinations tested), thus generating an accurate antifungal MIC determination and saving an average time of 24 hours compared with the time required for the standard procedures traditionally used.
