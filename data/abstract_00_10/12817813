A series of novel 12-membered ring macrolides was designed based on available information on structure-activity relationships and macrolide-ribosome interactions. Compounds with the desosamine and the anchor group properly attached to the 12-membered lactone ring exhibited improved activity against erythromycin-resistant organisms.
