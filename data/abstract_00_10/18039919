Ninety-two isolates belonging to five species of the Sporothrix schenckii complex were tested in vitro against 12 antifungal agents, using a reference microdilution method. There were significant differences among the species; Sporothrix brasiliensis was the species that showed the best response to antifungals, and S. mexicana had the worst response. In general, terbinafine was the most active drug, followed by ketoconazole and posaconazole.
