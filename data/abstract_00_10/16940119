Between 1998 and 2003 the rate of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci in Spain was 34.4%. Although the MLS(B) phenotype was prevalent (94.7%), the rate of the M phenotype increased from 3.3% to 8.9% (P < 0.01). Clonal dissemination of mef(E)-carrying strains of serotype 14 variant of the Spain(9V)-3 clone was the major contributor to this increase.
