Candida albicans strain diversity and fluconazole resistance were prospectively analyzed in oral strains from 29 adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients followed for > 1 year who had five or more culture-positive clinic visits. Molecular typing consisted of genomic blots probed with the Ca3 repetitive element. Sixteen patients had one or more episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), 12 (75%) maintained the original genotype, whereas the remaining four patients had a succession of 2-3 genotypes. The original genotype, either alone or mixed with another strain or with non-C. albicans Candida spp., was recovered from oral lesions in 13 of 15 evaluable (86.7%) patients. C. dubliniensis was the infecting yeast in the remaining two patients. Different patterns of fluconazole resistance occurred in three OPC patients. One patient's infecting strain became less susceptible. A second patient was infected with a resistant genotype and a progressively more susceptible minor genotype variant. C. dubliniensis isolates from the third patient varied in susceptibility. Thirteen colonized patients who never developed OPC harbored a greater variety of C. albicans genotypes (2-6) than their infected counterparts (P = 0.35). OPC patients maintained their original endogenous C. albicans strains for prolonged periods, whether or not they demonstrated decreased in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole. The adaptation and maintenance of an endogenous C. albicans strain within its host may be linked to as yet uncharacterized factors.
