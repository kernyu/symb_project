Atazanavir is a potent, novel and highly selective inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease, with a low pill burden and once-daily dosing. Clinical studies have shown atazanavir to be the first protease inhibitor (PI) to have equivalent efficacy to efavirenz over a 48-week period of follow-up in PI-treatment-naive patients. Loss of susceptibility to atazanavir in PI-naive patients occurs infrequently and is not associated with cross-resistance to other PIs. In clinical trials, atazanavir has shown better gastrointestinal tolerability than other PIs. Also, unlike other PIs, atazanavir has been associated with decreases, or only minimal increases, in lipid parameters such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides.
