The use of previously successful antiretroviral regimens in mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) prevention will be increasingly challenged by the rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV. We used enfurvitide together with an optimized antiretroviral backbone to prevent the MTCT prevention of MDR HIV in two pregnant women. The measurement of maternal and foetal peripheral blood levels of enfurvitide showed no evidence of transplacental transfer.
