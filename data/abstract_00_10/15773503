The aim of this study was to evaluate the drug susceptibility of 132 P. aeruginosa strains isolated from patients hospitalized in SPSK University Hospital in Bialystok. The isolates were obtained from clinical specimens over an 11-month period in 2001 and 2002. All the strains were identified in automatic ATB system using API 20 NE strips, and their susceptibility to antibiotics was tested by standard disc-diffusion method and agar dilution method. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for five antibiotics: piperacillin, amikacin, ceftazidime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin. The majority of strains were susceptible to ceftazidime (91.7%), piperacillin combined with tazobactam (85.6%), amikacin (80.3%), meropenem and imipenem (81.8%). Many of our strains were resistant to cefotaxime (73.5%), ticarcillin (53%) and ciprofloxacin (48.5%). Also, the trial was undertaken to detect strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and inducible beta-lactamases (IBL) among P. aeruginosa rods isolated from different specimens. ESBL-producing strains were detected with double disc test (DDST) and combination double disc (CD) test. Clavulanate was applied as the inhibitor of these beta-lactamases. Strains producing ESBL were not found. On the other hand, as many as 127 P. aeruginosa strains (96.2%) produced inducible beta-lactamases (IBL).
