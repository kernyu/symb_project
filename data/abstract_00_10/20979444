We report the isolation of Cryptococcus magnus and Cryptococcus chernovii in cultures inoculated with nasal specimens of pediatric cancer patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The phenotypic characteristics of the isolates are described and their identity confirmed by sequencing of rDNA. Both species were resistant to caspofungin, anidulafungin, 5-flucytosine and itraconazole, but susceptible to amphotericin B, posaconazole and voriconazole. To the best of our knowledge, the isolation of these two species from nasal cavities has not been reported previously.
