According to new reports the AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia gene is no longer the only gene encoding resistance to gentamycin in Gram-positive cocci and therefore the current method for predicting synergism aminoglycosides with bacterial cell wall active agents in this bacteria may need revision. To further our knowledge of aminoglycoside resistance mechanism in Gram-positive cocci in Gdansk region we tested presence of AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia gene among 22 enterococcal (E. faecalis) and 41 staphylococcal (S. haemolyticus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis) gentamycin-resistant isolates. Presence of AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia gene varied from 50% (n = 6) in gentamycin-resistant S. epidermidis, 80% (n = 10) in gentamycin resistant S. haemolyticus 88% in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 25). In Enterococcus faecalis this gene was noticed only in 59% (n = 22) of gentamycin-resistant isolates. These results suggest that spread of resistance gene among different species is limited and AAC (6')-APH (2")Ia mediated gentamycin-resistance mechanism is more common among MRSA and Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
