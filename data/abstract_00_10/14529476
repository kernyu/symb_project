Aurones [2-benzylidenebenzofuran-3(2H)-ones] are the secondary metabolites natural compounds belong to the flavonoids family, and structurally are the isomers of flavones, widely present in fruits and flowers where they play significant role in the pigmentation of the part of plant in which they occur. Literature survey clearly indicates that flavones, chalcones, flavonols and isoflavones have been studied largely for their therapeutical potential. Somehow, aurones still are less studied and it is only recently that these compounds have begun to be investigated. In this review, we report the recent advances made on the therapeutical potential of aurones in different biological areas. Their synthesis, structure-activity relationships, the importance of the substitution pattern will also be discussed. Finally, some aspects regarding the possible development of aurones will be highlighted briefly.
