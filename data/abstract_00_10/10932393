BACKGROUND: To know the characteristics of Enterococcus spp. strains isolated in the hospital; to analyse the importance of this microorganism and its resistance to antimicrobial agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the case histories of 169 patients with Enterococcus spp. isolates, selected at random at the Infanta Cristina Hospital in Badajoz. Investigation was carried out on: age, date of admission and discharge, clinical symptoms, risk factors, previous antibiotic treatment, clinical and microbiological evolution, recommended treatment and prescribed treatment. Identification of microorganisms and antibiogram with Pos Combo 41 microScam panels, read on Baxter WalkAway-40 equipment. RESULTS: The most frequently found species was Enterococcus faecalis. In 75 cases the isolations were polymicrobial. The enterococci were isolated mainly from urinary infections (27%), skin infections (20%), intrabdominal infections (14%) and infections from surgical wounds (14%). The existence of peripheral catheter was the main risk factor. All the strains of E. faecalis were susceptible to the glycopeptides. Two strains of Enterococcus faecium were not susceptible to vancomycin and one of these was not susceptible to teicoplanin. Mortality was from 21-27.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcus spp. is frequently isolated in nosocomial infections, although in approximately half the cases it is associated with other bacteria. For this reason, it is not always possible to determine its pathogenic contribution. The isolated strains, except two strains of E. faecium, are susceptible to vancomycin. A relation exists between high resistance to aminoglucosides and resistance to fluoroquinolones.
