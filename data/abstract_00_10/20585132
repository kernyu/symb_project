We determined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of 255 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria collected in 2007 and 2008 at a tertiary-care hospital in South Korea. Piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, and meropenem were highly active beta-lactam agents against most of the isolates tested. The rates of resistance of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms and anaerobic gram-positive cocci to moxifloxacin were 11 to 18% and 0 to 27%, respectively.
