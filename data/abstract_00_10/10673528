PURPOSE: To evaluate the results of etoposide, cisplatin/etoposide, methotrexate, and actinomycin D (EP/EMA) chemotherapy in patients with gestational trophoblastic tumors (GTTs), who have relapsed after or who have become refractory to EMA/cyclophosphamide and vincristine (CO) chemotherapy, and in patients presenting with metastatic placental site trophoblastic tumors (PSTTs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have treated a total of 34 patients with GTT and eight patients with metastatic PSTT with the EP/EMA chemotherapy schedule. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients received EP/EMA because of apparent drug resistance to EMA/CO, and because the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was near normal, they were not assessable for response. Twenty-one of these patients (95%) are alive and in remission. In the group where the hCG was high enough to confirm a response (greater than one log fall in hCG) to EP/EMA, all 12 patients responded and nine of these patients (75%) are alive and in remission. We have treated three patients with PSTT where the interval from antecedent pregnancy was less than 2 years, and all patients (100%) are alive and in remission. We have treated five patients where the interval from antecedent pregnancy was greater than 2 years and one fifth (20%) remain in remission. The survival for patients with GTT is 30 (88%) out of 34 patients and four (50%) out of eight patients for PSTT, giving an overall survival for these two cohorts of 34 (81%) out of 42 patients. The toxicity of this schedule is significant, with grade 3 or 4 toxicity (National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria) recorded in hemoglobin (21%), WBC (68%), and platelets (40%). The role of surgery in this group of patients is important and contributed to sustained remission in five patients (23%) and possibly helped an additional seven patients (32%). CONCLUSION: EP/EMA is an effective but moderately toxic regimen for patients with high-risk GTT who become refractory to or relapse from EMA/CO chemotherapy. Also, EP/EMA clearly has activity in patients with metastatic PSTT.
