We examined the effects of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S12 mutations on the efficiency of cell-free protein synthesis. By screening 150 spontaneous streptomycin-resistant isolates from E. coli BL21, we successfully obtained seven mutants of the S12 protein, including two streptomycin-dependent mutants. The mutations occurred at Lys42, Lys87, Pro90 and Gly91 of the 30S ribosomal protein S12. We prepared S30 extracts from mutant cells harvested in the mid-log phase. Their protein synthesis activities were compared by measuring the yields of the active chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Higher protein production (1.3-fold) than the wild-type was observed with the mutant that replaced Lys42 with Thr (K42T). The K42R, K42N, and K42I strains showed lower activities, while the other mutant strains with Lys87, Pro90 and Pro91 did not show any significant difference from the wild-type. We also assessed the frequency of Leu misincorporation in poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis. In this assay system, almost all mutants showed higher accuracy and lower activity than the wild-type. However, K42T offered higher activity, in addition to high accuracy. Furthermore, when 14 mouse cDNA sequences were used as test templates, the protein yields of nine templates in the K42T system were 1.2-2 times higher than that of the wild-type.
