The prevalence of the internalization-associated prtF1 gene was studied in 837 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes obtained from 713 pediatric patients presenting with acute pharyngotonsillitis before and after antibiotic therapy. Its association with macrolide resistance and with bacteriological treatment failure was determined. The bacterial population isolated from baseline pharyngeal swabs showed an overall prtF1 positivity rate of 33%. A higher prtF1 positivity was found among erythromycin-resistant strains (45%) showing, however, marked differences between the inducible (iMLS), constitutive (cMLS), and efflux pump (M) resistance phenotypes. The prevalence was statistically higher (p < 0.001) in strains belonging to iMLS (84%) and cMLS (67%) phenotypes as compared to the M phenotype (15%). Interestingly, the prevalence of the prtF1 gene was significantly lower (p = 0.04) in strains belonging to M resistance phenotype as compared to erythromycin-susceptible strains (28%). Failed bacterial eradication was demonstrated in 124 patients. The prtF1 positivity rate remained unchanged in strains isolated before and after therapy in patients treated with macrolides (9/54). On the other hand, the positivity rate for the prtF1 gene was significantly higher (p = 0.015) in strains isolated after therapy with beta-lactams (21/70) as compared to baseline isolates (6/70), indicating a differential selection imposed on the organism by these agents. Finally, a high overall eradication rate (88%) of prtF1-positive isolates, belonging to both the erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant phenotypes, was demonstrated following macrolide treatment.
