Increasing quinolone resistance has been reported worldwide, mainly among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli. The objectives of this study were to determine the susceptibility profile, the genetic relatedness, and the prevalence of the qnr gene among ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from distinct Brazilian hospitals. A total of 144 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli were isolated from 17 Brazilian hospitals between January/2002 and June/2003. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by microdilution according to NCCLS. The presence of the qnr gene was initially screened by colony blotting, and then confirmed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Ninety-five urinary ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli were further selected for molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Imipenem and meropenem showed the highest susceptibility rates (100.0% for both compounds) followed by amikacin (91.0%) and piperacillin/tazobactan (84.8%). A single ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli isolate was positive for qnr among the 144 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli. Forty-six PFGE patterns were observed among the 95 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli type. This study shows that therapeutic options are limited for treatment of ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli due to the presence of additional mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, such as ESBL production. The qnr gene was uncommon among ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli clinical isolates, but its identification might indicate the emergence of this mechanism of quinolone resistance in Brazil. The great genomic variability found among the ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli highlights the importance of the appropriate use of quinolone to restrict the selection of resistant isolates.
