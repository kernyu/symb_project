We designed a multicenter Phase II trial to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of rituximab with the DHAP regimen (dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin) in patients who relapsed after or were resistant to a CHOP-like regimen. A total of 53 patients with relapsed or resistant aggressive B-cell NHL were analyzed. The overall response rate was 62.3 percent. With a median follow-up of 24.9 months, median overall and progression-free survivals were 8.5 and 6.7 months, respectively. Immunochemotherapy with rituximab and DHAP proved to be feasible and effective in this patient population.
