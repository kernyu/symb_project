Insulin resistance results, in part, from impaired insulin signaling in insulin target tissues. Consequently, increased levels of insulin are necessary to control plasma glucose levels. The effects of elevated insulin levels on pancreatic beta (beta) cell function, however, are unclear. In this study, we investigated the possibility that insulin may influence survival of pancreatic beta cells. Studies were conducted on RINm, RINm5F and Min-6 pancreatic beta-cells. Cell death was induced by treatment with H(2)O(2), and was estimated by measurements of LDH levels, viability assay (Cell-Titer Blue), propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis, and mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1). In addition, levels of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase activity were determined. Treatment with H(2)O(2) increased cell death; this effect was increased by simultaneous treatment of cells with insulin. Insulin treatment alone caused a slight increase in cell death. Inhibition of caspase-3 reduced the effect of insulin to increase H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. Insulin increased ROS production by pancreatic beta cells and increased the effect of H(2)O(2). These effects were increased by inhibition of IR signaling, indicative of an effect independent of the IR cascade. We conclude that elevated levels of insulin may act to exacerbate cell death induced by H(2)O(2) and, perhaps, other inducers of apoptosis.
