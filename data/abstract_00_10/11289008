A new finding is reported of multiple mutations in the rpoB gene of 9 Mycobacterium leprae strains from leprosy patients in Thailand, who did not respond to therapy even when rifampicin, the main drug in multi-drug therapy was used. By means of sequence analysis of 9 Thai M. leprae strains, various mutations in 289 bps of the rpoB gene revealed forms of mutation never before described, such as multiple mutations (ie, mutation at two, three, six, seven, eight and nine positions in the rpoB gene), most of which were point-mutation substitutions (a few of which were silent), and some insertions. This investigation demonstrates that mutation in the rpoB gene of M. leprae strains from Thailand involves more variety than previously reported for rpoB mutation patterns in rifampicin resistance M. leprae strains.
