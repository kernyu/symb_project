Mutation of 23S rDNA is one of the mechanisms of erythromycin resistance. PCR and line probe assay (PCR-LiPA) with ten oligonucleotide probes were developed to detect the mutations associated with macrolide resistance at positions of 2072, 2073 and 2074 in 23S rDNA of Campylobacter jejuni/coli. A2074-->G mutation was detected in 12 of 25 isolates, which were resistant to erythromycin. No other mutations in 23S rDNA were detected. The rest of the strains were susceptible to erythromycin and no mutation in 23S rDNA was detected. Six laboratory induced erythromycin resistant mutants had no mutations in 23S rDNA. PCR-LiPA is a useful and rapid method to detect mutations in 23S rDNA associated with erythromycin resistance in C. jejuni/coli.
