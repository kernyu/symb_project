The aim of this study was to compare sewage samples from Hospital Sao Vicente de Paulo with water samples from the Passo Fundo river, with regard to the susceptibility profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, in order to make inferences about the presence of strains of hospital origin in surface water samples. The statistical significance between the susceptibility profiles of the samples was tested using analysis of variance, and the samples were compared by means of contrasts of interest. One hundred and ninety-eight isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were recovered from the samples analyzed. No phenotype for multiresistance was found in the samples from the Passo Fundo river, although some carbapenem-resistant isolates were identified, thereby indicating the presence of contamination with bacteria derived from an environment under strong selection pressure. Significant differences between the water and hospital effluent samples were observed, based on the analysis of variance by means of contrasts of interest.
