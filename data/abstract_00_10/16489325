AIM: Microbes commonly involved in ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) are difficult to eradicate: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are often resistant to piperacillin, aztreonam and ceftazidim while Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae are resistant to third generation cephalosporins. Physicians need to tailor their therapeutic approach depending on individual patients and clinical setting, firmly based on local epidemiology. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of VAP caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria in our ICU. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients mechanically ventilated for longer than 72 h, who developed pneumonia over an eighteen-month period for whom final culture data were available. One-hundred and forty-three patients admitted to a University Hospital medical surgical ICU were included in this survey. VAP was diagnosed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and confirmed by mini- bronchoalveolar lavage. RESULTS: In this study, the incidence of VAP in the period January 1, 2002-June 31, 2003 was very high, accounting for about 20% of all at-risk cases. Multiresistant agents were involved in about 57% of VAP occurring within 7 days of mechanical ventilation, and in 80% of late VAP. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed differences in VAP incidence and features among our ICU and literature data, indicating a need for caution when using hospital infection surveillance data for comparisons and choice of therapy. In our setting, with high levels of antibiotic resistance, combined approaches of non-antibiotic using strategies and education programs might be beneficial.
