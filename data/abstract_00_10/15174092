The purpose of this study was to determine whether expression of tissue transglutaminase (TG2) and caspase-3 proteins in drug-resistant breast carcinoma MCF-7/DOX cells would render these cells selectively susceptible to apoptotic stimuli. Despite high resistance to multidrug resistance (MDR)-related drug, doxorubicin (> or =150-fold), the MCF-7/DOX cells were extremely sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Thus, calcium ionophore, A23187 (A23187) and the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (STS) each induced rapid and time-dependent apoptosis in MCF-7/DOX cells. The apoptosis induced by either agent was accompanied by caspase-3 activation and other downstream changes that are typical of cells undergoing apoptosis. The alterations upstream of caspase-3 activation, however, such as loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi), release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-8, and caspase-9, were detected only in STS-treated cells. The A12387 failed to induce any of the caspase-3 upstream changes, implying that A23187-induced apoptosis may utilize one or more novel upstream pathways leading to the activation of caspase 3. In summary, these data demonstrate that MCF-7/DOX cells are much more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli than previously thought and that A23187-induced apoptosis may involve some novel, yet unidentified, upstream pathway that leads to the activation of caspase-3 and other downstream events.
