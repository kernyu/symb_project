BACKGROUND: Topical application of active substances offers an additional option in periodontal therapy. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of the administration of a novel, biodegradable 14% doxycycline gel on microbiological findings, in connection with scaling and root planing. METHODS: One hundred ten patients in three centers (Frankfurt and Heidelberg, Germany; Nijmegen, The Netherlands) with moderate to advanced periodontitis were evaluated in this randomized, double-masked, split-mouth clinical trial. In each patient, three test teeth were randomly assigned to one of three treatment modalities: 1) scaling and root planing (SRP) alone; 2) SRP with subgingival placebo gel (VEH); or 3) SRP and 14% doxycycline gel (DOX). Subgingival plaque samples were analyzed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Tannerella forsythensis (T.f.), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.), and Treponema denticola (T.d.) using a RNA probe. Samples from 10 patients were tested for resistance against doxycycline, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole using agar diffusion testing. RESULTS: The largest decrease in pathogens was found after 3 months, with the most pronounced differences between DOX and SRP (P <0.05). At 6 months, pathogens were still reduced markedly in all groups. Treatment results were consolidated for VEH and DOX, with a slight deterioration for SRP (DOX versus SRP: P <0.001). Resistance was observed to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole (four isolates) but not to doxycycline. CONCLUSION: The addition of subgingival instillation of a 14% doxycycline gel resulted in pronounced reduction of periodontal pathogens after 3 months and stabilizing results up to 6 months after therapy. Resistance to doxycycline was not induced.
