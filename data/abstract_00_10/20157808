Pseudomonas sp. strain NyZ402, a native soil organism that grows on para-nitrophenol (PNP), was genetically engineered for the simultaneous degradation of methyl parathion (MP) and ortho-nitrophenol (ONP) by integrating mph (methyl parathion hydrolase gene) from Pseudomonas sp. strain WBC-3 and onpAB (ONP 2-monooxygenase and ONP o-benzoquinone reductase genes) from Alcaligenes sp. strain NyZ215 into the genome of strain NyZ402. Methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH), ONP 2-monooxygenase (OnpA) and o-benzoquinone reductase (OnpB) were constitutively expressed in the engineered strain NyZ-MO. Strain NyZ-MO was free of exogenous antibiotic resistance gene markers and the introduced genes were genetically stable. Degradation experiments showed that strain NyZ-MO could utilize MP or ONP as the sole carbon and energy source, and mineralize 0.1 mM MP-0.1 mM ONP simultaneously. This method may serve as a useful strategy for the construction of engineered strains in the degradation of multiple environmental pollutants.
