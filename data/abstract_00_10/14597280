The state of anthelmintic resistance in Scottish sheep flocks was evaluated during April-August 2000 using in vitro bioassays, egg hatch assays for detecting thiabendazole (TBZ) resistance and larval development assays for levamisole, ivermectin and TBZ resistance. Anaerobic sampling kits and detailed questionnaires outlining farm demographics and current management practices were mailed to 227 Moredun Foundation member farms, replies were received from 98 farms. Kits received from 90 farms contained sufficient material to conduct one or more of the assays. A majority of the farms examined (64%) exhibited TBZ resistance but there were both farm locality and regional variations in the percentage of resistant farms. Teladorsagia was the predominant genera detected from farms. No resistance to levamisole or ivermectin was detected in any of the samples. There was no strong evidence from this survey that any of the management practices examined greatly affected TBZ resistance.
