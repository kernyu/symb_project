We describe 2 cases in which the prolonged use of linezolid to treat complicated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections was followed by acutely developed blurred vision and progressive loss of vision and color perception during the ensuing few weeks. Both patients received a diagnosis of toxic optic neuropathy, and linezolid therapy was stopped. The patients experienced an initial rapid partial improvement and a subsequent gradual, almost complete, recovery over many months.
