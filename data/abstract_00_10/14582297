Pentavalent antimony (PA) compounds remain the main therapeutic agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). CL infection resistant to PA is difficult to cure, limited by severe side effects and requiring a long course treatment of parenteral administration of recommended second line drugs. We report a case of CL unresponsive to meglumine antimoniate contracted in Djibouti, successfully treated with a short course treatment of AmBisome. In this case the subject had a recurrent thick crusted erythematous lesion on his left elbow associated with spreading micropapula on arms and thorax. The diagnosis of CL was confirmed by direct examination and genomic amplification by PCR of skin samples, cultures were negative. A short course treatment of parenteral AmBisome (18 mg/kg) has lead to clinical cure with no side effects and no relapse. In our hospital, the high cost of medication was counterbalanced by easiest administration, reduction of hospitalization duration, absence of adverse events and a gain of comfort. For this patient, a short course treatment of AmBisome proved to be a suitable alternative to traditional drugs used in CL resistant to PA.
