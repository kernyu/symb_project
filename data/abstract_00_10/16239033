OBJECTIVES: To produce recommendations for the management of Aspergillus osteomyelitis and joint infections. METHODS: Published literature was surveyed to identify both case reports of Aspergillus osteomyelitis and joint infections and anti-fungal pharmacology of anti-fungal agents. Included in the pharmacological review was an assessment of new and investigational anti-fungals to consider their potential role in the management of this infection. RESULTS: Successful treatments, identified from the cases reviewed, were based on combination anti-fungal therapy with one agent having good bone penetration and one having reliable anti-Aspergillus activity. CONCLUSIONS: For the management of serious Aspergillus osteomyleitis/joint infections amphotericin B in combination with flucytosine is recommended. A number of second line treatment combinations are identified. Monotherapy is appropriate with an azole in clinically stable patients.
