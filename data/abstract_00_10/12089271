We describe a simple multiplex allele-specific (MAS)-PCR assay to detect mutations in the second base of the katG gene codon 315, including AGC-->ACC and ACA (Ser-->Thr) substitutions that confer resistance to isoniazid (INH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates. The 315 ACC allele is found in the majority of Inh(r) strains worldwide, especially in areas with a high incidence of tuberculosis. The 315 ACA allele is characteristic of the New York City multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain W and its progenies in the United States. The mutations in katG315 are revealed depending on the presence or absence of an indicative fragment amplified from the wild-type allele of this codon. Initially optimized on the purified DNA samples, the assay was then tested on crude cell lysates and auramine-stained sputum slide preparations with the same reproducibility and interpretability of profiles generated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The MAS-PCR assay can be used for the detection of resistance to INH in clinical laboratories in regions with a high prevalence of MDR M. tuberculosis strains.
