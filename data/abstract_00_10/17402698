56 strains of Salmonella were isolated from the cerebro-spinal fluids (CSF) from meningitis suspected patients at the Yalgado-Ouedraogo University hospital center in Burkina Faso, from January 2000 to December 2004. 75% of the patients were less than 3 years old; 71.4% of the CSF were purulent, with an average of 523 leucocytes/mm3 and 78% of neutrophile polynuclears. The strains identified belonged mostly to Salmonella O: 4.5 group (51.8%). In vitro, 92.7% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin and this resistance was partially restored with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; however no strain was resistant to ceftriaxone. For the overall 56 patients, 20 different antibiotherapy regimes were used and they were successful in only 27% cases while 71% of patients died and 2% escaped from the hospital. Neurologic sequels were found in a patient treated with both ceftriaxone and chloramphenicol. These results showed that the illness occurred mainly in infants and was associated with high mortality rate. Most of the Salmonella strains were multi-drug resistant. In spite of strains multi-antibiotics resistance, adequate definition of therapeutic lines and early treatment including ceftriaxone could lead to higher cure rates and may improve the outcome.
