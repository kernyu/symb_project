The hypothesis tested was that ketoconazole can modulate P-glycoprotein, thereby altering cellular uptake and apparent permeability (P(app)) of multidrug-resistant substrates, such as cyclosporin A (CSA) and digoxin, across Caco-2, MDCKII-MDR1, and MDCKII wild-type cell transport models. (3)H-CSA/(3)H-digoxin transport experiments were performed with and without co-exposure to ketoconazole, and (3)H-ketoconzole transport experiments were performed with and without co-exposure to dietary flavonoids, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and xanthohumol. Ketoconazole (3 microM) reduced the P(app) efflux of CSA and digoxin from 5.07 x 10(-6) to 2.91 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) and from 2.60 x 10(-6) to 1.41 x 10(-6) cm s(-1), respectively, in Caco-2 cells. In the MDCKII-MDR1 cells, ketoconazole reduced the P(app) efflux of CSA and increased the P(app) absorption of digoxin. Cellular uptake of ketoconazole in the Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited by CSA and digoxin, whereas epigallocatechin-3-gallate and xanthohumol exhibited biphasic responses. In conclusion, ketoconazole modulates the P(app) of P-glycoprotein substrates by interacting with MDR1 protein. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate and xanthohumol modulate the transport and uptake of ketoconazole.
