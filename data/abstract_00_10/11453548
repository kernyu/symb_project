After pre-culture and treatment of osmosis, cotyledons of immature peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) zygotic embryos were transformed via particle bombardment with a plasmid containing a chimeric hph gene conferring resistance to hygromycin and a chimeric intron-gus gene. Selection for hygromycin resistant calluses and somatic embryos was initiated at 10th d post-bombardment on medium containing 10-25 mg/L hygromycin. Under continuous selection, hygromycin resistant plantlets were regenerated from somatic embryos and were recovered from nearly 1.6% of the bombarded cotyledons. The presence and integration of foreign DNA in regenerated hygromycin resistant plants was confirmed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for the intron-gus gene and by Southern hybridization of the hph gene. GUS enzyme activity was detected in leaflets from transgenic plants but not from control, non-transformed plants. The production of transgenic plants are mainly based on a newly improved somatic embryogenesis regeneration system developed by us.
