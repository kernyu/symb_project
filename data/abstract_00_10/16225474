Steatosis is a common feature of chronic hepatitis C, and may be caused directly by the virus, as in genotype 3 infection, or be associated with host metabolic factors. The interaction of hepatitis C virus core protein with the lipoprotein secretion pathways causes the characteristic alterations of lipid metabolism observed in hepatitis C virus-related steatosis. Several pathogenic mechanisms are likely involved into the pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus-related steatosis, including hyper-homocysteinaemia, hypoadiponectinaemia and insulin resistance. Steatosis is a major determinant of the liver damage progression in chronic hepatitis C (CHC), and negatively affects the response rate to the interferon (IFN)-based anti-viral treatment. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that steatosis may contribute to liver carcinogenesis. Chronic hepatitis C is a recognized risk factor for type 2 diabetes and it could be implicated into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The role of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related steatosis in these epidemiological associations remains to be determined.
