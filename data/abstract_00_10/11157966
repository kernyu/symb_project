The Enterococcus faecalis general stress protein Gsp65 has been purified from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Determination of its N-terminal sequence and characterization of the corresponding gene revealed that the gsp65 product is a 133-amino-acid protein sharing homologies with organic hydroperoxide resistance (Ohr) proteins. Transcriptional analysis of gsp65 gave evidence for a monocistronic mRNA initiated 52 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon and for an induction in response to hydrogen peroxide, heat shock, acid pH, detergents, ethanol, sodium chloride, and tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBOOH). A gsp65 mutant showed increased sensitivity to the organic hydroperoxide tBOOH and to ethanol.
