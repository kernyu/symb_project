A 23 year-old Pakistani man presented at the emergency clinic of Tepecik Research and Training Hospital with the symptoms such as fever (39.3 degrees C), blurred consciousness, subicteric sclera and splenomegalia. In the laboratory examination, a slightly increase of the liver enzymes and anemia were detected. The gametocytes and trophozoites of Plasmodium falciparum were seen in a bone marrow aspiration and treatment was started with quinine and doxycycline but since resistance was detected to these medicines, mefloquine was chosen as alternative therapy. He was cured and discharged. The second case was also a Pakistani 20-year old man and he was a friend of first case. He presented at our hospital with the symptoms such as fever (39.4 degrees C), closed consciousness, icteric sclera and systolic souffle in all cardiac foci. During the laboratory examination, severe anemia and trombocytopenia, and an increase in the liver enzymes were found. P. falciparum gametocytes and young trophozoites were seen in a blood smear stained with Giemsa. For treatment, mefloquine was used but unfortunately the patient died due to an adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complication. In this study, two cases with different clinical manifestations were presented to emphasize the importance of timing in starting the correct treatment.
