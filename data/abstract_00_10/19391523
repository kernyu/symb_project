During the period 1993-2001, a total of 1,499 pneumococci isolates were recovered through the Argentinean surveillance of Streptococcus pneumoniae causing invasive disease in children under 6 years of age, 3.5% of which were erythromycin resistant. Among the 50 erythromycin-resistant strains available, 58% (n=29) harbored mefA/E genes (15 mefA, 30%; and 14 mefE, 28%), 34% (n=17) ermB, and 6% (n=3) both mefA/E plus ermB genes, while one isolate was negative for all the acquired genes studied. The England14-9 (42%), Poland6B-20 (20%) and Spain9V-3 (16%) clones were responsible for the emergence of pneumococcal macrolide resistance in pediatric population from Argentina.
