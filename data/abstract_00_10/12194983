Nucleoside analogues are currently used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infections. The appearance of up to five substitutions (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M) in the viral reverse transcriptase promotes resistance to these drugs, and reduces efficiency of the antiretroviral chemotherapy. Using pre-steady state kinetics, we show that Q151M and A62V/V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M substitutions confer to reverse transcriptase (RT) the ability to discriminate an analogue relative to its natural counterpart, and have no effect on repair of the analogue-terminated DNA primer. Discrimination results from a selective decrease of the catalytic rate constant k(pol): 18-fold (from 7 to 0.3 s(-1)), 13-fold (from 1.9 to 0.14 s(-1)), and 12-fold (from 13 to 1 s(-1)) in the case of ddATP, ddCTP, and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate (AZTTP), respectively. The binding affinities of the triphosphate analogues for RT remain unchanged. Molecular modeling explains drug resistance by a selective loss of electrostatic interactions between the analogue and RT. Resistance was overcome using alpha-boranophosphate nucleotide analogues. Using A62V/V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M RT, k(pol) increases up to 70- and 13-fold using alpha-boranophosphate-ddATP and alpha-boranophosphate AZTTP, respectively. These results highlight the general capacity of such analogues to circumvent multidrug resistance when RT-mediated nucleotide resistance originates from the selective decrease of the catalytic rate constant k(pol).
