The introduction of pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha) as well as lamivudine and adefovir has greatly improved the perspectives for patients with chronic hepatitis B. In addition, new nucleos(t)ide analogues are currently being evaluated and may allow the development of effective combination therapy regimens in the future. In the absence of resistance development, lamivudine reduces the risk of decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. Current standard therapy of chronic hepatitis C, PEG-IFN-alpha combined with ribavirin, results in a sustained virologic response in 20-80% of patients, depending on the viral genotype and additional factors, such as ethnicity, fibrosis stage, body mass index, viral load, alcohol consumption, and coinfections. Novel antiviral strategies are currently being explored.
