Biofilm bacteria are widely held to exhibit a unique phenotype, typified by their increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. Numerous studies have been devoted to the identification of biofilm-specific genes, but surprisingly few have been reported to date. We compared the whole cell proteomes of 24 h old Bacillus cereus biofilms and the associated suspended population to exponential, transient and stationary phase planktonic cultures using the unbiased approach of principal component analysis, comparing the quantity variations of the 823 detected spots. The analyses support the hypothesis that biofilms of Gram positive bacteria have a unique pattern of gene expression. The data provides proteomic evidence for a new biofilm and surface influenced planktonic population which is distinct to both planktonic and biofilm cells.
