We have previously reported that novobiocin potentiates the cytotoxic activity of etoposide (VP-16) and teniposide (VM-26) in a number of experimental tumor cell lines by inhibition of the efflux of the epipodophyllotoxins by an ATP-requiring transporter. In leukemia cells from 12/19 patients and in ovarian carcinoma cells from 2/4 patients, novobiocin, in a concentration range of 150-1000 microM, increased the intracellular accumulation of VP-16 by 30-250% by inhibiting its efflux. Novobiocin did not significantly increase the intracellular concentration of VP-16 in human mononuclear bone marrow cells from two individuals with normal bone marrow, suggesting that it might be possible to selectively modulate the intracellular accumulation of the epipodophyllotoxin in tumor cells relative to normal hematopoietic tissue. Previous findings from our laboratory have provided evidence that the membrane transporter for VP-16 which is inhibited by novobiocin is distinct from the P-glycoprotein. The expression of MRP, measured by immunoblotting, was variable in novobiocin-responsive and non-responsive leukemia cells, indicating that no direct relationship existed between the modulatory activity of novobiocin on the transport of VP-16 and the expression of the MRP gene. The findings indicate that the novobiocin-sensitive VP-16 transporter is (i) present in high frequency in leukemia and ovarian carcinoma cells, and (ii) probably not the P-glycoprotein or MRP.
