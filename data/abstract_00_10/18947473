OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Dalian. METHODS: Between January 2006 and February 2007, 930 children with ARI were enrolled, including 364 with acute upper respiratory infection (AURI), and 566 with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). The AURI children, who did not receive antimicrobial agent treatment or received oral antimicrobial agents 1-2 times, had bacterial cultures of pharyngeal swab. The ALRI children, who received intravenous antibacterial agents more than 3 days, had bacterial cultures of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Isolated bacteria were identified by the ATB system (Bio-Merieux, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-bauer. RESULTS: A total of 404 isolates (43.4%) were identified. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 22.5%, 12.1% and 7.4% respectively. In the isolates from AURI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 43.9%, 22.0% and 9.1% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Nonfermenters accounted for 4.5%, 8.3% and 3.0% respectively. In the isolates from ALRI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 12.1%, 7.4% and 6.6% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Nonfermenters accounted for 16.9%, 13.2% and 21.8% respectively. The resistant rates of Haemophilus to ampicillin and TMP-SMZ were 29.3% and 32.9% respectively, and to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefalotin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and cefotaxime were 12.1%, 10.0%, 10.0%, 11.4% and 5.7%, respectively. The resistant rate of Haemophilus to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, tetracycine and TMP-SMZ in the ALRI group were significantly higher than that in the AURI group (P<0.05 or 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In Dalian, Haemophilus was the main isolate of children with ARI. The distribution of bacteria was different between ALRI and AURI. In ALRI, Gram-negative bacilli were in a higher proportion, and the resistant rates of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefaclor were higher.
