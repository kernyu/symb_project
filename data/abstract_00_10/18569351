Compounds based on the isoxazoline moiety were screened for their antimycobacterial activity in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37R (MTB), and INH (isoniazid) resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (INHR-MTB) using the agar dilution method and bactec 460. Among the synthesized compounds, 4-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-isoxazolyl]-2-methylphenol (4l) was found to be the most active agent against MTB and INHR-MTB with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.62 microM. When compared to INH, compound (4l) was 1.12 fold and 3.0 fold more active against MTB and INHR-MTB, respectively.
