For the treatment of children and adolescents with tuberculosis, the needs for reserve drugs are 24.0 and 48.6%, respectively. The main reason of the use of reserve drugs is intolerability of essential antituberculous drugs in children (16.4%), and resistance to these drugs in adolescents (40%). Overall, different types of intolerability events (allergic, toxic, toxicoallergic reactions) were observed in 27 (34%) of 79 children and in 46 (65%) of 70 adolescents. Adverse reactions to essential drugs were significantly more frequently observed than those to reserve drugs in both the children and the adolescents: in 96.3 and 3.7% (p < 0.001) and in 89.1 and 10.9% (p < 0.001) cases, respectively.
