We assessed the clinical and parasitological efficacy of six-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) (Coartem) for treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria three years after its introduction into Ethiopia. A total of 102 patients (mean age: 15.7 years; age range: 1-50 years) were enrolled in the study and followed-up for 28 days based on WHO protocol. Treatment with AL resulted in 100% adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). No severe side-effect of the drug was observed. All patients had rapid clinical and parasitological responses. None of the subject was found to be positive for asexual or sexual stage of the parasite after day 3. A significant increase in the mean of haemoglobin level was observed on day 28 posttreatment (11.4 g/dL on day 0 vs 12.3 g/dL on day 28, p < 0.05). Thus, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) seem to mitigate not only the problem of drug resistance malaria but also the transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, monitoring ACT therapeutic efficacy is crucial in Ethiopia.
