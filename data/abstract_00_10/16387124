BACKGROUND: Steroid-resistant rejection (SRR) results in significant morbidity and mortality from the adverse effects of rescue therapy and in graft loss from chronic rejection. In our knowledge, the efficacy and safety of anti-interleukin (IL) 2r antibodies (daclizumab and basiliximab) for the treatment of SRR in adult liver transplantation has not previously been evaluated. METHODS: Twenty-five patients received either daclizumab or basiliximab as rescue therapy for SRR. Outcome and biochemical parameters were recorded before and after treatment with an anti-IL-2r antibody. RESULTS: The median time from transplantation to SRR was 25 days. Secondary immunosuppression included mycophenolate mofetil in 18 patients. Twelve patients (48%) had complete resolution of SRR. Aspartate transaminase levels normalized at a median of 37 days (range, 1-168 days). In 13 patients (52%) progressive hepatic dysfunction developed. Four of these patients received another transplant, and 6 patients had chronic rejection. Three patients died with graft failure. Of 16 patients with acute cellular rejection, 12 (75%) had resolution, 2 had chronic rejection, 1 required a repeat transplantation, and 1 died with graft failure. In contrast, all 9 patients with established chronic rejection in their pretreatment biopsy continued to have significant graft dysfunction, with 4 having persistent chronic graft dysfunction, 3 requiring repeat transplantation, and 2 dying with graft failure. CONCLUSION: Twelve (48%) of 25 patients who received an anti-IL-2r antibody because of SRR were successfully treated. All successfully treated patients had ongoing acute cellular rejection at liver biopsy (75%), whereas patients with histologic evidence of chronic rejection responded poorly.
