The aim of the study was the analysis of frequency of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) resistance among MSSA (n=1682) and MRSA (n=272) strains which were isolated in 2002-2004 from various clinical materials from patients hospitalized in the University Hospital at the L. Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, University of Nicolaus Copernicus in Torun. Susceptibility testing and examination of methicillin-resistant strains were performed by the disc diffusion techniques according to recommendation of NCCLS. Resistance to the MLS(B) antimicrobials agents was higher among MRSA compared to MSSA isolates. The MLS, constitutive phenotype was more prevalent than the MLS(B) inducible phenotype among investigated MRSA (65.4%) and MSSA (7.6%) isolates. Inducible resistance had only 2.5% of the MSSA and 2.6% of the MRSA strains. Moreover in 2004 there were found increasing frequency of inducible MLS(B) resistance from 1.1% to 5.7% and decreasing frequency of constitutive MLS(B) resistance from 9.2% to 4.7% among MSSA strains, in comparison to 2003. The investigated MSSA MLS(B)-, MLS(B)- and MRSAMLS(B)+, MLS(B)- strains were the most frequently isolated from pus (adequately 5.2%, 28.8% and 30.5%, 10.7%) and also from nosopharynx swabs (1.7% MSSA MLS(B)+ and 22.9% MSSA MLS(B)-) and biomaterials (15,1% MRSA MLS(B)+ and 9.6% MRSA MLS(B)-). They mainly came from patients of the outpatient clinic (2,4% MSSA MLS(B)+ and 19.9% MSSA MLS(B)-) and patients treated at the neurosurgical ward (20.6% MRSA MLS(B)+ and 12.1% MRSA MLS(B)-).
