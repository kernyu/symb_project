Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-derived retroviral vector could efficiently deliver the green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is driven by the internal cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter, into restricted cell populations in the chicken embryo. RSV-derived vectors coupled with the tet regulatory elements also revealed doxycycline-dependent inducible GFP expression in the chicken embryo in ovo.
