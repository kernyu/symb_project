The 5' region of the cell wall protein(CWP) gene containing multiple tandem promoters and the signal peptide-coding sequence was isolated by PCR from Br. brevis 50, and used to construct the shuttle vector pBKE50, which included the replication origin of pUB110 and the erythromycin-resistance gene of pGK12. The alpha-amylase gene of Bacillus subtilis 168 was ligated to pBKE50, producing plasmid pBKE50/alpha-amy. After the resulting plasmid was introduced into Br. brevis 50, soluble and biologically active alpha-amylase was secreted directly into the culture medium. The expression level of alpha-amylase in the recombinant Br. brevis 50 was twice higher than that of the donor strain.
