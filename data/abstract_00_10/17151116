The nucleoside analogue ribavirin (R) is mutagenic for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Passage of FMDV in the presence of increasing concentrations of R resulted in the selection of FMDV with the amino acid substitution M296I in the viral polymerase (3D). Measurements of progeny production and viral fitness with chimeric viruses in the presence and absence of R documented that the 3D substitution M296I conferred on FMDV a selective replicative advantage in the presence of R but not in the absence of R. In polymerization assays, a purified mutant polymerase with I296 showed a decreased capacity to use ribavirin triphosphate as a substrate in the place of GTP and ATP, compared with the wild-type enzyme. The results suggest that M296I has been selected because it attenuates the mutagenic activity of R with FMDV. Replacement M296I is located within a highly conserved stretch in picornaviral polymerases which includes residues that interact with the template-primer complex and probably also with the incoming nucleotide, according to the three-dimensional structure of FMDV 3D. Given that a 3D substitution, distant from M296I, was associated with resistance to R in poliovirus, the results indicate that picornaviral polymerases include different domains that can alter the interaction of the enzyme with mutagenic nucleoside analogues. Implications for lethal mutagenesis are discussed.
