The in vitro activities of sitafloxacin and seven other fluoroquinolones a (ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, T-3811ME, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) were examined by the microdilution method against 79 clinically isolated 'Streptococcus milleri' group (SMG) microorganisms. No statistically significant differences were found between the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) against Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus. Sitafloxacin was the most active agent of the eight fluoroquinolones tested against SMG, with a MIC(90) of 0.06 microg/mL, which was 8 times more active than ciprofloxacin and 16 times more active than levofloxacin. Although none of the SMG strains showed high resistance to any of the fluoroquinolones tested, three agents (trovafloxacin, sitafloxacin and T-3811ME) had low MICs against 23 SMG strains against which levofloxacin had a MIC> 1 microg/mL. In conclusion, several fluoroquinolones have low MICs against SMG, but sitafloxacin has the lowest.
