Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy provides very limited disease control in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Approximately half of the patients failing upfront treatment present good performance status and are willing to undergo further treatment. Docetaxel activity against pancreatic cancer is reported both in the preclinical and clinical setting. Between November 2004 and November 2005, 10 patients (median age 59; median KPS 80) with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, progressive disease after gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy, KPS >50, adequate organ function, were treated with weekly docetaxel at 30 mg/m-(2) until progressive disease. Docetaxel dose intensity was 100% of the intended dose. No grade >2 toxicity was observed. No objective response to treatment was obtained. Median progression-free survival was 1.5 months (range 1-3.5 months); median survival was 4.0 months (range 2.0-7.5). Weekly administration of single-agent docetaxel does not seem to have any activity in the treatment of gemcitabine-resistant metastatic pancreatic cancer.
