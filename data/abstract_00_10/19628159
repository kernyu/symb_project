Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease leading to death from liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C is the most common indication for liver transplantation worldwide and is a major cause of the increased incidence of hepatocellular cancer in the United States. The current paradigm for HCV treatment relies on pegylated interferon and ribavirin as agents that enhance endogenous mechanisms for viral clearance and are dependent on host factors. In patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal, with less than half of genotype 1-infected individuals going on to achieve SVR. This has led to a shift in the investigational focus for treatment of HCV toward specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV agents. This review focuses on boceprevir, a protease inhibitor, and discusses its mechanism of action, effects on HCV, and viral resistance.
