We examined the susceptibilities to fluconazole of 559 bloodstream infection isolates of Candida glabrata and grouped the isolates by patient age and geographic location within the United States. Susceptibility of C. glabrata to fluconazole was lowest in the Pacific (44%) and East South Central (47%) regions and was highest in the West South Central region (82%) (regions are as designated by the U.S. Bureau of the Census). Isolates from pediatric patients were virtually all susceptible to fluconazole, whereas the highest frequency of resistance was observed in isolates from patients 16 to 64 years of age.
