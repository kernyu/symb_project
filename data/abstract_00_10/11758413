According to the systematic study for 5 years, this paper dealt with the ecological factors affecting prevalence of kiwifruit bacterial canker. The disease was more serious in the orchards with above 750 m in elevation, and more serious at mountain slope facing south than facing north. Incidence differed significantly among cultivars, with easy disease infection for Jinfeng, and strong disease resistance for Jinkui. The older the trees, the more the diseased plants. The one year old twigs had highest death twig incidence of diseased twigs and death twig incidence than other twigs. Among 6 tested bacteriocides, Jiaruinong and streptomycin showed best bacteriostatic effect.
