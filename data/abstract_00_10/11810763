OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between the NK lysis and HLA molecules expressed on the target cells as well as the regulatory effect of IFN-gamma. METHODS: The level of HLA-ABC molecules on seven human tumor cell lines were detected through the indirect immune fluorescence stain. NK lysis changes were observed after the blocking of HLA molecules on the target cells with the anti-HLA monoclonal antibodies or treating target cells with IFN-gamma. RESULTS: 1. Most of the tumor cell lines showed a complete or partial loss of HLA-ABC molecules, 2. After the HLA molecules had been marked on the target cells with the anti-HLA-ABC antibodies, the tumor cell susceptibility to the lysis of NK cells attack increased significantly and 3. After having being treated with IFN-gamma 500 U/ml for more than 48 hours, the HLA-ABC molecule levels on K562, M21 and PG cells went up. At the same time, their susceptibility to NK lysis was reduced. However, the resistance to Karpas, HL60 and HT29 NK lysis demonstrated a noticeable increase. The IFN-gamma promoted the apoptosis of HL60 and HT29 cells. CONCLUSION: The NK cells are capable of recognizing the HLA molecules on the target cells and show no lysis in providing a negative signal with the KIRs, an effect which the anti-HLA monoclonal antibodies are able to eliminate. IFN-gamma can be applied to make up for the loss of HLA molecules on some of the tumor cells, it can also facilitate some of the tumor cells' apoptosis.
