Klebsiella pneumoniae species (108) isolated from tertiary care hospitalized patients were investigated for antibiotic resistance patter. 74% isolates were from urine, 13.5% from pus, 4.5% from blood and 8% from sputum. The resistance pattern of the organisms to various antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin 93.3%, cefotaxime 70%, ceftazidime 81%, gentamicin 68.5%, amikacin 63.75%, netilmicin 74%, norfloxacin 55%, ofloxacin 53%, chloramphenicol 82%, tetracycline 85%, sulphamethoxazole 96%, trimethoprim 94%. 2-4 drug resistance was found in 34.5%, 5-8 drug resistance was in 25.1% and 9-12 drug resistance was found in 40.4% of strains. Out of 65 strains, 25 strains could be successfully conjugated. Common drugs which were transferred to transconjugants were sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, gentamicin, netilmicin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime. A large plasmid of 98.7% kb could be demonstrated in these strains by alkali denaturation method and agarose gel electrophoresis.
