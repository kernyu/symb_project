Community acquired pneumonia is one of the most frequent infections. With time, bacterial epidemiology and bacterial resistance evolve and new antibiotics become available. So an up-date on adequate antibiotic use is necessary. We reviewed the epidemiology of pneumonia and the evolution of bacterial resistance. We also collected data on new antibiotics which can be used for this infection such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, telithromycin, and pristinamycin. All these drugs are effective on bacteria involved in pneumonia. At this time, only few Streptococcus pneumoniae strains have developed resistance to these drugs. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones is not easily detected with common laboratory techniques. There is no effectiveness difference between the 2 new fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) in clinical studies. However, in bacteriological and pharmacological studies, moxifloxacin seems to be more effective than levofloxacin (500 mg/day). For the treatment of pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila, fluoroquinolones are now widely recommended. For Streptococcus pneumonia, amoxicillin remain the drug of choice, even for bacteria with a decreased susceptibility to penicillin. The importance of treating atypical pathogens remains to be documented.
