Prevalence of drug resistance to one drug and multidrug resistance--MDR in different categories of tuberculosis patients is an important information about the susceptibility pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates against antimycobacterial drugs. Poland joined WHO/IUATLD global project on TB drug resistance surveillance, and carried out in 1996/1997 the first prospective survey, simultaneously on primary and acquired drug resistance. This study is repeated in 2000 according to the WHO/IUATLD protocol. The programme covered the whole country. A total of 16 regional centers participated in the co-operative study. 3705 questionnaires and cultures were obtained from patients who excreted TB bacilli during the 12-months from 1 st. January to 31st December 2000. Drug resistance tests to INH, RMP, SM, EMB were performed on Lowenstein-Jensen medium according to the proportion method or/and Bactec 460 TB system. 3705 TB patients (3037 new and 668 treated cases) bacteriologically confirmed by culture were included in one-year study. Primary resistance to any drug was found in 6.12% (CI 5.27-6.56) of new cases. 35 patients (1.15%, CI 0.77-1.35) were infected with MDR strains. Acquired resistance to any drug was found in 16.6% (CI 5.27-6.56), 8.53% (CL 6.41-9.6) of the patients who excreted MDR strains. We have found increased resistance from 3.6% in 1997 to 6.12% (p < 0.001) in 2000 and MDR from 0.6% in 1997 to 1.15% (p < 0.001) in 2000 in untreated tuberculosis patients in Poland. The rate of resistance in the group of treated TB patients was very similar in 1997 (17.0%) and in 2000 (16.6%); except 20% increase of MDR cases--(7.0% in 1997, and 8.53% in 2000). We observed an increase in drug resistant tuberculosis first time during 40 years long period of its monitoring. Regular monitoring of drug resistance in TB patients in Poland is recommended.
