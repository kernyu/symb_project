Isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from three areas of West Africa were recovered from cryopreservation and their chloroquine-sensitivity were determined in vitro. Of the 90 samples studied, 60 were from Guinea-Bissau (30Resistant/30Sensitive), 15 were from S. Tome and Principe (11Resistant/4Sensitive) and 15 were from Angola (11Resistant/4Sensitive). All the isolates were sensitive to mefloquine. Using the polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism technique (PCR/RFLP) it was possible to detect two mutations in the pfmdr1 gene, often associated with chloroquine-resistance. 66% of the samples from Guine-Bissau showed a correlation with chloroquine-resistance while 73% of the samples from Sao Tome and Angola altogether had the 86Tyr mutation. The present study on West African isolates and clones showed, for the first time, the presence of a double point mutation in the pfmdr1 gene one being found, up to now, only in South America isolates of Plasmodium falciparum.
