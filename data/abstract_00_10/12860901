BACKGROUND: We describe the clinical and morphological patterns of restenosis after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 121 patients with coronary angiography obtained >30 days after SES implantation, restenosis (diameter stenosis >50%) was identified in 19 patients and 20 lesions (located at the proximal 5-mm segment in 30% or within the stent in 70%). Residual dissection after the procedure or balloon trauma outside the stent was identified in 83% of the proximal edge lesions. Lesions within the stent were focal, and stent discontinuity was identified in some lesions evaluated by intravascular ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus-eluting stent edge restenosis is frequently associated with local trauma outside the stent. In-stent restenosis occurs as a localized lesion, commonly associated with a discontinuity in stent coverage. Local conditions instead of intrinsic drug-resistance to sirolimus are likely to play a major role in post-SES restenosis.
