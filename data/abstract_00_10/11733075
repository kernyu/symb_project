We have studied the occurrence of the apoptosis phenomenon in the action of adriamycin (ADR) on human melanoma cells sensitive (ME18) and resistant (ME18/R) to ADR. The study has shown that the intensity of apoptotic morphological changes noted in melanoma cells depended on the duration of the ADR treatment. We have not observed any positive correlation between the induction of apoptosis and sensitivity to ADR. We have used a fluorescence microscope and flow cytometer to evaluate apoptotic events in cells treated with ADR.
