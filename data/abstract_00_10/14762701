Lincomycin and clindamycin are lincosamide antibiotics used in clinical practice. Both antibiotics are bacteriostatic and inhibit protein synthesis in sensitive bacteria. They may even be bactericidal at the higher concentrations that can be reached in vivo. Clindamycin is usually more active than lincomycin in the treatment of bacterial infections, in particular those caused by anaerobic species; and it can also be used for the treatment of important protozoal diseases, e.g. malaria, most effectively in combination with primaquine. Resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin may be caused by methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA, modification of the antibiotics by specific enzymes or active efflux from the periplasmic space.
