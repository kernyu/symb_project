Tetraoxygenated xanthones, cowaxanthones A-E, together with 10 previously reported tetraoxygenated xanthones, were isolated from the crude hexane extract of the fruits of Garcinia cowa. Cowaxanthone B has previously been reported as a synthetic xanthone. Their structures were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data, especially by 1D and 2D NMR. The antibacterial activities of the isolated compounds were also evaluated.
