With the aim of enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents, we investigated the antitumor actions and reversal effect on drug resistance of proanthocyanidin plus doxorubicin. The results showed that proanthocyanidin 12.5-200 mg/L significantly inhibited proliferation of K562, K562/DOX, SPC-A-1, and Lewis cells in vitro in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, as determined by microculture tetrazolium assay. A combination of proanthocyani din 12.5, or 25 mg/L and doxorubicin treatment synergistically inhibited cell proliferation with decreased IC50 values. Proanthocyanidin reverses drug resistance in doxorubicin-resistant K562/DOX cells, and IC50 values were decreased by 9.19 (3.64-23.19), 2.56 (1.48-.44), and 0.94 (0.81-1.09) mg/L, respectively, after 24 h treatment with doxorubicin 0.1-9.0 mg/L alone or in combination with proanthocyanidin 12.5 or 25 mg/L; the proanthocyanidin reversal fold was 3.6 and 9.8, respectively. Under confocal laser scanning microscope, the combination of proanthocyanidin 25 or 50 mg/L with doxorubicin 3 mg/L significantly increased the accumulation of intracellular doxorubicin, Ca2+, and Mg2+, and reduced the pH value and mitochondrial membrane potential in K562/DOX cells as compared with doxorubicin alone (p < 0.01). Additionally, the apoptosis rate was increased by 11.3% +/- 3.3%, 14.2% +/- 5.4%, and 23.8% +/- 2.8%, respectively, for doxorubicin 3 mg/L alone or with proanthocyanidin 12.5 or 25 mg/L, as compared with controls (3.0% +/- 1.4%), as demonstrated by flow cytometry. In vivo experiments demonstrated that i.p. administration of proanthocyanidin 10 mg/kg with doxorubicin 2 mg/kg had an inhibitory effect on the growth of transplantation tumor sarcoma 180 and hepatoma 22 in mice as compared with doxorubicin alone (p < 0.05). These results suggest that proanthocyanidin enhances doxorubicin-induced antitumor effect and reverses drug resistance, and its mechanism is attributed partially to the promotion of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis through an elevation of intracellular doxorubicin, and Ca2+, Mg2+ concentration, and a reduction of pH value and mitochondrial membrane potential.
