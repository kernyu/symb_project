The in vitro activity of three polycationic peptides, cecropin A, melittin, and cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptide CA(1-7)M(2-9)NH2, alone and in combination with various clinically used antimicrobial agents, was investigated against 32 nosocomial isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial activities were measured by MIC, MBC and bacterial killing assay. The peptides demonstrated different ranges of inhibitory values: overall, the organisms were more susceptible to CA(1-7)M(2-9)NH2 (MIC range, 0.25-16 mg/l) than to cecropin A (0.50-32 mg/l) and melittin (0.50-32 mg/l). Synergy was observed when CA(1-7)M(2-9)NH2 and melittin were combined with beta-lactam antibiotics.
