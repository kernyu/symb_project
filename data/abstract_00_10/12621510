Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common infectious pathogen during stem cell trans-plantation. We report a case of meningoencephalitis with multiple abscess formation caused by MRSA, which occurred in a 4-year-old boy soon after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. We successfully cured the infection with a combination of intravenous and intrathecal vancomycin.
