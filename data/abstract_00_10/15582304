With emerging resistance to fluoroquinolones, there arises a need to establish quality control (QC) guidelines for doxycycline, an effective alternative for treating various community-acquired respiratory tract infections. This multicenter study was performed to establish QC guidelines for susceptibility testing those Gram-positive QC organisms against doxycycline. The proposed three or four log2 dilution MIC ranges included 100.0% of the doxycycline MIC values reported.
