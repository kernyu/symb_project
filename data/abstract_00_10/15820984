OBJECTIVES: Compared with European countries, the use of antibiotics in Slovenia is moderate. In the period 1999-2002 an 18.67% decrease in outpatient antibiotic consumption was noted. The aim of the present study was to analyse this decrease and its consequences. METHODS: The data on outpatient antibiotic consumption were obtained from the Institute of Public Health and Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia and expressed in defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 inhabitant-days. The number of media publications on 'antibiotic drugs' and 'bacterial resistance' during the study period was obtained. In 2000, the prescription of co-amoxiclav and fluoroquinolones was restricted because of a constant increase in the consumption of these drugs. The data on incidence of acute mastoiditis and penicillin resistance among invasive pneumococci were obtained. RESULTS: The total outpatient consumption of antibacterials increased from 15.21 DDD/1000 inhabitant-days in 1996 to 20.08 in 1999, and decreased to 16.97 in 2003. The consumption of restricted antibiotics decreased from 7.29 in 1999 to 5.25 DDD/1000 inhabitant-days in 2003. There was a positive correlation between antibiotic consumption and the number of newspaper articles (r=0.92), and a negative correlation between the number of diagnostic tests and antibiotic consumption (r=-0.73 for the C-reactive protein test and -0.68 for the streptococcal antigen detection test). Reduced antibiotic consumption was paralleled by a decrease in penicillin resistance among invasive pneumococci. No increase in mastoiditis cases was observed in spite of reduced antibiotic consumption. CONCLUSION: Restriction of antibiotic prescription proved to be effective in reducing outpatient antibiotic consumption. The effect was prolonged and affected restricted antibiotics as well as non-restricted drugs.
