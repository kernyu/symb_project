OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the contribution and the correlation between the virulence factors of Candida albicans in denture stomatitis. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty C. albicans strains obtained from the oral cavity of patients with denture stomatitis and 30 C. albicans obtained from the oral cavity of denture wearers with normal palatal mucosa were compared for adhesion ability to buccal epithelial cells (BEC), reduction in adhesion after exposure to fluconazole, and enzyme production. The correlation between these virulence factors was assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: C. albicans obtained from denture stomatitis patients were more adherent to BEC and higher enzyme producers than those obtained from healthy patients. Our results demonstrated that exposure to fluconazole reduces C. albicans adherence to BEC. This study could also provide evidence of correlation between virulence factors. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that adhesion and enzyme production could be factors that, along with predisposing conditions related to the host, determine if an individual will develop disease or remain as a healthy carrier and confirm that fluconazole has an impact on the adherence ability and enzyme production in C. albicans.
