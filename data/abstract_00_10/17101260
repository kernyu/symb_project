Surveillance initiatives to track Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance trends are important for understanding the current in vitro effectiveness of available antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of S. pneumoniae (n=1479 isolates) collected from 17 geographical areas across the USA (2003-2004) were analysed; 36.8% of isolates were resistant to one or more agents (24.4% were multidrug-resistant, i.e. resistant to two or more antimicrobial classes). Multidrug resistance involved resistance to beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, but rarely fluoroquinolones (>96% of multidrug-resistant isolates were fluoroquinolone-susceptible). Multidrug resistance rates were prominent regardless of the geographical region surveyed. As this trend continues, the empirical therapeutic options for S. pneumoniae infections will diminish and there will be an ongoing need to evaluate the effectiveness of potent fluoroquinolones such as gemifloxacin.
