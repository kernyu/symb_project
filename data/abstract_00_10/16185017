Neisseria gonorrhoeae cases are increasing in Ireland. Ciprofloxacin is often used as first line treatment for this infection in STI clinics. A retrospective study to analyze resistance in two Dublin clinics was undertaken. Cases were defined as patients from whom an isolate of N. gonorrhoea was recovered. All cases from two clinics between January 1997 and June 2003 were included. Antimicrobial resistance data was correlated with sex and sexuality. One thousand one hundred and eighty laboratory-confirmed cases were identified. Eighty seven percent were male. Sixty nine percent were MSM. Twenty seven percent of isolates demonstrated reduced susceptibility to penicillin and 6% to ciprofloxacin. Isolates with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin increased year on year from 3.8% in 1997 to 15% in 2003. Prevalence of isolates of N. gonorrhoea with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin has exceeded 10% in these clinics since 2002. In concordance with international guidelines, ceftriaxone became the treatment of choice for gonorrhoea in July 2003.
