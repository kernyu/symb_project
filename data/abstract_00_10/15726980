The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in pasteurized milk was detected by plating 18 milk samples on selective media containing beta-lactams, macrolides, or a glycopeptide. Most samples contained gram-positive bacteria that grew on agar plates containing oxacillin, erythromycin, and/or spiramycin. The disk-diffusion method confirmed resistance to erythromycin and/or spiramycin in 86 and 65% of the coryneform bacteria and Micrococcaceae tested, respectively. PCR and sequence analysis revealed the presence of an ermC gene in 2 of the 25 Micrococcaceae strains investigated for their resistance to erythromycin and/or spiramycin. None of the 14 corynebacteria strains resistant to erythromycin and/or spiramycin harbored the erm(X) gene. No gene transfer could be demonstrated between the two erm(C) staphylococcal isolates and recipient strains of Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 or Staphylococcus aureus 80CR5.
