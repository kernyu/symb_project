The major influences on the amplification and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are the therapeutic use of antibiotics in human medicine and their use in livestock for therapy, prophylaxis and growth promotion. The use of veterinary antibiotics has many benefits to the livestock industries ensuring animal health and welfare, but use at subtherapeutic levels also exerts great selective pressure on emergence of resistant bacteria. The possible effect on human health is a problem of current debate. This study involved sampling pig carcasses, pig meat and assessing the level of resistance in zoonotic enteric bacteria of concern to human health. In South Australian pigs, thermophilic Campylobacter species showed widespread resistance (60-100%) to tylosin, erythromycin, lincomycin, ampicillin and tetracycline. No resistance was seen to ciprofloxacin. The enterococci demonstrated little resistance (0-30%) to vancomycin or virginiamycin, but the overall results from the antibiotic sensitivity testing of the enterococci have demonstrated how widespread their resistance has become. Escherichia coli strains showed widespread resistance to tetracycline and moderately common resistance (30-60%) to ampicillin and sulphadiazine. Resistance to more than one antibiotic was common. Pigs from New South Wales were also sampled and differences in resistance patterns were noted, perhaps reflecting different antibiotic use regimens in that state.
