Various analysis based on PK-PD (pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics) theory were performed for prediction on the efficacy of antimicrobial agents for infectious diseases. However, there have been few reports when causative organisms would be anaerobic bacteria. Although the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against anaerobes has been weak, gatifloxacin (GFLX), moxifloxacin (MFLX), and garenoxacin (GRNX) are considered as anti-anaerobic quinolones in recent days. Therefore, we investigated prediction on the efficacy of fluoroquinolones for anaerobic infections using Monte Carlo Simulation. Although the target attainment of fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, GFLX, and MFLX) on AUC/MIC value has not established yet, we have assumed 40 and 125 as the target attainment of AUC/MIC value. GFLX and MFLX would be effective against anaerobic infections caused by Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Micromonas micros, which are the causative organisms for respiratory tract infections. From these results, GFLX and MFLX would be effective against anaerobic infections in respiratory tract as anti-anaerobic fluoroquinolones.
