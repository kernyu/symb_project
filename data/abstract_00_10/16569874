A ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli isolate, isolate 1B, was obtained from a urinary specimen of a Canadian patient treated with norfloxacin for infection due to a ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolate, isolate 1A. Both isolates harbored a plasmid-encoded sul1-type integron with qnrA1 and blaVEB-1 genes. Isolate 1B had amino acid substitutions in gyrase and topoisomerase.
