Tritrichomonas foetus, a microscopic single-celled flagellated protozoan parasite, traditionally identified as a cause of reproductive disease in cattle, has been demonstrated as an important cause of diarrhea in cats. Until recently, an effective antimicrobial treatment for feline Tritrichomonas foetus had not been idnetified. Since recommended dosages of antimicrobial drugs have failed in cats infected with Tritrichomonas foetus and in vitro studies have revealed multiple drug resistance, investigations continue in the effort to find an effective treatment. One particular study by Dr.Jody Gookin noted no clinicopathological abnormalities or adverse effects with the use of ronidazole, and the research concluded that ronidazole administered at 30 to 50 mg/kg orally twice daily for 2 weeks was capable of resolving diarrhea and eradicating infections of Tritrichomonas foetus in cats. Clinical use of ronidazole has revealed a reversible, possibly dose-related, neurotoxicity. Cats receiving ronidazole should be monitored for signs of nystagmus, ataxia, or behavior change, and ronidazole should be discontinued immediately if any of these signs are observed. Many compounding pharmacists have begun stocking pure ronidazole powder to prepare veterinarian prescriptions for the treatnment of Tritrichomonas foetus. Doses of ronidazole are usually prepared as capsules, the most desirable dosage form because (1)the capsules mask the extremely bitter taste of ronidazole, (2)exact dosing reduces the risk of neurotoxicity that has been reported at higher doses, and (3)the owner can be assured that the entire dose is ingested by the cat after administration of a capsule.
