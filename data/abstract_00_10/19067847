In the present work, the development of experimental leishmaniasis was examined in sensitized BALB/c mice that were chronically fed with antigen. After an oral challenge with egg white solution, the ovalbumin (Ova)-sensitized mice showed an increase in serum anti-Ova IgE and IgG1 antibodies. Lesions induced by Leishmania major infection were reduced by the ingestion of Ova in sensitized mice, as assessed by reduced footpad growth, lower parasite loads and improved pathological outcome compared to sham sensitized mice. Moreover, such findings were connected to a shift to a Th1 response involving higher IFN-gamma production and serum levels of IgG2a anti-Leishmania antigens. The data appear to corroborate the suggestion that chronic ingestion of an antigen by sensitized mice modulates the immunological system through a shift in cytokine release, exhibiting a healing response and resistance to L. major infection.
