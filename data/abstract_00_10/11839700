An estimated 7.5 million individuals in England and Wales are actively infected with Helicobacter pylori and hence knowledge of local resistance rates is of growing importance. Also, information on strain resistance following treatment failure is crucial in selecting an appropriate regimen as the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics makes retreatment difficult. Molecular test methods may have an impact on improving the availability and accuracy of information on H pylori antimicrobial resistance to guide in the selection of primary as well as secondary backup treatment regimens.
