Prostate cancer (PC) is considered resistant to cisplatin chemotherapy. In order to identify novel causes of resistance to cisplatin, we explored the role of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) that mediates caspase independent apoptosis in cisplatin induced cell death in PC. Similar to treatment with pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, cisplatin induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells was inhibited by AIF inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), treatment of LNCaP cells with NAC prevented AIF translocation to the nucleus and over-expression of recombinant AIF gene increased apoptosis. Our results suggest that AIF is associated with cisplatin induced apoptosis in PC.
