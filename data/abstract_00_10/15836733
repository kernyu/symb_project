AIMS: To investigate the existing antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic characteristics of Lactococcus garvieae isolates from cultured Seriola in Japan. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 14 antimicrobial agents for 170 isolates were determined using the agar dilution method. Seventy-five isolates (44.1%) were simultaneously resistant to erythromycin (EM) (MIC>or=2 microg ml-1), lincomycin (LCM) (MIC>or=128 microg ml-1) and oxytetracycline (OTC) (MIC>or=4 microg ml-1). Resistance to EM was grouped as intermediate- and high-level resistant by MIC values. All resistant isolates possessed ermB and tet(S) genes. The number of different bands between pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of 25 isolates and two ATCC strains (isolated in 1974), determined using two enzymes (ApaI and SmaI), did not exceed 3. CONCLUSIONS: The present resistance pattern observed with ermB and tet(S) is similar to that observed in previous reports. Moreover, the genetic characteristics of L. garvieae isolates from a wide area in Japan in 2002 and ATCC strains were closely related. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study suggests that EM-, LCM- and OTC-resistant isolates have been present for 15 years and that L. garvieae strains with same origin have spread among Seriola spp. in Japan since 1974.
