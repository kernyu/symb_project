OBJECTIVE: To genetically analyze the epidemiology of the colistin-only-sensitive (COS) Acinetobacter baumannii (COS-AB) so as to provide experimental data for controlling COS-AB infection. METHODS: The drug resistance to 14 antibiotics of 136 COS-AB isolates collected in Ruijin Hospital from June 2004 to May 2005 were analyzed. 66 A. baumannii isolates were collected from May to December 2004, of which 33 strains were COS-AB and the other 33 non-COS-AB. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were applied to analyze the homology of these strains. RESULTS: RAPD analysis (with the primers ERIC2 and 272) showed all COS-AB strains as identical, while PFGE analysis showed that these COS-AB were of two closely related genotypes distinctly different from that of the non-COS-AB. The COS-AB strains obtained from the Burns Ward were PFGE B type causing inter-ward outbreak of single clone. And the COS-AB strains obtained from another wards were PFGE BA type causing inter-departmental outbreak, mainly among the departments of surgical system. CONCLUSION: The cross-infection of COS-AB is severe. Strict disinfection and sterilization should be implemented. The epidemiology of COS-AB in environment and patients should be closely monitored. PFGE analysis is a more accurate method in typing A. baumannii.
