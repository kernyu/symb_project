A total of nine species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from organs and haemolymph of the hard tick Hyalomma (Hyalomma) dromedarii and the soft tick Argas (Persicargas) persicus. Four species namely Serratia liquefaciens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Aeromonas hydrophila were isolated from H. dromedarii and five species namely Rahnella aquatilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Chryseomonas luteola and Chryseobacterium meningosepticum were isolated from A. persicus. Isolated bacteria were identified using the analytical profile index 20E. Disk diffusion test was carried out on all isolated bacteria to determine antibiotic sensitivity of chloramphenicol, amoxillin/clavulanic acid, neomycin, streptomycin, triplesulphur tetracycline and nitrofurantion. The results were discussed.
