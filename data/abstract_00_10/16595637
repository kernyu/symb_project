Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important cause of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Effective treatment can delay or prevent these outcomes. The decision to treat is based on the activity of liver disease and HBV replication status, and the likelihood of a long-term benefit. Approved therapies include standard and pegylated interferon-alfa and nucleoside analogues: lamivudine, adefovir and entecavir. Current therapies do not eradicate HBV so long-term treatment is usually required. Development of drug resistance is a major concern with long-term treatment. Even with successful therapy, patients remain at risk for reactivation of viral replication and require lifelong monitoring.
