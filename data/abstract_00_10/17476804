It was demonstrated that bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria B. adolescentis and Lactobacillus sp. synthesized extracellular enzymes cleaving glycoside bonds in the molecules of dextran, pectic acid, and soluble starch. The maximal production of extracellular beta-galactosidase by B. adolescentis 91-BIM and 94-BIM at a rate of 0.08 and 0.03 U/mg h was observed during the exponential growth phase at 5 and 12 h of cultivation, respectively. The cultures of bifidobacteria retained 60-70% of beta-galactosidase and alpha-amylase activities after six months of storage. The bifidobacterium strains studied were resistant to amphotericin and aminoglycosides (gentamicin, kanamycin, and netromycin). The lactam antibiotics (ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, bicillin 3, bicillin 5, and carbenicillin), the preparations inhibiting protein synthesis at the level of ribosomes (lincomycin), RNA polymerase inhibitors (rifampin), cephalosporin, and Maxipime inhibited the growth of bifidobacteria. Rifampin, erythromycin, amphotericin, Maxipime, Fortum, doxycycline, levomycetin, streptomycin, and the aminoglycosides netromycin, gentamicin, and kanamycin did not have an effect on the growth of Lactobacillus sp., whereas semisynthetic derivatives of penicillin, carbenicillin and ampicillin, inhibited its growth as well as Oxamp and lincomycin. The lactam antibiotics benzylpenicillin, bicillin 3, and bicillin 5 inhibited the growth of lactic acid bacilli by 30-90%.
