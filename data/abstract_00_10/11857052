Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a key regulator of the development and functions of the immune system. In particular, this cytokine plays a major role in immune defense against infections by various human pathogens and polymorphisms in the IFN-gamma gene, including the transcription regulatory region, and might affect host resistance to infectious agents such as schistosomes. In this study on the genetics of human schistosomiasis we uncovered three new single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IFN-gamma genes. Two polymorphisms are located in the third intron and the third is in the 3'UTR region of this gene: an A to G transition at position +2109 from the transcription start and two G to A transitions at positions +3810 and +5134. In a SUDANESE population living in an endemic area of malaria and schistosomiasis, the allelic frequenciesare: 0.85 (+2109A), 0.15 (+2109G), 0.92 (+3810G), 0.08 (+3810A), (+5134G) and 0.04 (+5134A).
