BACKGROUND: Adhesion to the intestinal mucosa is one of the main suitable properties for probiotic bacteria. Several in vitro studies have been published, but a very few data are available about the in vivo adhesion to intestinal surfaces of probiotics. Moreover, there are no data regarding the distribution of a probiotic strain along the entire intestine. AIM: The present study aimed to preliminary evaluate the intestinal recovery of a new synbiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus paracasei B21060. METHODS: Seven volunteers participated in the study. Subjects assumed three times a day for 15 days a sachet with a synbiotic preparation containing 5 x 10(9)CFUs of Lactobacillus paracasei strain B21060. Samples were recovered from the faeces and from the cecum, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. RESULTS: Identification at strain level showed that following administration, strain B21060 could be recovered from all sampled sites (except in one subject), representing 66.6% of the total vancomycin insensitive CFUs isolated from faecal samples, and 74.7% isolated from colonic samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Lactobacillus paracasei B21060 probiotic strain is able to temporarily associate throughout the different sites of the entire intestinal tract.
