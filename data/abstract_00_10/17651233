Antimicrobial dressings such as those containing silver are now being used widely to control wound bioburden, and tests to demonstrate their efficacy predominantly involve in vitro models using free-living or planktonic bacteria. In this present study a wide range of antibiotic-sensitive and resistant bacteria were tested in their quasi-sessile state using a standard agar assay and a second method used a poloxamer gel (true biofilm state - poloxamer encourages microorganisms to exhibit a more clinically relevant biofilm phenotype) technique. The antimicrobial activity of two silver dressings, a silver-containing Hydrofiber (SCH) dressing and a nanocrystalline silver-containing dressing (NCS), were evaluated on a variety of microorganisms, using a zone-of-inhibition (ZOI) test. When grown on agar (presenting a quasi-sessile state of each organism), the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms were generally more susceptible to the SCH dressing compared with the NCS. ZOIs associated with SCH dressing ranged between 5.7 and 17.5 mm; those for the NCS against the same group of organisms ranged between 1.9 and 8.6 mm. When grown on poloxamer gel, (presenting the biofilm state of each organism) the same group of microorganisms were less susceptible to both dressings. The SCH dressing was most effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus (ZOI range: 2.6-6 mm); the NCS was most effective against strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (i.e. ZOI range: 1-2.8 mm). Similarly to the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms, nine of ten antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains when grown on agar were more susceptible to the SCH dressing compared with the NCS. Although the microorganisms tested were universally less susceptible to the silver dressings when in their biofilm state, in the majority of cases, the SCH dressing demonstrated greater biofilm-inhibiting activity than the NCS.
