Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial agents, the oxazolidinones. It is particularly effective against Gram-positive infections and little resistance has been reported, even amongst methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteria. The compound's excellent oral bioavailability and reasonable safety profile, along with the increasing incidence of resistant infections, means that linezolid offers a valuable alternative to more traditional therapies such as vancomycin. Although no large randomised trials have been carried out in patients with orthopaedic infections such as osteomyelitis and septic arthritis, early results are encouraging. However, the apparent increase in observed adverse events, particularly bone marrow suppression, seen with prolonged administration, means that treatment of such patients must be undertaken with careful surveillance, at least until these complications are better understood.
