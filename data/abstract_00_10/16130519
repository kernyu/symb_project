Treatment of HIV-1-infected patients with anti-retroviral agents is not always successful due to the emergence of resistant HIV-1 mutants with reduced susceptibility to the agents. However, factors other than viral mutation may also contribute to treatment failure. It has been demonstrated that the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) is a key determinant of oral bioavailability of HIV-1 protease inhibitors and their penetration of the central nervous system. More recently, we have found that the expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) in a CD4+ T-cell line confers cellular resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The anti-HIV-1 activity of the NRTI zidovudine (AZT) was significantly diminished through the reduction of its metabolite levels in MT-4 cells which express high levels of BCRP. Moreover, the BCRP-specific inhibitor fumitremorgin C could completely restore the cytotoxicity of AZT and intracellular levels of its metabolites in BCRP-expressing cells. Thus, BCRP is considered to be a cellular factor that modulates the anti-HIV-1 activity of NRTIs.
