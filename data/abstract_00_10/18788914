Miners in sub-Saharan African are known to have an extremely high prevalence of HIV-1 infection. We therefore evaluated the prevalence of HIV-1 infection among manganese miners in Gabon, central Africa and examined the diversity of HIV-1 strains by characterizing the polymorphism of the pol gene in order to observe drug resistance-associated mutations. In 857 samples tested, the HIV-1 prevalence was 2.9%. By pol sequence analysis, we showed that all the HIV-1 strains belonged to group M, with a majority of CRF02_AG (57%) followed by subtype A (9%) and CRF01_AE or subtype B (4%). The remaining HIV-1 strains demonstrated discordant genomic results and exhibited a mosaic pol genome (30%). Most of the mutations detected in pol coding regions corresponded to the subtype polymorphism, with no specific antiretroviral drug resistance. To avoid the rapid emergence of resistant viruses in this part of central Africa, continuous surveillance of the circulation of drug-resistant viruses must be maintained to guide treatment strategies.
