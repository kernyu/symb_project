Resistance to antimicrobial agents among bacteria and fungi is a persistent problem complicating the management of critically ill patients. To understand the issues involved in resistance in critical care, it is essential to understand the epidemiology and mechanisms of resistance. beta-lactam resistance in pneumococci, and penicillin and chloramphenicol resistance in Neisseria meningitidis, have complicated the management of meningitis. Vancomycin resistance in enterococci and methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus have disseminated among hospitals, nursing homes and, in some cases, community patients. Glycopeptide resistance in S. aureus has recently been described in clinical isolates; the potential for spread of this resistance trait is concerning. Resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins is a persistent challenge in the management of infections caused by Pseudomonas areuginosa, and Enterobacter species, as well as other Enterobacteriaceae. Azole resistance in Candida species. has also complicated the treatment of nosocomial infections. Resistance to antimicrobial drugs is a persistent and emerging problem and presents major therapeutic challenges.
