OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of colonization with fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and to assess risk factors for and define the natural history of colonization. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with follow-up of up to 1 year. SETTING: Multiple outpatient sites. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four community-dwelling adults with spinal cord dysfunction. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Colonization of perineum with fluoroquinolone-resistant GNB. RESULTS: Overall, 24% of this community-dwelling cohort was colonized with fluoroquinolone-resistant GNB with resistance to both levofloxacin and gatifloxacin. The use of any antibiotic in the last 90 days was most strongly associated with an increased risk of colonization with fluoroquinolone-resistant GNB (relative risk, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.8; P=.05). Incontinence was significantly more common among those with fluoroquinolone-resistant GNB colonization. Among the participants with incontinence (n=42), the use of intermittent catheterization (vs suprapubic, urethral, or condom catheters or overflow incontinence) was significantly protective. Colonization was not associated with an increase in urinary tract infection and was often transient. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroquinolone resistance among GNB colonizing community-dwelling people with spinal cord dysfunction is common. Colonization is more common among those receiving antibiotics and less common among those continent of urine. Among those with incontinence, those using intermittent catheterization have less colonization.
