A series of benzyl-[3-(benzylamino-methyl)-cyclohexylmethyl]-amine derivatives with different substitution pattern on the aromatic ring have been prepared and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Most of the compounds exhibit potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis while compounds 6l and 6m showed antibacterial activity against all the four bacterial strains with MIC values ranging from 0.002 to 0.016 microg/mL and no hemolytic activity up to 512 microg/mL in mammalian erythrocytes was observed.
