In clinical practice the recommended treatment regimens achieve only an 80%Helicobacter pylori eradication rate and this rate is lower in patients who have failed first-line treatment. The increasing indications for H. pylori treatment (idiopathic thrombocytopenia and iron deficiency anemia) and an increasing trend of antibiotic resistance (especially in southern Europe) emphasize the need for more effective H. pylori eradication. Smoking and a short duration of treatment, especially in patients with functional dyspepsia, are predictors of eradication failure. In first line, the best option remains the clarithromycin-based regimens but an extended treatment duration is now indicated. Following first-line treatment failure, 14-day proton pump inhibitor triple therapy employing alternative antibiotics or quadruple therapy could be used. Levofloxacin-based 10-day triple therapy seems to be an encouraging strategy following one or more eradication failures.
