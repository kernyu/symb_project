We investigated the prevalence of contamination of retail-level beef, mutton, and broiler carcasses in Istanbul, Turkey, by thermophilic Campylobacter spp. (TCS) and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities of the TCS strains isolated from these carcasses. From November 2005 to October 2006, 198 beef and 120 mutton carcass excision samples, and 232 chicken carcasses (whole and pieces) were randomly collected from different retail stores and meat-processing plants in Istanbul. TCS were isolated from 11.1%, 21.6%, and 50.4% of beef, mutton, and chicken samples tested, respectively. There was no significant seasonal variation in the prevalence of TCS. A total of 292 Campylobacter isolates were obtained from the samples (56.5% C. jejuni, 33.9% C. Coli, and 9.6% C. lari). C. jejuni was the species most commonly isolated from chicken meat (56.5%<65.9 from table 2>), while C. coli was the most common in beef (63.3%) and mutton (63.9%) carcasses. Susceptibilities of 246 strains for eight antimicrobial drugs were determined using disk diffusion assay. Campylobacter isolates were most often resistant to tetracycline (69.1%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (64.2%), nalidixic acid (58.1%), erythromycin (56.9%), enrofloxacin (48.8%), ciprofloxacin (42.7%), chloramphenicol (36.2%), and gentamicin (26.0%). The results of this study suggest that a high proportion of meat samples, particularly chicken carcasses, are contaminated by TCS, most of which are antimicrobial-resistant strains. Since campylobacteriosis is transmitted primarily through food of animal origin, the presence of antimicrobial-resistant strains in meat has important implications for public health and food safety.
