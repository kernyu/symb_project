This study reports the prevalence of extended-spectrum b-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp among septicemic neonates. Over a five year period, there were 94 isolates of Klebsiella spp and E .coli. Of these, 68 (72.3%) were ESBL producers. Forty (80%) of the Klebsiella spp isolates produced ESBL as compared to 28 (63.6%) of E.coli.
