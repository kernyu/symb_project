Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospital and community settings, spreading endemic and epidemic disease in developed and developing areas throughout the world. Its toxins A and B cause epithelial disruption, inflammation, and secretion. Diagnosis of infection with C. difficile is based on appropriate clinical presentation and demonstration of the presence of either toxin A or B, or both. Established treatment is still predominantly metronidazole and vancomycin. The association of antibiotic therapy with recurrent disease and antimicrobial resistance, especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci, highlights the need for new approaches to managing C. difficile infection.
