Antimicrobial drugs are commonly used in the treatment of mutilating hand injuries. Valid arguments for the use of systemic antibiotics can be made despite the lack of data clearly documenting their efficacy in this clinical scenario. There is no information to support the use of topical agents in open hand injuries. When choosing an appropriate systemic antibiotic, the physician should consider unique characteristics of these injuries, the various environments in which they occur, and the potential infecting organisms. The duration of antibiotic use is arbitrary but should be minimized to avoid complications and the development of bacterial resistance.
