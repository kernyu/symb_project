Seventy-four nonrepetitive uropathogenic fluoroquinolone-resistant or -intermediate extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella isolates from Slovenia were screened for the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes. None of the known qnr genes were detected. The aac(6')-Ib-cr allele was detected on plasmids from 25 transconjugants for which the ciprofloxacin MIC was higher than for the recipient Escherichia coli strain.
