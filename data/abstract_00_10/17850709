OBJECTIVE: The Ministry of Public Health released the National Surveillance project on Shigellosis in August, 2005. This study was to reveal the antimicrobial resistance status of Shigella isolates through the National Shigellosis Surveillance System in 2005 in China, so as to provide evidence for the development of surveillance, prevention and cure of Shigellosis. METHODS: All the lab assistants received training from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The project prescribed the uniform experimentation, quality control method, reagent, etc. Disc diffusion test(K-B) was carried out, following the CLSI methods. Data were analyzed by WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: (1) 3 serotypes were identified and S. flexneri was common that accounted for 75.5% of all Shigella isolates followed by 24.4% of S. sonnei, but only 1 strain of S. dysenteriae was separated. (2) The resistant rates to tetracycline and ampicillin in Shigella spp were quite high, as over 90.0%. However, the resistant rate to Cefotaxime was the lowest, only 6.1%. The resistant rates were different between serotypes with the resistant rates of S. flexneri to ampicillin, ampicillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin were higher than those of S. sonnei (P < 0.001). (3) The multiple-antibiotic-resistance status in Shigella spp was quite serious and the resistant rate to five and more antimicrobials was 54.9%. The most common resistant patterns were seen on ampicillin, nalidixin, tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole. (4) There were some differences in subtypes and antimicrobial resistance among different provinces. CONCLUSION: Cefotaxime seemed the best in curing Shigellosis at the clinic level. Programs regarding monitoring subtypes and antimicrobial resistance of Shigella should be in a continuous manner so as to understand the pathogens timely and to control the disease pertinently.
