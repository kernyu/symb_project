OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibiotic resistance and genetic relatedness of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated in a general hospital in Kuwait over a period from 1996 to 1998 and 2001. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The isolates were characterized by antibacterial susceptibility testing, coagulase serotyping, coagulase gene polymorphism (coag-RFLP) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The MRSA isolates were highly resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, fusidic acid and mupirocin. The prevalence of gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin resistance remained high (80-96%) throughout the study period, but the prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid and mupirocin steadily increased. The already high mupirocin resistance level increased from 12.5 in 1996, to 85.7% in 2001, and the fusidic acid resistance varied between 70.8 and 85.7%. In contrast, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim resistance declined from 25 and 29% in 1996 to 4.7 and 14.2% in 2001, respectively. The majority (91.5%) of the isolates were coagulase serotype 4. AluI restriction endonuclease analysis of amplified coagulase gene generated four coag-RFLP patterns: 92% of them were coag-RFLP type 1, while types 2, 3 and 4 were 3.5, 4.6 and 1.1% respectively. PFGE differentiated them into seven pulsotypes (PFGE types 1-7). The PFGE type 1 pulsotype constituted 90.2% of the isolates. Isolates with the type A coag-RFLP also had the type1 PFGE pulsotypes. CONCLUSION: The concordant results of PFGE and coag-RFLP demonstrated the presence of a persistent MRSA clone in the hospital during the study period.
