Tigecycline is a novel 9-t-butylglycylamido derivative of minocycline that has demonstrated activity against a variety of Gram-positive and -negative bacterial pathogens. In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents was determined for 3498 recent (2000-2003) strains of Staphylococcus aureus recovered from patients with either nosocomial or community-acquired infections. Oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus from both patient populations displayed identical results for tigecycline (MIC(50) and MIC(90) results at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively) and all strains were inhibited by 1 mg/L or less. While co-resistances to other antimicrobial classes were present in oxacillin-resistant strains, susceptibility to tigecycline remained unaffected, making the compound an attractive candidate for treatment of serious hospital as well as community-acquired staphylococcal infections.
