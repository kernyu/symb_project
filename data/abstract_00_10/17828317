BACKGROUND: Non-gonococcal urethritis/cervicitis (NGU) is now the most common sexually transmitted infection that is possible to treat. Mycoplasma genitalium is a microorganism about to be established as an aetiological agent of NGU and upper genital infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The article is based on literature identified through a Pubmed search. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: There seems to be sufficient evidence to conclude that Mycoplasma genitalium causes sexually transmitted infection. The microbe is associated with non-gonococcal urethritis in both men and women and cervicitis in women. It may also be the cause of upper genital infection in women. M. genitalium seems to cause more severe urethritis and more often lead to symptomatic urethritis/cervicitis than non-chlamydia-non-gonococcal urethritis/cervicitis that is not associated with M. genitalium. For testing, a cervical/vaginal swab should be used for women and first void urine should be collected for both sexes. Nucleic acid amplification tests are used. Azithromycin is more effective against M. genitalium than doxycycline and erythromycin. Moxifloxacin is effective in cases of azithromycin resistance.
