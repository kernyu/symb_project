This paper contains a personal view on what has been achieved in Helicobacter pylori research and what the expectations might be for further developments. Knowledge about the organism is already extensive. Particularly intriguing are the differences in genetic make-up in the various geographical regions. Sadly, detailed knowledge on how the organism spreads is still lacking. The clinical spectrum of the disease in man is largely known, but as H. pylori is disappearing worldwide, the relative frequency of H. pylori-negative ulcer disease is increasing. To what extent H. pylori disappearance and eradication is responsible for the decreasing incidence of gastric cancer remains uncertain. Antimicrobial therapy is dominated by proton pump inhibitor triple therapy as first line with quadruple therapy as second-line therapy. The long-term consequences of the rising resistance to the 'key' antimicrobials are so far unknown and speculative.
