The aim of this study was to estimate effectiveness of methicillin-resistant S. aureus identification using screening method with oxacillin (6 microg/ml), latex agglutination test--Slidex MRSA Detection and a chromogenic agar medium--MRSA ID. The investigation were carried out on 120 S. aureus strains isolated from clinical materials of patients hospitalized in the University Hospital at the L. Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, University of Nicolaus Copernicus in Torun. Consistency of results between chromogenic medium and latex agglutination test amounted 97.5%, chromogenic medium and screening method--96.7%. Identical correspondence of results took a stand in case screening method and latex agglutination test. Results consistency of detecting methicillin resistance in S. aureus strains between this three methods concerned 95.8% strains. Our investigation demonstrated 96.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity for MRSA ID medium for the detection of methicillin resistance. The sensitivity of MRSA-Screen was 95.0% and its specificity reached 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of screening method amounted 96.7%.
