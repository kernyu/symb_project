PURPOSE: To assess the virologic and immunologic response to a boosted double-protease inhibitor (PI) regimen of highly pretreated patients infected with HIV-1 and to examine the role of PI resistance and concentration of serum saquinavir. METHOD: In an open-label prospective study, lopinavir/ritonavir, saquinavir-sgc, lamivudine, and other nucleoside analogues were offered to highly pretreated patients who had advanced HIV-1 infection and who had failed at least 2 previous highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens including at least 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The relationship between baseline drug resistance and steady-state saquinavir serum levels and early (week 4) and sustained (week 48) virologic response was documented. RESULTS: 35 advanced HIV-1 patients were enrolled. The boosted double-PI regimen was well tolerated. Twenty-two (63%) of the 35 patients had a > 0.8 log(10) decrease in HIV viral load at week 4. After 48 weeks of follow-up, the 22 patients who remained on the study therapy had an average decrease in viral load of 1 log(10) and had a median increase in CD4 cells of 60 cell/microL. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that genotypic resistance to both PIs and the week-3 trough concentrations of saquinavir were associated with virologic outcome at week 4. The presence of > or = 6 lopinavir mutations [odds ratio (OR) 0.03; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.79] and the 48V mutation (OR 0.01; 95%CI <0.01 to 0.88) was independently associated with lower odds of achieving an early response, whereas a higher saquinavir concentration at week 3 (OR 8.36; 95% CI 1.28 to 54.70) was associated with greater odds of an early response. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that baseline PI resistance and saquinavir concentration were associated with virologic response and should be considered when planning salvage therapy.
