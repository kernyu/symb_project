Two bacterial species are responsible for the majority of children skin infections: Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. If S. pyogenes remain susceptible to the beta-lactams, their resistance to macrolides varies over time but remains significant (> 10%). In France, most resistant strains are by modification of the target, coded by the gene erm b. For S. aureus, almost all strains isolated were resistant to G and A penicillins, but remain susceptible to M penicillin and cephalosporins. In France, the incidence of methicillin resistant community acquired S. aureus strains is currently low, around 6 %, but the risk of a rapid increase is real.
