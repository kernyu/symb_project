The presence of fluoroquinolone resistance-associated mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining region of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV was investigated genetically in clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis recovered from patients with urinay tract infections. Two isolates of fluoroquinolone-resistant P. mirabilis possessed the mutations in GyrA (Ser-83 --> Arg or Ile), GyrB (Ser-464 --> Tyr or Phe) and ParC (Ser-80 --> Ile). A novel mutation with Glu-87 --> Lys in GyrA, where suggested to be responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance, was identified. These results demonstrate that the presence of an additional mutation at Glu-87 in GyrA may contribute to high-level fluoroquinolone resistance, too.
