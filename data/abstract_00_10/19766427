A Helicobacter pylori mutant defective in a putative mfd gene was constructed and characterized. The mfd gene is required for DNA repair and is involved in DNA recombination processes. The mfd mutant strain displayed a greatly increased susceptibility to antibiotics, indicating that this gene plays a significant role in the antibiotic resistance of H. pylori strain J99.
