Acinetobacter species can cause many types of hospital-acquired infection and play an important role in nosocomial pneumonia in intensive care units, skin and wound infections, and meningitis. They are of increasing importance because of their ability to rapidly develop resistance to the major groups of antibiotics. We aimed to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of Acinetobacter strains isolated from, and determined to be the cause of, hospital-acquired infections. A total of 156 cultures of Acinetobacter (strains of A. baumannii [136; 87.2%] and A. iwoffii [20; 12.8%]), were isolated from clinical samples taken from patients in different units of our hospital. Conventional bacterial identification methods and the Sceptor system were used. In the antibiotic sensitivity tests, A. baumannii was susceptible to imipenem (90.4%), norfloxacin (84.5%) and ciprofloxacin (65.4%), and A. iwoffii to amikacin (80.0%), ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (70.0%) and imipenem (60.0%).
