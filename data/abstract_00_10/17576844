The in vitro and in vivo antipneumococcal activities of the main pneumococcal autolysin (LytA) and Cpl-1, a lysozyme encoded by phage Cp-1, were studied. Intraperitoneal therapy with LytA or high-dose Cpl-1 remarkably reduced peritoneal bacterial counts (>5 log(10) CFU/ml) compared with those for the controls. After intravenous injection, LytA was the most effective treatment.
