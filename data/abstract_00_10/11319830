We have developed a method for parallel independent on-chip amplification and the following sequence variation analysis of multiple DNA regions directly using microchip with an array of nanoliter gel pads containing specific sets of tethered primers. The method has three key features. First, DNA to be amplified is enriched at gel pads by its hybridization with immobilized primers. Second, different sets of specific primers are immobilized within various gel pads, and primers are detached within gel pads just before polymerase chain reaction to enhance the amplification. A gel pad may contain an additional permanently immobilized dormant primer that is activated to carry out the allele-specific primer extension reaction to detect mutations. Third, multiple polymerase chain reactions are confined within nanoliter gel pads covered and separated from each other with mineral oil. The method was applied to simultaneously identify several abundant drug-resistant mutations in three genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
