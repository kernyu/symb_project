Antibacterial activity of biapenem (BIPM) against clinical isolates of 8 species between 2000 and 2002 was compared with those of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS), meropenem (MEPM), panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) and ceftazidime (CAZ). The MICs of biapenem for Gram-positive bacteria were higher than those of IPM/CS and PAPM/BP, equal to those of MEPM and lower than those of CAZ. The MICs of BIPM for Gram-negative bacteria were higher than those of MEPM, equal to those of IPM/CS and PAPM/BP, and lower than those of CAZ. Antibacterial activity of BIPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was equal to those of IPM/CS and MEPM and superior to those of PAPM/BP and CAZ. In conclusion, BIPM showed broad antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. These results suggest that BIPM is useful for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
