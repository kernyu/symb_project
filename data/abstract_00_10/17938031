Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities, primarily hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance, have been reported in juvenile dermatomyositis. We report a 55-year-old woman with adult dermatomyositis who developed lipodystrophy of the thighs, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance. Our case illustrates that lipodystrophy may occur in adult and juvenile dermatomyositis. Loss of subcutaneous tissue may be a cutaneous marker for metabolic abnormalities in both the adult and the juvenile forms of dermatomyositis.
