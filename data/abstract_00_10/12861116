PURPOSE: To present a case of bilateral methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) keratitis after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). METHODS: Retrospective chart review. RESULTS A 26-year-old female internal medicine resident underwent an uneventful bilateral PRK. After the procedure, the patient was fit with a bandage contact lens and was prescribed tobramycin 0.3%, fluorometholone 0.1%, and diclofenac sodium 0.1% four times per day. Postoperatively, corneal ulcers were noted in each eye, and the patient was referred for a consultation. Gram stain showed gram-positive cocci. The patient immediately started using vancomycin, 35 mg/mL every half hour, and ofloxacin 0.3% every hour around the clock. Forty-eight hours later, corneal and lid cultures were positive for MRSA. Three months after the infection, there was approximately 40% corneal thinning in the right eye and 10% thinning in the area of the corneal ulceration of the left eye. The patient is awaiting corneal transplantation of the right eye. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this represents the first reported case of bilateral MRSA keratitis after PRK. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus is a potentially serious infectious agent after PRK and may be associated with exposure to a hospital setting. For patients who have had extensive exposure to a hospital environment and are undergoing ocular surgery, we recommend prophylaxis against MRSA. To treat a possible MRSA keratitis, we suggest starting a fourth-generation topical fluoroquinolone every 30 minutes, alternating it with vancomycin 50 mg/mL every 30 minutes, and discontinuing steroid use. A high degree of suspicion coupled with rapid and appropriate treatment may result in improved visual recovery.
