A study was made of Salmonella contamination in beef sampled from a slaughterhouse and from retailers in Dakar, Senegal. The serotypes as well as antibiotic-resistance patterns of the Salmonella isolates were determined. A total of 435 meat samples (236 from the slaughterhouse, 199 from retailers) were tested. Among them, 275 (63%) were positive for Salmonella, 43% (101/236) from the slaughterhouse and 87% (174/199) from the retailers. Furthermore, 97% of the investigated retailers had at least one beef sample contaminated by Salmonella. The 286 Salmonella isolates were divided into 51 serotypes. The most prevalent serotypes were Salmonella bredeney (25%), S. muenster (8%), S. waycross (7%), S. corvallis (4%) and S. kentucky (4%). About 62% of the isolates were resistant to nitrofurans. Resistance rates were lower to streptomycin (22%), sulfamethoxazole (15%), spectinomycin (1%), chloramphenicol (1%), and tetracycline (0,4%) while low-level resistance to quinolones was detected. About 16% of the Salmonella strains were multiresistant to two or more antibiotic families. Finally, ten resistance profiles have been identified. This study shows the huge spread of Salmonella in the beef production chain in Dakar, Senegal. Finally, this study provides the very first data about Salmonella prevalence in sub-saharian Africa.
