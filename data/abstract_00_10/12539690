OBJECTIVE: The study aimed at investigating the effects of a new anti-osteoporotic drug, XW630 on promoting the osteogenic activity of bone tissue in ovariectomized rats. METHODS: Thirty-six female SD rats, three months old, were randomly divided into four groups: sham-operated group (sham), the ovariectomized group (OVX), the esterone-therapy group (OVX + CFT) and the XW630-therapy group (OVX + XW630). Three rats in each group were killed on the 30th, 60th, and 90th day after the operation. The femur of one side was taken for the three-point bending resistance test, and the bilateral tibias were taken for the HE stain and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) examination. RESULTS: The HE and SEM results indicated that the bone loss appeared in the OVX group 30 days after the operation, which lasted for the whole observing period. While after application of ester-one and XW630, there were different degrees of bone repairing around the trabeculae, and the osteogenic activity was obviously active in the XW630 group than that in the esterone group. During the experimental period, the three-point bending resistance of the OVX group gradually decreased and there was a significant difference compared with that of the sham group (P < 0.01), while the three-point bending resistance of the two therapy group gradually increased and there was significant difference between the OVX group and the XW630 group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: XW630 can effectively promote osteogenic action and prevent osteoporostic fracture in ovariectomized rats.
