A retrospective study of bacterial infection in 71 burned patients over a 5-year period (1993-1997) was carried out. The commonest colonizing organism was Klebsiella species (26.7%) followed by Staph aureus (25.6%). There was a very high degree of resistance by these organisms to commonly available antibiotics in Nigeria, with the result that more expensive antibiotics such as the cephalosporins were required. The poor socioeconomic condition of most of the patients was a very important pre-disposing factor to burn wound infection, as only 25% of patients were able to afford the cost of wound microscopy and culture, thus leading to limited numbers of cultures being performed, the result being their prescription of antibiotics was made generally on an empirical basis. Restriction in the misuse of antibiotics and establishment of an infection control until will help to lower the incidence of infection.
