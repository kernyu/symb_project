Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogenic fungus capable of causing infections in an expanding population of immunosuppressed patients. The implementation of proteomics in the post-genomic era of this organism can provide vital information about its biological complexity and pathogenic traits. C. albicans proteomic analyses to date have focused on the understanding of the cell wall, virulence, dimorphism, antifungal drug effects and resistance, and serological response, among others. This exciting and rapid growing discipline should become an indispensable tool in C. albicans research, particularly to address problems that cannot be solved by genomic studies. Furthermore, in the near future it is expected that results from proteomic experiments will lead to novel techniques for the management of candidiasis.
