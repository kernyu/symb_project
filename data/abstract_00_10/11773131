Penicillin-nonsusceptible strains were isolated from 15% of 303 individuals with pneumococcal meningitis identified during a 4-year surveillance study in Salvador, Brazil. The estimated rate of coverage of the seven-valent conjugate vaccine was 74% among patients <5 years of age and 94% among those infected with nonsusceptible isolates, indicating that the use of conjugate vaccines may be an approach to the control of emerging penicillin resistance in Brazil.
