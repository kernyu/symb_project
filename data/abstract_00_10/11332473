Free-living waterfowl residing in metropolitan parks in central Ohio were surveyed for the fecal shedding and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Pasteurella multocida. In addition, a survey for intestinal parasites was also conducted in these same waterfowl to determine parasite burdens in free-living waterfowl. Prevalences of 67%, 50%, and 0.2% of E. coli, C. jejuni, and Salmonella spp., respectively, were observed for all waterfowl species. Pasteurella multocida was not isolated from the sampled population. Salmonella java was isolated from one mallard duck. Statistically, there was a significantly higher E. coli isolation rate for mallard ducks than for Canada geese, but no difference was observed for C. jejuni isolation rates between waterfowl species. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted via the disk diffusion method and multidrug resistance was exhibited for penicillin G, lincomycin, vancomycin, erythromycin, and bacitracin. In addition, the prevalence of endoparasites in these sampled waterfowl ranged from 5% to 66%. Protozoan oocysts were most prevalent followed by nematode ova. No trematode or cestode ovum was recovered from this sampled population.
