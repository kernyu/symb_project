Dalbavancin is a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic in late-stage clinical development as a once-weekly treatment for serious infections including skin and skin structure infections. Its in vitro potency is greater than that of vancomycin, with a MIC(90) of 0.06 mg/l for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (irrespective of oxacillin susceptibility), 0.06-0.12 mg/l for vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus spp. and 0.003 mg/l or less for Streptococcus pneumoniae or beta-hemolytic streptococci. Dalbavancin has dual routes of elimination. The results of Phase II/III studies show clinical efficiency in complicated skin and skin structure infection. During clinical trials, dalbavancin was as effective as linezolid or vancomycin in the treatment of patients with complicated skin and skin structure infection, including those with methicillin-resistant S. aureus. An additional Phase II study demonstrated efficacy in catheter-related bacteremia. Other preliminary in vitro and in vivo data have identified putative interest of dalbavancin in endocarditis, osteitis, diabetic foot, respiratory tract or joint infection.
