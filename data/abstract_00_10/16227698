BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the main causes of refractory infections that are often resistant to antimicrobial agents. In these cases, combination of agents with antimicrobial activity is being examined. However, few studies have investigated combined effects with antimicrobial agents including carbapenem and aminoglycosides. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of panipenem (PAPM) combined with 3 aminoglycosides, arbekacin, amikacin, and netilmicin, and vancomicin (VCM) with an agar dilution checkerboard technique and the fractional inhibitory concentration index against 47 strains of MRSA and 56 strains of P. aeruginosa. RESULTS: PAPM combined with VCM achieved a synergic effect against MRSA in 80.9%. PAPM combined with aminoglycosides showed only additive effects against MRSA and P. aeruginosa. When comparing the activity of Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) medium with MHA medium diluted 40-fold (1/40 MHA) against P. aeruginosa, the mean minimum inhibitory concentration of PAPM was decreased to 1/16. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of PAPM and VCM is effective against MRSA. Combinations of PAPM and aminoglycosides showed additive effects against MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
