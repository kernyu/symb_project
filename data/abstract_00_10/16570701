The in-vitro susceptibility of quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, which are also resistant to fusidic acid and rifampicin were carried out to determine whether these antibiotics can be used as an alternative treatment for multiply resistant MRSA strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these antibiotics were determined by E-test. Quinupristin/dalfopristin had good activity (MIC90 = 1 mg/L) against these strains while most of the strains showed intermediate resistance to moxifloxacin with MIC90 = 2 mg/L). However, more than 90% of these strains were resistant to levofloxacin with the MICs that ranged from 8 mg/L to 16 mg/L with the majority inhibited at 8 mg/L.
