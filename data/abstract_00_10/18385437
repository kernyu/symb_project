The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) was detected in carbapenem-resistant isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella oxytoca recovered from different patients in a Michigan hospital. Restriction analysis and hybridization with a KPC-specific probe showed the bla(KPC-2) genes of these two genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae are carried on a common plasmid.
