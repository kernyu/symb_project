BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: Previous experiments have demonstrated the retraction and fibrosis of vital autologous pericardial flap implants in the descending aorta of sheep. An in-vitro model of pericardial tissue contraction was developed that showed healing reactions similar to those observed in the fresh in-vivo flap. Here, the component(s) of serum that stimulate tissue contraction were partially characterized. The molecular weight range and stability (heat and protease resistance) of the serum component(s) are described. Tissue contraction also requires de-novo protein synthesis. METHODS: Sections (1 cm2) of sheep pericardium were incubated with fractionated, heat-treated, or protease-treated fetal bovine serum for 14 days. In addition, SDS-PAGE protein profiles were generated using tissues incubated with and without cycloheximide for up to 12 days. RESULTS: Tissue contraction was observed in molecular weight serum fractions > or =5 kDa, as well as in samples incubated with heat and protease-treated serum. SDS-PAGE showed the appearance of a protein band after day 4 during the process of tissue contraction that was absent in samples incubated with cycloheximide. CONCLUSION: Serum fractions > or =5 kDa stimulated protein synthesis and pericardial tissue contraction. The active component(s) was shown to be heat stable, but partially sensitive to protease. The addition of cycloheximide to the culture medium, shown previously to prevent pericardial tissue contraction, inhibited de-novo synthesis of the protein that appeared during the process of tissue contraction.
