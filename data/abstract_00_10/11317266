We report a case of bacteremia due to Abiotrophia species in a patient with neutropenic fever and cancer who was receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis, followed by empirical therapy with cefepime; the organism was resistant to both antibiotics. We provide susceptibility data on 20 additional bloodstream isolates of Abiotrophia species.
