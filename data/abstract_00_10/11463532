The enterobacterial flora from carrots (organic and non-organic) and salad vegetables has been identified and antibiotic susceptibilities determined. Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pantoea (formerly Enterobacter) agglomerans were the species most commonly found; the former was usually resistant to at least six of the antibiotics under test. Rahnella aquatilis (often producing beta-lactamase) was also found in carrots. There were no clear differences in flora from organic and non-organic carrots. Thus, uncooked vegetables are a potential source of highly resistant opportunistic pathogens.
