We examined 299 methicillin-resistant, community-associated Staphylococcus aureus isolates from Florida and Washington State for the presence of the USA300 epidemic clone. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated the epidemic clone in 43% of our S. aureus strains and in isolates from both states. The majority of the USA300 isolates (88%) were from wound infections.
