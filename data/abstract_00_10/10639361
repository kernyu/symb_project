Histatins are a group of small cationic peptides in human saliva which are well known for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. In a previous study we demonstrated that histatin 5 kills both blastoconidia and germ tubes of Candida albicans in a time- and concentration-dependent manner at 37 degrees C, whereas no killing was detected at 4 degrees C. This indicated that killing activity depends on cellular energy. To test histatin 5 killing activity at lower cellular ATP levels at 37 degrees C, respiratory mutants, or so-called petite mutants, of C. albicans were prepared. These mutants are deficient in respiration due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Mutants were initially identified by their small colony size and were further characterized with respect to colony morphology, growth characteristics, respiratory activity, and cytochrome spectra. The killing activity of histatin 5 at the highest concentration was only 28 to 30% against respiratory mutants, whereas 98% of the wild-type cells were killed. Furthermore, histatin 5 killing activity was also tested on wild-type cells in the presence of the respiratory inhibitor sodium azide or, alternatively, the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. In both cases histatin 5 killing activity was significantly reduced. Additionally, supernatants and pellets of cells incubated with histatin 5 in the presence or absence of inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP synthesis were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. It was observed that wild-type cells accumulated large amounts of histatin 5, while wild-type cells treated with inhibitors or petite mutants did not accumulate significant amounts of the peptide. These data showed first that cellular accumulation of histatin 5 is necessary for killing activity and second that accumulation of histatin 5 depends on the availability of cellular energy. Therefore, mitochondrial ATP synthesis is required for effective killing activity of histatin 5.
