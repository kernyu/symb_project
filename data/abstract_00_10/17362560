This is the case of a black African woman who presented with three distinct episodes of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection unresponsive to first-line therapy. Clinical and virological resistance to aciclovir therapy was demonstrated, and although the first two episodes manifested as the deep ulceration often associated with HIV/HSV coinfection, the third was an atypical hypertrophic lesion. This is despite her CD4 count being persistently above 300 and there being no previous diagnosis of AIDS.
