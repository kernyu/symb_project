BACKGROUND: In HIV-infected patients on first-line antiretroviral therapy, the significance of intermittent viremia and their relationship with drug resistance remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To study the virological characteristics of intermittent viremia (IV) and the association between IV and later virological failure (VF) in patients on a first-line, PI-containing therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Antiretroviral-naive patients were enrolled in the APROVIR substudy of the prospective, multicenter APROCO cohort at the time they initiated a PI-containing therapy and were followed-up at month 1 and every 2 months. IV was defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA > 500 copies/ml on a single specimen. VF were defined as: (1) viral rebound on two consecutive plasma specimens with HIV-1 RNA > 500 copies/ml after an initial response below 500 copies/ml, or (2) persistence of plasma HIV-1 RNA> or =500 copies/ml during the first year of follow-up. Genotypic resistance analysis was performed at baseline and at the time of IV. PI plasma concentrations were determined at the time of IV. RESULTS: IV was found in 20/219 patients in a 2 years follow-up. The occurrence of IV in the first year of therapy was associated with a higher risk of virological failure during the second year (p = 0.03). Genotypic resistance at the time of IV was found in only 4/16 patients and was not predictive of a subsequent virological failure. PI plasma levels suggested lack of adherence in 50% of patients with IV. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of IV > 500 copies/ml among patients on first-line, PI-containing ART is suggestive of a lack of adherence rather than the selection of resistant variants and should lead to an intensification of adherence monitoring in order to reduce the risk of subsequent VF.
