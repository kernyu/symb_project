This study sought to develop treatment strategies for managing percutaneous infection around craniofacial implants. The present general pathogen situation together with a bacterial resistance were determined in 57 infected peri-implant sites. Forty-four implants were randomly assigned for wound cleaning and split into three groups-two with local antibiotics of proven efficacy and one with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The pathogen spectrum differed depending on the severity of the infection, with Staphylococcus aureus clearly correlated with the degree of inflammation (positive correlation: R = 0.72). It was observed that the use of additional local antibiotics was not superior to conventional wound cleaning with 3% H2O2. It is suggested that sulcus fluid flow rate measurements could serve as a simple and reliable objective parameter for recall examinations.
