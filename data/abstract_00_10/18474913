Uruguay is a South American country (3241003 inhabitants) where renal replacement treatment is universally available. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and outcome of peritonitis, and the causative organisms and their sensitivity, in order to recommend an empiric initial antibiotic treatment. A retrospective descriptive study of all peritonitis during the period 2004-2005 was performed (144 peritonitis, 44% due to gram-positive bacteria). We conclude that the high prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci justifies the use of vancomycin in the national empiric initial antibiotic protocols.
