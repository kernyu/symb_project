A healthy 23-year-old man developed swelling of his left upper eyelid, conjunctival chemosis, and ocular motility restriction associated with epiphora and purulent discharge from the lacrimal ductules. Clinical examination, imaging, and culture results disclosed dacryoadenitis caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of methicillin-resistant S. aureus-associated dacryoadenitis.
