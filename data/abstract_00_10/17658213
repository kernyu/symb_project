We report here the development of a polyclonal antibody for human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) and assess the expression of hENT1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were treated with gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. hENT1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining in 24 NSCLC biopsy samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The hENT1-positive staining in NSCLC samples was significantly associated with response to gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. Responses to gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy were evident in none of the seven patients with no hENT1 expression. These results indicate that the absence of hENT1 expression may be useful to predict NSCLC patients who will not respond to gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy.
