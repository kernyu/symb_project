OBJECTIVES: To examine the direct detection of rifampicin (RFP)-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum by Line Probe Assay (LiPA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 130 sputa and analyzed both by LiPA and the Amplicor M.tuberculosis assay. For culture-positive samples, RFP resistance testing was performed and compared with the results by LiPA. RESULTS: Eighty two out of 84 M. tuberculosis samples were detected by LiPA and all of 10 Mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis (MOTT) samples and 36 negative samples were negative by LiPA. The detection rate is same as Amplicor. For culture-positive samples, LiPA showed mutation pattern for all of 22 RFP-resistant strains and wild type pattern for 19 of 20 RFP-sensitive strains. The one remaining showed mixed pattern of wild type and mutation pattern. CONCLUSION: The use of LiPA for sputum coould enable early detection of RFP-resistant tuberculosis and seems to be useful for the control of tuberculosis.
