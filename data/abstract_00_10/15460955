The Australian Gonococcal Surveillance Programme monitors the antibiotic susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in all Australian states and territories. In 2003 the in vitro susceptibility of 3,772 isolates of gonococci from public and private sector sources was determined by standardised methods. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns again varied considerably between jurisdictions and regions. Resistance to the penicillins nationally, was 17 per cent but ranged up to 27 per cent in larger urban centres. Quinolone resistance in gonococci (QRNG) remained widespread and increased in most states but most markedly in Victoria. Nationally, 14.4 per cent of all isolates were QRNG, and most of this resistance was at high MIC levels. All isolates remained sensitive to spectinomycin. A small number of isolates showed some decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC 0.06 mg/L or more) and were concentrated in New South Wales. A high proportion of gonococci examined in larger urban centres were from male patients and rectal and pharyngeal isolates were common. In other centres and in rural Australia the male to female ratio of cases was lower, and most isolates were from the genital tract. In New South Wales, the number of available cultures decreased and represented 30 per cent of the national total. In Victoria, the number of isolates increased and was 25 per cent of all gonococci examined.
