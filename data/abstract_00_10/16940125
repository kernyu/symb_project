A novel natural TEM beta-lactamase with extended-spectrum activity, TEM-138, was identified in a ceftazidime-resistant clinical isolate of Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis. Compared to TEM-1, TEM-138 contains the following mutations: E104K, N175I, and G238S. The bla(TEM-138) gene was located on a 50-kb transferable plasmid. Expression studies with Escherichia coli revealed efficient ceftazidimase and cefotaximase activities for TEM-138.
