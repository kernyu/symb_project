Among 99 clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates resistant to cefoxitin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, coexistence of AmpC (DHA-1, CMY-2, or CMY-8) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (CTX-M and/or SHV) was detected in a total of 35. The remainder produced AmpC (n = 42), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (n = 9), metallo-beta-lactamases (n = 2), or none of these enzymes (n = 11). Phenotypic characteristics of these isolates were demonstrated.
