This study investigated the identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Salmonella isolates in Northern Ireland during 2001-2003. All six participating hospital laboratories used similar methods. Identification and antimicrobial resistance of human enteric (n=897) Salmonella isolates were analysed by retrospective collation of laboratory records. Resistance of human Salmonella isolates to nalidixic acid was 16% but resistance to ciprofloxacin or cefotaxime was rare (<1%). Minor inter-laboratory variations in sensitivity testing practices make it difficult to compare antimicrobial sensitivity results reliably and also to monitor for epidemic clones such as S. Typhimurium DT104 with the ACSSuT resistance pattern. The outcome of this study was the adoption of a standardized regional approach to the isolation of salmonella antimicrobial resistance. This should improve epidemiological monitoring of epidemic clones and assure optimum treatment options are available. In cases of treatment failure, MICs to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin should be determined.
