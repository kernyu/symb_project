Rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis could be determined within 2 h by using pyrosequencing-based approach. Pyrosequencing results of rifampin-resistant (n = 21) and rifampin-susceptible (n = 20) M. tuberculosis isolates were concordant with those based on drug susceptibility testing and conventional DNA sequencing. Results showed pyrosequencing-based approach is a rapid, sensitive, and efficient detection method of rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis.
