OBJECTIVES: The continued rise in drug-resistant pathogens has led to global research efforts into new antimicrobial agents. A promising class of new agents are the antimicrobial peptides. The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of the antimicrobial peptide Dhvar-5 in a prophylactic, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis model. METHODS: Dhvar-5 (12 mg or 24 mg/rabbit) was incorporated into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads as a local drug delivery system. For comparison, plain beads (control) and beads containing gentamicin as a sulphate (10 mg or 24 mg per rabbit) were also prepared. The beads were inserted into the inoculated femoral cavity of 36 rabbits, and 1 week later they were killed. The presence and severity of MRSA osteomyelitis was assessed by culture and histology. RESULTS: Both the 24 mg Dhvar-5 beads and the 24 mg gentamicin sulphate beads significantly reduced the bacterial load of the inoculated femora compared with the control chain. Although a 24 mg Dhvar-5 dose inhibited MRSA growth, it did not completely sterilize the femora. Sterilization occurred only in some of the gentamicin-treated specimens. CONCLUSION: We conclude that both the gentamicin beads and the Dhvar-5 beads were only partially effective at preventing MRSA infection in this model.
