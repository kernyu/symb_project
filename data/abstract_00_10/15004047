The goal of this study was to apply temperature-mediated heteroduplex analysis using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography to identify pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and simultaneously differentiate between M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis. Features that contributed to an optimal assay included the use of two different reference probes for the pncA gene targets from wild-type M. tuberculosis and wild-type M. bovis, optimization of the column temperature, increasing the starting concentration of the elution buffer, and reducing the rate of elution buffer increase (slope). A total of 69 strains were studied, including 48 wild-type M. tuberculosis strains (13 were PZA-resistant strains) and 21 M. bovis strains (8 were BCG strains). In all isolates tested, wild-type M. tuberculosis generated a single-peak pattern when mixed with the M. tuberculosis probe and a double-peak pattern with the M. bovis probe. In contrast, all M. bovis isolates generated a double-peak pattern when mixed with the M. tuberculosis probe and a single-peak pattern with the M. bovis probe. PZA-resistant mutant M. tuberculosis isolates generated characteristic patterns that were easily distinguishable from both wild-type M. tuberculosis and M. bovis isolates. Chromatographic patterns generated by the two reference probes allowed the rapid detection of PZA resistance with the simultaneous ability to distinguish between M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. This approach may allow the detection of drug resistance-associated mutations, with potential application to clinical and epidemiological aspects of tuberculosis control.
