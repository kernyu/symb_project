OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin in Beijing. METHODS: H. pylori strains were cultured from the gastric biopsy samples obtained from 159 patients with upper abdominal symptoms by gastroendoscopy. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined by E-test method. RESULTS: The resistance rates of H. pylori to metronidazole and clarithromycin in Beijing were 36.0% (18/50) and 10.0% (5/50) in 1999-2000, 43.1% (47/109) and 18.3% (20/109) in 2001-2002, respectively. H. pylori resistance to both metronidazole and clarithromycin were 10.0% (5/50) in 1999-2000 and 14.7% (16/109) in 2001-2002. Only one strain was found resistant to amoxicillin in 49 patients. CONCLUSION: The resistance rates of H. pylori to metronidazole and clarithromycin were increased in Beijing in recent years. The strains resistant to amoxicillin were rare.
