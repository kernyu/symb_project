This research aimed to describe the genetic and phenotypic diversity of 74 Spanish Brachyspira hyodysenteriae field isolates, to establish epidemiological relationships between the isolates and to confirm the presence of tiamulin-resistant isolates in Spain. For these purposes, we performed biochemical tests in combination with diagnostic PCR analysis for the identification of Brachyspira spp. and for detection of the smpA/smpB gene. We also used antimicrobial susceptibility tests, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and a new pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) protocol. The combination of RAPD and PFGE allowed the study of epidemiological relationships. Both indole-negative and tiamulin-resistant isolates of B. hyodysenteriae are reported in Spain for the first time. The genetic analyses indicated a relationship between these Spanish isolates and indole-negative isolates previously obtained from Germany and Belgium.
