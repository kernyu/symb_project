A 29-year-old man with rapidly destructive Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis after mitral valve reconstruction is presented. Resistance to rifampin and teicoplanin occurred during antibiotic treatment resulting in clinical failure and valve destruction. Subsequently, the patient was successfully treated, by combining valve replacement with antibiotic therapy including quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. In conclusion, S. epidermidis can cause rapid valve destruction with large vegetations, and combination of surgery and antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
