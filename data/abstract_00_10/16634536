BACKGROUND: Opportunistic fungal infections are rare, life-threatening conditions and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts. Our experience in the management of a case of combined mucormycosis and aspergillosis of the rhinocerebral region is presented. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The infection developed a few weeks after tooth extraction, massively involving facial structures. After diagnosis, the patient underwent prolonged combined systemic antifungal treatment. Once the local and general conditions had stabilized, an extensive surgical debridement was performed, followed by reconstruction with a pedicled myocutaneous flap. RESULTS: This approach was curative with patient survival after 16 months. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis, early anti-fungal treatment and early stabilization of the patients' general condition are fundamental for patient survival. Surgery is necessary for fungal eradication, but must be performed according to the above conditions. Pedicled muscle flaps are considered the first reconstruction choice because of their excellent blood perfusion and resistance to fungal invasion.
