Resistance to different antibiotics was found in 26 of the 30 strains analyzed, more than 70% of the strains analyzed were resistant to carbenicillin and ampicillin and a significant correlation was found between the resistance to both antibiotics. Plasmids were found in 80% of the strains analyzed, and 11 different plasmid profiles were observed. The most common profile obtained had only a 21.2-kbp plasmid, a significant correlation was found between the presence of this plasmid and resistance to carbenicillin, although some exceptions could be detected. Plasmids were cured from a cephalothin resistant strain and reintroduced into the plasmid-free cell and into Escherichia coli DH5alpha, both strains gained resistance to this antibiotic.
