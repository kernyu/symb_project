The in vitro activities of linezolid were determined alone and in combination with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, fusidic acid, or rifampin against five methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and five methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. Similar responses were obtained against MSSA and MRSA. When combined with fusidic acid, gentamicin, or rifampin, linezolid prevented selection of resistant mutants but showed no synergy. When linezolid was combined with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, a slight antagonism was observed. While the combination with linezolid may reduce the emergence of mutants resistant to the associated drugs, the absence of synergy, especially in the case of vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, does not argue in favor of such combinations.
