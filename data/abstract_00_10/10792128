BACKGROUND: Chinese tea has an antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria. However, its activity against Helicobacter pylori has not been reported. METHOD: In this study the anti-Helicobacter pylori effects of a Chinese tea (Lung Chen tea), and two tea catechins, epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were examined. The effect of Lung Chen on metronidazole resistance was also studied using the E-test. RESULTS: Lung Chen, epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin all inhibited the growth of H. pylori. The MIC90 for Lung Chen was 0. 25-0.5% (w/w) and that of epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin were 50-100 and 800-1600 microg/mL, respectively. Epigallocatechin gallate is probably the active ingredient responsible for most of the anti-H. pylori activity of Chinese tea. Lung Chen did not reverse metronidazole resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese tea has anti-H. pylori activity in a daily consumed concentration, and epigallocatechin gallate is probably the active ingredient responsible for the action.
