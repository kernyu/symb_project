Multidrug resistance (MDR) lines from a murine T-cell leukemia were selected in increasing vincristine (VCR) or doxorubicin (DOX) concentrations. Daunorubicin (DNR) efflux was evidenced after 25 additional passages with constant 160 ng ml(-1) of either VCR or DOX, an effect that was inhibited by verapamil, cyclosporin-A (CsA) and PSC 833. The expression of Pgp was not evidenced in the resistant cell lines using anti-human Pgp antibodies. Cell proliferation assay showed that cell lines resistant to VCR (LBR-V160) or DOX (LBR-D160) required higher doses of either drug to produce GI50 compared with control cell line obtained after culture in the absence of VCR or DOX. When resistant cell lines were maintained during 60 days in the absence of either VCR or DOX, MDR phenotype reversal was obtained in LBR-D160 while LBR-V160 remained resistant to the drug, as shown by cell proliferation assays and by drug efflux pump functionality. When VCR or DOX were used together with either CsA or PSC 833, the latter was more effective to produce reversal of resistance than the former, whereas CsA presented greater cytotoxic effect than PSC 833 for sensitive and resistant cells. Cross-resistance was found between VCR, DOX and other antineoplasic agents on murine leukemic cell line. VCR was more effective to induce MDR since the resistant cell lines were more stable to the MDR phenotype.
