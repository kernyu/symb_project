In Togo, chloroquine (CQ) remains the first-line drug for the treatment of uncomplicated, Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In the absence of recent data on the level of parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs, Togo's National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) decided to assess the current efficacy of CQ in the treatment of uncomplicated, P. falciparum malaria at three sentinel sites in the north of the country. Between the September and November of 2001, the World Health Organization's standard 14-day protocol was used to investigate 153 malarious children aged 6-59 months old (46 from Sokode, 54 from Niamtougou and 53 from Dapaong). Of the subjects from Sokode, Niamtougou and Dapaong, early treatment failure was observed in 0%, 7% and 12%, late treatment failure in 0%, 11% and 17%, and overall parasitological failure in 0%, 45% [with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 39%-51%] and 62% (CI=54%-70%), respectively. Even within northern Togo, there is clearly considerable geographical variation in the level of resistance to CQ. Before an efficient antimalarial-drug policy can be developed, there is an urgent need to develop and use the national surveillance system further, to collect relevant data on the efficacies of CQ and other antimalarial drugs, such as amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
