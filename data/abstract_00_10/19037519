In the past 3 decades, classical extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have probably been the main contributors to gram-negative antimicrobial resistance in Singapore. These appear to be being replaced by the newer CTX-M ESBLs. Metallo-beta-lactamases are found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa but do not seem to have spread widely in Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacteriaceae. Carbapenem-hydrolysing oxacillinases are prevalent in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. More insidious developments include the emergence of plasmid AmpC beta-lactamases and multifactorial quinolone resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.
