Antibiotic resistance is increasing and beginning to affect the outcome of empirical antimicrobial therapy of urinary tract infections. Associated resistance, i.e. the fact that a bacterium resistant to one antibiotic is often much more likely to be resistant to other antibiotics, drastically decreases our chances of getting a second empirical attempt right. To increase the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics, which are considered to be less selective for resistance, we need to develop new strategies from the laboratory to support our clinical colleagues. We suggest that 'pre-emptive culturing' of urine (i.e. a culture obtained before empirical treatment is instituted) will prevent clinicians from making a second improper empirical choice or having to resort to expensive broad-spectrum antimicrobials, which may drive resistance further. This strategy will be especially important in settings with high levels of resistance.
