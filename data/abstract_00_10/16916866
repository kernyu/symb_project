OBJECTIVES: CNS infections due to multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) are an emerging problem in neurosurgical patients. Colistin remains one of the few remaining treatment options for MRAB but has poor CNS penetration. We describe our experience with intraventricular or intrathecal colistin for this infection. METHODS: Cases known to have received intraventricular or intrathecal colistin for CNS infections due to MRAB were retrospectively reviewed regarding colistin treatment, colistin efficacy and adverse events. RESULTS: Five patients were identified. All were admissions to the neurosurgical ICU and all were cured of their CNS infections. Three cases were complicated by drug-induced aseptic meningitis or ventriculitis. CONCLUSIONS: This largest case series to date shows that direct instillation of colistin into the CNS may cause chemical meningitis or ventriculitis but it is an effective treatment option for MRAB CNS infection. Further study of dosing regimens is needed.
