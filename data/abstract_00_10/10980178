The in vitro activity of LY303366 was compared with those of itraconazole and amphotericin B against 156 fluconazole-resistant (MIC > or = 16 mg/L) clinical isolates of Candida spp. An adaptation of the NCCLS reference method was employed for determination of MICs. LY303366 was more potent than either itraconazole or amphotericin B against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis, even against isolates with itraconazole MICs > or = 1 mg/L. LY303366 was less potent in vitro against Candida parapsilosis and Candida guilliermondii isolates. LY303366 has promising antifungal activity and warrants further investigation.
