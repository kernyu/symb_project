A novel trimethoprim resistance gene, designated dfrA20, was detected on the 11-kb plasmid pCCK154 from Pasteurella multocida. The dfrA20 gene codes for a dihydrofolate reductase of 169 amino acids. Sequence comparisons revealed that the DfrA20 protein differed distinctly from all dihydrofolate reductases known so far.
