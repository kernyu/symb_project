A new WRKY gene was cloned from Brassica chinensis by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of BcWRKY was 1175 bp long and contained a 924 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative W-box-binding protein of 308 amino acids. The predicted BcWRKY protein was found to have a potential bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS-BP) in its N-terminal region followed by a WRKY DNA-binding domain. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that BcWRKY resembled other WRKY domain-containing proteins from Arabidopsis (AtWRKY18), tobacco (WIZZ), parsley (PcWRKY4) and wild oat (ABF2). Expression of the BcWRKY gene could be induced by salicylic acid (SA), and influenced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 infection and wounding treatment. Our study implies that BcWRKY might have similar functions possessed by other WRKY genes such as inducing the expression of some defense-related genes and increasing plant's disease resistance ability.
