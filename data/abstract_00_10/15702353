BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacterial rhinosinusitis is one of the most frequent indications for an antibiotic therapy. The objective of this study was the analysis of the current pathogen spectrum and its antimicrobial susceptibility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2004, 188 specimens obtained from 170 patients with acute, purulent rhinosinusitis were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 217 pathogens were isolated. The most common isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (33%), Haemophilus influenzae (27%), Staphylococcus aureus (13%), Moraxella catarrhalis (11%) and streptococci (7%). S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were the predominant pathogens in children. S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and streptococci, however, dominated in specimens from adults. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, adults should be treated with an aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitor or a cephalosporin of the second generation. For children , however, the first line antibiotic is an aminopenicillin.
