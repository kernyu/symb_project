Complicated urinary infections tend to eventuate in severe pyoseptic complications--bacteriuria, sepsis. The search for methods of fighting agents of urinary infections goes in the direction of perfection of already existing methods and in the direction of design of novel antibacterial drugs. In the middle 1980s the first carbapenem drug-imipenem--was proposed for urological clinical practice. Mechanism of its action as that of the other beta-lactam antibiotics consists in impairment of synthesis of bacterial cell wall as a result of the drug penetration through the surface membrane and irreversible binding with penicillin-binding proteins. Imipenem is active against most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms which cause severe urological infections. The article presents the results of treatment of 45 patients with severe urological infections with multiple resistance of the causing agent and failure of previous treatment. Imipenem was given in a daily dose 1.5-2.0 g. Sometimes a stepwise regimen was used: 500 mg 4 times a day intravenously for the first 3-4 days, then 500 mg twice a day intramuscularly for the following 3-4 days. In detection of highly sensitive bacteria (E. coli, Proteus mirabilis) daily doses were reduced to 1 g. In long standing infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa imipenem was combined with amicacin. In high surgical risk of postoperative period imipenem was given prior to surgery and continued after it for 5 to 14 days. Good therapeutic results were achieved: clinical effect reached 95.5%, antibacterial efficiency was 87.8%. Thus, imipenem is antibiotic of the first line in empirical therapy of severe bacterial infections in urology as it has a wide spectrum of antibacterial action. We believe that this drug should not be left as a reserve but used for a starting empirical therapy of severe infections in urological hospital.
