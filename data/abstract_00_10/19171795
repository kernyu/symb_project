Bacillus subtilis mutants with resistance against peptide deformylase inhibitors were isolated. All showed a bypass of the pathway through mutations in three genes required for formylation of Met-tRNA(fMet), fmt, folD, and glyA. glyA corresponds to a yet uncharacterized locus inducing resistance. The bypass of formylation caused robust fitness reduction but was not accompanied by alterations of the transcription profile. A subtle adaptation of the enzymes of the intermediary metabolism was observed.
