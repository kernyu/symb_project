There is challenge and urgency to synthesize cost-effective chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of malaria after the widespread development of resistance to CQ. In the present study, we synthesized a new series of hybrid 9-anilinoacridine triazines using the cheap chemicals 6,9-dichloro-2-methoxy acridine and cyanuric chloride. The series of new hybrid 9-anilinoacridine triazines were evaluated in vitro for their antimalarial activity against CQ-sensitive 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum and their cytotoxicity were determined on VERO cell line. Of the evaluated compounds, two compounds 17 (IC(50)=4.21 nM) and 22 (IC(50)=4.27 nM) displayed two times higher potency than CQ (IC(50)=8.15 nM). Most of the compounds showed fairly high selectivity index. The compounds 13 and 29 displayed >96.59% and 98.73% suppression, respectively, orally against N-67 strain of Plasmodium yoelii in swiss mice at dose 100 mg/kg for four days.
