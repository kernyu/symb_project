We established a variant of MIAPaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells that is resistant to 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (gemcitabine, dFdCyd), MIAPaCa-2/dFdCyd, and elucidated the biochemical characteristics and mechanism of dFdCyd-resistance in these cells. We also evaluated 1-(3-C-ethynyl-beta-D-ribo-pentofuranosyl)cytosine (ECyd, TAS-106, RNA polymerase inhibitor), a new anticancer ribonucleoside, for antitumor activity against the resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. MIAPaCa-2/dFdCyd cells were 2541-fold more resistant to dFdCyd than parental MIAPaCa-2 cells, and the major mechanism of the dFdCyd-resistance was found to be a decrease in the intracellular pool of dFdCyd and its active metabolites, which would result in a decrease in incorporation of dFdCyd triphosphate into DNA. This finding was confirmed by the discovery of decreased deoxycytidine kinase activity, increased cytidine deaminase and ribonucleotide reductase activity, and increased 5'-nucleotidase mRNA expression in the MIAPaCa-2/dFdCyd cells. The cytotoxicity of TAS-106 as an antitumor nucleoside analog was similar in both parental and dFdCyd-resistant cells, with IC(50) values of 6.25 and 6.27 nM, respectively, and this finding was supported by similar intracellular uptake and metabolism of TAS-106 in both cell lines. We also evaluated the in vivo antitumor activity of TAS-106 against MIAPaCa-2 and dFdCyd-resistant MIAPaCa-2/dFdCyd tumors implanted into nude mice. The tumor growth inhibition rate of weekly additions of TAS-106 (7 mg/kg, iv) against parental and dFdCyd-resistant tumors was 73% and 76%, respectively, while that of dFdCyd administered twice a week (240 mg/kg, iv) was 84% and 34%, respectively. These results suggest that TAS-106 would contribute to the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic carcinomas in whom dFdCyd-based chemotherapy has failed.
