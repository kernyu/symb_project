Gemcitabine is currently the best known chemotherapeutic option available for pancreatic cancer, but the tumor returns de novo with acquired resistance over time, which becomes a major issue for all gemcitabine-related chemotherapies. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) enhances gemcitabine-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cell lines in vitro. The mechanism is at least partially due to DHA deactivates gemcitabine-induced NF-kappaB activation, so as to decrease tremendously the expression of its target gene products, such as c-myc, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL. In our in vivo studies, gemcibabine also manifested remarkably enhanced anti-tumor effect when combined with DHA, as manifested by significantly increased apoptosis, as well as decreased Ki-67 index, NF-kappaB activity and its related gene products, and predictably, significantly reduced tumor volume. We concluded that inhibition of gemcitabine-induced NF-kappaB activation is one of the mechanisms that DHA dramatically promotes its anti-tumor effect on pancreatic cancer.
