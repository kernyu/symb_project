BACKGROUND: The optimal approach to patients with gastric lymphoma of extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) that resist to anti-Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication therapy is still to be defined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1997 to December 2004, we observed 24 patients affected with newly diagnosed early-stage and HP-positive gastric lymphoma of the MALT type. Five of them resisted to oral anti-HP antibiotic regimens and to subsequent one (two patients) or two (three patients) chemotherapy regimens. Age ranged between 51 and 77 years (median 70); three were females. Translocation (11;18) was ascertained in one subject. They were admitted to local radiation therapy with a total dose of 30 Gy. RESULTS: All such resistant patients achieved complete remission after radiotherapy. No relapses were observed after 21, 45, 48, 52, and 67 months of uninterrupted follow-up. Early toxicity was very low and consisted of mild nausea. Late toxicity or secondary malignancy was not recorded so far. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy proved to be effective and safe for early-stage HP-positive gastric extranodal lymphoma of MALT type that is resistant to anti-HP eradication antibiotics and to following chemotherapy. Radiotherapy might be suggested as principal salvage therapy after resistance to HP eradication, instead of chemotherapy.
