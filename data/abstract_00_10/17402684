Between May and June 2001, efficacy of chloroquine was assessed in 5 sentinel sites in the 3 Comoro islands. Among the 183 children, age range between 6 and 59 months, followed up for 14 days, clinical failure rates ranged between 31.2 and 73.1% and the total failure rate (clinical and parasitological) between 50 and 88.5%. Failures were mainly early treatment failures. The Ministry of health, during a consensus meeting decided to change the first line drug and to gather baseline information on the efficacy and the tolerance of the combination artemether-lumefantrine. Between June and September 2004, among the 164 children, age range between 6 and 59 months included, the success rate of the combination was 99.4% in the 3 sites with a follow-up of 28 days. No serious drug related adverse event was reported.
