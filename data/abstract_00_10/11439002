Antibiotic resistance among bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections poses a threat, particularly to patients in intensive care units (ICUs). In order to control the spread of resistant bacteria, local, regional and national resistance surveillance data must be used to develop efficient intervention strategies. In an attempt to identify national differences and the dynamics of antibiotic resistance in European ICUs, data have been merged from several networks of resistance surveillance performed during the 1990s. It should be stressed, however, that comparisons of results from different studies using different methods and different population samples must be made with caution. Antibiotic resistance across all species and drugs was, with some exceptions, highest in southern European countries and Russia, and lowest in Scandinavia. More effective strategies are needed to control the selection and spread of resistant organisms. Antibiotic intervention policies, efficient infection control measures and an overall awareness of the serious implications at public health level will contribute to the management of antibiotic resistance.
