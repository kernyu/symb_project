AtPep1, a 23-aa peptide encoded by Arabidopsis PROPEP1, a member of a small, six-member gene family, activates expression of the defense gene PDF1.2 (encoding defensin) and its own precursor gene, PROPEP1, through the jasmonate/ethylene signaling pathway, mediated by a cell-surface receptor, PEPR1. Overexpression of two family members, PROPEP1 and PROPEP2, enhances resistance of Arabidopsis plants against the pathogen Pythium irregulare, and PROPEP2 and PROPEP3 are expressed at highly elevated levels in Arabidopsis in response to pathogen infections and to several pathogen-associated molecules (general elicitors). Here, we report that PDF1.2, PR-1 (pathogenesis protein), and PROPEP genes were differentially expressed in the leaves of intact plants sprayed with methyl jasmonate and methyl salicylate and in excised leaves supplied through cut petioles with peptides derived from the C terminus of each of the encoded proteins. The expression of PDF1.2 and PR-1 elicited by the peptides was blocked in mutant plants deficient in the jasmonate/ethylene and salicylate pathways, and in wild-type plants by treatment with diphenylene iodonium chloride, an inhibitor of hydrogen peroxide production. PROPEP1, PROPEP 2, and PROPEP3 genes appear to have roles in a feedback loop that amplifies defense signaling pathways initiated by pathogens.
