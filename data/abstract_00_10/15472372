We report the case of a pediatric patient with a Salmonella enterica serotype Infantis infection. Detailed microbiological investigation revealed that this isolate carries four beta-lactamase genes (bla(TEM-1b) variant, bla(SHV-5), bla(CTX-M-15), and bla(CMY-2)) conferring resistance to all beta-lactams but imipenem. This is the first report of a Salmonella isolate with CTX-M and AmpC enzymes on the American continent, the first report of bla(CMY-2) in Salmonella serotype Infantis, and the first report of bla(CTX-M-15) in the genus Salmonella.
