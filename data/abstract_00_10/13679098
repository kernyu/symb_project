Five isoflavonoids, (+/-)-7,2',4'-trihydroxy-8,3'-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)isoflavanone, (3R)-7,4'-dihydroxy-2'-methoxy-6,8-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)isoflavanone, (3R)-7,2',4'-trihydroxy-6,8-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)isoflavan, 2',4'-dihydroxy-8-gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl-2",2"-dimethylpyrano-[5,6:6,7]isoflav an and (6aS, 11aS)-3,6a-dihydroxy-9-methoxy-4,10-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)pterocarpan, along with five known compounds, were isolated from the roots of Erythrina zeyheri. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, and their antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were estimated by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations.
