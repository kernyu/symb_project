Taking into account the increasing contribution of species, which enter into the composition of purely physiological flora of the organism, of the Corynebacterium type and related coryneforms in opportunistic infections in people, the analysis of strains was made from different clinical materials from patients. Their identification was made on the basis of biochemical properties and their antibiotic sensitivity was characterized. It was found that strains with similar biochemical properties (C.striatum, C.amycolatum ) should be identified by means of genetic methods, all the more that they were isolated from clinically important materials. Out of the examined strains the biggest number of infections were caused by C.pseudodiphtheriticum, next C. striatum/C. amycolatum, Brevibacterium sp., C.propinquum, one: C.afermentans, C.jeikeium, C.group G, C.group F1, C.accolens, C.macqinleyi. The highest sensitivity of isolated strains was to Vancomycin, Teicoplanin and Imipenem.
