Staphylococcal endocarditis is potentially fatal and is now the most common cause of infective endocarditis with a mortality rate of 25-47% [Hecht SR, Berger M. Right-sided endocarditis in intravenous drug users: prognostic features in 102 episodes. Ann Intern Med 1992;117:560-6]. Its treatment requires maintenance of bactericidal level of antibiotics for prolonged periods to attain a culture-negative state. Although intravenous vancomycin is currently the drug of choice for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis, we present a case treated successfully with oral linezolid for 4 weeks due to a lack of venous access.
