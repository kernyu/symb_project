In recent years one of the more alarming aspects of clinical microbiology has been the dramatic increase in the incidence of resistance to antibacterial agents among pathogens causing nosocomial as well as community-acquired infections. There are profound geographic differences in the incidence of resistance among pathogens of the respiratory tract, only some of which can be explained by the local use of antibiotics. A high percentage of Moraxella catarrhalis strains produce beta-lactamase and are thus resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics. In contrast, beta-lactamase production among strains of Haemophilus influenzae rarely reaches more than 30% around the world. Methicillin-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is a common and increasing problem in hospitals but its extent varies both locally and nationally. Resistance is usually associated with the local spread of resistant strains. High standards of hygiene in hospitals can prevent the spread of such strains but once established they can be difficult to eradicate. Although Streptococcus pyogenes remains highly susceptible to penicillins, even after many decades of their use, resistance to macrolides has occurred. This resistance can rise and fall. Although the increase of macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes can often be associated with an increase in the use of these drugs, this is not always so. In some cases it has been shown to be caused by the spread of one or more resistant clones. Eradication of these clones can reduce the level of resistance markedly. Resistance to both macrolides and penicillins among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae is seen world-wide but is highly variable from country to country. Local habits of drug usage may play a part. In Italy, for example, there is preference for the use of parenteral third-generation cephalosporins for some severe infections and there is a corresponding low level of penicillin-resistance among pneumococci.
