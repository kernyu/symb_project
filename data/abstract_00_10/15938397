The capability of streptomycetes to form endospores during their life cycle was studied in submerged cultures of Streptomyces avermitilis. Submerged S. avermitilis spores were most intensely formed (1) during the culture development cycles on synthetic medium CP1 with glucose under phosphate limitation, and (2) in autolysing cell suspensions of high density obtained by tenfold concentration of a stationary-phase culture grown in a synthetic medium resuspended in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 0.2% CaCl2. Endospores of S. avermitilis formed in submerged cultures shared the major characteristics of specialized microbial resting forms: heat resistance, resistance to lysozyme, ability to pertain to the main species-defining features, and ultrastructural organization characteristic of endospores. They can be considered a resting form of streptomycetes alternative to the spores formed exogenously on aerial mycelium in a surface culture.
