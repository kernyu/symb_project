We report cases of immunocompetent patients showing multiple abscesses by a Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) positive Staphylococcus aureus. PVL is considered to be an important virulence factor. The most common manifestations by this pathogen are recurrent or multiple abscesses of the skin. Seldom necrotizing pneumonia with high mortality occurs. Even methicillin-resistant PVL positive isolates have been identified in Germany. Only appropriate infection control measures in combination with antimicrobial therapy resulted in successful eradication of this pathogen. Dermatologists should be informed about this specific type of infection and about the appropriate infection control measures.
