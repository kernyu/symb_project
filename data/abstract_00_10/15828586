Drug resistance to Plasmodium falciparum contributes to major health problems in central Africa and, as a consequence, poverty. We have analyzed the efficacy of three currently available antimalarial drugs to treat symptomatic, uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in semi-immune adults living in Bangui, Central Republic of Africa. 210 consecutive individuals were enrolled in the survey, of which 45 were excluded. Those having received dihydroartemisin proved significantly less parasitemic than those having received quinine per os or sulfadoxin-pyrimethamin (chi2 = 16.93; p < 0.05), and 75% recovered in two days compared to 57 and 44%, respectively. The 25% who did not recover benefited from a second cure with dihydroartemisin, which proved 100% efficient. The most accurate protocol remains to be established by analyzing clinical and parasitological data and taking into account the economics of the country.
