BACKGROUND: Lichen planus (LP) is an inflammatory disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Studies suggested that type I interferons (IFNs) could play an important role in the cytotoxic inflammation in LP. Type I IFNs stimulate the production of several IFN-induced proteins including myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA protein). The association of LP and chronic hepatitis C is well established, with variable prevalence rates among different populations. Many authors have considered hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a possible antigen for inducing cytotoxic immune response in LP. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of type I IFNs in LP through the detection of MxA protein, and to compare the expression of MxA protein between HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients with LP in an attempt to clarify the role of HCV in the pathogenesis of LP. METHODS: The study included 33 skin biopsies from patients with LP and 10 control biopsies. MxA mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. HCV-specific antibodies were detected in patient sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significantly higher level of MxA protein in all the LP skin biopsies compared with controls. The expression was significantly higher in HCV-positive patients than in HCV-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Type I IFNs play a role in the pathogenesis of LP, and HCV could induce LP through increasing the production of type I IFNs.
