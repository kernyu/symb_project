The conjugative transposon CTnDOT is virtually identical over most of its length to another conjugative transposon, CTnERL, except that CTnDOT carries an ermF gene that is not found on CTnERL. In this report, we show that the region containing ermF appears to consist of a 13-kb chimera composed of at least one class I composite transposon and a mobilizable transposon (MTn). Although the ermF region contains genes also carried on Bacteroides transposons Tn4351 and Tn4551, it does not contain the IS4351 element which is found on these transposons. In CTnDOT, insertion of the ermF region occurred near a stem-loop structure at the end of orf2, an open reading frame located immediately downstream of the integrase (int) gene of CTnDOT, and in a region known to be important for excision of CTnERL and CTnDOT. The chimera that comprises the ermF region can apparently no longer excise and circularize, but it contains a functional mobilization region related to that described for the Bacteroides MTn Tn4399. Analysis of 19 independent Bacteroides isolates showed that the ermF region is located in the same position in all of the strains analyzed and that the compositions of the ermF region are almost identical in these strains. Therefore, it appears that CTnDOT-like elements present in community and clinical isolates of Bacteroides were derived from a common ancestor and proliferated in the diverse Bacteroides population.
