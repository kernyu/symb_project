All open wounds healing by secondary intention are contaminated by bacteria and in chronic wounds this can progress through colonisation to invasive infection. Iodine products reduce bacterial load and are active against most species of micro-organisms, and certainly those encountered in chronic wound care. This review evaluates the use of iodine products in chronic wound care including povidone-iodine solutions and cadexomer iodine. Antiseptics containing iodine are relatively cheap, resistance is unknown and concerns about systemic toxicity are probably overstated. More widespread use of these agents as topical anti-microbials in chronic wound care should be considered to reduce the need for systemic antibiotics when colonisation has progressed to invasive infection with systemic signs.
