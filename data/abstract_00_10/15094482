The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on blood leptin concentrations and expression of leptin receptor subtype-b (Ob-Rb) mRNA in the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus (ARC). Male Wistar rats (26 weeks old) underwent regular wheel exercise for 12 weeks. The expression of Ob-Rb mRNA in the ARC decreased at the end of the study period despite reductions of abdominal fat-pad weight and serum leptin concentration. Serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels were higher in exercising rats, suggesting lower serum insulin levels in exercising rats. Our results suggested that 12-week wheel exercise reduced the expression of Ob-Rb mRNA in the ARC probably through improvement in insulin resistance.
