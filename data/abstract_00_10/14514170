In this study a collection of 547 S. Typhimurium strains isolated in the years 2000 and 2001 both of the human and non-human origin were analysed. 21 different phage types were detected, the most frequent one was DT104 (46%) followed by DT141 (28%) and DT68 (3%). Resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents was found mainly in DT104 (77.4%). S. Typhimurium isolates resistant to 5 and more antimicrobial agents were found in three phagetypes DT104 (57%), DT120 and DT155. Plasmid profiling of DT104 isolates showed 10 different profiles. Pattern A found in 30.5% of tested strains was predominant and carried serovar specific plasmid and one additional small plasmid of approx. 2.5 kb.
