The 16th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections maintained its tradition of being recognized as the preeminent forum for detailing the state-of-the-art of antiretroviral therapy. Abundant new and updated information was presented on investigational drugs, approaches to the management of treatment-naive and -experienced patients, the use of drugs for prevention of mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission, and antiretroviral drug resistance. Of particular note were the continued advances in antiretroviral treatment and research emanating from resource-limited settings and the presentation of the results of 2 much-anticipated, phase III trials of interleukin-2, ESPRIT (Evaluation of Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomized International Trial) and SILCAAT (Subcutaneous, Recombinant Human Interleukin-2 in HIV-Infected Patients With Low CD4+ Counts Receiving Active Antiretroviral Therapy).
