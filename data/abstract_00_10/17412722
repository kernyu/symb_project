A genomic strategy for the overexpression of bacterial multidrug and antibiotic resistance membrane efflux proteins in Escherichia coli is described. Expression is amplified so that the encoded proteins from a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria comprise 5% to 35% of E. coli inner membrane protein. Depending upon their topology, proteins are produced with RGS(His)(6)-tag or a Strep-tag at the C terminus. These tags facilitate the purification of the overexpressed proteins in milligram quantities for structural studies. The strategy is illustrated for the bicyclomycin resistance efflux protein, Bcr, of E. coli.
