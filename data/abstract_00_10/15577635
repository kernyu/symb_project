Over the past 5 years, 1846 HIV-infected patients underwent drug resistance testing at our institution. None out of 216 drug-naive subjects showed K65R. However, it was recognized in 53 out of 1630 antiretroviral-experienced patients (3.3%), of whom 10 had never been exposed to tenofovir. The rate of K65R increased from 0.6% in 1999 to 11.5% in 2004. The recognition of K65R correlated negatively with the presence of thymidine analogue mutations but positively with Q151M.
