Eighty-eight strains of Shigella sonnei isolated in Korea during the period 1980 to 1999 were tested for susceptibility to 13 antimicrobial agents. S. sonnei isolates demonstrated high frequencies of resistance to sulfamethoxazole (97.7%), tetracycline (96.6%), and trimethoprim (95.5%). S. sonnei isolates from the 1990s were more resistant to nalidixic acid than isolates from the 1980s (100 vs 7.7%), while isolates from the 1990s were more susceptible to chloramphenicol than isolates from the 1980s (0 vs 100%). Ampicillin-resistant S. sonnei isolates produced the TEM-1 beta-lactamase with a pI of 5.4. The TEM-1 gene was located on conjugally transferable plasmids in the majority of isolates. S. sonnei isolates were all susceptible to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin. These results indicate that cephalosporins and quinolones may be alternative antibiotics for the treatment of S. sonnei infections in Korea.
