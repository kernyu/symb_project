Exposure of red blood cells (RBC) to the K+ -ionophore valinomycin (val), causes loss of KCl and water, resulting in cell dehydration, manifested by increased cell density. While almost all normal val-treated RBC dehydrate, in sickle cell anemia (SCA) a portion of the RBC fail to dehydrate and maintain a light density, indicating the existence of val-resistant (val-res) RBC. In thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD), although the primary lesion is in the globin genes, damage to the RBC is partly mediated by oxidative stress. We previously showed that such RBC are under oxidative stress, having more reactive oxygen species (ROS) and less reduced glutathione than normal RBC. We now report a relationship between the phenomenon of val-res and the RBC oxidative status: Treatment with oxidants that increase ROS, also increased the frequency of val-res cells. Val-res cells had higher oxidative status than other RBC in the sample. Similar to SCA, thalassemic blood has more val-res cells than does normal blood. Val-res cells in thalassemic and sickle blood showed a higher oxidative status than normal val-res cells. Thus, oxidative stress might be involved in generation of val-res cells. Further studies are required to elucidate the origin and significance of these cells.
