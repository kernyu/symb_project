BACKGROUND: Upper urinary tract infections are frequent. Escherichia coli is the main pathogen identified from community acquired infections. AIM: We aim to study epidemiologic, clinical and bacterial features of this infection. METHODS: We identified 261 episodes that occurred in 241 patients. They were 213 females and 48 males aged of 48.75 years. Enterobacteriaceae were the main pathogens isolated in 93.5%: E. coli in 73.3% and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 15.3%. E. coli sensitivity was of 30% for amoxicillin, 98% for cefotaxim, 96% for gentamicin, 90% for ciprofloxacin and 56% for co-trimoxazole. Anterior antibiotic use was associated with low E. coli sensitivity mainly with fluoroquinolones (96 vs 77%) and co-trimoxazole (62 vs 43%). This enhances the role of antibiotic pressure on the resistance emergence. CONCLUSION: the reasonable use of antibiotics is necessary to limit resistance extent.
