The incidence of fungal infections and the role of liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) in proven and probable infections were evaluated in acute leukemic patients, intolerant to conventional amphotericin B. During 1999-2002, 307 febrile episodes occurred in 231 patients. Fungi were responsible for 3% of bloodstream infections. Ambisome was employed in 5 fungal sepsis (1 Candida albicans, 1 C. famata, 1 C. tropicalis, 1 C. krusei, 1 Geotrichum capitatum) 2 Aspergillosis, 2 probable fungal pneumonia cases. A favorable response was achieved in 78% of patients (4 fungemia, 2 aspergillosis, 1 probable), an unfavorable response in 1 C. krusei fungemia and in 1 probable pneumonia. Our antimicrobial pattern documented a high resistance rate to azoles. We concluded that Ambisome is an effective and well tolerated agent and its introduction has changed the outcome for many patients, although in some refractory diseases other strategies must be considered.
