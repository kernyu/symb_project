OBJECTIVE: To study the resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), an indicator used in hospitals. METHODS: We used minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of iodoph and chlorhexidine to MRSA, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538. RESULTS: Obvious difference between MRSA and MSSA the MIC of Iodophor was noticed. Among MICs, 5.3% MRSA strains were 2-folds and 28.9% MRSA strains were 1.5 fold more than staph. aureus ATCC6538, while the MIC of 11.1% MSSA strains raised 1.5 fold than ATCC6538. The MIC of 83.3% MSSA strains were the same to staph. aureus ATCC6538. The MIC of chlorhexidine to MRSA, MSSA and staphylococcus aureus ATTC6538 were similar to each other. CONCLUSION: Results showed that some MRSA were more resistant to Iodophor than staph. aureus ATCC6538, but remained the same resistance to Chlorhexidine. Thus the concentration of Iodophor should be raised when the resistant strains were isolated.
