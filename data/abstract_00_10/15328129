Fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, obtained from a long-term care facility, were examined for nucleotide sequence differences in the quinolone-resistance-determining regions of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE. Similarities among the resistant isolates, plus multiple differences with susceptible isolates, suggest clonal dissemination involving two resistant subclones.
