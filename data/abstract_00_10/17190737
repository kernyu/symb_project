Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important pathogen of humans and other animals, causing septicemia, abcessation, toxemia, and other infectious diseases. Refined bioengineered lacteal complex (BLC), made specifically against MRSA, is a novel complex of low molecular weight immunogenic and antimicrobial molecules. It was evaluated in vivo using a mouse model of MRSA-induced peritonitis. Intraperitoneal dosing of anti-MRSA BLC demonstrated a therapeutic effect (83% survival) against an intraperitoneal MRSA challenge that caused 100% mortality in untreated animals. Anti-MRSA BLC is a promising therapeutic modality for MRSA infection.
