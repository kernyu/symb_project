The prevalence of low-level resistance to glycopeptides (teicoplanin MIC > or = 8 microg/mL and vancomycin MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) among staphylococci was investigated over a 15 month period. A total of 2,279 isolates (1,519 S. aureus, 760 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS)) were screened using inoculum of 10(6) CFU/mL and Mueller-Hinton agars supplemented with 8 microg/mL of teicoplanin. Of these, 218 isolates (136 S. aureus and 82 CNS) grew on the screening agar. For these isolates, teicoplanin and vancomycin MICs were determined by agar dilution method and a vancomycin agar screening method was evaluated. The prevalence of low-level resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin was 7.8% and 0.1% for S. aureus and 8.8% and 0.8% for CNS, respectively. The brain heart infusion agar containing 4 microg/mL of vancomycin failed to detect two out of eight staphylococcal isolates with vancomycin MICs of 4 microg/mL. Furthermore, the method appeared to lack reproducibility. Considering the increasing incidence of vancomycin treatment failure in staphylococcal infection, a more reliable screening method is required.
