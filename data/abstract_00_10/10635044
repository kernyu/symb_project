Advances in HIV/AIDS therapy have been rapid and profound. An improved understanding of HIV pathogenesis has demonstrated the need for aggressive antiretroviral therapy in most persons with HIV infection. Combinations of at least three drugs are necessary to fully suppress viral replication. Suppression of viral replication prevents the development of drug resistance and allows immune reconstitution to occur. Current therapies do have limitations including side effects, cross-resistance, adherence challenges, and drug interactions. However, most patients have derived great benefit from these therapies. The consequences of immune reconstitution have included resolution of existing opportunistic infections and a markedly reduced risk of new infections. In certain settings, immune reconstitution may allow the discontinuation of opportunistic infection prophylaxis or treatments. The net result has been a substantial improvement in the quality and quantity of life for HIV-infected patients.
