We investigated the efficacies of moxifloxacin, cloxacillin, and vancomycin in a rabbit model of Staphylococcus aureus arthritis. No significant difference between therapeutic regimens was observed after a 7-day treatment. Oral moxifloxacin could be a suitable alternative to standard parenteral therapy for S. aureus arthritis.
