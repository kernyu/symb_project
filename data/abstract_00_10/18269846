OBJECTIVE: To improve the understanding of the clinical manifestations of complications caused by methacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. METHODS: A case of MRSA pneumonia complicated by septicemia, multiple aneurysms and arterial thrombosis was reported, and the literature was reviewed. The pathogenesis of MRSA septicemia, aneurysm and arterial thrombosis was discussed. RESULTS: A 66 year old male was admitted to this hospital because of fever, cough and sputum production for 1 month. The temperature on admission was 40 degrees C. Blood cultures for 2 times and sputum cultures all grew MRSA. The diagnosis of community acquired MRSA pneumonia and septicemia was made. The temperature returned normal after intravenous vancomycin therapy. But localized fever, pain and pulsating masses were noted, and ultrasonography and CT scanning revealed aneurysm formation in the external iliac arteries and the bilateral superior gluteal arteries, and arterial thrombi in the bilateral femoral arteries and deep femoral arteries. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA pneumonia complicated with multiple aneurysm and arterial thrombosis is uncommon. Endothelial injury caused by arteritis may lead to blood coagulation, and vascular muscle injury can cause or aggravate arterial dilatation and aneurysm.
