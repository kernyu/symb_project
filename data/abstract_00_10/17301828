A nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the low-affinity IgE receptor (FcvarepsilonRII/CD23) gene resulting in an arginine to tryptophan exchange at amino-acid position 62 (R62W) has been associated with enhanced T-cell responses to antigen in allergic subjects. To explore the mechanism, a CD23(a) cDNA was cloned into the plasmid pCMVScript-CD23a-C with a C allele (R62). The pCMVScript-CD23a-T with T (W62) was produced using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. The pCMVScript-CD23a-C only (CC), mixture of pCMVScript-CD23a-T and pCMVSCript-CD23a-C (CT) and pCMVScript-CD23a-T only (TT) plasmids were transfected in Cos-7 cells at equivalence in transfection efficiency. No soluble CD23 was released from TT transfectants whereas a higher level of soluble CD23 was detected in CC than in CT transfectants. Human leukocyte elastase (HLE), cathepsin G, the dust mite allergen Der p I and ADAM 33 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase) were found to cleave membrane CD23 in CC but not in TT transfectants, implying the resistance of CD23 to enzymatic cleavage associated with T mutant. Addition of tunicamycin resulted in the resistance of CD23 to Der p I mediated cleavage in CC but no change in TT transfectants. These results indicate that R62W influences the stability of membrane CD23 molecules due to possibly diminished N-glycosylation.
