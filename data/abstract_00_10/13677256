Increasing worldwide antibacterial resistance among respiratory pathogens, especially S. pneumoniae, are an emerging problem in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. In some areas penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae increased to 80% and macrolide-resistance and MLSb-resistance are an evolving problem. In addition, increasing resistance to quinolones has been documented in Hong Kong and in Spain. One way to combat increasing resistance is the development of new antimicrobial drugs. However, the practice of just changing one drug for another without also altering poor prescribing habits merely results in different resistance issues. In the long-term, to prevent increasing resistance, clinicians must be aware of restrictive antibiotic prescription and adequate dosages.
