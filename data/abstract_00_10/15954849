Oritavancin, a new semisynthetic glycopeptide has a spectrum of activity similar to vancomycin, although it exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci species. It has a long-terminal half-life of 360 h, is highly protein bound and has been dosed once-daily in clinical trials. Oritavancin has been studied in complicated skin and skin structure infections where it was noninferior to the comparator group of vancomycin/cephalexin. Thus far, oritavancin has a favorable side-effect profile and appears promising in the treatment of multidrug resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
