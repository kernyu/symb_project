We previously discovered that the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sigma1278b has the MPR1 gene that confers resistance to the proline analogue azetidine-2-carboxylate (AZC). The MPR1-encoded protein (Mpr1) is an N-acetyltransferase that detoxifies AZC and is a novel member of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily. Mpr1 can reduce intracellular oxidation levels and protect yeast cells from oxidative stress, heat shock, freezing, or ethanol treatment. Here, we analyzed the amino acid residues in Mpr1 involved in substrate binding and catalysis by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant Strep-tagged fusion proteins were analyzed in terms of AZC resistance and acetyltransferase activity. The replacement of Arg145, which is conserved in the GNAT superfamily, by Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, or Trp led to a growth defect of transformants grown in the presence of AZC. Kinetic studies demonstrated that these mutations caused a large reduction in the affinity for AZC and acetyl-CoA, suggesting that Arg145 interacts with both substrates. Among seven conserved Tyr residues, one of which may be a catalytic residue in the GNAT superfamily, Tyr166Ala- showed no detectable activity and Tyr166Phe-Mpr1, a remarkable decrease of the k(cat)/K(m) value. This result suggests that Tyr166 is critical for the catalysis.
