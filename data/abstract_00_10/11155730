KETOLIDES: The principal advantage of this series of original compounds elaborated from macrolides is their activity against pneumococci and against macrolide-resistant streptococci while preserving the remainder of the macrolide spectrum of activity, particularly for intracellular germs. TELITHROMYCIN: To date, the main indications have been assessed in adults: pneumonia, super-infection of chronic bronchitis, sinusitis and pharyngitis. The recommended dose is 800 mg once a day. The safety of this dose has been validated for patients treated for 7 to 10 days for community-acquired pneumonia. CONTRIBUTION TO CURRENT STRATEGIES: Should telithromycin be proposed as first line treatment for community-acquired respiratory tract infections or should it be used as an alternative treatment for situations where no other antibiotic can be used?
