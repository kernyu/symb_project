We have recently shown that the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDAC) protects the heart against ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. The mechanism by which HDAC inhibition induces cardioprotection remains unknown. We sought to investigate whether the genetic disruption of gp-91, a subunit of NADPH-oxidase, would mitigate cardioprotection of HDAC inhibition. Wild-type and gp-91(-)(/-) mice were treated with a potent inhibitor of HDACs, trichostatin A (TSA, 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours later, the perfused hearts were subjected to 30 min of ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion. HDAC inhibition in wild-type mice produced marked improvements in ventricular functional recovery and the reduction of infarct size. TSA-induced cardioprotection was eliminated with genetic deletion of gp91. Notably, Western blot and immunostaining displayed a significant increase in gp-91 in myocardium following HDAC inhibition, which resulted in a mildly subsequent increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The pre-treatment of H9c2 cardiomyoblasts with TSA (50 nmol/l) decreased cell necrosis and increased viability in response to simulated ischemia (SI), which was abrogated by the transfection of cells with gp-91 siRNA, but not by scrambled siRNA. Furthermore, treatment of PLB-985 gp91(+/+) cells with TSA increased the resistance to SI, which also diminished with genetic disruption of gp91 in gp91(phox)-deficient PLB-985 cells. TSA treatment inhibited the increased active caspase-3 in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and PLB-985 gp91(+/+) cells exposed to SI, which were prevented by knockdown of gp-91 by siRNA. These results suggest that a cascade consisting of gp-91 and HDAC inhibition plays an essential role in orchestrating the cardioprotective effect.
