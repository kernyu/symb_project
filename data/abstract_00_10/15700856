Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are unusual etiologic agents of bacterial meningitis and pose significant therapeutic difficulties. We report the first confirmed case of nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis in Turkey. The patient was treated with chloramphenicol and cerebrospinal fluid cultures became negative, but clinical success was not achieved. We also review the previously reported cases of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis.
