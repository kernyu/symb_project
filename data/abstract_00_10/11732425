A guideline on the responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry has been developed by the Ad hoc Group of experts on antimicrobial resistance, created by the Office International des Epizooties. The objectives of responsible use are to maintain antibiotic efficacy, to avoid the dissemination of resistant bacteria or resistance determinants and to avoid the exposure of humans to resistance through food. The guideline attributes a central role to the competent authorities responsible for granting marketing authorizations for antimicrobial substances. Requirements before and after granting of marketing authorizations are defined. Important aspects include the control of the pharmaceutical product quality and the therapeutic efficacy, the assessment of the selection pressure, the protection of the environment, specific and non-specific antimicrobial resistance surveillance. The guideline is also addressed to the veterinary pharmaceutical industry, veterinary practitioners, dispensing pharmacists and farmers. The respective roles and responsibilities of these groups are defined.
