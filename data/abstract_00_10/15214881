An isolate of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from a 63-year-old woman with a serious wound infection was found to be highly resistant to fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin MIC > or = 32 mg/L). DNA amplification and sequencing revealed a serine-81 to phenylalanine substitution in gyrA and three substitutions in parC: serine-79 to phenylalanine, aspartic acid-91 to asparagine, and serine-140 to proline. To our knowledge, this is the first report from a European country of a clinical isolate of S. pyogenes with high-level fluoroquinolone resistance.
