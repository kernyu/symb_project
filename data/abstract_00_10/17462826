Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) has previously been suggested as a means of assessing cyathostomin burdens in horses, although SPE used for that purpose is supported by little evidence. This clinical research report describes a study that objectively evaluated the use of SPE on a population of 38 horses following the administration of different anthelmintics. The population was subdivided into three groups, Groups F, M and P: 7.5 mg/kg bwt fenbendazole was administered to Group F on day -12; on day 0 0.4 mg/kg bwt moxidectin was administered to Group M and 19 mg/kg bwt pyrantel was administered to Group P. Faecal worm egg counts were obtained on days -14, 0 and 10. Groups M and P acted as controls for the Group F faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) in which a high level of benzimidazole resistance was demonstrated. Group F was then used as a control group for the FECRT for both Groups P and M. A high anthelmintic efficacy of moxidectin and pyrantel was detected. SPE was performed on venous blood collected on days 0, 10, 30, 56 and 80. As the cyathostomins infecting the horses had been shown to be highly resistant to fenbendazole, Group F then served as a control group for comparison of any changes in protein fractions. Serum proteins did not vary significantly between groups on any of the sampling dates. No significant changes in serum proteins were observed in any group and no patterns were apparent on qualitative assessment of SPE profiles. SPE was therefore concluded to be an insensitive tool for the monitoring of cyathostomin treatment in horses in a clinical environment.
