OBJECTIVE: Susceptibility to seven betalactam antibiotics, glycopeptides and aminoglycosides was investigated in 190 erythromycin-resistant alpha-hemolytic streptococci and 30 Gemella spp, mainly from normal flora. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by a standard agar diffusion test and a standard agar dilution method according to NCCLS/CLSI criteria. RESULTS: 62.6% of alfahemolytic streptococci and 53.3% of Gemella spp. were not susceptible to penicillin (MIC50: 0,5 microg/mL). Cefuroxime was the least active cephalosporin (MIC50: 1 microg/mL and 0.5 microg/mL, in streptococci and Gemella spp., respectively), whereas cefotaxime, ceftriaxone (MIC50: 0.25 microg/mL) and cefepime (MIC50: 0.5 microg/mL) were more active than penicillin. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin and gentamicin. Four alfahemolytic streptococcal strains showed high-level resistance to streptomycin, and three strains to kanamycin. There were no significant differences in resistance rates to the antibiotics studied between strains with different macrolide resistance phenotypes. Resistance to penicillin and other betalactam antibiotics (73.8%) was prevalent in M phenotype strains and resistance to penicillin and other classes of antibiotics predominated in constitutive (cMLS(B)) strains (71.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to penicillin in erythromycin-resistant strains was notably high in this study. This fact has important clinical implications because of the endogenous character of alpha-hemolytic streptococcal and Gemella spp. infections. The lower cefuroxime activity suggests that use of this agent against other pathogens would be effective in preserving the oropharyngeal microflora analyzed.
