Typhoid fever is rare in Europe, but well-recognized endemic disease in tropical zones. We report our findings in a series of 25 cases of typhoid fever during pregnancy observed in French Guiana and reviewed the literature on clinical signs, diagnosis and treatment. Salmonellea typhi causes septicemia of digestive origin that can cross the placenta resulting in chorioamniotitis. Maternal-fetal infection with S. typhi can lead to miscarriage, fetal death, neonatal infection, as well as diverse maternal complications. In order to avoid maternal complications and possible fetal transmission, treatment with ceftriaxone should be initiated as early as possible
