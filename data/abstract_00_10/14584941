Dimers of vancomycin (Van), linked by a rigid metal complex, [Pt(en)(H(2)O)(2)](2+), exhibit potent activities (MIC approximately 0.8 mug/mL, approximately 720 times more potent than that of Van itself) against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The result suggests that combining metal complexation and receptor/ligand interaction offers a useful method to construct multivalent inhibitors.
