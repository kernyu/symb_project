Antiviral prophylaxis with lamivudine appears to reduce hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after liver transplantation, although recurrence of infection occurs in at least 20% of the patients because of the development of drug resistance. Treatment for HBV reinfection with lamivudine pretransplantation and posttransplantation together with hepatitis B immunoglobulin could abolish recurrence of HBV infections following liver transplantation. We report the experience at our center in which lamivudine has been used in combination with low doses of immunoglobulin. Lamivudine (100 mg/d) was administered to liver transplant candidates for at least 4 weeks before transplantation and was continued posttransplantation indefinitely. Immunoglobulin was administered intramuscularly (10,000 IU at time of liver transplantation; 1,000 IU for 1 week; 1,000 IU weekly the first month; and 1,000 IU monthly thereafter). Lamivudine and low-dose immunoglobulin administration prevents posttransplantation recurrence of hepatitis B with 100% efficiency; it is well tolerated and is less cost-effective than high-dose immunoglobulin regimens.
