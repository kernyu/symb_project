Cryptococcus laurentii is one of the non-neoformans cryptococci that have rarely been isolated from humans. We report a case of repeated colonization of the oropharynx by Cr. laurentii in a patient with erythroleukaemia. The isolate was identified by phenotypic and genotypic tests and showed resistance to fluconazole.
