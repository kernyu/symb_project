BACKGROUND: The ever-increasing resistance to antibiotics is a serious worldwide problem. Antibiotic strategies for appropriate use of antimicrobials in hospitals are not well defined. METHODS: A questionnaire on "ABS maturity of hospitals" was the basis of an analysis as a part of an EU project. This questionnaire was sent to 12 hospitals in Slovenia including 11 general hospitals and one university hospital. MAIN FINDINGS: All 12 hospitals returned the questionnaires. Maturity of antibiotic strategies were considered moderate (3.74). Antibiotic consumption had the highest maturity ratio (4.44), followed by diagnostics (3.96), antibiotic-related relationships (3.58), antibiotic-related personnel development (3.44) and antibiotic-related organization (3.36). The availability of data on antibiotic consumption had the highest ranking; designation of and time resources for antibiotic officers were ranked lowest. CONCLUSION: In Slovenia the maturity of antibiotic strategies in general hospitals and in one university hospital is moderate. The data provide a basis for further development of antibiotic-related issues in hospitals.
