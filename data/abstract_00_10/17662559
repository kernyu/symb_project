Prevalence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin, SCCmec, and accessory gene regulator (agr) types were studied in 197 community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from children in Texas. The majority of pediatric macrolide-resistant clindamycin-susceptible community-associated MRSA belonged to PVL(+)/SCC type IV/agr type I group with msrA gene encoding for macrolide resistance. PVL(-)/SCC type II/agr type II strains, although rare, were consistently present in the community throughout the study period.
