OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic differences and their relativity with multi-drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated. METHODS: Forty-nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility and four-enzyme (I-CeuI, SpeI, SwaI, PacI) pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: 85.7% of the P.aeruginosa isolates were MDR strains. Strains with PFGE pattern A were all susceptible to amikacin and cefepime, but were resistant to levofloxacin and meropenem. Strains with PFGE Patterns H and P had resistance to 6 - 8 different kinds of antibiotics. Strains with PFGE Patterns I and J were susceptible to all antibiotics tested in this study. Strains with other PFGE Patterns had intermediate resistance. PFGE pattern A was the dominant pattern, which accounted for 61.2% of all P.aeruginosa strains, 100% (2/2) in 2001, 65% (13/20) in 2002, 44.4% (8/18) in 2003 and 77.8% (7/9) in 2004. CONCLUSION: Four-enzyme combined PFGE analysis is highly discriminatory for the subtyping of MDR P.aeruginosa isolates.
