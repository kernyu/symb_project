BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteremia is an important cause of mortality among immunocompromised children. However, there has been little information concerning S. maltophilia bacteremia in the pediatric population. METHODS: We reviewed the drug susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of S. maltophilia and medical charts of S. maltophilia bacteremia patients less than 18 years old at the Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital from January 1993 to June 2003. The risk factors associated with mortality of the patients with S. maltophilia bacteremia were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 32 episodes (31 patients) of S. maltophilia bacteremia were reviewed. The average rate of nosocomial bloodstream infection was 8.3 episodes per 100,000 patient-days, and an average of 6.4% of them were caused by S. maltophilia. Malignancy was the most common underlying disease (32%). Six episodes of S. maltophilia bacteremia had soft tissue involvement, and only 1 of them underwent surgical intervention and survived. These 32 isolates were most susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (91%), and no obvious increase in multidrug resistance was noted in the previous 10 years. The crude mortality rate was 40.6%. Malignancy, failure to remove central venous catheter, and ineffective antibiotic treatment were significant risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Early and effective antimicrobial therapy and removal of central venous catheter as soon as possible are vital for the successful management of S. maltophilia bacteremia.
