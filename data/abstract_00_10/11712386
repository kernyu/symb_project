The methods most widely used for susceptibility testing against anti-tuberculosis drug (AST) are the proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen egg (L-J), Ogawa egg or Middle-brook agar media, and BACTEC TB 460 system. Recently, drug concentrations have been established for AST using the automated BACTEC MGIT 960 system (aMGIT). We have evaluated the BACTEC MGIT 960 SIRE kit for AST of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin and ethambutol. Also we compared the results with the proportion methods on Middlebrook 7H10 agar (7H10), L-J and Ogawa egg, and the manual MGIT system (mMGIT). Overall concordance rates among aMGIT and the proportion method on 7H10 or Ogawa media were 98.3% and 96.9% for 4 first-line drugs, respectively. Rates were particularly high for isoniazid and rifampin between aMGIT and 7H10 (efficiency of 100%). On the other hand, overall concordance rates among two egg media, L-J and Ogawa were 99.9%. Agreement between aMGIT and mMGIT was high for the AST to isoniazid and rifampin, but lower for the AST to ethambutol (90.9%), which relates to a lower specificity of mMGIT. The mean times to aMGIT and mMGIT results of susceptibility were 7 and 6 days, respectively, contrasted with 3 weeks in 7H10 and 4 weeks in L-J and Ogawa, indicating that both MGIT systems have the potential to consistently meet the turnaround time suggested by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States. These results demonstrate that the fully automated BACTEC MGIT 960 SIRE system for AST is useful for rapid diagnosis of drug resistant tuberculosis.
