BACKGROUND: Chloroquine (CQ) resistance has reached high levels in Africa in recent years. Little is known about variations of resistance between urban and rural areas. OBJECTIVES: To compare the rates of in vivo resistance to CQ and the prevalences of the main molecular marker for CQ resistance among young children from urban and rural areas in Burkina Faso. METHODS: The current analysis used the frame of a randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN27290841) on the combination CQ-methylene blue (MB) (n=177) compared to CQ alone (n=45) in young children with uncomplicated malaria. We examined clinical and parasitological failure rates as well as the prevalence of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene (pfcrt) T76 mutation. RESULTS: Clinical and parasitological failure rates of CQ-MB differed significantly between urban (70%) and rural areas (29%, p<0.0001). Likewise, CQ failure rates were higher in the urban setting. Matching this pattern, pfcrt T76 was more frequently seen among parasite strains from urban areas (81%) when compared to rural ones (64%, p=0.01). In the presence of parasites exhibiting pfcrt T76, the odds of overall clinical failure were increased to 2.6-fold ([1.33, 5.16], p(LR)=0.005). CQ was detected at baseline in 21% and 2% of children from the urban and the rural study area, respectively (p(Chi)=0.002). CONCLUSION: Even within circumscribed geographical areas, CQ efficacy can vary dramatically. The differences in the prevalence of pfcrt T76 and in CQ failure rates are probably explained by a higher drug pressure in the urban area compared to the rural study area. This finding has important implications for national malaria policies.
