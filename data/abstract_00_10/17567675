Drug resistance surveillance and trend monitoring resistance rates bring some insights into tuberculosis (TB) control. The current study reports the characteristics of TB and drug resistance during a 10-yr prospective surveillance of culture-positive TB in France. Data for the current study was collected from 1995-2004 via a sentinel network of laboratories from university hospitals that complied with the international recommendations for the surveillance of drug resistance. Susceptibility test results were performed in each individual laboratory. Data on 13,283 patients were collected during the 10-yr period, 49% of whom had been born in France, 10% were HIV co-infected and 8% had previously been treated. As expected, previously treated and HIV co-infected patients were more likely to harbour resistant strains, especially rifampicin (RMP)-resistant strains. Among new patients, the mean resistance rate to at least one drug was 8.8%, and there was an upward trend in resistance to isoniazid and RMP (0.8-1%) related to the increase in the proportion of patients who had been born outside of France (38-53%). Among previously treated patients, the mean resistance rate to one drug was 20.6% and there was no significant time trend in resistance rates. The sentinel network provided valuable data on trends regarding the characteristics of tuberculosis and on drug resistance rates and reinforced the interest of analysing data by country of birth and history of treatment.
