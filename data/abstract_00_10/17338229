The paper presents data of a study of the structure of reverse transcriptase gene in the population infected with HIV subtype G formed during the 1989 HIV infection outbreak in the North-Caucasian region. The authors analyzed 3 samples obtained in 1993-1994 and 17 samples taken in 2000-2001. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that polymerase of the test virus variants belonged to HIV-1 subtype G. The mutations occurring with azidothymidine therapy did not differ from those in subtype B. Analysis of the mutations of resistance to other nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors did not show great differences from subtype B either.
