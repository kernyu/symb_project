Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly adaptable, opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in the environment. It can infect a number of sites in the body and disseminate. It can cause both acute and chronic pulmonary infection and the acuity of infection and accompanying inflammatory phenotype is determined, for the most part, by the host. Although P. aeruginosa has been a successful opportunist in the context of a number of different disease states, it has been best studied in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF). The adaptability of P. aeruginosa has enabled it to adjust quickly to the CF airway, transitioning from initial colonization to chronic infection. The organism quickly expresses virulence factors that allow it to circumvent some elements of the host immune response and, even more importantly, quickly develops antimicrobial resistance. In the case of CF, chronic infection resulting in progressive lung damage, coupled with antimicrobial resistance, becomes an increasingly important issue as individuals with CF live longer. It is for these reasons that both organism- and host-targeted immunotherapies are being increasingly explored.
