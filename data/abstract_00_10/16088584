Persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) are susceptible to respiratory tract infection with a variety of bacterial species. Among these are several species in the genus Burkholderia (including members of the B. cepacia complex, B. gladioli, and B. pseudomallei), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter ( Alcaligenes) xylosoxidans, certain Ralstonia species, and species within the new genus Pandoraea. Enterobacteriaceae and several other rather unusual or novel species also can be found. Many of these species are closely related phylogenetically and have similar phenotypes, presenting a challenge to accurate laboratory identification. Although their role in contributing to pulmonary disease in CF is not clear, the incidence of infection by some of these species appears to be increasing. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance typically exhibited by these species severely limits treatment options. Newly developed genotypic methods of identification will enable studies to better assess the epidemiology and natural history of these emerging pathogens in CF.
