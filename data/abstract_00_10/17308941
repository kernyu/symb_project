Biosynthesis and secretion of two different types of antifungal compound [phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) and pyoluteorin (Plt) in Pseudomonas sp. M18] contribute to its suppression of soil-borne root pathogens. To better understand the correlation between two antifungal agents in secondary metabolism, a DNA fragment covering partial pltC and pltD coding sequences was obtained by screening the genomic library of Pseudomonas sp. M18. A mutant, M18T, was then constructed by insertion of the aacC1 gene cassette (encoding gentamycin resistance). With the same methods, one PCA biosynthetic gene cluster was insertionally inactivated and a mutant M18Z1 was created. The mutant strain M18T produces no Plt and the same amount of PCA in comparison with the wild-type strain M18. The mutant M18Z1, however, produces less PCA but more Plt than the wild-type strain M18. According to the documented data on strain M18, it is suggested that production of PCA is not influenced by Plt yield, but Plt biosynthesis is influenced by an alteration of PCA production.
