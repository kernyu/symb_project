Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a severe complication in the post-transplant period in recipients of solid organs. Therefore, early diagnosis and specific therapy of fungal infections in these patients are indispensable. We report the case of a 49-year-old patient, who suffered from IA after cardiac transplantation, which was complicated by post-transplant right heart failure requiring mechanical circulatory support using veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and a right ventricular assist device. Despite antifungal treatment, the patient died 3 weeks after transplantation because of multi-organ failure secondary to IA. The isolated Aspergillus strains exhibited in vitro resistance to caspofungin.
