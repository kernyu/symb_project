PURPOSE: Concurrent atazanavir (ATV) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) may be useful for patients with extensive antiretroviral resistance; however, limited information exists concerning the pharmacokinetics and safety of this combination. METHOD: A parallel-arm pharmacokinetic study was conducted in HIV-infected patients (n = 10) using contemporary formulations of each agent. Intensive pharmacokinetics were conducted at Day 6 (ATV/r), Day 16 (ATV qd + LPV/r bid), and Day 20 (ATV + LPV/r qd) in Arm A and Day 6 (LPV/r) and Day 12 (LPV/r bid + ATV qd) in Arm B. Plasma ATV, LPV, and ritonavir concentrations were measured by HPLC-UV. Electrocardiograms (12-lead) and safety labs were conducted at each visit. RESULTS: Prolonged PR and QRS intervals occurred in the majority of patients (mean increase: 16 ms and 5 ms, respectively; p < or = .01). Two patients developed new-onset arrhythmias (bundle branch block, atrioventricular block), resulting in premature termination of the study. No change in ATV or LPV pharmacokinetics was evident. CONCLUSION: Concurrent ATV and LPV/r was associated with PR and QRS interval changes in this small study population. Electrocardiogram monitoring should be considered for patients receiving concurrent ATV and LPV/r shortly after their initiation, especially if other risk factors for altered conduction are present.
