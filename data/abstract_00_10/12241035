Rhodococcus equi is a well-characterized bacterial pathogen which lyses cell membranes with the help of cholesterol oxidase (CO). Survival in macrophages is warranted by its ability to resist reactive radicals via catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Therefore, CO production in the absence or presence of 0.1 % cholesterol and sensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (SOA) were tested in seven strains of R. equi in vitro. When R. equi strains were grown on agar plates with cholesterol, the bacterial growth [colony-forming units (cfu)/plate] did not increase significantly in comparison with the growth on plates without cholesterol. The activity of CO increased, significantly for extracellular CO. In subsequent experiments, R. equi strains grown on cholesterol were stressed with H2O2 or SOA so that approximately 10 % of cfu/plate survived. During stress induced by SOA, membrane CO and SOD activity increased significantly. Catalase activity increased 2-fold with H2O2 and 3-fold with SOA exposure. These data suggest that the presence of cholesterol induces CO in bacteria grown on agar plates. Catalase, SOD and even membrane-bound CO respond to reactive oxygen species.
