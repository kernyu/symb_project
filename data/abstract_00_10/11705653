Three Eimeria tenella field isolates from Gurgaon district of Haryana (north India) were studied in a battery test for evaluating drug resistance against two currently used ionophores; maduramicin (5ppm) and salinomycin (60ppm). Broiler birds (Ross strain) were infected with 10(5) sporulated oocysts each at the age of 2 weeks and prophylactic medication commenced 2 days prior to infection. Drug resistance was assessed by calculating the global index for individual ionophore compounds based on weight gain, feed conversion ratio, oocyst index, lesion score and mortality. Present studies revealed no resistance of the ionophores in any of the field isolates. Both the drugs showed varying degree of efficacy, e.g. maduramicin exhibited limited efficacy against all the three field isolates, whereas salinomycin showed limited efficacy against Gurgaon isolate (GrI)-I, good efficacy against GrI-II and partial resistance against GrI-III.
