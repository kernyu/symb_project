Two new norsesquiterpenoid glycosides named austrosides A and B, together with four known glycosides, corchoionoside B, citroside A, icariside B1 and dihydrophaseic acid 4'- O-beta- D-glucopyranoside were isolated from Evodia austrosinensis. Their structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR data. Austroside A showed antibacterial activity against the Staphylococcus aureus antibiotic resistant strain.
