Antibiotic self-resistance mechanisms, which include drug elimination, drug modification, target modification, and drug sequestration, contribute substantially to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria. Enediynes are among the most potent naturally occurring antibiotics, yet the mechanism of resistance to these toxins has remained a mystery. We characterize an enediyne self-resistance protein that reveals a self-sacrificing paradigm for resistance to highly reactive antibiotics, and thus another opportunity for nonpathogenic or pathogenic bacteria to evade extremely potent small molecules.
