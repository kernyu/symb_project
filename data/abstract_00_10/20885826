This study determined the diversity of species and antimicrobial resistance of staphylococci isolated from dogs with a presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI). Urine samples from 348 dogs with clinical signs of UTI, according to clinical examination and urinalysis, were processed for isolation of Staphylococcus. Colonies in pure culture were identified by biochemical reactions and tested for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials. Seventy isolates of staphylococci were obtained (20.1%). Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was the most frequent species (32.8%), followed by S. epidermidis (18.6%), S. simulans (15.7%), S. schleiferi schleiferi (11.4%), S. aureus (11.4%), S. schleiferi coagulans (7.2%) and S. saprophyticus (2.9%). All the isolates were resistant to at least 1 drug and 77.1% were multiresistant. The study reports the alarming antimicrobial resistance of members of the Staphylococcus genus isolated from canine UTI and highlights the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci in its etiology.
