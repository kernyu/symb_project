The paper presents the results of a follow-up of children and adolescents who isolate drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) strains of those with manifestations of tuberculosis and preserved sensitivity to antibacterial agents. Bacterial isolation in children and adolescents is scanty and multiple. There is a high rate of resistance to isoniazid, streptomycin, and rifampicin. The vast majority of children and adolescents who isolate drug-resistant MBT strains have been found to contact a patient who also isolate drug-resistant MBT. The drug sensitivity of MBT in patients is identical to that of sources of their contamination. Most patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis have been ascertained as having been registered in dispensaries and treated with drugs, which suggests that the use of chemotherapy in prophylactic doses, particularly in patients contacting a bacterial isolator, does not prevent local tuberculosis.
