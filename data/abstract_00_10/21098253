The activity of fosfomycin was evaluated in an experimental methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis model. Eighteen rats were treated for 4 weeks with 150 mg of fosfomycin/kg of body weight intraperitoneally once daily or with saline placebo. After treatment, animals were euthanized and the infected tibiae were processed for quantitative bacterial culture. Bone cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant S. aureus in all 9 (100%) untreated controls and in 2 of 9 (22.2%) fosfomycin-treated rats. Thus, fosfomycin treatment was significantly more efficacious than placebo. No development of resistance was observed after the 4-week treatment period.
