Forty-five novel cephalosporin derivatives with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are described. The compounds contain novel cinnamic acid moieties at C-7 that were synthesized using a key Heck reaction followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions. The most active compound (41) displayed an MIC(90) against MRSA of 1.0 microg/mL, and a PD(50) of 0.8 mg/kg. Compound 14 was found to be very safe in a mouse model of acute toxicity.
