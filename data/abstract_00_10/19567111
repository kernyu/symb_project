OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of pathogenic bacteria in the patients of injuries combined with infection after May 12 Wenchuan Earthquake and the drug resistance thereof. METHODS: Bacterial culture and identification were conducted on 139 clinical specimens from 108 patients with open injuries combined with infection. Drug-sensitive test was carried out by Kirby-Bauer method on the isolated strains. RESULTS: Ninety-six stains were isolated, 79.86% of them were from the infected wound secretion and 58.33% were from three department of orthopedics. The bacteria with high isolation rates included Acinetobacter spp. (20 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (17 strains), and Staphylococcus spp. (13 strains). The isolated Gram negative bacteria showed lower resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam. CONCLUSION: The Gram negative bacteria isolated from the wounds caused by earthquake show lower resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam. No Staphylococcus spp. is found resistant to glycopeptides.
