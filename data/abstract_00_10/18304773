Susceptibilities to amphotericin B and fluconazole of 964 Candida isolates collected in Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts in 2006 were determined. There were 419 (43.5%) Candida albicans, 246 (25.5%) Candida tropicalis, 211 (21.9%) Candida glabrata, 62 (6.4%) Candida parapsilosis, 14 (1.5%) Candida krusei, and 12 (1.2%) others. Interestingly, 16 of the 17 amphotericin B-resistant isolates were non-albicans Candida species. The resistant rate to amphotericin B has decreased from 2.5% in 2002 to 1.8% in 2006. On the other hand, there were 132 C. tropicalis, 14 C. krusei, 10 C. albicans, and 9 C. glabrata isolates that had MICs to fluconazole > or =64 microg/mL. The prevalence of isolates with such high MICs was significantly higher than that in 2002 (17.1% versus 1.9%). Our results further indicate that most of the isolates with MICs to fluconazole > or =64 microg/mL exhibited the "trailing" phenomenon.
