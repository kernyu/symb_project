Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species are worrisome nosocomial pathogens. After introduction of a preventive program involving clinical surveillance culture to reduce the spread of those pathogens, we observed an 80% decrease in the percentage of cultures that yielded carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter isolates. The percentage of cultures that yielded carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa remained relatively stable during the intervention.
