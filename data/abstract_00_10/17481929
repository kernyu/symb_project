OBJECTIVES: Prophylactic efficiencies of cefazolin, teicoplanin and vancomycin in a dacron graft infection model caused by methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) or -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were investigated. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled animal study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infections were established subcutaneously in the back of rats by implantation of Dacron prostheses followed by topical inoculation onto grafts of MSSA or MRSA. Experimental groups were as follows: Uncontaminated group (control), MSSA- or MRSA-contaminated and untreated groups, MSSA- or MRSA-contaminated groups treated with cefazolin, teicoplanin or vancomycin by one of three regimens (one day, two days, or three days regimen). Grafts were removed 7 days after the implantation and evaluated by using sonication and quantitative blood agar culture. RESULTS: Contaminated groups demonstrated graft infections. Cefazolin, teicoplanin and vancomycin profoundly prevented the graft infections in MSSA- or MRSA-contaminated groups. For each antibiotic regimen, the most effective prevention was achieved by the drugs given as three days regimen. For MSSA and MRSA, the order of the effectiveness was as follows: teicoplanin>vancomycin>cefazolin. CONCLUSION: As a prophylactic agent, teicoplanin seems to be more effective than vancomycin and cefazolin against vascular graft infections caused by MSSA and MRSA in rats.
