In vitro activities of 16 antibiotics were tested against 36 Staphylococcus aureus (SA) strains isolated from raw sheep's milk cheese from six dairies. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using a broth microdilution method (CLSI). All 36 isolates were analyzed for the presence of the accessory gene regulator gene, agr (I-IV), and genes encoding resistance to methicillin (mecA), erythromycin (ermA), penicillin (blaZ), and vancomycin (vanA-B). The isolates were also analyzed for similarities in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. SA strains showed resistance to ampicillin (36.1%), penicillin (33.3%), tetracycline (11.1%), and cloxacillin (2.8%) but were susceptible (>or=94.4%) to 12 out of 16 tested antimicrobials. The overall susceptibility of the strains to oxacillin, vancomycin, and erythromycin was confirmed by the absence of the mecA, vanA-B, and ermA genes. The PFGE results showed that 32 strains belonged to 10 different clusters (P1-P10) while four strains were untypeable.
