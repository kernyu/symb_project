Three men aged 53, 25 and 34 years and 2 women aged 39 and 34 years with HIV infection had different courses with and without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Medication regimes were often complicated and adverse events occurred frequently, which led to adjustment of treatment. Since the introduction of HAART for treatment of HIV infection, a tremendous progress has been achieved, resulting in reduction of HIV related events and in reduction of fatality due to AIDS. However, besides the positive effects of this therapy, there is also a negative side of HAART. In addition to the complexity and adverse events, the medication has to be taken lifelong while non-compliance might result in resistance-mutation. If HAART might be indicated, it is necessary to weigh the pros and contras before starting with medication.
