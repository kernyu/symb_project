The authors describe an acyclovir-resistant varicella zoster virus infection in a pediatric patient after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, the use of foscarnet as salvage therapy, and review the literature to clarify the pediatric experience with foscarnet in this setting. A novel thymidine kinase mutation is described, along with a new phenotypic assay for characterizing acyclovir resistance in varicella zoster virus.
