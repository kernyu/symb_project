We present a patient with Linear IgA who was both difficult to diagnose and treat. Numerous biopsies were needed before a positive result could be returned. Trials of multiple systemic agents failed. Eventually, a second trial of dapsone was successful and well-tolerated. The case exemplifies the determination and perseverance that is often required by both patient and physician in pursuit of symptom relief.
