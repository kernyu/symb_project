We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on the existence of a unique positive equilibrium point and a set of sufficient conditions on the existence of periodic solutions for a 3-dimensional system which arises from a model of competition between plasmid-bearing and plasmid-free organisms in a chemostat with an inhibitor. Our results improve the corresponding results obtained by Hsu, Luo, and Waltman [1].
