Using the rabbit endocarditis model, we compared the activity of a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin, ceftaroline, with those of linezolid and vancomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. After a 4-day treatment, ceftaroline exhibited superior bactericidal in vivo activity against resistant S. aureus strains and appeared to be the most effective drug against a heterogeneous glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus strain.
