The ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b is a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, the survival pathway implicated in chemotherapy resistance. However, it remains unclear whether Cbl-b can regulate chemosensitivity through modulating Akt activation. In this study, VP-16-induced RBL-2H3 cells apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of Akt and ERK. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002, not the ERK inhibitor PD98059, enhanced the apoptosis. In addition, down-regulation of Cbl-b was also detected. Over expression of Cbl-b significantly enhanced VP-16-induced cell apoptosis with inhibition of Akt activity, while a dominant negative (DN) RING Finger domain mutation completely abolished this enhancement. On the other hand, ERK activity was enhanced by Cbl-b, and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 reversed Cbl-b-enhanced apoptosis. The consistent results were also showed in the process of Ara-c treatment. These observations indicate that Cbl-b promotes RBL-2H3 apoptosis induced by VP-16 or Ara-c, probably through inhibition of Akt and activation of ERK.
