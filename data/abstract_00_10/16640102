BACKGROUND: Ritonavir (RTV)-boosted atazanavir (ATV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF-DF) are promising in highly experienced patients because of their pharmacokinetic profile, activity, safety and resistance properties. METHODS: A 26-week study of the safety and efficacy of RTV-boosted ATV plus TDF-DF was conducted in 53 HIV-infected patients who were failing their current highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. Patients with history of failure to at least two protease inhibitors (PIs) and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) were randomized to either continue their current regimen (group 1) or replace the PI by ATV (300 mg once daily) boosted by RTV (100 mg; group 2) for 2 weeks. Then, all patients received the same combination of ATV, RTV and TDF-DF (300 mg) plus optimized NRTIs regimen. RESULTS: At baseline, median CD4+ T-cell count was 206/mm3, median viral load (VL) 5.0 log10/ml and median numbers of NRTI, NNRTI and PI resistance mutations were 7, 1 and 8, respectively. At week 2, median VL remained unchanged from baseline in group 2 as compared with group 1 (-0.1 vs -0.1 log10/ml). At week 26, a mild decrease in median VL from baseline of 0.2 log10/ml was observed, with 16 (31%) and 9 (17%) patients exhibiting a decrease in viral load of at least 0.5 and 1.0 log10/ml, respectively. Baseline phenotypic and genotypic resistance to ATV were the most predictive independent factors of virological response. The regimen was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: In these very advanced patients failing highly HAART, the combination of boosted ATV plus TDF-DF yielded low antiretroviral activity.
