The effect of five fungicides, benomyl (1 mg/l), dodine (50 mg/l), manzate (100 mg/l), cupric sulphate (200 mg/l) and thiabendazole (4 mg/l) was tested under in vitro conditions on development of 15 isolates of fungi pathogenic for insects and other invertebrates (Beauveria brongniartii, Culicinomyces clavisporus, Duddingtonia flagrans, Hirsutella thompsonii, two Metarhizium anisopliae, Nomuraea rileyi, two Isaria/Paecilomyces spp., and Sporothrix insectorum) and 13 isolates of contaminant fungi (five Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium cladosporioides, Cunninghamella echinulata, Fusarium roseum, Gliocladium sp., Mortierella isabellina, Mucor plumbeus, Rhizopus arrhizus and Trichothecium roseum) originating mostly from tree-hole breeding sites of mosquitoes. Most pathogenic and contaminant fungi had clear patterns of susceptibility or resistance to tested concentration of the fungicide. Development of both pathogenic and contaminant fungi on fungicide-supplemented medium varied among fungi and fungicides tested. Minimal inhibition of pathogenic fungi was found for cupric sulphate, benomyl, dodine, thiabendazole < manzate. The highest inhibition of contaminants was obtained with thiabendazole > benomyl and dodine > manzate and cupric sulphate. Thiabendazole was the most appropriate fungicide to isolate fungi pathogenic to invertebrates from substrates with high water contents and rich in organic material. The results underline the importance of adapting both a fungicide and its concentration for a selective medium for isolating specific target fungi and while selecting against possible contaminants.
