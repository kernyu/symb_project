A patient with severe burns who was colonized by multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii was cared for in contact isolation by staff intensively trained on hospital hygiene. Of the 1,907 postexposure cultures from the staff and 425 environmental samples, only 0.7% and 4%, respectively, yielded this microorganism. These data show that strict hygienic measures may limit staff colonization and contamination of the environment byA baumannii.
