An increase in Haemophilus influenzae resistance has been documented around the world during the last 30 years. Resistance is due to the production of beta-lactamases, and/or changes to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) targets. The resistance problem has led to the need for new therapeutic strategies aimed at maintaining effective management of both upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Among antimicrobial agents tested, third-generation cephalosporins have been shown to possess excellent in vitro activity against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates, corresponding with proven clinical efficacy in a wide range of RTIs. The role of H. influenzae in RTIs is outlined, changing trends in epidemiological surveillance studies monitored and implications for therapy, based upon results of clinical trials discussed.
