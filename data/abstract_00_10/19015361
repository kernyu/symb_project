A Klebsiella pneumoniae ompA mutant was more susceptible to antimicrobial peptides (APs) than the wild type. Susceptibility did not result from surface changes other than the absence of OmpA. Our data suggest that OmpA is implicated in the activation of yet-unknown systems dedicated to ameliorating AP cytotoxicity.
