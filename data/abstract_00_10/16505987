The study presented here investigated the impact of initial antibiotic choice (beta-lactams vs vancomycin) on the outcome of 342 patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (50.9% with methicillin-resistant isolates) encountered between 1 January 2002 and 30 June 2003. Initial antibiotics were inappropriate (beta-lactams) in 60 (34.5%) methicillin-resistant cases and suboptimal (vancomycin) in 62 (36.9%) methicillin-susceptible cases. Time to effective antibiotic therapy was longer in methicillin-resistant cases (25.5+/-28.6 vs 9.6+/-16.6 h; p<0.0005). All-cause in-hospital mortality was higher with inappropriate therapy (35.0 vs 20.9%; p=0.02). Initial vancomycin treatment was associated with a higher incidence of delayed clearance (>or=3 days) of methicillin-susceptible bacteremia (56.3 vs 37.0%; p=0.03). The results indicate inappropriate initial therapy is associated with higher in-hospital mortality and initial vancomycin may delay clearance.
