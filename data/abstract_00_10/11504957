OBJECTIVE: To study the kinetics of HIV-1 RNA and drug-induced mutations after cessation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). DESIGN AND METHODS: Successive plasma samples from 26 patients were tested for HIV-1 RNA by PCR and for mutations associated with drug resistance by sequencing of the pol gene. RESULTS: After cessation of ART the phase of undetectable virus (< 50 copies/ml), ranging from 6 to more than 29 days, was followed by a rapid viral increase, which slowed down before a plateau corresponding to pre-treatment levels or higher was reached in most cases (14/19 patients). In one patient virus was still undetectable at 4 weeks. Also, a significantly larger number of primary protease inhibitor (PI)-associated mutations reverted to wild-type, as compared with secondary PI-, and primary reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-associated mutations. During the rapid viral increase no mutations disappeared, which instead happened during the slower viral increase preceding the viral plateau level. CONCLUSION: After discontinuation of ART large individual variations were found for the time period until HIV-1 became detectable in plasma, possibly due to differences in the HIV-1 specific immunity. The more rapid loss of primary PI mutations suggests that they might cause a more impaired viral fitness than primary RTI mutations. However, the persistence of drug mutations during the initial viral load increase indicates that mutated strains may still replicate efficiently.
