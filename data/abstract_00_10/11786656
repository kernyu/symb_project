In vitro resistance of community-acquired and nosocomial strains of Enterococcus faecalis isolated in Badajoz (Spain) were determined by a microdilution method. The isolates were identified with conventional MicroScan Pos Combo 4 I dehydrated panels. No resistance to glycopeptides was found, but LY333328 was 2-4 times more active than vancomycin. In the nosocomial strains, high-level resistance to streptomycin (HLRS) was 54.7%, and high-level resistance to gentamicin (HLRG) was 38.1%. Resistance to ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin was 45.3 and 38.9%, respectively. In the community-acquired isolates, HLRS, HLRG, resistance to ciprofloxacin and resistance to trovafloxacin were 44.2, 17.3, 15.4 and 13.5%, respectively. Trovafloxacin was 2-4 times more active than ciprofloxacin against both groups of strains. An association between high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and resistance to fluoroquinolones was noted. The resistance to aminoglycosides did not influence the activity of vancomycin and LY333328.
