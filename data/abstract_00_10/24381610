The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti-microbial resistance in intubated patients in intensive care unit (ICU) of Bahonar hospital in Kerman province, Iran during the year 2008. Tracheal samples were obtained from 111 intubated patients in the ICU by broncoalveolar lavage method. Amikacin, Ceftazidim and Imipenem were used to evaluate antibiotic susceptibility. For detecting anti-microbial susceptibility, minimum inhibitory concentration method were used. Colony counts equal or more than 104 microorganisms/mL were considered resistant. Overall we obtained positive tracheal cultures from 32 patients (29%) out of 111 intubated ones. The most common micro organisms isolated were Klebsiella (90.6%), Acinetobacter (28.1%) and Pseudomonas (21.9%). The results showed that the most common resistance was against to ceftazidim. The susceptibility of Klebsiellain tracheal cultures to the antibiotics was only 5%. E. coli in both sexes was 100% resistant to the tested antibiotics. In the ICU, There was a very big problem concerning antibiotic resistance. Most of the isolated microorganisms were resistant to both the old and the new antibiotics. It may be related to the inappropriate use of antibiotics, bacterial contamination of enteral feeding and infection transmission by medical staff or instruments.
