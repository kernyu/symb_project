Salicylic acid (SA) has been shown to act as a signal molecule that is produced by many plants subsequent to the recognition of potentially pathogenic microbes. Increases in levels of SA often trigger the activation of plant defenses and can result in increased resistance to subsequent challenge by pathogens. We observed that the polyketide 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MeSA), a compound that apparently is not endogenous to tobacco, can mimic SA. Tobacco leaves treated with 6-MeSA show enhanced accumulation of the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins PR1, beta-1,3-glucanase, and chitinase and also develop increased resistance to tobacco mosaic virus. We transformed tobacco with 6msas, the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase (6MSAS) gene from Penicillium patulum, to generate plants that constitutively accumulate 6-MeSA. Analysis of primary transformants and the first generation progeny of 6MSAS tobacco revealed that plants can be engineered to accumulate significant amounts of 6-MeSA as a conjugate. Levels of total 6-MeSA increased with plant age. Increased 6-MeSA accumulation correlated with increased levels of PR1 and chitinase proteins and resulted in enhanced resistance of NN genotype 6MSAS tobacco to tobacco mosaic virus. Our results demonstrate that a multistep biosynthetic pathway can be engineered into plants using a single fungal polyketide synthase gene. The functional expression of 6msas can be used to activate disease resistance pathways that normally are induced by SA.
