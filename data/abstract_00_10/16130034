Antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infections in adults is usually empirical, and use of urine culture is an exception. The choice of antibiotic is normally made based on the results of published case studies (positive urine cultures), which are used to determine the most probable etiology and likely antimicrobial susceptibility. The results of studies published in recent years were reviewed, detailing the differences in relation to the place of residence and characteristics of the patients, and any temporary trends. In lower urinary tract infections in patients without risk factors, treatment must mainly cover Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, in complicated urinary tract infections or in patients with risk factors, the available clinical epidemiological data do not provide for safe empirical choice of antibiotic without the use of urine culture. There has been a reduction in the susceptibility of E. coli to various antibiotics, and this shows wide geographic variations; the reduction in the activity of fluoroquinolones could limit its empirical use in the future.
