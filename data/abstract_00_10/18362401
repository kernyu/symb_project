Out of 2,235 diarrheal stool samples collected from patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Kolkata, 343 cases were positive for Vibrio cholerae (341, V. cholerae O1 and 2, O139). During the year 2004, infections caused by V. cholerae serotype Ogawa and Inaba were 93 and 7%, respectively, while in 2005, the Inaba isolation rate rose to 88% as compared to 12% for Ogawa. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents revealed that the O1 strains were resistant to multiple antibiotics (ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, furazolidone, nalidixic acid and streptomycin) with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Increased isolation of tetracycline-resistant strains (27.3% for Ogawa and 15% for Inaba) was noted in 2005. It appears that the population might be at risk of infection by the Inaba serotype and that tetracycline may not be useful for the treatment.
