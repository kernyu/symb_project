Antibiotic misuse is associated with emergence of resistance and high expenditures. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) and carbapenems (CP) are drugs with considerable potential of resistance development and its disseminated use is a concern. We undertook a prospective clinical audit to evaluate prescriptions of FQ and CP in a multistep process. Each prescription was unfolded in the following steps: indication for antimicrobial therapy; adequacy of initial prescription, dosage and route; previous cultures; and parenteral-oral transition. There was no antibiotics indication in 8.9% of FQ and 1.5% of CP group (p = 0.07). In CP 25.8% of initial schemes were inappropriate (21% in FQ). Lack of switch to oral therapy comprised 25% of monthly costs of FQ. Inadequacy in initial choice accounted for 13.6% of CP expenses. We concluded that, in spite of infection control restrictive policies, inappropriateness of antibiotic usage is worrisome. Clinical audit in a multistep approach may identify possible flaws in this process.
