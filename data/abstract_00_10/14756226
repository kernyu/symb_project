We compared community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) with hospital-acquired UTI at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated organism. Hospital-acquired E. coli isolates were often multidrug resistant. These results can be used to improve empiric treatment of UTI.
