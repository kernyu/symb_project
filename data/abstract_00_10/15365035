Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species have been associated with various infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility data for these nutritionally variant streptococcus-like organisms, especially for pediatric isolates, are very limited. Little is known about the genetic bases of their resistance mechanisms. We report the results of identification to bacterial species level, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, macrolide resistance testing, and detection of genes encoding that resistance for a collection of 15 pediatric clinical isolates from normally sterile sites. Our results indicate that the prevalence of beta-lactam and macrolide resistance is high and that both erm and mef are found in these isolates.
