Culture broth of an actinomycete isolate, Nocardia sp. CS682 showed specifically higher antibacterial activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Purified substance from the organism, CS-682, which is active against MRSA and Micrococcus leuteus, is a C(28)H(37)NO(8) (M+H(+), observed: 516.83) and identified as an unusual macrolide antibiotic, nargenicin. The chemical structure of CS-682 was identified by FT-IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and ((1)H-(1)H and (1)H-(13)H) COSY. The anti-MRSA activity of CS-682 was stronger than that of oxacillin, vancomycin, monensin, erythromycin, and spiramycin. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain CS682 is closely related to Nocardia tenerifensis DSM 44704(T) (98.7% sequence similarity), followed by N. brasiliensis ATCC 19296(T) (98.4% sequence similarity). The ability of Nocardia sp. CS682 to produce nargenicin was unique.
