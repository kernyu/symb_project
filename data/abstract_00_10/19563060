OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial composition and antibacterial resistance in female urinary tract infections (UTI) in China. METHODS: The disc diffusion test, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC), test or E-test was used to detect the antimicrobial susceptibility in 86 tertiary hospitals in China from June 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007. WHONET 5.4 was applied for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6071 pathogenic germs were collected from urine cultures of UTI female patients in the surveillance period, which included 5958 bacterial isolates. Escherichia coli 3529 strains (59.23%), Enterococcus spp 938 strains (15.74%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae 394 strains (6. 61%) were the most common pathogens. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae had 35.7% and 34.0% extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) positive rates, and their resistant rates to quinolones were about 70% and 40%, respectively. Enterococcus faecium was much more resistant to almost all the antibiotics than Enterococcus faecalis. 0.9% Escherichia faecalis and 3. 8% Escherichia faecium were resistant to vancomycin, whereas 2.7% and 4.8% were resistant to teicoplanin. Staphylococcus epdermidis was more common in UTI than Staphylococcus aureus, 79.1% and 75.0% of the isolates being methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus epdermidis (MRSE) or methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), respectively. No vancomycin intermediate or resistant staphylococcus was detected, but 4.9% teicoplanin intermediate rate was found in Staphylococcus epdermidis. The resistant rates to quinolones increased with the patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance in UTI in Chinese females is a severe problem, which could be resulted from antimicrobial irrational use. In the selection of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of UTI, doctors should refer to the results of bacterial resistant surveillance.
