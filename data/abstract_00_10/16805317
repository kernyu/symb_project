We tested the drug susceptibility to 8 anti-pseudomonal agents of 97 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urine between January 1998 and May 2004. The results were as follows. 1. Antimicrobial activity was, in order of superiority to biapenem (BIPM), meropenem (MEPM), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), imipenem (IPM), pazufloxacin (PZFX), amikacin (AMK), ceftazidime (CAZ), piperacillin (PIPC). 2. The resistance rate (intermediate+resistance) to carbapenem drugs was 10.3% for BIPM and MEPM, and 13.4% for IPM. Many of the IPM-resistant strains showed crossover resistance with BIPM and MEPM. 3. The resistance rate (intermediate+resistance) to fluoroquinolone drugs was 23.7% for CPFX and 20.6% for PZFX. 4. One strain showed simultaneous resistance to IPM = 16 microg/mL, CPFX = 4 microg/mL, and AMK = 32 microg/mL, and produced IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from urine developed resistance to fluoroquinolone drugs. It is important to promote appropriate use of antimicrobial agents and continue to survey emerging resistance in the clinical isolates.
