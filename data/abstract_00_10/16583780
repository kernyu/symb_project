Efforts to curb production losses caused by nematode parasitism in sheep have led to the development of a number of control methods to complement or replace anthelmintics. The need for alternative control measures stems from the emergence of anthelmintic-resistant parasitic nematodes with reports of multi-class resistance to these drugs now emerging. A number of these control methods such as predacious microfungi, protein supplementation, plant extracts in feed and vaccines have demonstrated potential to control infection but require development and examination under natural conditions. Breeding for natural resistance to nematode infection has already shown success in controlling the disease under natural conditions. Selection for resistance is currently based on fecal egg count measurements but identification of genetic indicators of resistance will provide a more efficient method of selection. Current quantitative trait loci for nematode resistance include the MHC genes, interferon gamma gene, IgE gene and microsatellites on chromosome 1, 5 and 6. This paper reviews the current alternatives to anthelmintics to control infection, with an emphasis on breeding for host resistance and identification of genetic indicators of resistance.
