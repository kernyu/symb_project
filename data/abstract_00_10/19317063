OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of tannic acid (TA) treatment on the physico-chemical properties of glutaraldehyde (Glut)-fixed bovine jugular vein (BJV). METHODS: Fresh BJVs were treated with Glut or Glut/TA, respectively. The shrinkage temperature, resistance to collagenase or elastase digestion, bio-mechanical properties, and molecular structure of these prepared BJVs were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: TA treatment resulted in higher shrinkage temperature (P < 0.01), higher resistance to collagenase or elastase digestion (P < 0.01), slightly increased tensile strength (P < 0.01), and elongation at break (P < 0.05) in Glut/TA BJV walls when compared with those of Glut group. Chemical bonds existed between TA and JBV tissue. CONCLUSION: TA treatment can effectively improve the physicochemical properties of Glut-fixed BJVs.
