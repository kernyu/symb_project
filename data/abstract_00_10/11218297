INTRODUCTION: Advances in HIV/AIDS therapy have been rapid and profound. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: In developed countries the epidemic infection has stabilized and there are dramatic decreases in morbidity and mortality resulting from the use of intensive but expensive therapies. HIV patients who have detectable viral loads and/or evidence of immunologic dysfunction should be treated with a potent combination antiretroviral regimen. Currently, this consists of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with at least one protease inhibitor, or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or another combination with adequate potency. Current therapies do have limitations, including side effects, cross-resistance, adherence challenges, and drug interactions. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: Drug resistance is a major factor contributing to the failure of antiretroviral therapy: the ability to predict clinical response to therapy on the basis of genotype and/or phenotype depends on knowledge of appropriate data for defining drug resistance. Moreover, careful selection and monitoring of combination drug therapy along with individualized rather than standard dosage regimens may minimize the pharmacological problems and help ensure optimum antiviral activity. Further developments include new drugs, vaccine, cytokine-, and gene therapy-based treatment strategies.
