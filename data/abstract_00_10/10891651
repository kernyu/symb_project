Candida albicans is an increasingly important opportunistic fungal pathogen in immunocompromised patients. Natural killer (NK) cells constitute an important immune effector mechanism and are involved in the response to different pathological disorders. We wished to determine if this immune mechanism is involved in the specific response to C. albicans. Tilorone hydrochloride and related compounds have been described to display antiviral and antitumoral activity, as well as to enhance NK cell activity. In this study, we show the antimicrobial activity of different tilorone analogues and the enhanced resistance of tilorone-treated mice in experimental systemic candidiasis. We also present data suggesting that there is a correlation between NK cell activation and the resistance to experimental systemic candidiasis. Thus, it seems that the immunosurveillance of metastatic spread and the infection by C. albicans share some immune effector mechanisms, in particular activation of NK cells.
