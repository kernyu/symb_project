Clinical salmonellosis in pigs in the Netherlands usually manifests itself as diarrhoea. In finishing pigs this is sometimes accompanied by peracute mortality, mainly in the last month of the finishing period. This is the first report describing Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 infection of 1-week-old suckling piglets in the Netherlands. The piglets showed nervous symptoms and died. The clinical symptoms, gross pathology, histopathological, bacteriological and phagetyping results are presented as well as the antimicrobial resistance pattern. This case is not only important as an extension of the clinical syndrome of salmonellosis in pigs in the Netherlands, but also because of the risk of human infection after consumption of pork or pork products contaminated with this pathogenic and multiple resistant Salmonella clone.
