Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem and is a significant public health issue. An increasing number of organisms are developing resistance to many of the antimicrobial agents available for treatment of infections in both humans and animals. These resistant organisms often result in greater disease severity, longer hospitalization, and increased care and treatment costs. This article reviews the current situation of antimicrobial resistance in companion small animals and highlights how important it is for veterinarians to recognize the significance of antimicrobial resistance and to commit to the judicious use of antimicrobial agents.
