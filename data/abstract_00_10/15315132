A variety of mutations in the genes rpoB, katG, inhA, ahpC, kasA was studied by using different molecular biological methods (conformational polymorphism of single-chain fragments, heteroduplex analysis, biochips) in rifampicin- and isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) strains isolated from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Twenty-nine mutation combinations were identified in the MBT strains. The use of biochips is the most promising method for identifying the type of mutations responsible for the simultaneous resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid. Detection of several MBT strains in one patient requires the use a combination of molecular biological and microbiological studies.
