In the liver, the multidrug resistance (MDR) protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is physiologically expressed at the bile canalicular membrane, where it participates in the biliary excretion of various lipophilic drugs and xenobiotics. Previous studies showed that the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A (CsA) modulates P-gp and exerts a hepatotrophic influence in the regenerating liver. Hepatocytes isolated from regenerating rat liver, after 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH 2/3), were used as an in vivo experimental model of cells with high proliferating activity in order to investigate whether CsA influences cellular levels of P-gp in those cells. Male Wistar rats were treated with CsA (20 mg/kg body weight) for 4 d preoperatively and 1 d postoperatively, and regenerating hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion 12, 24 and 48 h after PH 2/3. Flow cytometry and Western blotting studies with the monoclonal antibodies C494 and C219 showed that after PH 2/3, cellular levels of P-gp were initially suppressed, 12 h after PH 2/3, by 23%, but were significantly elevated thereafter, 24 and 48 h after PH 2/3 by 28% and 73%, respectively. In CsA pretreated animals, P-gp levels were increased even in normal hepatocytes by 34%, and an additional augmentation was seen in hepatocytes from 24 and 48 h regenerating livers (60% and 56%, respectively). In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that CsA has an additive effect on the expression of P-glycoprotein during liver regeneration in the rat. Therefore, induction of P-gp might also be considered in patients receiving CsA after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma and chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment for the prevention of tumor recurrence.
