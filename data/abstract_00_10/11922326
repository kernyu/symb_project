One hundred four Escherichia coli isolates were collected from internal tissues and the cloacae of broilers with colibacillosis or from the cloacae of healthy birds. The isolates were tested for the presence of DNA sequences for temperature-sensitive hemagglutinin (tsh), for P (pap) and F1 (pil) fimbriae, and for aerobactin synthesis (iuc) by DNA/DNA hybridization. The isolates were also tested for O1, O2, and O78 serogroups, serum and antibiotic resistance, and virulence in day-old chickens. The Tsh/Pil/Iuc was the major pathotype detected in 53.8% of isolates from internal tissues, as compared with only 28.8% of isolates from the cloacae. The Tsh/Pap/Iuc pathotype was detected at a lower frequency (15.4%) but only in isolates from internal tissues. Among the virulence-associated marker genes, tsh and iuc were detected in most of the isolates from internal tissues (90.4% and 92.3%), as compared with only 51.9% and 63.5% of isolates from the cloacae, respectively, pap was detected to a lesser extent, in 25% of isolates but only from internal tissues. In contrast to the pil gene, the tsh-, pap-, and iuc-DNA sequences were more frequently detected in isolates from internal tissues than in isolates from the cloacae. O-antigen typing revealed that 25% of isolates belonged to serogroups O1 (4.8%), O2 (9.6%), and O78 (10.6%). Although most isolates appeared to be resistant to serum, only isolates from internal tissues were virulent in day-old chickens in contrast to isolates from the cloacae. More than 10% of isolates were resistant to most of the antibiotics used for the study. However, less resistance to enrofloxacin and norfloxacin was observed. Our data suggest that the Tsh/Pil/Iuc and Tsh/Pap/Iuc pathotypes and Tsh and Iuc virulence-associated markers are important factors of avian pathogenic E. coli. Enrofloxacin appeared to be the best choice for treatment of the infection.
