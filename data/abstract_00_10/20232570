OBJECTIVE: To determine the clonal spread of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) in the patients and their environment at BMA Medical College and Vajira Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study on CRAB isolated from the clinical specimens of 30 patients and 300 from their environmental samples were carried out from September 1-15, 2008. The CRAB isolates were genotyped using PCR-based typing method. RESULTS: Twenty-six (86.7%) and 20 (66.7%) cases of 30 patients had their environment contaminated with A. baumannii and CRAB, respectively Environmental contamination rates of A. baumannii and CRAB were 18.0% (54/300) and 13.0% (39/300), respectively. The most contaminated sites with CRAB were bedside cupboards (26.7%), followed by bedrails and bed sheets (20%), BP cuffs (16.7%), over bed tables and nurse station counters (13.3% each) and push carts (10%). Four molecular types were classified among 65 CRAB isolates. Molecular type 1 was the most prevalent (90.7%) and found in all kinds of environmental samples except patient record folder and computer keyboard/mouse. About 37% of the patients had at least one of their environmental samples contaminated with CRAB clonally related with their own types. CONCLUSION: Clonal spread of CRAB was demonstrated to emphasize the important of hand hygiene, contact precaution and patient's environmental decontamination in controlling the spread of CRAB in the hospital.
