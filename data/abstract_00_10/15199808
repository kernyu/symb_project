E. coli is the most frequent agent causing urinary infection (UI) both in adults and children. E. coli of UI outpatients is often resistant to ampicilline, amoxicilline and co-trimoxasol. The study of phosphomycin in UI outpatients showed its highest efficacy against E. coli. Phosphomycin in a single daily dose of 3 g is a drug of choice in acute uncomplicated cystitis. The results of the study also demonstrate that phosphomycin can be used for prevention of pyoinflammatory complications before endoscopic manipulations and operations as well as open operations on the lower urinary tracts and genital organs.
