BACKGROUND: To survey the epidemiologic findings of infections and antibiotic resistance patterns in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care university teaching hospital. METHODS: The microbiologic culture-sensitivity reports of patients admitted to a surgical ICU were prospectively studied for 6 months each of 3 consecutive years. The antibiotic usage for these patients also was studied concurrently. Reports from general surgical wards for 6 months of 1 year also were analyzed for comparison. The common specimens assayed microbiologically were tracheal aspirate, urine, blood, wound swabs, invasive catheter tips, and screening swabs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: The organisms reported were Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas species, S aureus, and enterococci. Organisms were highly resistant to amoxicillin and first-generation cephalosporins because of the wide use of these drugs in the hospital. Pseudomonas species showed a 25% increase in resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam and an 18% increase to ciprofloxacin, which was correlated with the increased use of these antimicrobial agents (82% and 200% increases, respectively) in the unit during the 3 years. There was no increase in the resistance to ceftazidime because it is used less often. The resistance to ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ceftazidime was significantly greater in the ICU than in the general surgical wards in the same study period. CONCLUSIONS: The study provided data of antimicrobial resistance in a developing country with tourism as the main industry for epidemiologic comparison with other countries.
