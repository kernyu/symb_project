Orificial tuberculosis (OTB) is a rare form of cutaneous Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection affecting the mucosa and skin around orifices in patients with advanced internal tuberculosis and poor general health. We report a 72-year-old Chinese man who had a 10-year history of OTB with disseminated tuberculosis infection of the lungs and urinary tract. He appeared surprisingly healthy and had been free from systemic symptoms all along despite widespread tuberculosis. The diagnosis of OTB was established by the microscopic presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the tissue section and was rapidly confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be Mycobacterium tuberculosis. PCR shortens the time of diagnosing rare presentations of cutaneous tuberculosis and prevents delays in treatment. Conventional culture is still important in confirming the diagnosis and screening for drug resistance.
