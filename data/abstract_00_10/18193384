Streptococcus agalactiae, commonly referred as group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a major cause of neonatal sepsis and infections in pregnant women. However, the number of invasive infections in non-pregnant adults is growing. Elderly patients and those with chronic underlying conditions, such as diabetes mellitus or compromised immune defence, are at increased risk of invasion. The spectrum of clinical manifestations is broad and includes necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. Although, primary bacteremia and skin and soft-tissue infections are the most frequently reported diagnosis. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment of invasive GBS disease in non-pregnant adults, with an emphasis on skin and soft-tissue infections.
