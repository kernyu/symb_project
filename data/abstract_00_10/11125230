The choice of antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of bacteremia is often empirical and based on the knowledge of susceptibility profiles of the most common bacteria. We analyzed blood culture isolates from a teaching hospital for 13 years prospectively. This study examined the susceptibility profiles of 6,616 gram-negative bacteria. Escherichia coli ranked among the commonest bacteria, representing 43.6% (2,890) of all gram-negative isolates. Klebsiella sp. ranked second, 17.7% (1,171) and 16.7% were resistant to ceftazidime in 1997. There was a trend towards an increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones in the common gram-negative bacteria. Imipenem was the most active agent against gram-negative bacteria. The results of the susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria causing bacteremia provide valuable information for implementing the appropriate chemotherapy for bacteremia.
