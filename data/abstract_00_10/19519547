Staphylococcus pasteuri is a coagulase-negative, Gram positive organism which is emerging as an agent of nosocomial infections and a blood derivatives contaminant, though its role in causing human disease mostly remains controversial. Despite the paucity of isolates recovered, this bacterium has recently appeared to express resistance against several classes of antibiotic compounds, such as methicillin/oxacillin, macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, fosfomycin, as well as quaternary ammonium compounds. Also, authors will discuss some essential patents related to the topic reviewed.
