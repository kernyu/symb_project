In order to improve the efficiency of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) transformation, two different selection systems were assessed, a positive one based on the use of mannose as the selective agent, and a negative one based on hygromycin resistance encoded by an intron-containing hph gene. Transgenic plants selected on mannose or hygromycin were regenerated for the first time from embryogenic suspensions cocultivated with Agrobacterium. After the initial selection using mannose and hygromycin, 82.6% and 100% of the respective developing embryogenic callus lines were transgenic. A system allowing plant regeneration from only transgenic lines was designed by combining chemical selection with histochemical GUS assays. In total, 12 morphologically normal transgenic plant lines were produced, five using mannose and seven using hygromycin. The stable integration of the transgenes into the nuclear genome was verified using PCR and Southern analysis. RT-PCR and northern analyses confirmed the transgene expression in the regenerated plants. A rooting test on mannose containing medium was developed as an alternative to GUS assays in order to eliminate escapes from the positive selection system. Our results show that transgenic cassava plants can be obtained by using either antibiotic resistance genes that are not expressed in the micro-organisms or an antibiotic-free positive selection system.
