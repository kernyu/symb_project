The species pattern and antibiotic resistance of gramnegative isolates from patients with nosocomial infections in Minsk ICUs were studied. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were the main pathogens, highly resistant to the antibiotics used. Imipenem, meropenem, polymyxin B, ampicillin/sulbactam, amikacin and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most active antimicrobials against the isolates. The choice of antimicrobials for empirical therapy of hospital infections in ICUs should be based on the local situation regarding the antibiotic resistance, that makes it obligatory to use regular microbiological monitoring in all hospitals thus providing the policy of the use of antimicrobials in ICUs.
