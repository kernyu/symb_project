The response of male gonococcal urethritis to a single 250 mg dose of ciprofloxacin versus 500 mg was studied. Both regimens were given in combination with doxycycline in the context of the local syndromic management protocol. There was no significant difference in response between the regimens, inclusive/exclusive of tetracycline susceptible isolates. One patient in the 250 mg arm failed to respond clinically but was microbiologically cured and four patients in the 500 mg arm failed microbiologically but responded clinically. All four isolates had ciprofloxacin MICs </=0.007 mg/l.
