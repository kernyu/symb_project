This is the first report regarding isolation of Salmonella from cecum samples of buffaloes and pigs and characterization of the isolates in Laos. The organisms were isolated from 8% (4/50) of buffaloes and 76% (37/49) of pigs. In buffaloes, 3 animals harbored serotype 9,12: -:1,5, and 1 animal harbored both S. Derby and S. Javiana. In pigs, the most predominant serotypes were S. Derby (51%) followed by S. Anatum (45%), S. Weltevreden (15%) and S. Stanley (5%). The buffalo isolates were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested, whereas the pig isolates showed 10 resistance patterns to 1-5 antibiotics. Of the 59 pig isolates, the resistance rates to tetracycline, streptomycin, ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and nalidixic acid were 24%, 22%, 14%, 5%, 2%, 2% and 2%, respectively. The results suggest that pigs and buffaloes harbor Salmonella, with a higher prevalence especially in pigs, and all the isolates showed sensitivity to cefotaxime, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin.
