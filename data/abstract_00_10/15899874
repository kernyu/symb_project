5-Azacytidine- and 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR)-mediated reactivation of tumor suppressor genes silenced by promoter methylation has provided an alternate approach in cancer therapy. Despite the importance of epigenetic therapy, the mechanism of action of DNA-hypomethylating agents in vivo has not been completely elucidated. Here we report that among three functional DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), the maintenance methyltransferase, DNMT1, was rapidly degraded by the proteasomal pathway upon treatment of cells with these drugs. The 5-aza-CdR-induced degradation, which occurs in the nucleus, could be blocked by proteasomal inhibitors and required a functional ubiquitin-activating enzyme. The drug-induced degradation occurred even in the absence of DNA replication. Treatment of cells with other nucleoside analogs modified at C-5, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and 5-fluorocytidine, did not induce the degradation of DNMT1. Mutation of cysteine at the catalytic site of Dnmt1 (involved in the formation of a covalent intermediate with cytidine in DNA) to serine (CS) did not impede 5-aza-CdR-induced degradation. Neither the wild type nor the catalytic site mutant of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b was sensitive to 5-aza-CdR-mediated degradation. These results indicate that covalent bond formation between the enzyme and 5-aza-CdR-incorporated DNA is not essential for enzyme degradation. Mutation of the conserved KEN box, a targeting signal for proteasomal degradation, to AAA increased the basal level of Dnmt1 and blocked its degradation by 5-aza-CdR. Deletion of the catalytic domain increased the expression of Dnmt1 but did not confer resistance to 5-aza-CdR-induced degradation. Both the nuclear localization signal and the bromo-adjacent homology domain were essential for nuclear localization and for the 5-aza-CdR-mediated degradation of Dnmt1. Polyubiquitination of Dnmt1 in vivo and its stabilization upon treatment of cells with a proteasomal inhibitor indicate that the level of Dnmt1 is controlled by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of the substrate recognition component, Cdh1 but not Cdc20, of APC (anaphase-promoting complex)/cyclosome ubiquitin ligase reduced the level of Dnmt1 in both untreated and 5-aza-CdR-treated cells. In contrast, the depletion of Cdh1 with small interfering RNA increased the basal level of DNMT1 that blocked 5-aza-CdR-induced degradation. Dnmt1 interacted with Cdh1 and colocalized in the nucleus at discrete foci. Both Dnmt1 and Cdh1 were phosphorylated in vivo, but only Cdh1 was significantly dephosphorylated upon 5-aza-CdR treatment, suggesting its involvement in initiating the proteasomal degradation of DNMT1. These results demonstrate a unique mechanism for the selective degradation of DNMT1, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, by well-known DNA-hypomethylating agents.
