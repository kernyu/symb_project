Rates of hernia recurrence following repair of abdominal wall hernia defects have been shown to be lower when prosthetic biomaterials are used, but their presence may be associated with a higher rate of infectious complications. Traditional surgical teaching has advocated removal of contaminated or exposed prosthetics, although the morbidity of these revisions is high. The case presented involves a ventral hernia repair complicated by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and exposed polytetrafluoroethylene mesh. The open abdominal wound was successfully managed with a combination of intravenous antibiotics, local wound debridement, vacuum-assisted closure, and soft tissue coverage of the mesh. Eighteen months following surgical closure of the wound, no hernia recurrence or infection was evident.
