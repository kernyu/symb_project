A real-time PCR genotypic assay was developed for the detection of isoniazid (INH) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The assay detects mutations C(-15)T and, possibly, G(-24)T in the regulatory region of the inhA gene and proved as sensitive and specific as nucleotide sequencing in all the clinical isolates tested. Our assays mapped the mutations efficiently in 10 out of 35 resistant isolates, thereby covering 29% of all resistant strains.
