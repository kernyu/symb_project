The aim of this study was to produce hydrogels for topical use and having strengthened anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antirheumatic activity. To obtain the above effect dry standardized plant extract was added to enrich a formulation containing therapeutic agent (ketoprofen) from the group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Dry standardized extract from Solidago virgaurea L. of confirmed anti-inflammatory activity was selected for this purpose. The derivatives of acrylic acid polymers (Carbopol Ultrez and Carbopol 980) were used as the formulation vehicles. These vehicles were selected owing to their high applicative properties--transparency, resistance to changes of temperature, perfect tactile and esthetic qualities, no sensitizing agents, no toxicity and lack of influence on therapeutic properties of the therapeutic agent and compatibility in the pharmaceutical phase. The produced formulations were exposed to basic physicochemical tests--pH, viscosity parameters (structural viscosity, yield stress and thixotropy), pharmaceutical availability and durability after six months of storage. The effect of component plant extracts on the process of ketoprofen diffusion to acceptor fluid through a semipermeable membrane was also compared. The obtained results indicate that dry standardized extract from Solidago virgaurea L. does not affect significantly the process of ketoprofen release from the tested preparations. After six months of storage the preparations with ketoprofen demonstrate rheological stability and high pharmaceutical availability.
