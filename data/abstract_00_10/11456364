During the past decade, yeast infections have had an important role in nosocomial infections due to alterations in the immune status of patients. Coincidentally with the increased usage of antifungal agents, the number of reports of drug resistance has increased, which highlights the need for understanding the molecular mechanisms of antifungal agent resistance. This review describes the mechanisms of action of antifungal agents, cellular factors contributing to drug resistance, the known molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, and proposed but unproved molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. This review also proposes possible strategies for preventing drug resistance.
