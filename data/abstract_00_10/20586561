On 10-13 April 2010, the 20th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) took place in Vienna, Austria. The scientific program touched a wide range of issues, some controversial, in the fields of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases. Particular attention was dedicated to modern aspects in research methodology, the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoints and methods, infection control programs, antibiotic stewardship and new therapeutic challenges for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This year ECCMID attracted more than 7000 delegates from 98 countries all over Europe and beyond. The participation of a such significant number of scientists presented a unique opportunity for discussion on several clinical and research topics.
