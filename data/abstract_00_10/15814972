To understand the Candida colonization of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected outpatients in Taiwan, we have conducted a prospective cohort study of Candida colonization and its risk factors at the National Taiwan University Hospital from 1999 to 2002. More than 50% of the patients were colonized with Candida species, and 12% developed symptomatic candidiasis. Patients colonized with fluconazole-resistant strains of Candida species had a higher prevalence of candidiasis than those colonized with susceptible strains. Our analysis found that antibiotic treatment and lower CD4(+) counts (<200 cells/mm(3)) increased the rate of oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients, while antiretroviral therapy protected patients from the development of candidiasis.
