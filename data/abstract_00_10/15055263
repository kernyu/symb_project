Linezolid is a member of the new class of antibacterial agents called oxazolidinones that are active against Gram positive organisms and exert their action by protein synthesis inhibition. In this study we investigated the in vitro activity of linezolid versus the other agent against clinical strains of staphylococci: Staphylococcus aureus (n = 82) and S. epidermidis (n = 32) collected in 2002 from hospitalized patients and healthy individuals, isolated from different biological samples. Agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by using Mueller-Hinton agar according to the guidelines established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Linezolid demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against all isolates tested, with MICs values in the range of susceptibility (< or = 8 microg/ml). No associated resistance between linezolid and other agents tested was observed. The resistance among Gram positive bacteria continues to spread and for many patients infected with these resistant organisms antimicrobial therapy is ineffective and linezolid may be a new alternative treatment.
