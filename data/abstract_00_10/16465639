We reviewed the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of 3 cases of chest tube-related empyema due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Antiseptic-impregnated chest tubes were inserted in cultures containing MRSA isolates from these 3 patients, and zone of inhibition were measured. Chest tube-related MRSA empyema might complicate tube thoracostomy, and coating the chest tube with antiseptic agents could prevent this complication.
