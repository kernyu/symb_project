SETTING: New York City (NYC). OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which prior tuberculosis (TB) treatment, length of residence in the United States and other factors are associated with the occurrence of drug resistance among non-US-born persons in NYC. DESIGN: Cases were non-US-born persons diagnosed with TB in NYC from 1998-1999 and from 2001-2002, with an initial Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate resistant to any first-line anti-tuberculosis drug. Controls were randomly selected from non-US-born persons whose isolates were susceptible to all first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. RESULTS: Overall, cases with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB were more likely to have had prior TB treatment; other drug resistance was not associated with prior TB treatment. In a multivariate model, the relationship between MDR-TB and prior treatment remained significant for non-US-born persons regardless of length of time in the U.S. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the utility of monitoring trends in drug resistance among the non-US-born by time in the US and prior treatment to determine where or when drug resistance may be occurring.
