BACKGROUND/AIMS: Periodontal infections with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans seem to be refractory to conventional therapy. The aim of the present study was to test the in vitro susceptibilities of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains to a panel of seven orally administrable antibiotics. METHODS: A total of 60 isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans recovered from 43 individuals with gingivitis or periodontitis were tested. In addition, laboratory strains UP-6 and JP2 were analysed. The E-test was employed in order to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics ampicillin/sulbactam, roxithromycin, azithromycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans was highly susceptible to both fluoro-quinolones (MIC90 of 0.006 microgram/mL of ciprofloxacin and 0.032 microgram/mL of moxifloxacin). Good susceptibilities were found for ampicillin/sulbactam and doxycycline (MIC90 of 0.75 microgram/mL and 1 microgram/mL, respectively), and moderate susceptibilities for azithromycin (MIC90 of 3 microgram/mL). Most strains were resistant to metronidazole and roxithromycin. Cluster analysis revealed two larger clusters of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains with the smaller cluster assembling isolates with significantly higher MICs of most antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Due to reported favourable pharmacokinetics, the fluoro-quinolone moxifloxacin appeared to be a promising candidate for adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy in periodontal infections with A. actinomycetemcomitans.
