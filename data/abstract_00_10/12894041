The pattern of aerobic bacteria with their antibiotic susceptibility isolated from infected patients in one of the surgical units at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital during the period from September to November' 2000 were reported in the present study. Out of 74 clinical samples, 52 were wound swabs, 18 were pus and 4 were urine. Bacterial growth was yielded in 43 samples and the distribution of isolates was as follows: Pseudomonas spp 16, Esch.coli 13, Staphylococcus aureus 08, Klebsiella spp. 03 and others 03. Majority (61.5 %) of culture positive results were found in wound swabs. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern showed considerable variation within Gram negative bacterial isolates. All the Esch.coli and Klebsiella isolates were resistant to amoxicillin. Ceftriaxone (65.6% and 100% respectively) and ciprofloxacin (71.4% and 100%) still appeared to be highly sensitive for both species. Over 93% strains of Pseudomonas were sensitive to Ceftazidime and aztreonam. Whereas, over 43% of same strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Over 87% strains of Staph.aureus were resistant to penicillin but sensitive to erythromycin. Whereas, 100% of those strains were sensitive to cloxacillin. Over 50% of all isolates were sensitive to gentamicin but resistant to cefalexin and cotrimoxazole. It was suggested to be careful regarding selection of antibiotic regime in surgical cases to minimize incoming higher magnitude of drug resistance among bacteria in near future.
