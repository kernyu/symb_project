The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of ertapenem and other antimicrobials against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacteria isolated from patients' urine samples at 4 community healthcare centers in the Madrid (Spain) area and to determine the prevalence of ESBL-producing enterobacteria in community-acquired urinary tract infections. The antibiotic susceptibility results were compared by patient age and sex. A total of 293 strains were studied. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each antibiotic was determined using the agar dilution method. The tested carbapenems were the antibiotics with the greatest activity (ertapenem MIC(90)=0.06 mg/l; imipenem MIC(90)=0.5 mg/l), with no intermediate or resistant strains being observed. High rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin (80.9%) and cotrimoxazole were observed (62.1%). The global prevalence of ESBL-producing enterobacteria was 3.6% (293/8,139). Prevalence according to areas was 5.3% in Getafe, 3.45% in Arguelles, 3.02% in Alcala de Henares and 3.56% in Mostoles. The global prevalence of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli was 4.15% (279/6,721). The analysis of resistance according to patient sex (males versus females) showed no significant differences. The analysis of resistance according to patient age (<50 years versus > or = 50 years) showed statistically significant differences (more resistance among subjects > or = 50 years old) for cotrimoxazole (OR=0.43, 95%CI: 0.20-0.93, p=0.018) and ciprofloxacin (OR=0.32, 95%CI: 0.14-0.74, p=0.0027). In view of the good activity shown by ertapenem, and the continuous increase in the prevalence of ESBL strains, this antibiotic and some of the others could be a good choice for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections produced by such bacteria in Spain.
