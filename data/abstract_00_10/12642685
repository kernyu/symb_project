We and others have previously described that the androgen-responsive human prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCaP is resistant to TRAIL and that TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP is PI3K/Akt-dependent. In this study, we found that LNCaP remained resistant to treatment with TRAIL after androgen deprivation even in the presence of the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor wortmannin. This resistance was determined by failure to form the TRAIL-DISC and by decreased TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 levels after androgen deprivation; the capacity of TRAIL to induce DISC formation was completely restored in the presence of DHT. TRAIL and wortmannin together accelerated processing of caspase-8 on the DISC and apparently the release of caspase-8 from the DISC into the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, we found that wortmannin decreased the total amount of TRAIL-R1, but not TRAIL-R2, in the cells as well as the amount of TRAIL-R1 precipitated by TRAIL. Our data suggest that TRAIL-DISC formation and sensitivity to TRAIL treatment are androgen-dependent in LNCaP.
