K103N is frequently detected in HIV-infected women after single dose (SD) nevirapine (NVP). K103N-containing variants were detected more frequently by the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System in women with subtype C (69.2%) than subtypes A (19.4%, p < 0.0001) or D (36.1%, p < 0.0001). K103N-containing variants were also detected more frequently and at higher levels in women with subtype C by the LigAmp assay. In this report, we analyzed samples collected prior to or within hours after SD NVP administration from antiretroviral drug-naive African women with subtypes A, C, and D. Only 1/254 samples had an NVP resistance mutation detected with the ViroSeq system, and only 4/236 samples had K103N detected at < 0.5% with the LigAmp assay [2/110 (1.8%) with subtype A, 1/46 (2.2%) with subtype C, and 1/80 (1.3%) with subtype D] (p = 0.92). We did not detect significant differences in the pre-NVP frequency of NVP resistance mutations or the pre-NVP levels of K103N-containing variants in women with subtypes A, C, and D that explain the dramatic subtype-based differences in emergence of HIV-1 variants with these mutations after SD NVP exposure.
