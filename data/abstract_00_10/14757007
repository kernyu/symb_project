Atherosclerosis increases cardiovascular risk and the possibility of developing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or stroke. Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often present morphological and metabolic alterations (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, diabetes) that can increase vascular risk. The frequent coexistence of classic risk factors (atherogenic diet, smoking, physical inactivity, cocaine abuse), the progressive increase in mean age of HIV-1 infected patients, and the polymedication they receive make it difficult to estimate the direct effect that new therapies may have on cardiovascular risk. Retrospective clinical studies with diverse designs in large cohorts offer contradictory results for cardiovascular risk in the HIV-infected population. Longer observational periods are needed and the effect of other classic risk factors needs to be controlled, in order to establish the possible detrimental effect the new therapies may have on cardiovascular risk in this population.
