A major barrier to the long-term use of medical devices is development of infection. Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most common bacterial isolates from these infections with biofilm formation being their main virulence factor. Currently, antibiotics are used as the main form of therapy. However with the emergence of staphylococcal resistance, this form of therapy is fast becoming ineffective. In this study, the ability of a novel furanone antimicrobial compound to inhibit S. epidermidis adhesion and slime production on biomaterials was assessed. Furanones were physically adsorbed to various biomaterials and bacterial load determined using radioactivity. Slime production was assessed using a colorimetric method. Additionally, the effect of the furanone coating on material surface characteristics such as hydrophobicity and surface roughness was also investigated. The results of this study indicated that there was no significant change in the material characteristics after furanone coating. Bacterial load on all furanone-coated materials was significantly reduced (p<0.001) as was slime production (p<0.001). There is a potential for furanone-coated biomaterials to be used to reduce medical device-associated infections.
