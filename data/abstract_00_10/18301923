This paper presents the first report of anthelmintic resistance (AR) in dairy goats in a desert (Pakistan). Three breeds of dairy goats, i.e. Dera Din Panah, Pak Angora and Beetal, kept at Government Livestock Farm, Rakh Khairewala, district Jhang/Layya, Pakistan, were surveyed for gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) resistant to commonly used three anthelmintics, i.e. benzimidazole, levamisole and ivermectin. Sixty animals of each breed were selected randomly on the basis of their weight and egg count. Three commonly used anthelmintics, viz., oxfendazole (three different preparations of oxfendazole: fendamex, oxazole, systamex), levamisole and ivermectin, were given at the recommended dose to five groups while one untreated group was kept as control for each breed. Faecal egg counts, faecal egg count reduction test, postmortem worm count and copro-culture were performed to assess the efficacy of selected anthelmintics. The prevalent species of GINs exhibited resistance against all three preparations of oxfendazole. Levamisole in two breeds and ivermectin in all the breeds led to reduction (P< or =0.05) of prevalent species of GINs in both flocks. Haemonchus controtus and Trichostrongylus species exhibited the presence of resistance against oxfendazole preparations which exhibited low efficacy (P> or =0.05). The farm management practices along with the results of the present study revealed the presence of multiple anthelmintic resistant GINs of dairy goats kept in a desolated tract.
