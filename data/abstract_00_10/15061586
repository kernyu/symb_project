Infection by HIV-1 is characterized by genetic diversity wherein distinct viral subtypes (clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, K and O) are expanding in different geographic regions. With respect to HIV-1 sensitivity to antiretroviral drugs and drug resistance, increasing evidence suggests that all clades probably display similar sensitivity to antiviral drugs, but viruses from some subtypes and geographic regions have a greater propensity than other viral variants to develop resistance to certain drugs. There is an urgency to make anti-HIV drugs available to all who are in need, regardless of ability to pay.
