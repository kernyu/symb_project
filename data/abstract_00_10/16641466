Erythromycin (EM) and clindamycin (CM) susceptibility testing was performed on 222 clinical isolates of group B Streptococcus. A multiplex PCR assay was used to detect the ermB, ermTR, and mefA/E antibiotic resistance genes. These results were compared to the phenotypes as determined by the standard EM/CM double disk diffusion assay.
