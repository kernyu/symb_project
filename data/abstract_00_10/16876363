Optimal antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains controversial. The clinical impact of S. pneumoniae resistance to macrolides is well documented. By contrast high dosage amoxicillin (1 g tid) remains active against such strains and no failure has been reported. The aim of this paper was to review clinical trials in community-acquired pneumonia, published from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2005. One hundred seventy-three articles were collected, using Medline, 35 of which were analyzed, and 16 finally used. Telithromycin and pristinamycin may be used in mild to moderate CAP. Anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin may be used in at risk patients, but levofloxacin has only been investigated in patients with severe CAP and patients with Legionnaire's disease. Amoxicillin 1 g tid remains the drug of choice for pneumococcal CAP.
