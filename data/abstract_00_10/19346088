OBJECTIVE: A one-year prospective, observational study was conducted in the west of France, to evaluate the epidemiology of candidemia. METHOD: During the year 2004, each patient with at least one blood culture yielding Candida sp. was included. For each episode of candidemia, mycological, demographical, clinical, and therapeutic data, as well as outcome, were collected. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-three strains of Candida sp. were isolated in 186 patients, Candida albicans accounting for 54.9%, Candida glabrata for 18.7%, Candida parapsilosis for 12.9%, Candida tropicalis for 4.7% and Candida krusei for 4.1% of these isolates. A percentage of 84% of the Candida isolates were fully susceptible to fluconazole in vitro. Dose-dependent susceptibility or resistance to fluconazole was detected in more than one third of the Candida glabrata strains, of which 36% were also resistant to voriconazole. Two-thirds of the patients were males, and the mean age was 61.5 years. A percentage of 37% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units. The main predisposing factors for candidemia were broad-spectrum antibiotics (75.8%), central venous catheter (72.6%), cancer or hematologic malignancy (47.3%), recent surgery (42.5%), total parenteral nutrition (37.6%). One hundred and fifty-four patients were treated with antifungal therapy, two-thirds of whom received fluconazole as first-line agent. Mortality was 49% overall, and was significantly higher in case of septic shock, advanced age, and absence of catheter removal.
