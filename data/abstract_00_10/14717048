The case reports about the neurological sides effects of amodiaquine are scare, and just a few of them concerned the children. But more and more, amodiaquine is prescribed because of the resistance of Plasmodium in front of chloroquine. And, in the endemic area of malaria, there are more and more neurological side effects with amodiaquine among the children. From a retrospective study, from January 1998 to June 2000, the authors described 35 case reports of children aged from 5 months to 15 years who presented neurological side effects after taking amodiaquine in endemic malarial area. The aim of this study is, first to inform the pediatricians in our area about these side effects, as they are not mentioned in therapeutic guides. Second, it shows that it is not exceptional in the endemic area of malaria.
