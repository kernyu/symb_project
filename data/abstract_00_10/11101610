The source of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during HIV-1 infection is uncertain. The sequence heterogeneity of HIV-1 RNA in simultaneous CSF and plasma samples was characterized for five patients at the baseline and during the first week of antiretroviral therapy by two commercial genotyping methodologies. In individual subjects, the sequences in CSF samples differed significantly from those in plasma. In contrast, the viral sequences in CSF at the baseline did not differ from the sequences in CSF during treatment. Similarly, viral sequences in plasma did not vary over this interval. This study provides evidence that HIV-1 RNA in CSF and plasma arise from distinct compartments.
