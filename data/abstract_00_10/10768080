Early recognition of the sepsis syndrome, prompt administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, surgical intervention when indicated, and aggressive supportive care in intensive care units remain the therapeutic strategies for patients with sepsis. Antibiotic selection is based on many factors including the most probable source of infection, the most likely pathogens, and knowledge of antibiotic susceptibility patterns for community- and hospital-acquired infections. Unfortunately, with this approach, mortality remains unacceptably high. Adjuvant therapies such as antiendotoxin antibodies, cytokine antagonists, and anti-inflammatory agents aimed at blunting the host immune response to bacterial infection have provided little clinical benefit to date. As our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis progresses, perhaps newer modalities will improve clinical outcome. At this time, preventive strategies, including optimal vaccine use, effective infection control practices, judicious use and care of intravascular lines and indwelling urinary catheters, and appropriate use of anti-infective agents to prevent microbial resistance should be used to decrease the incidence of infection and subsequent sepsis.
