Tigecycline is the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved glycylcycline antibiotic. It has shown remarkable in vitro activity against a wide variety of gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria including many multidrug resistant (MDR) strains. However, it has minimal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp. To date, little resistance to tigecycline has been reported. Clinical trials studying complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs) demonstrated that tigecycline has equivalent efficacy and safety compared with the combination of vancomycin and aztreonam. For complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), tigecycline was found to be as effective as imipenem/cilastatin. Adverse events related to tigecycline therapy, i.e. nausea and vomiting, were tolerable. Currently available data suggest that tigecycline may play an important role in the future as a monotherapy alternative to older broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as advanced generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gram-positive directed agents (e.g. daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin) for which resistance is being increasingly reported from all parts of the world.
