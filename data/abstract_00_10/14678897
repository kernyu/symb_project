OBJECTIVE: To understand the molecular and genetic mechanism underlying fluconazole resistance in Candida albicans by PCR fingerprinting with M13 primer. METHODS: Paper disc diffusion method was employed for assay of fluconazole resistance in 41 clinical isolates of Candida albicans, followed by PCR fingerprinting with M13 primer to study the gel patterns with cluster analysis using neighbor joining (NJ) method performed with RAPD200 software. RESULTS: Of the 41 clinical isolates, 11 strains (26.8%) were fluconazole-sensitive, 8 (19.5%) fluconazole-dependent and 22 (53.7%) fluconazole-resistance. Two to twelve bands could be observed among these strains, and the gel patterns revealed by cluster analysis were associated with the reactions of the strains against fluconazole and the location of infection. CONCLUSION: There is high prevalence of fluconazole resistance in clinical Candida albicans isolates, and PCR fingerprinting with M13 primer is convenient for assay of fluconazole resistance and molecular epidemiological study of Candida albicans.
