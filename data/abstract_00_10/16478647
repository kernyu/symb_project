Metastatic liver tumors are highly malignant and refractory to conventional therapies. TRAIL-resistant CT-26 cells underwent apoptosis in vitro in the presence of both recombinant TRAIL (rTRAIL) and a suboptimal dose of actinomycin D (ACD). Co-administration of soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL) gene and ACD suppressed the metastatic liver tumors of CT-26, significantly inducing apoptosis in the tumors, while such effects were not demonstrated in mice that received either the sTRAIL gene or ACD alone. The gene therapy of sTRAIL with a suboptimal dose of an anticancer drug is a new strategy for treatment of multiple liver metastasis.
