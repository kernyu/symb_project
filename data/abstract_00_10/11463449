A major deletion of the region proximal to the rearranged ABL gene on 9q was found in 14/94 (15%) of chronic myelogenous leukemia Philadelphia-positive patients by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization with the BCR/ABL extra signal dual-color probe. Preliminary results indicated that the prognosis of the deletion 9q patients is probably worse than that of the non-deletion 9q patients. Twelve of the 14 deletion 9q patients were treated with alpha-interferon and none had a major cytogenetic response. The median duration of the chronic phase in patients not undergoing BMT was significantly shorter for the deletion 9q patients as compared to the non-deletion 9q patients (p =.0144). DNA microarray technology was performed in order to compare the gene expression patterns between the two groups of patients. A number of genes exhibiting differential expression, especially involving cell adhesion and migration, were identified. This finding may identify a sub-group of CML patients with different cell properties and a relatively poor prognosis.
