Many different cell populations or lineages participate in the resistance to Trypanosoma cruzi infection. gammadelta T cells may also take part in a network of interactions that lead to control of T. cruzi infection with minimal tissue damage by controlling alphabeta T cell activation, as was previously suggested. However, the gammadelta T cell population is not homogeneous and its functions might vary, depending on T cell receptor usage or distinct stimulatory conditions. In this study, we show that the in vivo depletion of V gamma 1-bearing gammadelta T cells, prior to the infection of BALB/c mice with the Y strain of T. cruzi, induces an increased susceptibility to the infection with lower amounts of IFN-gamma being produced by conventional CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. In addition, the production of IL-4 by spleen T cells in V gamma 1-depleted mice was increased and the production of IL-10 remained unchanged. Since V gamma 1(+) gammadelta T cell depletion diminished the conversion of naive to memory/activated CD4 T cells and the production of IFN-gamma during the acute infection, these cells appear to function as helper cells for conventional CD4+ Th1 cells. Depletion of V gamma 1(+) cells also reduced the infection-induced inflammatory infiltrate in the heart and skeletal muscle. More importantly, V gamma 1(+) cells were required for up-regulation of CD40L in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during infection. These results show that a subset of gammadelta T cells (V gamma 1(+)), which is an important component of the innate immune response, up-regulates the type 1 arm of the adaptative immune response, during T. cruzi infection.
