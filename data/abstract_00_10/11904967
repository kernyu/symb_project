Recently, monoclonal antibody(MoAb) therapies which direct at antigens such as CD33, CD45 and GM-CSF receptors on myeloid leukemia cells have been in progress. There are three major MoAb therapies against acute myeloid leukemia(AML), which include unconjugated MoAb, MoAb conjugated with chemotherapy or toxins, and MoAb conjugated with radioisotopes. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is consisting of an engineered human anti-CD33 antibody linked with the potent anti-tumor antibiotic calicheamicin, which is the most effective for AML. However, recent studies suggested that calicheamicin was also pumped out by multi-drug resistance(MDR) related P-glycoprotein. The combination therapy with MDR modifiers may improve the effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
