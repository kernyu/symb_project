In Deinococcus radiodurans, there is a unique RecQ homolog (DR1289) with three-tandem HRDC domains. Deletion of drrecQ resulted in a low doubling rate and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Here, we used cDNA microarray and biochemical assays to explore the physiological changes in the drrecQ mutant. The expressions of genes with predicted functions involved in iron homeostasis, antioxidant system, electron transport, and energy metabolism were significantly altered in response to drrecQ disruption. More reactive oxygen species (ROS) was accumulated in drrecQ mutant strain when compared to wild type. In addition, ICP-MS results showed that the intracellular level of iron was relatively higher, whereas the concentration of manganese was lower in drrecQ mutant than in wild type. Furthermore, our microarray data and pulsed-field gel results showed that DNA suffered more damage in drrecQ mutant than in wild type under 20 mM hydrogen peroxide stress. These results suggested that drrecQ is a gene of pleiotropic functions and contributes to the extraordinary resistance of D. radiodurans against stresses.
