The antimicrobial susceptibility of 240 isolates from the ophthalmological infections during July 2003 to March 2004 was determined to gatifloxacin (GFLX), levofloxacin, lomefloxacin and cefmenoxime applicable for ophthalmological infections. The in vitro activities of these drugs against the fresh isolates were compared. The quinolones including GFLX were potently active against Gram-positive bacteria, except for MRSA, a major causative pathogens for ophthalmological infection. When MIC ranges, MIC50 and MIC90 of three quinolones were compared, it was considered that the activity of GFLX was the most active of them. GFLX showed to be more active against opportunistic pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa than other antimicrobial agents, and GFLX was especially potent against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. In conclusion, GFLX exhibits a potently active against fresh isolates from ophthalmological infections, and has an effective potential in the treatment of ophthalmological infections with the drug to administer eye drops.
