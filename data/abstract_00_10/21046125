BACKGROUND: Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) present in macrophages has been implicated in the integration of lipid metabolism and inflammatory response, contributing to development of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the role of fatty acids in the inflammatory pathways is mediated through the modulation of A-FABP expression in macrophages. METHODS: Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with inflammatory insults and fatty acids for quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. The cells were treated with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for elucidating mechanisms for the regulation of A-FABP expression by fatty acids. RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down A-FABP was utilized to assess its role in inflammatory gene expression. RESULTS: When RAW 264.7 were incubated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 100 ng/ml) or 2.5 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor alpha for 18 h, A-FABP mRNA and protein levels were drastically increased. Unsaturated fatty acids (100 mumol/l in complexed with BSA) such as palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid, significantly repressed the basal as well as LPS-induced A-FABP expression, whereas palmitic acid did not elicit the same effect. TSA increased A-FABP mRNA levels and abolished the repressive effect of linoleic acid on A-FABP expression in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Depletion of A-FABP expression by 70-80% using RNAi markedly decreased cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA abundance and potentiated the repression by linoleic acid. CONCLUSION: Unsaturated fatty acids inhibited the basal as well as LPS-induced A-FABP expression. The mechanism may involve histone deacetylation and anti-inflammatory effect of unsaturated fatty acids may be at least in part attributed to their repression of A-FABP expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
