HIV infection starts as an acute, systemic infection, followed by a chronic period of clinical latency, usually lasting 3 to 10 years, which precedes the eventual collapse of the immune system. It is increasingly recognized that events occurring during acute HIV infection may determine the natural course of the disease. The very dynamic events of acute HIV infection provide multiple opportunities for biologic interventions, such as anti-retroviral or immune-based therapies. Similarly, the implementation of public health measures during acute HIV infection could help control epidemics or outbreaks. Many of the dramatic possibilities for intervention in acute HIV infection remain unproved, not the least because of traditional difficulty of diagnosing patients during this early period. This article reviews the natural history, pathogenesis and clinical presentation of acute HIV infection, and suggests a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to guide clinicians dealing with patients with suspected or confirmed acute HIV infection.
