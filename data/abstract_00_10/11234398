Low-molecular-weight water-soluble chitosan with a molecular weight of 5 kDa obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis of native crab chitosan was shown to display an elicitor activity by inducing the local and systemic resistance of Solanumi tuberosum potato and Lycopesicon esculentum tomato to Phytophthora infestans and nematodes, respectively. Chitosan induced the accumulation of phytoalexins in tissues of host plants, decreased the total content and changed the composition of free sterols producing adverse effects on infesters, activated chitinases, beta-glucanases, and lipoxygenases, and stimulated the generation of reactive oxygen species. The activation of protective mechanisms in plant tissues inhibited the growth of taxonomically different pathogens (parasitic fungus Phytophthora infestans and root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita).
