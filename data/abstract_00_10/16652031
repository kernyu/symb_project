BACKGROUND: Primary HIV drug resistance has been associated with poor treatment outcome of first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in several trials. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of first-line HAART guided by resistance testing. METHODS: In a prospective multicenter study in the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany, chronically HIV-infected patients underwent genotypic resistance testing and were monitored for 48 weeks after initiation of HAART. RESULTS: Primary drug resistance was found in 30 of 269 patients entering the study between January 2001 and December 2003 [11.2%; 95% confidence interval, 7.4-14.9]. In intent-to-treat analysis, the proportion of patients with viral load below 50 copies/mL after 24 and 48 weeks was 70.0% and 66.7%, respectively, in patients with resistance and 74.1% and 73.6%, respectively, in patients without (P = 0.66 and 0.51). In on-treatment analysis, the proportions were 80.8% and 83.3%, respectively, in patients with resistance and 81.9% and 85.0%, respectively, in patients without (P= 0.79 and 0.77). These results were also valid considering a detection limit of 400 copies/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of primary drug resistance was 11.2% in chronically HIV-infected patients. HAART guided by resistance testing had similar efficacy in patients with primary drug resistance as compared with patients with wild-type virus. Based on these facts, resistance-adapted first-line HAART is suggested as routine practice.
