Laboratory golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were infected with Necator americanus under several different parasite and host conditions to optimize the model for testing anthelminthic drugs. The results confirmed that male hamsters were more susceptible to infection than females. Host age in the range of 5-15 weeks was not a factor that impacted on adult worm burden, and similar worm burdens were achieved using doses of 150, 250 or 500 N. americanus L3 (NaL3). The largest numbers of adult hookworms were recovered on days 21-28 post-infection, with a significant decrease at days 40-50 post-infection. Therefore adult worm recovery is maximal approximately 11-18 days prior to patency and host blood loss. From these studies a drug evaluation protocol was developed using 150 NaL3 as the infectious dose and then evaluating the anthelminthic effects of the drugs albendazole, tribendimidine, and pyrantel pamoate on days 21-28 post-infection. The model confirms the anthelminthic activity of albendazole, tribendimidine, and pyrantel pamoate and has the potential as a laboratory animal model to detect emerging drug resistance.
