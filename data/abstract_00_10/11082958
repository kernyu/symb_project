OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to analyses the sensitivity of 73 randomly selected Candida albicans strains isolated from the vagina of pregnant and delivering women against seven basic antimycotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microtest FUNGITEST (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur) was applied in assessing the sensitivity of 5-fluorocytosin, amphotericin B, ketoconazol, fluconazol, itraconazol and miconazol and the disk-diffusion method with the use of a Casitone base for nystatin. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Variations in the sensitivity against drugs have been noted between individual strains of Candida albicans species. The largest number of strains was resistant against ketoconazol--56.16%, and only 10.96% was resistant against nystatin.
