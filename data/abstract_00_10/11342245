Bisphenol A is used as a monomer in the production of polycarbonate plastic products. The widespread use of bisphenol A has raised concerns about its effects in humans. Since there is little information on the mutagenic potential of the chemical, the mutagenicity of bisphenol A was tested using human RSa cells, which has been utilized for identification of novel mutagens. In genomic DNA from cells treated with bisphenol A at concentrations ranging from 1x10(-7) to 1x10(-5)M, base substitution mutations at K-ras codon 12 were detected using PCR and differential dot-blot hybridization with mutant probes. Mutations were also detected using the method of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-mediated PCR clamping. The latter method enabled us to detect the mutation in bisphenol A-treated cells at a dose (1x10(-8)M) equivalent to that typically found in the environment. Induction of ouabain-resistant (Oua(R)) phenotypic mutation was also found in cells treated with 1x10(-7) and 1x10(-5)M of bisphenol A. The induction of K-ras codon 12 mutations and Oua(R) mutations was suppressed by pretreating RSa cells with human interferon (HuIFN)-alpha prior to bisphenol A treatment. The cells treated with bisphenol A at the concentration of 1x10(-6)M elicited unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS). These findings suggested that bisphenol A has mutagenicity in RSa cells as well as mutagens that have been tested in these cells, and furthermore, that a combination of the PNA-mediated PCR clamping method with the human RSa cell line may be used as an assay system for screening the mutagenic chemicals at very low doses.
