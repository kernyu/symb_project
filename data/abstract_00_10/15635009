We evaluated a protocol for the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in gram-negative bloodstream pathogens. Two hundred eighty-three blood culture bottles were subjected to direct ESBL testing by inoculating samples directly from blood culture bottles onto agar plates containing cefotaxime and ceftazidime disks, with and without clavulanate. Standard ESBL testing in accordance with the NCCLS guidelines after subculturing on agar plates was performed in parallel. Results of the direct ESBL testing were reported 2.3 days sooner and were comparable to those of the standard NCCLS method with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100, 98, 94, and 100%, respectively.
