BACKGROUND: Double-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) are under investigation for the treatment of patients who are unable to take nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors because of cross-resistance and/or intolerance. Evidence of synergistic inhibition of wild-type HIV has been reported for saquinavir with atazanavir or lopinavir. METHODS: We investigated the activity of these two combinations against a panel of six site-directed mutant HIV-1 strains and 14 clinically derived recombinant HIV-1 strains presenting a range of PI-resistance profiles. RESULTS: No evidence of synergy was observed against wild-type virus for either combination. The combination of saquinavir and lopinavir showed evidence of synergy against four viruses displaying high-level resistance to lopinavir and low-level resistance to saquinavir. Similarly, evidence of synergy between saquinavir and atazanavir was only observed in two viruses which were more susceptible to saquinavir than to atazanavir. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that differences between the PIs in intracellular protein-binding behaviour or inhibition of drug transporters (P glycoprotein, MDR1 and MDR2) could result in intracellular levels of saquinavir being increased by co-administration with lopinavir or atazanavir. The effect of this increase would be masked in cases involving viruses that were susceptible to atazanavir or lopinavir. In virus resistant to lopinavir or atazanavir but susceptible to saquinavir, the majority of the antiviral effect is due to saquinavir; thus even small increases in intracellular concentration could significantly increase virus inhibition. These results confirm that in vitro synergy can be observed between PIs and suggest that the degree of synergy observed might depend on the resistance profile of the virus.
