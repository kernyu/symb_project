Cefepime is a 'fourth-generation' cephalosporin with an in vitro extended-spectrum of activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Cefepime is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe infections, such as pneumonia, uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections, skin and soft-tissue infections, intra-abdominal infections and febrile neutropenia. In this article, we provide a critical review of pharmacodynamics, clinical management, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, pharmacodynamic target analyses, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of cefepime after more than a decade of clinical use.
