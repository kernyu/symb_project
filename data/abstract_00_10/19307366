For 297 penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant pneumococcal strains, the sulopenem MIC(50)s were 0.008, 0.06, and 0.25, respectively, and the sulopenem MIC(90)s were 0.016, 0.25, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. The MIC(50)s of amoxicillin for the corresponding strains were 0.03, 0.25, and 2.0 microg/ml, respectively, and the MIC(90)s were 0.03, 1.0, and 8.0 microg/ml, respectively. The combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate gave MICs similar to those obtained with amoxicillin alone. The sulopenem MICs were similar to those of imipenem and meropenem. The MICs of ss-lactams increased with those of penicillin G, and among the quinolones tested, moxifloxacin had the lowest MICs. Additionally, 45 strains of drug-resistant type 19A pneumococci were tested by agar dilution and gave sulopenem MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s of 1.0 and 2.0 microg/ml, respectively. Both sulopenem and amoxicillin (with and without clavulanate) were bactericidal against all 12 strains tested at 2x MIC after 24 h. Thirty-one strains from 10 countries with various penicillin, amoxicillin, and carbapenems MICs, including those with the highest sulopenem MICs, were selected for sequencing analysis of the pbp1a, pbp2x, and pbp2b regions encoding the transpeptidase active site and MurM. We did not find any correlations between specific penicillin-binding protein-MurM patterns and changes in the MICs.
