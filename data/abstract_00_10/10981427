In 1996-1998, the Central Institute of Tuberculosis, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences performed more than 600 operations. Of them 90 (15%) patients isolated mycobacteria. The drug resistance of M. tuberculosis was found in 69 (76.7%) patients. In 60.9% of cases, the resistance of M. tuberculosis to isoniazid and rifampicin was concurrently accompanied by that to one (21.4%), two (61.0%), and even 3 (14.8%) tuberculostatics. Removal of the lung or its remnants in the extrapleural layer was most common (67.7%); thoracic cavernomyoplastic operations were made in 17.4% of cases, and partial resections accounted for only 13%. Postoperative complications were more frequently encountered in patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis than in controls (6.7%). Among them, tuberculosis progression and empyema were prevalent (13%). The clinical efficiency and duration of surgical treatment were directly related to the rates of progression and to the magnitude of drug-resistance of Mycobacteria.
