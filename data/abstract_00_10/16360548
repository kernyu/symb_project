This overview provides a summary of the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program over an 8-year period from 1997 to 2004. The evolution of the MYSTIC Program is described, as well as its design compared with other surveillance programs. In addition, the global MYSTIC Program data, published to date, are summarized, and the empiric use of carbapenems, their current indications, and meropenem usage versus resistance was discussed. From 1997 to 2004, 120 medical centers that were actively prescribing meropenem in 32 countries worldwide participated in the program. The MYSTIC Program results demonstrate the sustained potency and continued effectiveness of meropenem globally against clinically relevant Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens including extended spectrum beta-lactamase- and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing organisms, which may also display resistance to the fluoroquinolones and/or aminoglycosides. Furthermore, in centers actively prescribing meropenem, resistance to meropenem is not increasing despite greater resistance among the comparator antimicrobial agents. Thus, antipseudomonal carbapenems such as meropenem and imipenem remain an effective treatment option.
