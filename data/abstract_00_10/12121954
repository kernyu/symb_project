Among 585 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated in 22 Croatian hospitals 21 strains (3.6%) were quinolone nonsusceptible. MICs of all quinolones were high for seven strains tested with the same serotype (23F) and mutations in gyrA, parC, and parE. The remaining 14 strains were more heterogeneous and had mutations only in parC and/or parE, and the MICs of quinolones were lower for these strains.
