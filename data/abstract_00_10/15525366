Antimicrobials are essential for treatment of sick animals, but even if used correctly, may eventually lead to antimicrobial resistance. While this represents a potential hazard to humans, the great majority of resistant human pathogens, especially the more important ones, are unrelated to animal sources. A survey of informed medical opinion suggested that of the human antimicrobial resistance problem, <4% was seen as potentially linked to animal sources. This proportion related largely to zoonotic bacteria which by definition have the capacity to carry resistance between species, although the evidence for resulting harm remains limited. A recent study compared resistance among chicken, pig and cattle isolates of Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Escherichia coli from a series of EU countries. When tested against antimicrobial agents, this survey showed variation of resistance between countries, between hosts and between organisms. Such variation may give insight into preferred methods of antimicrobial administration or disease control, but it is clear that the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance induction and dissemination in animals remains complex and is yet to be fully understood.
