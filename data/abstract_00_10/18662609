The HBV genome variability is responsible for the complexitiy of the viral quasi-species and its evolution during the course of the infection. During antiviral therapy, the persistence of infected cells is another important determinant involved in the selection of drug resistant strains. The development of nucleoside analogs with complementary resistance profiles has provided the rationale for add-on strategies in case of virologic breakthrough. The current trend is to add antivirals earlier, before the rebound of viral load, especially in case of partial virologic response. Clinical trials are required to determine if a de novo combination of nucleoside analogs provides an added benefit compared to an early add-on strategy. However, de novo combination is recommended in patients whose liver functions cannot tolerate treatment failure, and in patients with a high risk of developing viral resistance because of a complex viral quasi-species prior to therapy.
