BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Morbidity and mortality due to falciparum malaria are increasing in many tropical areas. The situation is further complicated by drug resistant malaria. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of arteether on acute chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in eastern coalfield area of Asansol. METHODS: A total of 30 patients with chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria smear and histidine-rich protein II (HRPII) antigen positive were given arteether intramuscularly in a single daily dose of 150 mg (3 mg/kg body weight in case of children) for three consecutive days. They were followed up to 28 days of arteether therapy. Each patient was assessed in terms of fever clearance time, parasite clearance time and parasite reappearance rate. RESULTS: The cure rate was found to be 100% with fever clearance time between 1-3 days (mean +/- SD 48.2 +/- 10.6 h) and mean parasite clearance time of 1.2 +/- 0.3 days. Parasite reappearance rate was found to be 0%. No adverse effect due to arteether therapy was observed following the treatment. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results indicated that arteether was effective in patients with acute chloroquine resistant, complicated as well as uncomplicated, falciparum malaria and might be considered as a suitable alternative to quinine.
