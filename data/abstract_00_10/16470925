OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibiotics resistance, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and homology of high-level gentamycin resistant enterococcus in clinical specimens. METHODS: The high-level gentamicin resistant (HLGR) isolates were screened by the agar method and the resistance of 14 antimicrobial agents was determined by K-B method. The aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to analyze the homology of HLGR isolates. RESULTS: The ratio of HLGR was 64.2% (68/106). Among the HLGR,there were no isolates resistant to linezolid, vancomycin and tecoplanin, and Enterococcus faecium was more resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolone than Enterococcus faecalis. The positive rate of aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia was 92.6% and 3 isolates had the resistance gene mostly similar to aph(2')-Id. And among 51 HLGR isolates from the hospitalized patients, PFGE grouped 17 E. faecalis isolates into 4 clusters (A-D), and 33 E. faecium isolates into 8 clusters (A-H) with A cluster as predominant. CONCLUSION: HLGR has become the important antibiotic resistance bacteria which results in nosocomial infection; and aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia is the main aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene which causes HLGR.
