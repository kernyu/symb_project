Wild Listeria isolates representing serovars found in artisanal cheeses commercialized in Asturias (northern Spain) were assessed for their susceptibility to several bacteriocins. Pediocin PA-1 was the most active bacteriocin followed by enterocin AS-48, nisin, and plantaricin C. However, some Listeria monocytogenes and Listeria innocua strains were already highly resistant to PA-1. Among the wild L. monocytogenes populations, the frequency of development of nisin resistance ranged from 10(-6) up to 10(-3), depending on the strain. Highly stable mutants with increased nisin resistance (two- to fourfold) were isolated and tested for potential cross-resistance to lysozyme, EDTA, and various NaCl concentrations and pH values. All mutants were cross-resistant to lysozyme but sensitive to EDTA. In contrast, no clear correlation could be established between nisin resistance and an altered susceptibility to NaCl or pH changes. Nisin-resistant variants were able to survive and even to multiply in milk fermented by a nisin-producing Lactococcus, but the growth of the wild-type strain was inhibited. The different phenotypes evaluated in this study are indicative of the unpredictability of the consequences of the development of nisin resistance in a dairy environment. This resistance should be considered when making a risk assessment of the long-term use of nisin to control L. monocytogenes.
