We evaluated the activity and tolerability of alemtuzumab given as a continuous infusion for 7 d followed by subcutaneous administration for 11 wk as salvage therapy for 10 patients with fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The continuous infusion of alemtuzumab was well tolerated. The typical infusion reaction seen with intravenous alemtuzumab was abolished. Two patients achieved a partial response with an overall response rate of 20%. Alemtuzumab levels were measured in four patients and detectable levels were obtained in three. Clinical activity needs to be confirmed in a larger patient population.
