Extensive use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine results in environmental exposure. Of major concern are microbial effects; including effects on nutrient soil cycles and antibiotic resistance. There is a need to assess the effects of these compounds in the environment. The application of standardized guidelines is relevant in studying many compounds. However there is a lack of special test methods designed for antibiotics. We validate manometric test flasks using glucose and a recalcitrant herbicide. The suitability of these tests for studying antibacterial agents is then investigated using two target functions (aerobic biodegradation and carbon transformation). Compound stability is quantified using HPLC techniques. Effects on total soil respiration in the biodegradation test are immediate and differ significantly from background. We show that compounds do not function as substrates, so effects are due to other soil processes, correlate well to sorption characteristics and are not dose dependent. This test provides details of relative antimicrobial potency towards soil microorganisms and can be used to rank compounds. However the test does not provide details on the nature or extent of specific microbial effects. In contrast, the carbon transformation test is more specific and provides a reproducible indication of dose effect relationships, which is more suitable in assessing the effects of these compounds in the environment. Presently, standard guidelines do not take into account the normal input of antibiotics into soils via contaminated sludge or manure. This should be corrected in future guidelines as these inputs alter microbial composition, organic matter, ionic strength and pH affect sorption and overall impact the test results.
