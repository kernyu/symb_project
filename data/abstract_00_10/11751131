BMS 284756 penetrated well into inflamed meninges (44% +/- 11%) and produced good bactericidal activity (-0.82 +/- 0.22 Delta log(10) CFU/ml. h) in the treatment of experimental meningitis in rabbits due to a penicillin-sensitive strain. BMS 284756 monotherapy had a greater potency than the standard regimen of ceftriaxone and vancomycin (-0.49 +/- 0.08 Delta log(10) CFU/ml. h) against a penicillin-resistant strain (MIC, 4 mg/liter). Even against a penicillin- and quinolone-resistant strain, BMS 284756 showed good bactericidal activity (-0.52 +/- 0.12 Delta log(10) CFU/ml. h). The antibacterial activity of BMS 284756 was confirmed by time-killing assays over 8 h in vitro.
