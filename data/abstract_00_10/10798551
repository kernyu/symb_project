Characteristic patterns of beta-lactam susceptibility are associated with different biovars of Yersinia enterocolitica. In a previous study differences in beta-lactam susceptibility among biovar 2, 4 and 5 strains were largely attributed to differences in expression of beta-lactamase A (BlaA) and beta-lactamase B (BlaB). The basis for differences in beta-lactam susceptibility of strains of biovars 1A, 1B and 3 is now considered. All the strains examined had blaB; nine of 31 biovar 3 strains and two of 13 biovar 1B strains had blaA, but PCR did not amplify blaA from biovar 1A strains. Nevertheless, inhibition data indicated that the majority of uninduced biovar 1A strains expressed BlaA and BlaB in similar amounts. Strong inducibility was seen in all these strains. Biovar 1B strains (which were less inducible than strains of biovar 1A) predominantly produced BlaA without induction; ticarcillin-sensitive strains of biovar 3 produced only BlaB but were not inducible; without induction biovar 3 strains resistant to ticarcillin and amoxycillin/clavulanate produced either predominantly BlaA, predominantly BlaB or exclusively BlaB and induction was demonstrated except for strains producing BlaB alone; biovar 3 strains resistant to ticarcillin but sensitive to amoxycillin/clavulanate predominantly produced BlaA without induction and were inducible for beta-lactamase activity. After induction, nearly all strains predominantly or exclusively produced BlaB. Although PCR amplification fragments with primers specific for blaA were obtained only from some strains, the induction and inhibition data suggest that all Y. enterocolitica strains possess enzymes related to BlaA- as well as BlaB. Nevertheless, expression of the beta-lactamase is regulated differently in different biovars and varies within most biovars. Failure to predict beta-lactamase expression profiles from MIC data indicates the presence of additional mechanisms contributing to differences in susceptibility.
