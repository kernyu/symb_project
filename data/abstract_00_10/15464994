Intracellular accumulation of denatured proteins impairs cellular function. The proteasome is recognized as an enzyme responsible for the effective clearance of those cytotoxic denatured proteins. As another enzyme that participates in the destruction of damaged proteins, we have identified oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH) and found that OPH confers cellular resistance to various kinds of oxidative stress. In this study, we demonstrate the roles of the proteasome and OPH in the clearance of denatured proteins. The inhibition of proteasome activity results in the elevation of protein carbonyls in cells under oxidative stress. On the other hand, cells overexpressing OPH retain higher resistance to oxidative stress, even though the proteasome activity is inhibited. Furthermore, upon inhibition of the proteasome activity, OPH is recruited to a novel organelle termed the aggresome where misfolded or denatured proteins are processed. Thus, OPH and the proteasome coordinately contribute to the clearance of cytotoxic denatured proteins.
