The metallo beta-lactamase (MBL) mediated resistance patterns remain unknown in most countries. We aimed to investigate the existence and antimicrobial resistance of MBL-producing strains among carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria that were isolated from nosocomial infections in patients in an university hospital in Turkey. Fifteen of 52 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (29%), 5 of 24 Acinetobacter baumanii strains (21%), and 2 of 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (100%) were found to be metallo enzyme producers, with the Etest MBL technique. The in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of the MBL-positive organisms was investigated by the Etest method. Of the ten drugs tested, isepamicin was the most active agent against the MBL-producing strains. Overall, the rank order of activity of the ten antibiotics, in terms of the percentages of susceptible strains, was: isepamicin, 73%; ciprofloxacin, 64%; amikacin, 59%; aztreonam, 18%; tobramycin, 18%; meropenem, 14%; cefoperazone-sulbactam, 5%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 0%; ticarcillin-clavulanate, 0%; and cefepim, 0%. The meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the metallo enzyme-producing and nonproducing carbapenem-resistant strains were compared, and the MBL-producers were found to have higher meropenem MICs than the nonMBL-producing carbapenem-resistant strains. Early preventive measures should be taken against MBL-producing nosocomial pathogens that are associated with wide spread and high antimicrobial resistance.
