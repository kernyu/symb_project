An isoleucine-to-valine change at position 233 (rtI233V) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase was recently reported to cause decreased in vitro susceptibility to, and treatment failure of, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). To further evaluate these findings, we screened our ADV clinical-study sequence database of 853 patients and identified 4 who, at baseline, had HBV with this mutation. All 4 patients responded to treatment with ADV, with a median change in HBV DNA levels of 4.0 log(10) copies/mL after 48 weeks of treatment. Phenotypic evaluation of clinical isolates and of a laboratory strain with the rtI233V mutation demonstrated their full susceptibility to adefovir in vitro, and HBV with the rtI233V mutation developed in none of the patients.
