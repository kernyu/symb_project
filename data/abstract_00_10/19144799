Detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) can be nonspecific, especially when KPCs are uncommon. We determined the positive predictive value and specificity of ertapenem resistance for KPC detection in 2,696 Enterobacteriaceae isolates. The positive predictive value and specificity of ertapenem resistance for KPC detection were 74% and 99.2%, respectively.
