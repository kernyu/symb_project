Omiganan, a bactericidal and fungicidal cationic peptide being developed as a topical gel for prevention of catheter-associated infections, inhibited commonly occurring fungal pathogens including Candida spp. (106 isolates) at <or=256 microg/ml and molds (including 10 Aspergillus isolates) at <or=1,024 microg/ml. All fungi were inhibited by omiganan at concentrations well below the 1% (10,000 microg/ml) clinical formulation, including species with reduced susceptibility to azoles and echinocandins.
