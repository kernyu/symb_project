Evidence is presented that Tim18, a mitochondria translocase, plays a role in the previously described apoptosis induced by arsenite in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Tim18 deletion mutant exhibited resistance to arsenite. After arsenite treatment, both the wild type and Tim18-deficient cells showed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Arsenite induced the higher expression of tim18 in wild type yeast cells. We found that the tim18 deletion mutant also exhibited resistance to other apoptotic stresses such as acetic acid, H2O2, and hyperosmotic stress. These results suggest that Tim18 is important for yeast cell death induced by arsenic, and it may act downstream of ROS production.
