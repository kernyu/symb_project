BACKGROUND: Septicemia continues to be a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. METHODOLOGY: To know the rate of neonatal septicemia in our tertiary care centre, a retrospective analysis of 2,247 blood samples was done over a period of four years and three months (July 2003 to October 2007). RESULTS: During that period, a total of 296 (13.17%) blood samples were found to be positive for bacterial isolates. Gram-negative septicemia (80.40%) was identified in more cases than Gram-positive septicemia (20.60%) with Klebsiella species 84 (28.3%) being the most common isolate. Maximum resistance among Gram-negative organisms was seen in amoxycillin/ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins. Amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam and imipenem were found to be good alternative drugs. Among Gram-positive organisms, all strains were sensitive to Vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Continued surveillance for various pathogens and their susceptibility profile should be done to effectively and timely treat the patients of neonatal septicaemia.
