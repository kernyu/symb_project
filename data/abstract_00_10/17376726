INTRODUCTION: A cluster of three related cases of tuberculosis (TB) with primary multidrug resistance was investigated at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Kigali (CHUK) in Rwanda. The patients were HIV-1/2 seronegative. Patients 1 and 2 were hospitalized in the same room of CHUK for one month. Patient 3 was a younger sibling of patient 2. METHODS: Drug susceptibility of two consecutive Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from each patient was tested by the BACTEC 460 radiometric method. DNA fingerprinting was performed using spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units of variable numbers of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) analysis. All patients initially received the World Health Organization category I regimen. RESULTS: The isolates collected during the first TB episode were resistant to isoniazid, rifampin and ethambutol. After subsequent retreatment regimens with rifampin, isoniazid, streptomycin, pyrazinamide (8 months) and rifampin, isoniazid, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, ciprofloxacin (21 months), patients 1 and 2 developed additional resistance to streptomycin and quinolones. Patient 3 received only the category I regimen and consecutive isolates retained the initial drug susceptibility pattern. All isolates were genetically indistinguishable by spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR, indicating the same origin. CONCLUSIONS: These observations highlight the risk of nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and the possible selection of secondary resistance to second-line drugs if a single new drug is added at the time of retreatment of MDR TB patients.
