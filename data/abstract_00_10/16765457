Cytomegalovirus infections are associated with severe morbidity and mortality is patients at risk for disease because of immune system disabilities; in particular, recipients of stem cell (HSCT) or solid organ (SOT) transplants. There are three systemic drugs approved for CMV treatment: ganciclovir, or its prodrug valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. An anti-sense therapeutic, ISIS 2922, is also approved specifically as in intravitreal treatment for CMV retinitis. Ganciclovir, and more recently, valganciclovir, have been useful in proactive approaches of CMV disease management; in both prophylactic and preemptive regimens in HSCT and SOT populations. The major anti-herpes agent valacyclovir has also been approved for prophylaxis of renal transplant recipients, or SOTs outside of the US. These drugs have provided major advances in CMV disease management, although they are limited by intolerable toxicities, oral bioavailability and efficacy, and risk of drug resistance with extended use. Several drugs are in early clinical development which may address these limitations; this review will provide an overview of our current arsenal of available drugs, and of those in the early clinical development pipeline.
