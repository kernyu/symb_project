Replacement of phenylalanine with leucine at position 391 in squalene epoxidase was identified as being responsible for terbinafine resistance in mutants of Aspergillus nidulans. The equivalent mutation was engineered into the ergA gene of Aspergillus fumigatus, resulting in an F389L substitution that also conferred resistance to this pathogenic mold.
