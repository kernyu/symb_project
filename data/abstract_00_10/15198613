The origin of the substantial difference in deacylation rates for acyl-enzyme intermediates in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and beta-lactamases has remained an unsolved puzzle whose solution is of great importance to understanding bacterial antibiotic resistance. In this work, accurate, large-scale mixed ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations have been used to study the hydrolysis of acyl-enzyme intermediates formed between cephalothin and the dd-peptidase of Streptomyces sp. R61, a PBP, and the Enterobacter cloacae P99 cephalosporinase, a class C beta-lactamase. Qualitative and, in the case of P99, quantitative agreement was achieved with experimental kinetics. The faster rate of deacylation in the beta-lactamase is attributed to a more favorable electrostatic environment around Tyr150 in P99 (as compared to that for Tyr159 in R61) which facilitates this residue's function as the general base. This is found to be in large part accomplished by the ability of P99 to covalently bind the ligand without concurrent elimination of hydrogen bonds to Tyr150, which proves not to be the case with Tyr159 in R61. This work provides an essential foundation for further work in this area, such as selecting mutations capable of converting the PBP into a beta-lactamase.
