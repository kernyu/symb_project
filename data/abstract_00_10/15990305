A novel series of tyrosine-derived HIV protease inhibitors was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antiviral activity against wild-type virus and two protease inhibitor-resistant viruses. All of the compounds had wild-type antiviral activities that were similar to or greater than several currently marketed HIV protease inhibitors. In addition, a number of compounds in this series were more potent against the drug-resistant mutant viruses than they were against wild-type virus.
