Staphylococci isolated from animals (n=311) were screened for methicillin resistance by oxacillin agar screening. Oxacillin-resistant strains were tested for the presence of the mecA gene by PCR. Isolates were identified by standard techniques and 16S rDNA analysis, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were tested using an agar diffusion method. MecA-positive strains were further analyzed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). From 11 multidrug-resistant staphylococci, 6 were mecA-positive: 2 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 4 Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Screening of 300 staphylococci (100 S. aureus, 100 S. intermedius and 100 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS)) randomly chosen from the strain collection of the Veterinary Microbiological Diagnostic Center yielded five oxacillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, four of which were mecA-positive. PFGE showed that all mecA-positive staphylococci isolated from animals had distinct patterns. However, one MRSA isolated from a flank fistula of a dog showed homology to a human epidemic MRSA cluster, suggesting that transfer of MRSA between humans and dogs might occur.
