The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which encodes, among other indispensable enzymes, an aspartic protease that is essential for viral maturation and replication. Numerous inhibitors of the protease have been developed. However, the eventual resistance of HIV-1 to these drugs implies a continuous battle to develop new inhibitors. Proposed herein is a robust, fast, and reliable method employing (19)F NMR for the evaluation of the inhibitory activity of new compounds against HIV-1 protease.
