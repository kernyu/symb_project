We analyzed the frequencies of selection, the order of acquisition, and the mutations selected on moxifloxacin in two wild-type pneumococcal strains, R6 and 5714. The first selection step showed either a single GyrA mutation or no mutation in any of the quinolone resistance-determining regions. Second-step mutants selected had either a second mutation in ParC or in ParE. Moxifloxacin could belong to these fluoroquinolones, which preferentially target GyrA though probably acting equally through both gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
