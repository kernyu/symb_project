Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, exhibits bacteriostatic activity against virtually all Gram-positive bacteria and even covers atypical organisms like mycobacteria and Nocardia. However, little is known about its effectiveness for central nervous system (CNS) infections. We report on our good experience with linezolid for the treatment of CNS infections in 10 patients, amongst whom three were caused by mycobacteria. While six of our patients clinically improved during linezolid therapy even after failure of various antibiotics, it was unsuccessful in one case. Side-effects were only mild gastrointestinal problems in one patient after long term-treatment, which however led to the cessation of therapy. Linezolid appears to be a safe alternative to vancomycin for therapy-resistant CNS infections because of its good CSF penetration and few side-effects.
