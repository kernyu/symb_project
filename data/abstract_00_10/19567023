OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Chai Shao Liu Jun Tang in combination with Lamivudine for the treatment chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. METHODS: 405 CHB patients in Guangdong Provincial Hospital were randomly divided into 2 groups, 220 in the treated group, and 185 in the control group. The control group was treated with Lamivudine for 18 months. The treated group was treated with Lamivudine in combination with Chai Shao Liu Jun Tang for 18months. At the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th and 18th month during the treatment, the clinical symptoms, ALT normalization rate, HBeAg seroconversion rate, the proportion of patients with undetectable serum HBV DNA, and YMDD mutation rate were observed. RESULTS: ALT normalization rates at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 18th month of the treatment group (69.5%, 85.9%, 90.5%, 82.7%) were higher than those in the control group (50.3%, 65.4%, 78.4%, 69.7%; P < 0.01). HBeAg seroconversion rate, rate of HBV DNA undetectable, and YMDD mutation rate at he 12th and18th month are 77.7%, 57.7%, 25.5%, 6.8%; 86.8%, 74.1%, 33.2%, 8.6% in the treatment group, and 54.6%, 36.8%, 13.0%, 14.6%; 69.2%, 37.3%, 19.5%, 20.5% in the control group (P < 0.01, or P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared to lamivudine alone, Cai Shao Liu Ju Tang in combination with lamivudine is more effective and induces less YMDD mutation rate in CHB patients.
