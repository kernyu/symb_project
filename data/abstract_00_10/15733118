A 51-year-old woman developed multiple pulmonary metastases after receiving nephroureterectomy and two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma. All metastases disappeared after four cycles of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (M-VAC) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy; however, 8 months later two pulmonary metastases recurred. The patient was entered into a phase I study of combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine, etoposide and cisplatin, designed for chemorefractory urothelial cancer. The lung masses showed significant reduction after two cycles of this chemotherapy; following salvage surgery, the patient has been well with no evidence of recurrence for more than 3 years.
