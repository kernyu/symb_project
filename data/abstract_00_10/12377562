Microorganisms and viruses have developed numerous resistance mechanisms that enable them to evade the effect of antimicrobials and antivirals. As a result, many have become resistant to almost every available means of treatment. This problem, although not new, is becoming increasingly acute and it is now clear that a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that microbes and viruses deploy in the development of resistance is essential if we are to gain new insights into ways to combat this problem.
