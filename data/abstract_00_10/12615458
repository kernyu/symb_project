A retrospective study of bacterial isolates from the wounds of patients admitted to burns unit, was undertaken at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India, over a period of 5 years between July 1997 and April 2002. The study compared the results obtained with the previous 5 years data (June 1993-June 1997) from the same unit to determine the changing patterns and emerging trends of bacterial isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Pseudomonas species (31%) and Staphylococcus aureus (22%) were the most common pathogens followed by Klebsiella species (19%). Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter species (9%) have emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen in our burn unit. Most of the gram-negative isolates obtained were found to be multi-drug resistant and 61% of the tested isolates were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Concomitant resistance to penicillin and aminoglycosides was observed in 61% of Enterococcus fecalis isolates. When compared with the results of previous 5 years (June 1993-June 1997) Pseudomonas spp. was still the commonest pathogen in the burns unit. However, isolation of this organism and other gram-negative organisms has decreased in comparison to previous years. The incidence of antimicrobial resistance has markedly increased over the past years resulting in limitation of therapeutic options.
