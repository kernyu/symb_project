Two hundred and twenty-four patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and bacterial isolation were examined to study the efficiency of chemotherapy in patients who isolated drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) of different genotypes. According to the pattern of susceptibility to antituberculous drugs (ATDs), the patients were divided into 3 groups: 1) those who were found to have ATD-susceptible MBT; 2) those who had multiresistant MBT susceptible to all ATDs, other than isoniazid and rifampicin; 3) those with multidrug resistance. MBT genotyping in accordance with the polymorphism of the length of restriction fragments IS6110 has indicated that the strains of the families W and AI were prevalent in all the groups. However, the strains of mycobacteria of the W family were most frequently (62%) detected among the patients with tuberculosis with slight drug resistance. Treatment was performed in accordance with the data of tests of MBT for their susceptibility to chemical agents. Comparison of the efficiency of therapy failed to reveal any relationship of the genotype of the causative agent within the groups of patients with tuberculosis with different resistance of Mycobacteria, including those with slight drug resistance. At the same time, the pattern of drug susceptibility of MBT largely determined the frequency and trends of bacterial isolation cessation.
