The introduction of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in 1995 ushered in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. For the first time, inhibition of two key enzymes responsible for HIV replication, reverse transcriptase and protease, was possible. The combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with a single protease inhibitor proved highly effective at reducing viral burden. In resource-rich countries where such combination therapy is readily available, dramatic reductions in HIV-related morbidity and mortality have been seen. However, long-term use of highly active antiretroviral therapy has led to several issues, including development of drug resistance and metabolic complications. Atazanavir (formerly BMS-232632), a novel azapeptide protease inhibitor, is a potent protease inhibitor that is not associated with significant dyslipidaemia as seen with other protease inhibitors. In this review, the current standard approach to the treatment of HIV in the US will be discussed as background to understand the potential utility of this new antiretroviral agent.
