In 200 sulfonamide-resistant Portuguese Salmonella isolates, 152 sul1, 74 sul2, and 14 sul3 genes were detected. Class 1 integrons were always associated with sul genes, including sul3 alone in some isolates. The sul3 gene has been identified in isolates from different sources and serotypes, which also carried a class 1 integron with aadA and dfrA gene cassettes.
