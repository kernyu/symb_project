BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an effective and commonly used immunosuppressant but has frequent adverse events. Genetic polymorphisms may contribute to variability in MMF efficacy and related complications. In this study we explore the distribution frequencies of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IMPDH1, IMPDH2 and ABCC2 and investigate whether these SNPs influence MMF adverse events in 59 pediatric heart recipients. METHODS: Genotypes were assessed by TaqMan analysis of: ABCC2 rs717620; IMPDH2 rs11706052; and IMPDH1 rs2288553, rs2288549, rs2278293, rs2278294 and rs2228075. Gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance was defined as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea or abdominal pain requiring dose-holding for >48 hours or MMF discontinuation. Bone marrow toxicity was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3 (CTCAE). RESULTS: GI intolerance occurred in 21 patients, and 21 had bone marrow toxicity. The ABCC2 rs717620 A variant was significantly associated with GI intolerance leading to drug discontinuation (p < 0.001); the IMPDH1 rs2278294 A variant and rs2228075 A variant were also associated with greater GI intolerance (p = 0.029 and p = 0.002, respectively). The IMPDH2 rs11706052 G variant was associated with more frequent neutropenia requiring dose-holding (p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample of pediatric heart transplant patients receiving MMF, ABCC2, IMPDH1 and IMPDH2 SNPs were associated with MMF GI intolerance and bone marrow toxicity. Thus, genetic polymorphisms may directly influence MMF adverse events.
