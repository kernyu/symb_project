BACKGROUND AND AIM: Many studies have reported poor results with standard first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori. Second-line regimens that may overcome bacterial resistance can minimize side-effects and optimize compliance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and bismuth subcitrate-based quadruple therapy, after failure of a PPI plus clarithromycin and amoxicillin as first-line therapy. METHODS: Patients who failed to eradicate the infection after initial therapy were randomly separated into three groups. The first group received lansoprazole, bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole and amoxicillin (LBMA); in the second group metronidazole was replaced by tetracycline (LBTA); and the third group was given metronidazole and tetracycline in addition to same doses of lansoprazole and bismuth subcitrate (LBMT). RESULTS: In the LBMA group, the eradication rate was 74.7% and was significantly related to sex, with no relationship to age. In the LBTA group the eradication rate was 81.5% with similar rates in males and females. No relation to sex or age was observed. In the LBMT group the eradication rate was 82.1% with no difference between women and men and it was not related to age, either. Eradication rates in study groups were similar (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: A-14-day regimen of lansoprazole, bismuth subcitrate and antibiotic pairs, tetracycline-amoxicillin and tetracycline-metronidazole, is an effective quadruple therapy after one failed course of standard triple therapy. The evaluation of tolerability of and compliance with quadruple therapy needs further studies.
