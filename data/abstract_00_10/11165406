The aim of the study was to evaluate the activity of cisplatin (CDDP) plus vinorelbine (VNR) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progressing after paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. Treatment consisted of CDDP 80 mg/m(2) administered on day 1 and VNR 25 mg/m(2) administered on day 1 and 8, repeated every 3 weeks. Nine patients who relapsed after partial response and eight patients refractory to prior CT received a minimum of two treatment cycles: three patients achieved a PR (18%; 95% CI: 4-43%), four had stable disease and 10 had disease progression. All responses were observed among the nine patients responsive to prior treatment. Median survival was 35 weeks. No patients required dose-reduction, treatment discontinuation or delay because of toxicity. Our results indicate a reasonable antitumor efficacy and no relevant toxicity of a second-line CDDP-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. We recommend the use of this regimen for patients not refractory to primary treatment.
