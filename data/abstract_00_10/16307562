Gemifloxacin MICs for 12 Haemophilus influenzae strains with different resistance phenotypes were 0.001-0.015 mg/L. Gemifloxacin was bactericidal against all 12 strains after 24 h at 2 x MIC. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin had MICs of 0.008-0.03 mg/L and similar kill kinetics. Macrolides and telithromycin had unimodal MICs (1.0-8.0 mg/L), except for two strains without efflux systems (0.0125-0.5 mg/L) and two with efflux systems and ribosomal protein mutations (> 64.0 mg/L), and were bactericidal against eight to ten strains tested at 2 x MIC after 24 h.
