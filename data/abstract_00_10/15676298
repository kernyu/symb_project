In the late 1960s, the medical need for new antibiotics began to be questioned, and the pharmaceutical industry shifted its emphasis of antibacterials from that of a therapeutic leader to a low-priority research area. Although infectious diseases, in particular those caused by bacterial infections, are still among the top causes of mortality in the world, industrial support continues to wane. The shift from this important area of antimicrobial research has been attributed to a combination of science, medical, marketing and business reasons. This decline in antibacterial drug discovery, coupled with increasing risk as a result of infections caused by drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, represents a clear public health threat.
