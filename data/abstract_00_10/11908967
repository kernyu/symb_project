Nine new polyprenylated benzoylphloroglucinol derivatives, hyperibones A-I (1-9), were isolated from the aerial parts of the Uzbekistan medicinal plant Hypericum scabrum. Their structures were determined mainly on the basis of spectroscopic evidence (2D NMR and HRMS). Compounds 1, 2, and 4 showed mild in vitro antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistance Staphylococus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococus aureus (MSSA).
