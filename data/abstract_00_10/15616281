In the present report we describe the characteristics of 189 antimicrobial-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae isolates from bovine (38 isolates) and human (151 isolates) sources. All the strains were resistant to tetracycline (TET), and 16 (8.5%) were also resistant to erythromycin, corresponding to 23.7% of the TET-resistant bovine isolates and 4.6% of the TET-resistant human isolates. The tet(O), erm(B), and mreA resistance-related genes, as well as the bca and scpB virulence-related genes, were the most frequent among the bovine isolates, while the tet(M), erm(A), mreA, bca, lmb, and scpB genes were the most prevalent among the isolates from humans. Although a few major clusters were observed, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis results revealed a variety of profiles, reflecting the substantial genetic diversity among strains of this species isolated from either humans or bovines.
