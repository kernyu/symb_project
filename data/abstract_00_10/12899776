OBJECTIVE: To analyze the antimicrobial resistance of enterococci in Beijing and other areas in China. METHODS: Disk diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial resistance of 1978 enterococcal isolates from 4 teaching hospitals in Beijing and 53 grade 3 A hospitals in other areas of China The laboratory data were analyzed by WHONET5 statistic software. RESULTS: Enterococcus. faecalis isolates and E. facium isolates accounted for 80.7% and 17.1% of the enterococcus isolates in Beijing and 79.4% and 15.2% in other areas respectively. The enterococcus isolates from urine, sputum, secretion with pus, blood, and bile accounted for 33.7%, 22.9%, 9.8%, 4.4%, and 3.0% of the enterococcus isolates in Beijing and 28.4%, 16.3%, 14.6%, 5.0%, and 4.5% in other areas respectively. The resistance rates of E. faecalis to vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, and high -level gentamicin were 2.0%, 1.4%, 17.7%, and 47.4% in Beijing, and 5.1%, 3.7%, 24%, and 49.2% in other areas; The resistance rates of E. faecium to vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, and high -level gentamicin were 1.5%, 2.6%, 64.2%, and 64.9% in Beijing, and 2.1%, 3.1%, 68.5%, and 62.3% in other areas respectively. The vancomycin-resistant rate of the total isolates of enterococci was 3.2%. CONCLUSION: Enterococcus faecalis is the main species in the enterococcus isolates from clinical samples. E. facium, as compared with E. faecalis resists many antimicrobial agents more strongly. Both of E. faecalis and E. facium show the least resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin.
