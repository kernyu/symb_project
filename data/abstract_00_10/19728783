Antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli strains from pigs, sympatric rodents, and flies from two large farms in the Czech Republic with different antibiotic exposure histories were characterized based on antimicrobial resistance genes, integrons, and macrorestriction DNA profiles. Isolates of E. coli were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents according to the standard disk diffusion method. In resistant isolates, polymerase chain reaction was used to detect antibiotic resistance genes, integrase genes, and gene cassettes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used for molecular subtyping of E. coli. In farm A (long-term use of amoxicillin only), 75% (n = 198), 65% (n = 49), 11% (n = 139), and 82% (n = 177) of E. coli isolates from piglets, sows, sympatric rodents, and flies, respectively, were antibiotic resistant. In farm B (various antibiotics commonly used), 53% (n = 154), 69% (n = 98), and 54% (n = 74) of E. coli isolates from piglets, sows, and sympatric rodents, respectively, were antibiotic resistant. In both farms, the highest resistance prevalence was to tetracycline, and resistance patterns of isolates were greatly variable. Isolates with the same resistance phenotype, genes, and PFGE profile were found in pigs and flies. Isolates from rodents showed unique PFGE profiles. Close contact of sympatric rodents and flies with pigs or their products was associated with colonization of rodents and flies with resistant bacteria or transfer of resistance genes found in pig intestinal flora.
