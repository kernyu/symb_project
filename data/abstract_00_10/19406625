Acinetobacter baumannii is a multiresistant opportunistic nosocomial pathogen responsible for outbreaks worldwide. The main infection caused by this microorganism is nosocomial pneumonia, in particular ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients in Intensive Care Units. Treatment of these nosocomial infections is becoming problematic because the level of resistance to antimicrobial agents is rising. Ceftobiprole is a new cephalosporin with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. This study evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against a collection of 58 A. baumannii clinical isolates and showed that the activity of ceftobiprole was superior to ceftazidime and cefepime when the bla(ADC)-like gene was not expressed or was expressed at a low level.
