We describe the patterns of antimicrobial prescribing and trends in disease occurrence among children with otitis externa using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1995 to 2000. Oral antimicrobial therapy for otitis externa is more likely to contribute to antimicrobial resistance than is topical antimicrobial therapy and is rarely indicated. Thirty-nine percent of visits resulted in a prescription for topical antibiotics, and 25% of visits resulted in a prescription for oral antibiotics. Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing for otitis externa occurs frequently.
