PURPOSE: To report a case of subretinal abscess due to Nocardia farcinica resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus on immunosuppressive therapy. DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: We retrospectively studied the medical record of a patient with nocardiosis. RESULTS: The microorganism disseminated from the lungs (pneumonia) to the eye and brain. The ocular lesion appeared to be a yellowish, lobulated subretinal abscess with irregular surface and superficial retinal hemorrhages. As it was not responding to empiric therapy for nocardia, pars plana vitrectomy and aspiration of the subretinal material was performed to confirm the etiology. CONCLUSION: In an immunocompromised patient with pulmonary involvement and a subretinal abscess with a characteristic aspect, one should consider nocardia as a possible etiology taking into account its possible antibiotic resistances.
