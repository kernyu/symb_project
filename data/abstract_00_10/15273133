The activity of oral clofazimine against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis was compared to that of ofloxacin in healthy volunteers by the use of whole-blood cultures. Clofazimine was inactive whether it was tested alone or combined with other drugs that are used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, despite a total dose of 2 g. Kanamycin was the most active drug tested.
