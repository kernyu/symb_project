A follow-up of 558 children and adolescents contacting the patients with tuberculosis who isolated bacteria was analyzed. In 46.5% of cases, the children and adolescents contacting the patients with tuberculosis were in the foci of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) in the source of infection. The patients from these foci fell ill with tuberculosis 3.4 times more frequently than those from the foci where the sources of infection isolated MBT susceptible to antituberculous drugs. Processes with bacterial isolation were detected in 47.7% of the ill children and adolescents, primary MBT resistance to antituberculous drugs being noted in 68.8% of cases. Preventive chemotherapy reduces the risk for children and adolescents contacting the patients with tuberculosis to fall ill by 7.6 times. Ineffective preventive chemotherapy performed in those contacting the patients was due to the use of MBT-resistant antituberculous drugs in the source of infection. The administration of the MBT-resistant drugs in the source of infection led to the same high incidence of tuberculosis in children and adolescents from the bacterial foci of tuberculous infection as in its absence.
