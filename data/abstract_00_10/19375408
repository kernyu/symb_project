Up to this date, nothing is known about the molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from animals in Africa. Therefore, this study was carried out to screen the incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Salmonella from neonatal calf diarrhea in Egypt and also to characterize the molecular basis of this resistance. Nine unique Salmonella isolates were obtained from 220 fecal samples, and six of these showed multidrug resistance phenotypes and harbored at least two antimicrobial resistance genes. Four were Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and two were S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. Class 1 integrons were identified in all MDR Salmonella isolates. The identified gene cassettes within class 1 integrons were as follows; aminoglycoside adenyltransferase type A (aadA1, aadA2 and aadA5), which confer resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, and dihydrofolate reductase gene cassettes (dfrA1, dfrA15 and dfrA15), which confer resistance to trimethoprim. A class 2 integron containing dfrA1-sat2-aadA1 gene cassettes was identified in only one isolate of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. The beta-lactamase-encoding gene, bla(TEM-1), was identified in five isolates and the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-encoding genes, bla(CMY-2) and bla(SHV-12), were identified in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Furthermore, the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnrB, qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr, were also identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of qnrS in S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, qnrB in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and aac(6')-Ib-cr in Salmonella of animal origin. Also, this is the first report of the molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from animals in Africa.
