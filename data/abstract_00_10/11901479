Every minute, somewhere in the world four people die from tuberculosis (TB), yet it has been nearly 40 years since a novel drug was introduced to treat this disease. The ever increasing number of TB cases together with the advent of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, has stimulated the search for novel anti-TB agents. An array of novel drug targets is provided by the mycobacterial cell wall, whose integrity is essential for bacterial viability. Over the years researchers have identified potential drug targets that are associated with the synthesis of various cell wall constituents. This classic approach, together with the unravelling of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome sequence, has placed TB drug research in an unprecedented position. An entire new set of genetic and bioinformatic tools for probing potential drug targets is now available. As therapies using first-line drugs like isoniazid (INH) or rifampin in combination with second-line drugs, like ethambutol (EMB) still continues, a number of substituted fluoroquinolones are being considered as the new generation of anti-TB drugs for their favourable pharmacokinetic profile and excellent oral bioavailability. In this review, the future of anti-TB drugs is discussed with reflection on the structure and biosynthesis of cell wall constituents that are potential drug targets. The importance and relevance of the M. tuberculosis genome sequence for the development of novel anti-TB drugs, have also been underscored.
