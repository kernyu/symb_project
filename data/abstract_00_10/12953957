Flavimonas oryzihabitans is rarely reported as a pathogen in human infections and is related to opportunistic infection. Previously reported cases of infections caused by this bacterium were nosocomially acquired, including bacteraemia in critically ill patients, catheter-related infection, and peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Three cases of F. oryzihabitans infection are presented, 1 of which was sinusitis and 2 were nosocomially acquired bacteraemia. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of sinusitis infection due to F. oryzihabitans induced by prosthetic material. Isolates from the 2 bacteraemic patients were susceptible to tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, gentamicin, amikacin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, but resistant to cephazolin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim. The isolate from the sinus was susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. After appropriate treatment all the patients recovered and no longer showed signs of the pathogen.
