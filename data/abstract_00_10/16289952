The genetic diversity of 115 Campylobacter coli strains, isolated from pigs of 59 geographical distant farms in Switzerland, were characterized on the basis of their DNA fingerprints and resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Sequence analysis showed that the macrolide-resistant isolates had a point mutation in the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes (A2075G) and that the fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates had a point mutation in the gyrase gene gyrA (C257T). One fluoroquinolone-resistant strain had an additional transition mutation in the gyrB gene (A1471C). The flaA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping revealed that 57% of the isolates were genetically different. Point mutations in the 23S rRNA and gyrA genes could be found in both genetically distant and genetically related isolates. Additionally, isolates with and without point mutations were found within individual farms and on different farms. This study showed that the ciprofloxacin and erythromycin-resistant C. coli population present on the pig farms is not issued from a common ancestral clone, but individual Campylobacter strains have most likely mutated independently to acquire resistances under the selective pressure of an antibiotic.
