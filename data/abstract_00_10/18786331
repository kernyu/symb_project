Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) abscesses are best managed surgically; postprocedure antibiotics do not substantially improve outcomes. Cure rates with incision and drainage alone are at least 90%. If incision and drainage fail to promote healing within 7 days, the oral antibiotics of choice are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline.
