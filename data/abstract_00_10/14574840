Chemiluminescent assay can give the result of the detection of MRSA about 13 hours more rapidly than conventional broth microdilution method. In order to apply chemiluminescent assay to detection of MRSA, we compared MIC and antimicrobial susceptibility to MPIPC in using chemiluminescent assay with these in using broth microdilution method. In MSSA, rate of concordance of MIC and antimicrobial susceptibility to MPIPC obtained by both methods was 87%, but all MICs come to be agreed by modifying the concentration of bacterial liquid. In MRSA, all MICs and susceptibility to MPIPC are agreed in both methods. Although we have used chemiluminescent assay to detect MRSA for one year, no trouble has been reported by clinical side. The chemiluminescent assay is evaluated to be good in detecting MRSA.
