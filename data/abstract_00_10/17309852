The in vitro activity of fluconazole was investigated against 476 yeast isolates collected during a 9-year period (1997-2005) from patients hospitalised in a teaching hospital of Ancona. They included 373 isolates of Candida albicans, 53 of Candida glabrata and 50 of Candida parapsilosis. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute methodology showed that 96% of the isolates were susceptible (MIC < or =8.0 microg/ml). The uncommon, resistant isolates (MIC > or =64 microg/ml) were randomly distributed over time. Our data show that resistance to fluconazole in this geographical area is a rare event and suggest that this triazole can still represent first-line therapy in our institution.
