Lipid peroxidation products such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) cause dysfunction and death of retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells, thereby leading to retinal degeneration. The molecular mechanisms underlying their action remain elusive however. In this study, the roles of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in 4-HNE-induced RPE cell dysfunction and viability were addressed. 4-HNE caused RPE cell death and down-regulated basal activity of AMPK as evidenced by decreased Thr(172) phosphorylation of AMPKalpha. Exposure of RPE cells to the AMPK inhibitor, compound C also led to cell death, indicating that RPE cell death is correlated with 4-HNE modulation of AMPK activity. ARPE19 cells express both AMPKalpha1 and AMPKalpha2 with predominant expression of the AMPKalpha1 isoform. siRNA studies revealed that knockdown of AMPKalpha1 expression sensitized RPE cells to 4-HNE. Intriguingly, knockdown of AMPKalpha2 protected RPE cells from 4-HNE injury. Sub-lethal doses of 4-HNE induced an increase in RPE monolayer permeability, as measured by reduction in trans-epithelial resistance (TER). Knockdown of AMPKalpha2 but not AMPKalpha1 significantly restored RPE cell barrier function. No further protection was observed by knockdown of both AMPKalpha1 and AMPKalpha2. In contrast, knockdown of AMPKalpha1 and/or AMPKalpha2 did not reverse the 4-HNE's inhibitory effects on production of IL-8 and MCP-1. These data demonstrate that AMPKalpha1 and AMPKalpha2 play distinct roles in regulating 4-HNE effects on RPE function and viability. Therefore, selective modulation of AMPKalpha activity may benefit patients with retinal degeneration associated with RPE cell atrophy.
