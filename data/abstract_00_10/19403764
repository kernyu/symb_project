We screened 533 and 361 methicillin (meticillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated in a university hospital in 2002 and 2003 and in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and identified 4 (0.8%) of the strains in the first group and 8 (2.2%) of the strains in second group as heterogeneous vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (heterogeneous VISA) strains and 3 (0.8%) of the strains in the second group as VISA strains. This is the first report of VISA strains isolated from patients in Thailand.
