This study investigated the basis for intrinsic amphotericin B (AMB) resistance in Aspergillus terreus. The ergosterol content, cell wall composition, and lipid peroxidation level had no influence on AMB resistance. The level of catalase production in A. terreus was significantly higher than that in A. fumigatus (P < 0.05). This higher-level production may contribute to AMB resistance in A. terreus since oxidative damage has been implicated in AMB action.
