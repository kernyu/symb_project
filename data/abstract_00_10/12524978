In the Sverdlovsk Region, multidrug resistance was observed in greater than 8% of patients isolating bacteria mainly in the residents of cities, former prisoners, those having fibrocavernous tuberculosis complicated by chronic nonspecific lung disease (CNLD). Primary resistance was determined in 4.7%, secondary resistance developing in 57.4% of cases 3 years or longer after the initiation of treatment. The most common cause of multiresistant tuberculosis is irregular treatment, patients' discontinuation of some antituberculous agents, as well as scarce financing of a tuberculosis control service, which prevents the standard treatment regimens from using in tuberculosis. Death due to tuberculosis was largely occurred irregularly treated dwellers of cities, tuberculosis-induced disabled individuals, alcohol abusers, patients with CNLD, or having fibrocavernous tuberculosis resistant to 4-5 antituberculous agents.
