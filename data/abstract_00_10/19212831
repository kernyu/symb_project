The upregulation of GRP78 and GRP94 under the induction of A23187 and its function in drug resistance to etoposide (VP-16) was investigated in human lung cancer cell line SK-MES-1. The expression of GRP78 and GRP94 induced by A23187 at different concentrations was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cell survival to VP-16 was determined using a colony-formation assay. The expression of GRP78 and GRP94 in the cells was found to correspond well with the cell survival to VP-16. The results showed that upregulation of GRP78 and GRP94 can significantly confer the chemoresistance to VP-16 in human lung cancer cell line SK-MES-1.
