UNLABELLED: Antibiotic resistance, the important public health threat, depends on antibiotic overuse/misuse. Self-medication with antibiotics is of serious medical concern. The aim of the study, as a part of SAR project (Self-medication with antibiotic in Europe) was to survey the incidence of this phenomenon. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In Poland among 938 respondents of the questionnaire 27% adults were treated with antibiotics at least once a year, 13% of the therapies were undertaken without medical consultation. The most frequently prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin, the most often self-ordered--fusafungine. RESULTS: The main self-medicated symptoms were sore throat and common cold. The duration of self-ordered therapy was less then 5 days. The sources of antibiotics used for self-medication were leftovers and those given by friends or family. CONCLUSION: The results of the study confirmed that antibiotic self-medication is relatively frequent problem in Poland and interventions are required in order to reduce the frequency of antibiotics misuse.
