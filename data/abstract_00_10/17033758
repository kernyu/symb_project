Topics highlighted at the XVI International AIDS Conference in Toronto included HIV/AIDS vaccine research, entry inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, new NNRTIs and PIs, single-agent therapies, pre-exposure prophylaxis and microbicides.

This includes new epidemiological and resistance data, results from current studies investigating established and novel antiretroviral drugs and drug classes as well as new findings in therapy management and strategies.
