The polymicrobial nature of the odontogenic infections as well as the variety of associated conditions are a consequence of the diversity of the buccal microbiota and the anatomical and functional complexity of the oral cavity. In addition to this, all these processes can give way to multiple complications which range from the local to the systemic level. The appropriate choice of antibiotic and posology is crucial in the successful management of these infections. Pharmacodynamics provides those parameters that make it possible to assess how antibiotics activity varies in time. As a general rule, the first step in the initial management of orofacial infections in adults, included odontogenic infections, will be the administration of 875 mg of amoxicillin and 125 mg of clavulanic every 8 hours. Therapeutic compliance is paramount to avoid resistance, therefore patient acceptance must be sought. In this sense, it has been proved that Augmentine Plus (2000/125) every twelve hours both as profylaxis and as treatment significantly decreases the rate of infective complications associated to extraction of the third molar.
