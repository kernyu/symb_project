A new secoguaianolide sesquiterpene (1) was isolated along with its three stereoisomers (2-4) from the nonmedicinal plant Artemisia gilvescens. The structure of 1 was elucidated to be (4S,5S)-dihydro-5-[(1R,2S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-oxo-3-cyclopenten-1-yl]-3-methyle ne-4-(3-oxobutyl)-2(3H)-furanone on the basis of 2D NMR and other spectroscopic evidence. Five known sesquiterpenoids were also isolated from this plant, and one of them (5) showed activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
