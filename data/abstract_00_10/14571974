Monascus purpureus was transformed into hygromycin B resistance with hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) fused to Aspergillus nidulans trpC or a putative Monascus purpureus gpd1 promoter by electroporation. Among five strains, only M. purpureus DSM1397 was a competent recipient. Normal growth and sporulation on media containing up to 500 mg hygromycin B l(-1) occurred up to five generations. Upon transformation of the strain with the green fluorescent protein gene (sgfp) as a model gene and hph as a selection marker, characteristic green fluorescence was observed under fluoromicroscopy indicating successful transformation.
