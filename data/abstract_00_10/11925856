Previously, a factor (Factor T) was found in aged mixtures of tungstate and phosphate, which greatly sensitizes strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to beta-lactams. Factor T was purified and identified as undecatungstophosphate([PW11O39]7-). Undecatungstosilicate([SiW11O39]8-), a compound closely related to undecatungstophosphate, showed a similar enhancing effect. Chemically, these compounds are classified as "polyoxotungstates", and it is expected that these tungsten compounds will be useful as a "tool" in laboratory tests: i.e., in screening media for highly resistant MRSA strains. They may be also useful to investigate the resistant mechanism of the bacterial cells.
