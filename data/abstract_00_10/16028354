The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp) uses ATP to transport a wide variety of structurally unrelated cytotoxic compounds out of the cell. The relatively high expression of P-gp in organs such as the intestine, kidney, blood-brain/testes barrier and in some tumor cells can compromise chemotherapy treatments for patients with cancer or AIDS/HIV. It has been difficult to inhibit P-gp during chemotherapy with noncovalent inhibitors because the relatively high levels of inhibitors have severe side effects. An alternative approach to inhibit P-gp would be to covalently modify cysteine residues within the NBDs. In this study, we tested whether metabolites of disulfiram, a drug currently used to treat chronic alcoholism, could inhibit P-gp. We show that the disulfiram metabolites, S-methyl N,N-diethylthiocarbamate sulfoxide and S-methyl N,N-diethylthiocarbamate sulfone inhibited the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of P-gp with IC50 values (concentrations that result in 50% inhibition of activity) of 9 and 4.8 microM, respectively. Similarly, S-methyl N,N-diethylthiocarbamate sulfoxide and S-methyl N,N-diethylthiocarbamate sulfone inhibited the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase with IC50 values of 3.2 and 1.7 microM, respectively. Inhibition of P-gp by the metabolites was not reversed by addition of the reducing compound, dithiothreitol. We then determined which endogenous cysteine residue was responsible for inhibiting P-gp activity after exposure to the disulfiram metabolites. Treatment of P-gp mutants containing a single cysteine residue showed that inactivation was primarily due to modification of Cys1074 in NBD2. These results indicate that metabolites of disulfiram can covalently inactivate P-gp. Covalent modification of drug transporters could be a useful approach for inhibiting their activities during chemotherapy.
