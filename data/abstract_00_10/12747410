The sinorhizobia isolated from root nodules of Acacia species native of Mexico constitute a diverse group of bacteria on the basis of their metabolic enzyme electromorphs but share restriction patterns of the PCR products of 16S rRNA genes and a common 500 kb symbiotic plasmid. They are distinguished from other Sinorhizobium species by their levels of DNA-DNA hybridization and the sequence of 16S rRNA and nifH genes. nolR gene hybridization patterns were found useful to identify sinorhizobia and characterize species. A new species, Sinorhizobium americanus, is described and the type strain is CFNEI 156 from Acacia acatlensis.
