A premature twin of 1.9 kg had mitral valve endocarditis develop during neonatal intensive care. Vegetation involving the entire anterior mitral valve leaflet was identified. Reconstruction was achieved by near complete resection of the anterior mitral valve leaflet and retention of the peripheral margin of coaptation including primary and secondary chordae. The body of the anterior mitral valve leaflet was reconstructed using fresh autologous pericardium, a technique not previously reported in an infant of this size. Three and a half years later, the child is well and has required no further intervention.
