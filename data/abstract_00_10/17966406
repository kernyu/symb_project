Disruption of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis genes in an epidemiologically significant Yersinia pestis strain showed that the ability to synthesize the full inner core of the LPS is crucial for resistances to the bactericidal action of antimicrobial peptides and to complement-mediated serum killing. Resistance to polymyxin B also requires a high content of the cationic sugar, 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose, in lipid A.
