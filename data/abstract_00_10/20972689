The value of percutaneous chemical lumbar sympathectomy (LSE) for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is still being discussed controversially. In particular, a benefit for Fontaine stage II PAD could not yet be shown. This case report is about a patient suffering from Fontaine stage II PAD. By applying five LSE in regular intervals good symptom control could be achieved and maintained for more than 5 years. The case is an occasion to call for larger controlled studies designed to find out the efficacy of LSE for the treatment of stage II PAD. Mechanisms and available data are discussed.
