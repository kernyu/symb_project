We investigated the parameters driving nelfinavir resistance, along the D30N and L90M evolutionary pathways. The advantage of the D30N mutant was mostly due to its resistance level, while the L90M mutation allowed preservation of infectivity coupled with minimal resistance. Emergence of secondary mutations further increased the selective advantage of viruses harboring D30N.
