In many developing countries and outside hospital settings, the characteristics of endemic Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to multiple drugs remain unknown. In a community-based referral and therapy program in northern Lima, Peru, beginning in 1996, patients found to be failures on standard regimens were referred for drug-susceptibility testing of their isolates, and those found to be infected with M. tuberculosis isolates resistant to at least rifampin were treated with individualized regimens based on their infecting strains. Isolates from 42 of these patients were subjected to DNA sequencing of the rpoB gene region responsible for rifampin resistance. We determined the frequency of types of mutations in the rpoB gene among these Peruvian isolates.
