Dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides belongs to a group of facultative anaerobic Gram-negative coccobacilli that was formerly designated CDC group DF-3. We evaluated the characteristics of this microbe and its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. In this study, D. capnocytophagoides was isolated by anaerobic blood cultures from a 78-year-old male with pancreatic cancer, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, who also showed symptoms of cholangitis. The isolated strain demonstrated resistance to various beta-lactams, erythromycin, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, but was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, clindamycin, minocycline, and chloramphenicol. The results of all biochemical tests and the homology of the 16S rRNA gene were consistent with previous reports of D. capnocytophagoides.
