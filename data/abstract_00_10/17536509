Genetic material of HCV consists of single-strained RNA. Generation of HCV mutants insensitive to the immune system activity and resistant to used medications seem to be a consequence of HCV genetic variability, unusual replication potential and selection pressure of the host organism. During only one day 10(12) of viral particles may be formed, many of which contain mutations. Selection pressure put by the immune system and used medications lead to the selection of new HCV variants insensitive to therapeutics. The aim of the study is to draw attention (by means of discussing the structure and replication of HCV) to therapeutical problems of chronic hepatitis C consisting of the biology of the virus. Clinical and laboratory factors dependent on the patient (e.g. biochemical, histopathological, genotype) were omitted.
