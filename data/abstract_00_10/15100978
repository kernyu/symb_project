For the time being telithromycin is the only representative of a new group of antibiotics - ketolides - available for clinical use. Its chemical structure is derived from erythromycin, but it is better resorbed from the digestive tract and is efficacious against most macrolide-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Telithromycin is registered for the treatment of respiratory infections: sinusitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. The drug is well tolerated. It is less likely to induce MLS(B) resistance than macrolides with a 14- or 15-member ring.
