PURPOSE: The effect of ionizing radiation on multidrug resistance (MDR) of human larynx cancer HEp-2 cells has been investigated. We studied the dependence of the radiation effect on radiation dose, time after irradiation and cell density. METHODS: MDR was determined from an increase in cell sensitivity to daunorubicin, taxol and vincristine by the inhibitors of multidrug resistance cyclosporin A and avermectin B(1), and from the suppression by cyclosporin A of the transport of rhodamine 123 out of the cells. The cells were irradiated with X-ray beams (dose rate 1.12 Gy min(-1)) at room temperature. RESULTS: It was shown that, at 8 and 16 h after irradiation with doses up to 4 Gy, the multidrug resistance of cells increases, and at 24 h it decreases to the control level. The effect was maximal by 16 h after irradiation with a dose of 1 Gy. Both, the contribution of active transport to the rate of rhodamine 123 efflux from cells and their resistance to vincristine, increased. The effect of irradiation on multidrug resistance of HEp-2 cells depended on the density of cells on the substrate, being maximal at a density of 80,000-100,000 cm(-2). CONCLUSION: The irradiation-induced changes in the MDR of tumor cells should be taken into account when combining radiotherapy with chemotherapy. It was assumed that the dependence of multidrug resistance of HEp-2 cells on radiation dose and cell density is determined by changes in the amount of reactive oxygen species in the cells.
