Comparative in vitro activities of several antimicrobial agents against Helicobacter pylori were evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations against 41 strains of H. pylori were determined by using E test. All 41 strains were isolated from gastric mucosa of patients suspected to have gastric ulcer. The ranges of MIC of amoxicillin was from 0.016 microgram/ml and less to 0.064 microgram/ml. The ranges of MIC of clarithromycin, erythromycin, and azithromycin were from 0.016 microgram/ml and less to 64 micrograms/ml, from 0.016 microgram/ml and less to more than 256 micrograms/ml, from 0.064 to more than 256 micrograms/ml, respectively. The ranges of MIC of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin were from 0.016 microgram/ml and less to 32 micrograms/ml, from 0.002 microgram/ml and less to more than 32 micrograms/ml, from 0.002 microgram/ml and less to more than 32 micrograms/ml, from 0.064 to more than 32 micrograms/ml, respectively.
