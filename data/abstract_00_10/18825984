Bacilli of the species Bacillus subtilis, B. pumilus, B. mycoides, B. marinus and B. licheniformis (a total of 53 strains) were isolated from 15 invertebrate species and the water of the Vostok Bay, Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan. Bacilli were most often isolated from bivalves (22.7%) and sea cucumbers (18.9%); they occurred less frequently in sea urchins and starfish (13.2 and 7.5%, respectively). Most of bacilli strains were isolated from invertebrates inhabiting silted sediments. No Bacillus spp. strains were isolated from invertebrates inhabiting stony and sandy environments. The species diversity of bacilli isolated from marine objects under study was low. Almost all bacterial isolates were resistant to lincomycin. Unlike B. pumilus, B. subtilis isolates were mostly resistant to benzylpenicillin and ampicillin. Antibiotic sensitivity of B. licheniformis strains was variable (two strains were resistant to benzylpenicillin and oxacillin, while one was sensitive). A significant fraction of isolated bacilli contained pigments. Pigmented strains were more often isolated from seawater samples, while colorless ones predominated within hydrobionts. B. subtilis colonies had the broadest range of colors. In the Bacillus strains obtained, DNase, RNase, phosphatase, elastolytic, chitinase, and agarolytic activity was detected. Bacilli strains with hydrolytic activity occurred in invertebrates more often than in seawater.
