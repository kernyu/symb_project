A 62-year-old man with amphotericin B-resistant Candida krusei spondylodiscitis, following an episode of candidemia caused by the same strain, was successfully treated with caspofungin plus voriconazole. Amphotericin B fungicidal concentrations were better predictors of the clinical outcome than were MICs. This is the first case of C. krusei spondylodiscitis reported in the literature.
