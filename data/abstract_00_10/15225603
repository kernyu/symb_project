The ompX gene of Enterobacter aerogenes was cloned. Its overexpression induced a decrease in the major porin Omp36 production and consequently a beta-lactam resistance was noted. Purified outer membrane protein X (OmpX) was reconstituted into artificial membranes and formed ion channels with a conductance of 20 pS in 1 M NaCl and a cationic selectivity. Both MarA expression and high osmolarity induced a noticeable increase of the OmpX synthesis in the E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 strain. In addition, OmpX synthesis increased under conditions in which the expression of the E. aerogenes major non-specific porins, Omp36 and Omp35, decreased.
