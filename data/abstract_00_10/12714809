In this study, a total of 647 vaginal discharge samples were examined. Ureaplasma urealyticum growth was seen in 68 samples (10.5%). The antibiotic sensitivity of 30 types of U.urealyticum was determined with the E-test and agar dilution method. With the agar dilution method, all types were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (MIC 0.94 microg/ml), tetracycline (MIC 0.125 microg/ml) and doxycycline (MIC 0.125 and 0.190 microg/ml). Furthermore, with the agar dilution method, 18 types (60%) were resistant to roxithromycin and 12 (40%) were sensitive (MIC 12 microg/ml); 3 types (10%) were resistant to erythromycin and 27 (90%) were sensitive (MIC 12 microg/ml); 9 types (30%) were resistant to clarithromycin and 21 (70%) were sensitive (MIC 12 microg/ml), and all types were sensitive to azithromycin (MIC 14 microg/ml).
