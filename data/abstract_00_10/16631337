In vitro activities of tigecycline were compared with 15 other comparator agents against recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens (623 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 105 Staphylococcus aureus, 92 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 84 Haemophilus influenzae isolates) collected from 11 Asian countries. All isolates of S. pneumoniae from Asian countries were susceptible to tigecycline regardless of penicillin susceptibility with MIC90 of <or=0.06 mg/L. Both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates were susceptible to tigecycline with very low MIC90 values (0.25 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively). Tigecycline was also active against K. pneumoniae (98.9% susceptible; MIC50, 1 mg/L; MIC90, 2 mg/L) including 10 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates and H. influenzae (100% susceptible; MIC50 and MIC90, 0.12 mg/L) from Korea. Data confirmed that tigecycline has an excellent in vitro activity against drug-resistant clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens from Asian countries.
