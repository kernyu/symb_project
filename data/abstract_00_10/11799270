Alcaligenes xylosoxidans is an uncommon cause of peritonitis in patients on maintenance continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Peritonitis caused by A. xylosoxidans usually carries a poor prognosis because of the pathogen's virulence and its universal resistance to most antimicrobial agents. Even after early Tenckhoff catheter removal, the transport property of the peritoneum is often irreversibly damaged, leading to permanent technique failure. We report 2 patients with CAPD-associated peritonitis due to A. xylosoxidans sp. xylosoxidans who were successfully cured with a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam. One of them subsequently returned uneventfully to CAPD.
