OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the intracellular cytidine deaminase (CDD) activity and drug resistance in acute leukemia (AL) of different stage. METHODS: CDD activity of 80 AL patients was determined by radioactive isotope assay. RESULTS: CDD activity of previously untreated and refractory/relapse AL patients was much higher than that of patients in complete remission (P<0.05). There was no significant difference of CDD activity between previously untreated and refractory/relapse patients (P>0.05). The activity of CDD had no correlation with age, sex, classification of AL and effect of chemotherapy containing cytidine deaminase (Ara-C). CONCLUSION: Intracellular CDD activity in AL patients may be related to the stages of the disease. It seemed that CDD might not be considered as an independent predictive factor for the drug healing efficacy of Ara-C.
