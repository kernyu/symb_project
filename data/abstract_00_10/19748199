Usually, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is susceptible to a variety of non-beta-lactam drugs. These isolates commonly display SCCmecIV and are associated with community-acquired infections. More recently, CA-MRSA has been isolated from health-care-associated diseases. We characterized MRSA isolates from 2 hospitals in Rio de Janeiro area to assess the entry of new lineages. The isolates were primary genotyped using a combination of molecular typing methods including SCCmec, restriction modification test, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) detection. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was carried out for representatives of each lineages found. Disk diffusion test was performed as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. SCCmecIV was the predominant cassette mec detected. The most frequent MRSA lineage, a PVL nonproducer, was allocated in the CC1-SCCmecIV. It was found that 56% of these isolates were resistant to 3 or more non-beta-lactam drugs. Multilocus sequence typing of a representative of the CC1 isolates supported our finds that multiresistant variants of a CA-MRSA lineage (ST1-SCCmecIV) emerged in this city.
