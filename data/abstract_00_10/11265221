Antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus has been surveyed by eight city laboratories of the Aquitaine area, during a six month-period (january to june 1998). Antibiotic susceptibility testing has been performed by the disk diffusion method, and the results have been collected and analysed using the SIRscan system. After elimination of the redundant strains, a total of 747 isolates has been retained. They were mainly isolated from pus (64%) collected from patients of the community (40%) or hospitalized in 30 private clinics or nursing homes. The percentages of resistant strains (community/institutions) were: benzylpenicillin: 90% (87/92%), oxacillin: 39% (23/50%), kanamycin: 37% (22/47%); gentamicin: 13% (8/16%), tobramycin: 37% (21/47%), amikacin: 21% (13/27%); netilmicin: 6% (5/7%), erythromycin: 33% (30/35%), spiramycin: 72% (77/69%), lincomycin: 24% (17/29%), pristinamycin: 2% (1/2%), tetracycline: 17% (14/19%); pefloxacin: 40% (25/50%), fosfomycin: 9% (6/12%), rifampicin: 10% (7/13%), fusidic acid: 14% (11/15%), cotrimoxazole and vancomycin: 0%. Meticillin-susceptible strains of S. aureus were mostly sensitive to other antibiotics (< or = 6% resistant strains, except for erythromycin: 22%). Among meticillin-resistant S. aureus, heterogeneous strains with a KT phenotype, and various resistance patterns to the remaining antibiotics were predominant (61%), compared to the homogeneous strains with a KTG phenotype and multiresistant to the other antibiotics (32%). The frequencies of resistant strains were highly variable depending on the specimen, the laboratory and the health care institution, except for cotrimoxazole and vancomycin which were always active.
