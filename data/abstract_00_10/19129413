We established a real-time PCR assay with melting curve analysis to rapidly genotype quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrase A and topoisomerase IV genes in Haemophilus influenzae. This assay is a useful tool for the detection of fluoroquinolone resistance and for the early detection of preexisting QRDR mutations.
