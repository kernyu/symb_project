The production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) by natural killer (NK) cells provides an innate mechanism of resistance to many intracellular pathogens. These events are regulated by multiple cytokines and transcription factors which have both positive and negative effects. This article reviews the role of cytokines, as well as costimulatory and signaling pathways, involved in NK cell responses associated with resistance to infection.
