After transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs induce frequently lipid changes and glucose intolerance which result in worsening of the patient's prognosis. The mechanisms of the metabolic changes of corticosteroid hormones, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus and mycophelonate are shortly reviewed but are not fully understood. Controlling serum lipids is critical in the management of the patients after transplantation. Statins seem to be the best choice but it remains some concerns about drug interactions and risk of rhabdomyolysis. Fibrates except gemfibrozil are not recommended because potential renal side effects.
