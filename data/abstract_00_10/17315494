Previous publications have indicated that between 2002 and 2003 in the Netherlands, the antimicrobial resistance in gonococci increased. Repeat measurements in 2004 and 2005 suggest a further increase in resistance ofgonococci, to quinolones in particular, from 7% in 2002 to 26% in 2005. National surveillance of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance is important for public health. In 2006 a further survey will be implemented, in which resistance data and epidemiological information on the patients are combined and collected in a project called 'Gonococcal resistance to antimicrobials surveillance' (GRAS).
