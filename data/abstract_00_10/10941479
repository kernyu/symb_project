Haemophilus influenzae is the main pathogen in community-acquired infections in children. Prior to the introduction of H. influenzae type b immunization (Hib), capsular type b H. influenzae was the most invasive type of H. influenzae, and was the major cause of meningitis in children in France and many developing countries. The introduction of a Hib vaccine program results in rapid and dramatic decline in the incidence of Hib infections in children. The resistance rate to beta-lactam antibiotics is slowly increasing with beta-lactamase production. Third generation cephalosporins are used for the treatment of invasive infection (meningitis etc.). The empiric treatment of otitis and respiratory tract infections in children is the combination of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin or third generation cephalosporins.
