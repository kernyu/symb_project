Bovine mastitis is mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and antimicrobial therapy, commonly used for its control, has resulted in an increase in the frequency of resistant staphylococci in recent years. Thus, alternative therapies are desirable and the antimicrobial peptides represent attractive control agents. In this work, we expressed the antimicrobial peptide thionin Thi2.1 cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana in the bovine endothelial cell line BVE-E6E7 and evaluated its activity against bovine mastitis S. aureus isolates. A polyclonal population from BVE-E6E7 cells transfected with the pThi2.1 construct was obtained and thionin Thi2.1 expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. From this population, eight stably transfected cell clones were obtained and their conditioned media (CM) were evaluated against the S. aureus ATCC 27543 strain. Clones showed high antibacterial activity (>95%) relative to the activity of the polyclonal population. The C8 clone showed the highest antibacterial activity (>99%) and its CM was evaluated against eleven bovine mastitis S. aureus isolates. A 2.5microg aliquot of total protein from the C8 clone's CM inhibited the growth of S. aureus isolates (>40%) relative to the CM from BVE-E6E7 cells used as control. Growth inhibition of S. aureus isolates was dose-dependent, showing a total inhibition at concentrations higher than 3.12microg/ml. These results suggest that thionin Thi2.1 antimicrobial peptide could be use in the treatment of bovine mastitis.
