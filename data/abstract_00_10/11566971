Ketolides are the most recent generation of antimicrobials derived from the 14-membered ring macrolide, erythromycin A. The main structural feature that differentiates ketolides from erythromycin is the keto group, which replaces the L-cladinose moiety at position 3 of the macrolactone ring. The keto group bestows greater acid stability on the drugs, and enables them to bind to their ribosomal target without causing expression of MLS(B) resistance in inducible strains. Several ketolides are described here, including ABT 773 and telithromycin (HMR 3647), both of which possess a carbamate at C11/C12 of the macrolactone ring. In telithromycin, which is the first ketolide to be approved for clinical use, the carbamate is linked to an alkyl-aryl extension, which is responsible for the increased potency of this compound relative to macrolides. This review examines how the structural differences between macrolides and the new ketolides are related to their antimicrobial activities in inhibiting protein synthesis and blocking the assembly of new ribosomal subunits.
