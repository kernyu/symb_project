Antimicrobial peptides are present in organisms spanning virtually every kingdom, and employ sophisticated mechanisms to exert rapid microbicidal action consistent with their key roles in host defense. Offsetting these mechanisms, some microbial pathogens have evolved complex countermeasures to neutralize exposure to and subvert mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides. The following discussion highlights recent advances that offer greater understanding of the mechanisms of action and resistance of antimicrobial peptides.
