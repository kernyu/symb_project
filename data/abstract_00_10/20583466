A stable increase in the frequency of methicillin resistant clinical isolates of staphylococci was recorded. 258 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, including methicillin resistant ones, were susceptible to batumin. The minimum inhibitory concentration of batumin ranged within 0.04 and 0.5 mcg/ml and depended on the concentration of the microbial cells and the medium pH. The medium composition had limited influence on the batumin activity. No differences in the batumin activity against methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant staphylococci were observed. The antibiotic had bactericidal action on the strains (2-4 mcg / ml). The results of the study showed that batumin ointment was prospective for eradication of S. aureus. including MRSA, in cases with the nasal carriage and for control of multiresistant strains during hospital outbreaks.
