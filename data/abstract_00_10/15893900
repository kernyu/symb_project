We determined the resistance to nalidixic acid and 6 fluoroquinolones of 771 nontyphoidal Salmonella strains isolated from humans between 1999 and 2002. A total of 22 different serotypes were identified among the Salmonella isolates, the most common being Salmonella Enteritidis (79%) and Salmonella Derby (8%). Resistance to nalidixic acid increased from 38% in 1999 to 43% in 2002. This resistance was not homogeneous among the different serotypes, with the highest percentage of resistant isolates belonging to Salmonella Hadar (79%) followed by Salmonella Enteritidis (46%). Reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility (minimal inhibitory concentrations [MICs] from 0.12 to 0.5 microg/mL) was observed in 300 (39%) Salmonella. In our study, the nalidixic acid-resistant strains had an MIC90 at least 4-fold higher than the susceptible ones for all the fluoroquinolones tested, thus showing that resistance to nalidixic acid is an indicator of low-level resistance to all fluoroquinolones.
