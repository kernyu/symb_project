In an era of increasing resistance to classical antibacterial agents, the synthetic oxazolidinone series of antibiotics has attracted much interest. Zyvoxtrade mark was the first oxazolidinone to be approved for clinical use against infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-positive bacteria. In the course of studies directed toward the discovery of novel antibacterial agents, a new series of synthetic phenyl-isoxazolinone agents that displayed potent activity against Gram-positive bacterial strains was recently discovered at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Extensive investigation of various substitutions on the phenyl ring was then undertaken. We report here, the synthesis and antibacterial activity of a series of biaryl isoxazolinone compounds.
