Ceftazidime-susceptible and -resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were isolated from pulmonary specimens following a treatment with ceftazidime in a patient who developed a nosocomial pneumonia. The ceftazidime-susceptible and -resistant strains were clonally related and harbored a self-transferable approximately 155-kb plasmid. These isolates expressed two OXA-10-like oxacillinases, the narrow-spectrum OXA-35 and the expanded-spectrum OXA-19, respectively, differing by one amino acid substitution. This is the first example of in vivo selection of an extended-spectrum oxacillinase from a restricted-spectrum oxacillinase.
