During the period of profound combined immunodeficiency after bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (SCT), patients are at increased risk for serious viral disease. Recent advances in rapid diagnostic methods and the introduction of potent antiviral compounds have made it possible to establish efficient management strategies for several herpesviruses. Acyclovir, valaciclovir, and famciclovir are widely used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus disease. Intravenous ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir are available for prevention or therapy of cytomegalovirus disease, and oral valganciclovir could become a valuable alternative to intravenous treatment if shown to be effective and safe after SCT. Preliminary data on pleconaril for therapy of picornaviral disease are promising. Future investigations may help to clarify the role of the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir in the management of influenza in SCT recipients. The emergence of viruses resistant to antiviral drugs is of concern, and alternative treatment strategies need to be defined.
