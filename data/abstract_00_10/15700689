Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis is the most common individual causative agent of infectious disease in the world. It is responsible for 26% of preventable deaths in adulthood. Because the number of new cases grows at an annual rate of 2%, in 1993 WHO proclaimed tuberculosis a global health problem. The immediate cause for this was coinfection with causative agents of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus, and spread of resistant and multiresistant strains of M. tuberculosis (MDR TB). It is estimated that 50 million people are infected with resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. Tuberculosis has emerged as a major public health problem for its high mortality (50%-80%) in the first 4-16 weeks of the disease and 100 times more expensive therapy for drug-resistant than for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Mycobacteriologic laboratories play a fundamental role in the detection, combat and control of tuberculosis, especially in preventing the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis. In this connection, there is an increased need of a rapid and reliable determination of the susceptibility of isolated strains of M. tuberculosis to the first- and second-line antituberculotic drugs.
