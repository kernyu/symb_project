Two thousand four hundred thirty nine cases of tuberculosis were confirmed by the method of culture of the sputum at Kaunas Romainiai tuberculosis hospital during the period of 1997-2001. Out of them, 669 of them were diagnozed for the first time (not treated or treated for less than 1 month). Out of confirmed cases, 1601 of confirmed cases were the "old" ones (treatment failures, relapses, treated with one or two courses of antimicrobial therapy). The resistance to H, R, E, S and multidrug resistance have been investigated. We have revealed that among the "new" cases of tuberculosis the resistance of M. tuberculosis has decreased. In 1997 the resistance to H was 27.5 percent. However, it decreased 5.3 percent in 2000 and to 8.7 percent in 2001. In 1997 the resistance to R was 19.9 percent and it has decreased to 9.0 percent and 1.9 percent in 1998 and 1999, respectively. No R resistance cases were diagnozed in 2000 and 2001. In 1997 the resistance to E was 1.1 percent. It reached 1.5 percent in 1998 and there was no resistance to E in 1999-2001. In 1997 the resistance to S was 15.6 percent. In 1998 it was 26.3 percent and dropped to 1.8 percent in 2000.
