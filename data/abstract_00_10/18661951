Chlorohydroaspyrones A (1) and B (2), antibacterial aspyrone derivatives, and the previously described aspyrone (3), asperlactone (4), and penicillic acid (5) have been isolated from the broth of a marine isolate of the fungus Exophiala. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of the compounds were determined on the basis of the physicochemical data analysis and chemical reactions. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited a mild antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and multidrug-resistant S. aureus. The MIC values of each strain are as follows: compound 1 showed 62.5 microg/mL for S. aureus and 125 microg/mL for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and multidrug-resistant S. aureus, and compound 2, 62.5 microg/mL for S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 125 microg/mL for multidrug-resistant S. aureus.
