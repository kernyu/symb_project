Penicillin resistance identification tests are important in veterinary medicine. Six enzyme assays and a PCR test were compared for the detection of beta-lactamase production or the beta-lactamase gene in 175 staphylococcal isolates. We conclude that the PCR test and two nitrocefin-based assays can be recommended for routine clinical use.
