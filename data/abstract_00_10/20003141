AIM: The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of colistimethate sodium therapy in multidrug-resistant nosocomial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii in neonates and children. METHODS: Pediatric patients hospitalized at the Uludag University Hospital who had nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii, were enrolled in the study. Colistimethate sodium at a dosage of 50-75 x 10(3) U/kg per day was given i.v. divided into three doses. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received 17 courses of colistimethate sodium for the following infections: ventilator-associated pneumonia (n= 14), catheter-related sepsis (n= 1) and skin and soft-tissue infection (n= 2). The mean age of patients was 53.2 + 74.7 months (range, 8 days-15 years) and 60% were male. Mortality was 26.6%. CONCLUSION: Colistimethate sodium appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii in pediatric patients.
