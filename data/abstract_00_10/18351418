The present study was designed to determine the prevalence and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) types in clinical isolates of Klebsiella spp. at a university hospital located in the Brazilian southern region (Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo) as well as their antibiotic susceptibility and genetic profiles. This study included 147 non-repeat Klebsiella spp. isolates collected from January to June 2000, of which 23 K. pneumoniae and 8 K. oxytoca were selected as ESBL producers by using the Oxoid combination disk method and Etest ESBL strip. beta-lactamases were characterized by IEF, PCR and sequencing assays using primers for ESBL genes. Antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated by MicroScan system. Dissemination of two major clones of ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. occurred in the hospital. According to the results obtained in this study there was a clonal spread of CTX-M-producing K. oxytoca in five clinics and dissemination of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in the nursery and pediatrics wards.
