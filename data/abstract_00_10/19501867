The aminoglycoside apramycin has been used widely in animal production in China since 1999. This study was aimed to investigate the resistance pattern of apramycin-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from farm animals and farm workers in northeastern of China during 2004-2007 and to determine whether resistance to apramycin was mediated by plasmid containing the aac(3)-IV gene and the mode for the transfer of genetic information between bacteria of farm animals and farm workers. Thirty six E. coli isolates of swine, chicken, and human origins, chosen randomly from 318 apramycin-resistant E. coli isolates of six farms in northeastern of China during 2004-2007, were multi-resistant and carried the aac(3)-IV gene encoding resistance to apramycin. Conjugation experiments demonstrated that in all 36 cases, the gene encoding resistance to apramycin was borne on a mobilisable plasmid. Homology analysis of the cloned aac(3)-IV gene with the sequence (accession no. X01385) in GenBank showed 99.3% identity at a nucleotide level, but only with a deletion of guanosine in position 813 of the gene in all 36 cases. The results indicted that resistance to apramycin in these isolates was closely related to aac(3)-IV gene. Therefore, the multi-resistance of E.coli could complicate therapeutic practices for enteric infections in both farm animals and human.
