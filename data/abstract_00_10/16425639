BACKGROUND: This study provides an update on the bacterial aetiology of chronic otitis media in our area and the antibiotic sensivity of the bacteria involved in this pathology. METHODS: A retrospective study from 2000 to 2004, is carried out in a total of 127 adults diagnosed of chronic otitis media. Isolated bacteria were tested in vitro regarding sensitivity to fluoroquinolones, aminoglyosides, colistin, oxacilin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cephalosporins. RESULTS: The most common pathogens we found were gram-negative organisms, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa (47.7%), but among gram positive organisms, Staplhylococcus aureus, was involved in a significant number of infections (21%). The main findings that we found were as follows: 18% of P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 21.8% S. aureus strains were resistant to levofloxacin. 10.8% of S. aureus strains showed resistance to beta-lactams. CONCLUSION: The most important pathogen in our study was P. aeruginosa along with a variety of other gram-negative organisms and S. aureus. There is growing concern over the use of antibiotics and the development of resistance. We need to evaluate the antimicrobial activity by determining the susceptibility of a particular antibiotic against a specific bacterial strain.
