Vascular hypertrophy occurs during chronic hypertension and contributes to the elevation of peripheral vascular resistance in hypertension. In this study, we examined whether acute pressure overloading of the vascular wall produces activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, enzymes believed to be involved in the pathway for cell proliferation, in isolated perfused rat aortae, and examined whether the mechanical overloading-induced MAP kinase activation is mediated via the vascular angiotensin system. Aortae were perfused with Tyrode solution. Increases in perfusion pressure caused a pressure-dependent increase in MAP kinase activity in endothelium-intact aortae and in endothelium-denuded aortae. The increase in MAP kinase activity induced by pressure loading was inhibited by the angiotensin receptor antagonist, losartan, the renin inhibitor, pepstatin A, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. Ca(2+) depletion and the Ca(2+) channel antagonist, nifedipine, did not affect the pressure loading-induced MAP kinase activation. The results of the present study suggest that pressure loading of the vascular wall per se can activate MAP kinases in the vasculature and that the MAP kinase activation is mediated at least partly via the vascular angiotensin system. It seems unlikely that the pressure loading-induced increase in MAP kinase activity is mainly mediated via increases in Ca(2+) influx in vascular cells.
