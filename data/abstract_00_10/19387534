PURPOSE: The antiviral effect of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) added to ongoing lamivudine (LAM) treatment for LAM-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) differs among patients. We investigated clinical factors affecting the response to ADV therapy in LAM-resistant CHB. METHODS: The subjects were 75 LAM-resistant CHB patients treated with ADV in addition to LAM. Virological response (VR) was defined as HBV DNA clearance (<2.6 logcopies/ml) at 12 months after the start of ADV therapy. Clinical factors contributing to VR were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Lower HBV DNA at baseline and negative hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were significant factors affecting VR in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, lower HBV DNA at baseline (P = 0.005), negative HBeAg (P = 0.009), and higher ALT (P = 0.036) were significant independent factors contributing to VR. In HBeAg-positive patients, HBV DNA clearance was more frequently observed during ADV therapy in patients with baseline HBV DNA < or = 7.0 logcopies/ml than in those with baseline HBV DNA >7.0 logcopies/ml. By contrast, the link of lower HBV DNA at baseline to better therapeutic response was not evident in HBeAg-negative patients. CONCLUSION: In ADV therapy added to ongoing LAM treatment for LAM-resistant CHB, lower baseline HBV DNA and negative HBeAg contributed to a better antiviral effect. Addition of ADV should be done promptly before marked increase in HBV DNA, especially in CHB patients showing LAM resistance positive for HBeAg.
