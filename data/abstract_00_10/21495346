The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficiency of the first-line antibiotic treatment of the community-acquired respiratory tract infections in a population of young adults from an urban setting and to establish the pattern of antibiotic resistance of the germs involved. The bacteria most frequently identified have been: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, atypical agents also being suspected. Antibiotic treatment has been chosen accordingly to the recent guidelines, total clinical remission rate being of 91.08%, despite the increasing resistance for the commonly used antibiotics; a close monitoring of the phenomenon is mandatory.
