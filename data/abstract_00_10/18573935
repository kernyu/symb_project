The bla(KPC-3) and qnrB19 determinants of transferable Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pLRM24 reside within a complex region consisting of a Tn1331 backbone into which a Tn4401-like element and qnrB19 mobilized by an adjacent ISEcp1 insertion sequence have been inserted. This novel element represents a coalescence of genes conferring multidrug resistance in K. pneumoniae.
