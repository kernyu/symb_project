In this study, the nematode-trapping fungus, Monacrosporium sphaeroides, was transformed with a plasmid harboring the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene, via restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI). Frequencies of up to 94 transformants microg(-1) per linearized plasmid DNA were obtained by optimizing the PEG concentration, as well as the category and quantity of the added restriction enzyme. 90% of the transformants were determined to be stable for drug resistance when 20 randomly selected transformants were tested. Southern analyses revealed that the transforming DNA was integrated into the M. sphaeroides genome either with or without rearrangement. Five mitotic stable mutant strains were obtained using this approach, all of which had been altered with regard to sporulation capacity and pathogenicity toward nematodes. Southern blot analyses of the five mutants revealed that foreign plasmid DNA had integrated into the genome. Three of the mutants, Tms2316, Tms3583 and Tms1536, exhibited integration at a single location, whereas the remaining two, Tms32 and Tms1913, manifested integration at double or multiple locations. Our results suggest that the transformation of M. sphaeroides via REMI will facilitate insertional mutagenesis, the functional analysis of a variety of genes, and the tagging or cloning of genes of interest.
