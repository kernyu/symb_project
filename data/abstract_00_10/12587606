Antimicrobial susceptibility levels of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from urine were followed up at our University Hospital during three years (1999-2001), in order to evaluate the trend of antibiotic resistance of this common community-acquired pathogen of the genito-urinary tract. One thousand and 249 consecutive strains were examined, and a surprisingly low resistance profile was detected. As a result, penicillin , ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and piperacillin may still represent first-line agents in our area when community-acquired urinary tract enterococcal infections is of concern, pending in vitro susceptibility studies.
