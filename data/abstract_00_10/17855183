Fluoroquinolone-resistance among pneumococci is low; however the number of isolates with a single ParC mutation has increased. Consequently, more potent agents are needed to minimize resistance selection. We investigated the efficacy of ertapenem versus gatifloxacin in a temperature-sensitive mouse model of pneumonia caused by a wildtype Streptococcus pneumoniae strain (A66) and an isogenic mutant with a ParC mutation (R222). Treatment started at 24 h and lasted for 5 days. Temperature was used to assess disease progression before and during treatment. Of mice infected with either strain and treated at an early stage of infection, 79-94% of those given ertapenem survived compared with 56-61% given gatifloxacin. If treated at a later stage, the results were similar for ertapenem (71-84%) but were considerably lower for gatifloxacin (17-33%). Ertapenem was as bactericidal as gatifloxacin against A66 (94-100% vs 92-100%) but was superior to gatifloxacin against R222 (95-100% vs 50-77%). Ertapenem is a promising new treatment for patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, including those at risk of infection with a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain.
