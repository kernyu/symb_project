A 47-year-old woman was hospitalized because of urinary-tract infection. She was treated with antibiotics for 6 days. However, severe watery diarrhea and pyrexia developed 6 days after stopping administration of antibiotics. Stool, throat and blood cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and negative for Clostridium difficile DI toxin. In spite of administration of VCM, she died of septic shock. At autopsy, macroscopic observation revealed a pseudomembrane in the ileum. MRSA enterocolitis can occur in patients with antibiotic-related diarrhea, and physicians should be aware of its rapid clinical course and possible lethal outcome.
