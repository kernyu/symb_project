Purified QnrA blocked ciprofloxacin inhibition of topoisomerase IV, just as QnrA was previously found to prevent quinolone inhibition of DNA gyrase. With a gel displacement assay, tagged QnrA was shown to bind to topoisomerase IV and its subunits in a reaction that did not depend on the presence of DNA, quinolone, or ATP.
