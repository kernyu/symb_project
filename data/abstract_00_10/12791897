Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on 122 neonatal bloodstream isolates of group B streptococci (GBS) to further examine the relationship between macrolide resistance and serotype V GBS (GBS-V). Over one-third (35%) of macrolide-resistant GBS belonged to a single PFGE subtype of GBS-V, which was also the most common GBS-V subtype noted in previous Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance studies. Erm methylase (ermA and ermB) was the most common resistance mechanism detected, present in 12 of 20 macrolide-resistant GBS.
