A series of new imines and amines have been synthesized by condensation of 1H-3-ferrocenyl-1-phenylpyrazole-4-carboxaldehyde with the corresponding amines, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride. The synthesized compounds have been screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against 11 bacteria and three fungal/yeast strains, using disc diffusion and broth microdilution susceptibility assays. They have shown a wide range of activities, from completely inactive to the highly active compounds.
