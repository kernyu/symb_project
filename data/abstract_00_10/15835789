The study of the effect of ampicillin on the electrophysical properties of Escherichia coli cells showed that this antibiotic influences the orientational spectra (OS) of the ampicillin-susceptible E. coli strains K-12 and XL-1 within the frequency range 10-1000 kHz of the orienting electric field and does not affect the OS of the ampicillin-resistant strains K-12(pUC-18) and XL-1(pHEN1). The change in the electrooptical signal of the ampicillin-susceptible cells was maximum at an ampicillin concentration of 50 microg/ml and did not depend on the exposure time. The conclusion is drawn that changes in the OS of cells can be used to evaluate their resistance to ampicillin.
