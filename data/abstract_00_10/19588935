Drug resistance acquired by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is a major problem in the treatment and control of malaria. One of the major examples of drug resistance is that caused by mutations in the active site of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of Pf (PfDHFR-TS). A double mutation, A16V+S108T, is specific for resistance to the marketed drug cycloguanil. In this study, we used 58 cycloguanil (2,4-diamino-1,6-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine) derivatives to explore the relationship between various physicochemical properties and reported binding affinity data on wild-type and mutant-type A16V+S108T. Using the Hansch 2D-quantitative structure-activity relationship method, we obtained a parabolic relationship of hydrophobicity of substituents at the N1-phenyl ring with the wild-type binding affinity data. Hydrophobicity being a key property for wild-type binding affinity data, we found steric factors to be crucial for A16V+S108T mutant resistance. We investigated FlexX, GOLD, Glide and Molegro virtual docking programs and 13 different scoring functions on 10 of the cycloguanil derivatives to evaluate which program was best for reproducing the experimental binding mode and correlating the docking scores with the reported binding affinity data. We identified GOLD, using its GoldScore fitness function, as the most accurate docking program for predicting binding affinity data of cycloguanil derivatives to DHFR and Molegro virtual docker, with its template docking algorithm and MolDock [GRID] scoring function, as most accurate for reproducing the experimental binding mode of a reference ligand that is structurally similar to the cycloguanil derivatives studied. We also report an interaction index which best describes the structure-activity relationships exhibited by these analogs in terms of PfDHFR-TS active site interactions.
