The present work provides the first information concerning the immunostimulatory activity of trout recombinant interleukin-1 beta (rIL-1beta) in vivo. The predicted rainbow trout mature IL-1beta peptide was produced as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Optimal migration of peritoneal leucocytes and rIL-1beta induced phagocytosis occurred following intraperitoneal injection of 1 microg of the recombinant protein. Moreover, systemic IL-1beta, COX-2 and lysozyme II gene expression was enhanced following >or=1 microg rIL-1beta administration. Finally, resistance to Aeromonas salmonicida, the causative agent of furunculosis, was augmented at early times (2 days) post-injection of 1 microg rIL-1beta.
