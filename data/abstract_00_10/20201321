The aim of this study was to evaluated the susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae rods to tigecycline, tetracycline and doxycycline. We analysed 121 strains belonged to species as follows: Escherichia coli (40 strains), Proteus mirabilis (22), Enterobacter cloacae (19), Klebsiellapneumoniae (18), Morganella morgannii (13), Serratia marcescens (4), Klebsiella oxytoca (3) i Proteus vulgaris (2). All strains of E. coli, K. oxytoca, S. marcescens and P. vulgaris were susceptible to tigecycline. Twenty five of analysed strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Among of ESBL-positive strains 22 (88.0%) were susceptible to tigecycline and 13 (52.0%) to tetracycline and doxycycline.
