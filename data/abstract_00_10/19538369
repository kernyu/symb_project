A fresh focus on histoid leprosy is the primary objective of this article, especially in the context of the postglobal leprosy elimination era. The emergence of the entity following dapsone monotherapy is well recognized, in addition to de novo cases. Irregular and inadequate therapies, coupled with resistance to dapsone and/or mutant organisms, are responsible. It was considered to be worthwhile to take stock of the condition through its history, nomenclature, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis. The bacteriologic and histopathologic features and immunologic profile are also described.
