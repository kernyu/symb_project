A label-free and sensitive faradic impedance spectroscopy (FIS) aptasensor based on target-induced aptamer displacement was developed for the determination of lysozyme as a model system. The aptasensor was fabricated by self-assembling the partial complementary single strand DNA (pcDNA)-lysozyme binding aptamer (LBA) duplex on the surface of a gold electrode. To measure lysozyme, the change in interfacial electron transfer resistance of the aptasensor using a redox couple of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) as the probe was monitored. The introduction of target lysozyme induced the displacement of the LBA from the pcDNA-LBA duplex on the electrode into the solution, decreasing the electron transfer resistance of the aptasensor. The decrease in the FIS signal is linear with the concentration of lysozyme in the range from 0.2 nM to 4.0 nM, with a detection limit of 0.07 nM. The fabricated aptasensor shows a high sensitivity, good selectivity and satisfactory regeneration. This work demonstrates that a high sensitivity of the fabricated aptasensor can be obtained using a relatively short pcDNA. This work also demonstrates that the target-induced aptamer displacement strategy is promising in the design of an electrochemical aptasensor for the determination of lysozyme with good selectivity and high sensitivity.
