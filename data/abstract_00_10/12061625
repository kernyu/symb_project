HIV-1 can be considered an infection of the immune system, resulting in progressive and ultimately profound immune suppression. The availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in dramatic changes in the disease course in persons fortunate enough to have access to these medications, but long-term therapy is limited by the development of resistance as well as toxicities of the potent medication regimens. Emerging data indicate that individuals who have non-progressive clinical course control HIV-1 immunologically. This has bolstered hope that the immune response might be effectively augmented in persons with HIV infection. Recent data indicating that immediate treatment of acute infection leads to augmentation of antiviral immune responses have provided evidence that the immune system might be enhanced in certain situations. Therefore, investigation in the reconstitution of anti-HIV immune response in patients under HAART should provide encouragement for continuing to explore methods to obtain meaningful and durable immune enhancement as an adjunct to HAART in HIV-1 infection.
