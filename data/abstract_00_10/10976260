Globally the proportion of tuberculosis cases caused by drug-resistant strains is increasing. Interruptions in the drug supply, improper drug prescription and nonadherence to treatment protocols promote drug resistance through mechanisms that are now well understood. The treatment of tuberculosis must take into account the possibility of drug resistance and include at least 2 drugs, preferably 3, to which the isolate is proven or anticipated to be susceptible.
