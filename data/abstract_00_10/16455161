This study identified 37 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteraemia. The sources, causative organisms and mortality of gram-negative bacteraemia were consistent with historical series. Antibiotic resistance among well-described species with a propensity for antimicrobial resistance was the most common reason for ineffective antibiotic administration. This study emphasizes the importance of antibiotic resistance in antimicrobial selection and the power of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation criteria for predicting patient mortality.
