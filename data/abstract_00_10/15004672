Current therapy concepts for post-trauma osteitis include radical debridement, stabilization of bone and soft tissue care using early flap transfers. With this more radical approach, the long term results are improved, however, total treatment time still is very long. In addition to the physical, mental and social consequences for the patient, treatment costs are also very high. Antibiotic therapy as an adjuvant is still standard and effective although the development of worldwide antibiotic resistance has increased treatment difficulties. One of the main aims of research is to reduce these problems or to prevent the development of osteitis entirely. However, research has not yet elucidated the complex immunologic changes involved. In addition, most results are obtained from animal studies and clinical investigations are required.
