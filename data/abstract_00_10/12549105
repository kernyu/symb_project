We used callus of medical plant, Ningxia Lycium barbarum. L as material to induce somatic embryo genesis, and used multitracer technique and gamma-ray energy spectrum analytical method to study different concentration of AgNO3 on some absorption of trace metal ions during the somatic embryogenesis of Lycium barbarum. L. The results show that (1) when the concentration of AgNO3 is less then 50 mg/L, with the increase of AgNO3 concentration, the absorption rate of some metal ions is increasing, but when the concentration is excess of such concentration, the effects on the absorption rate are different. Ag+ has the effect of coordination, resistance or competition on the absorption of metal ions. (2) AgNO3 in suitable concentration will promote cell differentiation and somatic embryogenesis. When the concentration of AgNO3 is less then 50 mg/L, along with the increase of the concentration, the frequency of somatic embryogenesis is increased, and Ag+ has the promotion on the somatic embryogenesis of Lycium barbarum. L. While the concentration is up to 50 mg/L, it will mostly raise somatic embryogenesis in calli, the amount of callus is about 3 times as much as that of contrast group (in which AgNO3 is not added). When excess of this concentration point, Ag+ has toxic effect, and the somatic embryogenesis is inhibited remarkably.
