We compared the serum bactericidal activity (SBA) of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12 healthy volunteers. Each subject received 3 days of oral moxifloxacin 400 mg daily and levofloxacin 750 mg daily, respectively, with a 2- to 4-week washout period between regimens. Blood was drawn at 6 time points after the third dose of each antibiotic. Mean serum bactericidal titers (MSBTRs) for moxifloxacin were 4-fold higher than the mean titers for levofloxacin at each time point. For each drug, MSBTRs at each time point were the same or within one 2-fold dilution when analyzed according to the penicillin susceptibility of the strains or the sex of the subjects. The difference in SBA of the 2 drugs may have implications for the emergence of resistance and clinical outcome.
