The Cre recombinase and its activity in C57-TgN(Mx-Cre) transgenic mice is studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunogold electron microscopy and Southern blot. C57-TgN(Mx-Cre) transgenic mice harbouring cre gene in genomic DNA is demonstrated by PCR, and these mice which are induced by INF-alpha 1b could express Cre recombinase, which is confirmed by Western blot. With immunohistochemistry, we find that the Cre recombinase expresses in hepatocyte cytoplasm and nuclear of C57-TgN(Mx-Cre) transgenic mice. Cre recombinase expressed in hepatocyte cytoplasm and nuclear is further confirmed by immunogold electon microscopy. And it is supported that the Cre recombinase which is created from C57-TgN(Mx-Cre) transgenic mice induced by INF-alpha 1b can direct DNA recombination reaction in vitro. All evidence leads us supporting the view that the Cre recombinase expressed in C57-TgN(Mx-Cre) transgenic mice has activity. Thus we find a method to detect the activity of Cre recombinase in vitro.
