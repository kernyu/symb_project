This paper presents the results of an intervention study carried out as part of the activities of a District Health Management Team responsible for integrated primary health care delivery in a rural district in Ghana. The aim was to test the impact of a combination of improved information provision to patients and drug labeling on adherence to recommended anti-malarial treatment regimens focusing on oral chloroquine, for the outpatient management of acute uncomplicated malaria. The study had a quasi-experimental pre-test post-test control group design with partly random allocation by clinic. The results show that the intervention resulted in an improved flow of information to clients prescribed chloroquine, and better labeling of drugs for the home treatment of acute clinical episodes of malaria in the intervention area. Improvements in adherence occurred in all clinics. However, improvements in adherence were most marked in the clinic that was worst performing at the start of the intervention. Implications of the results for improving adherence to chloroquine therapy on an outpatient basis are discussed.
