Antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella spp., especially resistance mediated by extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), is a growing public health concern. Understanding the mechanisms through which Salmomella spp. acquire the resistance genes can lead to the development of intervention and mitigation strategies. Thirty-one Salmonella isolates of bovine origin were analyzed by serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, phage induction and bacterial host range determination, and phage transduction of antimicrobial resistance. The Salmonella isolates consisted of 12 serovars. Resistance to 1 or more antibiotics was detected in 12 isolates. Inducible phages were recovered from 19 Salmonella (61%) by spot lysis assay. Of the 19 phage samples, 13 were able to multiply in 2 or more Salmonella of various serovars. A cross-serovar transduction of antimicrobial resistance was observed from S. Heidelberg to S. Typhimurium. Transfection of an antimicrobial-susceptible strain of S. Typhimurium with a phage propagated in a S. Heidelberg resistant to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics and tetracycline resulted in independent acquisition of bla(CMY-2), tet(A), and tet(B). These data indicate that inducible phages are common in Salmonella of bovine origin, many of them demonstrate a broad host range, and wild-type phage mediated transduction may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, including the resistance mediated by ESBL.
