There is accumulating evidence that the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals has adverse human health consequences. The use of antibiotics in food animals selects for resistant pathogens and resistance genes that may be transferred to humans through the consumption or handling of foods of animal origin. Recent studies have demonstrated that antimicrobial-resistance among foodborne bacteria may cause excess cases of illness, prolonged duration of illness, and increased rates of bacteremia, hospitalization, and death. The continued availability of safe and effective antimicrobials for humans and animals depends upon the responsible use of these products.
