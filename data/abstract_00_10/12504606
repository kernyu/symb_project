OBJECTIVES: To measure the effects of antibiotic prescribing changes in the community on the prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. METHODS: Penicillin-resistant pneumococci were isolated from clinical samples taken from 549 patients between January 1987 and December 2000. Changes in the percentage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci isolated over the 14-year period and changes in prescribing practices were determined. RESULTS: Between January 1987 and December 2000, the prevalence of penicillin resistant pneumococci increased from 1.4% to a peak of 12.9% in 1997, subsequently falling to 8.9% after changes in antibiotic prescribing practices in the community. Over 65% of isolates were community acquired with 53% of patients having received antibiotics in the 3 months prior to their first isolate. Thirteen patients had a history of recent travel abroad. CONCLUSION: Reduction in antibiotic prescribing in general practice was followed by a reduction in the prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
