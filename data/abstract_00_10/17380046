Pseudomonas aeruginosa showing resistance to imipenem were found in 100 of 1,058 strains (9.5%) from six hospitals (a-f) in Hiroshima City, Japan. Of the 100 strains, 14 (14%) were double disk synergy test positive using sodium mercaptoacetic acid disks, and 18 (18%) were bla(IMP-1) or bla(VIM-2) allele positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among 100 imipenem-resistant strains, 32 were categorized into multi-drug resistant strains, in which 13 were positive for the metallo-beta-lactamase gene. Fifty-one strains (51%) among the 100 imipenem-resistant strains had elevated RND efflux pump activity against levofloxacin. But only 6 of 51 strains were classified as multi-drug resistant strains. The pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis of the Spe I-digested DNA from the 100 isolates suggested not only clonal spread but spread of heterogeneous clones started to contribute to the prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa strains in Japanese hospitals.
