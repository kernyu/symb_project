Eight pulsed-field gel electrophoresis subtypes and six Tn1546 variants were identified among Enterococcus faecalis isolates of a single clone recovered in three geographically separate Portuguese hospitals. Some clonal subtypes were found in particular hospitals, and Tn1546 variants were either widespread or confined to some of them. We also report on the first Tn1546 transposon containing an ISEf1 insertion.
