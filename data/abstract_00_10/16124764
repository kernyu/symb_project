One new benzopyran, nigrolineabenzopyran A (1), two new biphenyls, nigrolineabiphenyls A and B (2, 3), and four new tetraoxygenated xanthones, nigrolineaxanthones T-W (4-7), were isolated from the crude methanol extract of the twigs of Garcinia nigrolineata along with 11 known xanthones. The xanthones isolated from the twigs as well as those from the stem bark were evaluated for antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Nigrolineaxanthone F, latisxanthone D, and brasilixanthone showed significant activity, with an equal MIC value of 2 microg/mL.
