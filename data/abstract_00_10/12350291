The synthesis of a new series of 1beta-methylcarbapenems having the substituted thiazolopyrrolidine moiety is described. Their in vitro antibacterial activities against both Gram-positive including MRSA and Gram-negative bacteria were tested and the effect of substituent on the thiazole ring was investigated. A particular compound (28c) having 4'-amide substituted thiazole moiety showed the most potent antibacterial activity.
