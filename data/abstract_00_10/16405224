Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are expensive for MCOs and cause significant morbidity among their members. Although awareness of resistance to antibiotics is increasing, antibiotic selection for community-acquired RTIs remains largely empiric. When making formulary decisions, Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees may want to consider the spectrum of coverage that an antibiotic provides and its vulnerability to resistance development. Through appropriate formulary management and provider education, MCOs can promote successful clinical and economic outcomes. This article examines the current status of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired RTIs and encourages the incorporation of new parameters into MCO formulary decision processes.
