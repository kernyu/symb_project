The influence of salicylic acid (SA) on cell resistance to bunt pathogen in wheat calluses has been studied. Cell staining by diaminobenzidin substratum (DAB-cells) was conditioned by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation with the involvement of oxalate oxidase (OO). In the control group, DAB-staining was typical only of rhizoid cells (up to 50%). The infection caused no significant increase in the number of such cells; however, in the zone of fungus penetration parenchyma-like DAB-stained cells were observed (up to 24%). Under the influence of SA, the number of DAB-stained cells did not change, but increased in the zone of fungus penetration (up to 36%). Besides, SA increased OO activity and accelerated proembyogenic complex formation in the calluses, which, unlike rhizoids, were not sensitive to the phytopathogen. The infection caused an increase of OO activity in the cytoplasm and in an intercellular fraction, and an inhibition of an extracellular fraction of the enzyme.
