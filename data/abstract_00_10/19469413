A survival of A. hydrophila B3 has been conducted in different conditions (mineral water, seawater exposed or not to the sunlight). Also, unculturable forms have been detected by using epifluorescence microscopy. Thus, different kinds of microcosms were prepared using filtered and autoclaved marine water or mineral water, inoculated by A. hydrophila B3 and maintained or not in room light. Further, we tested the survival of A. hydrophila B3 incubated in seawater and exposed to sunlight. Our results revealed that the culturable count of A. hydrophila B3 incubated in different conditions declined. Nevertheless, no variations were obtained for the total bacterial cells. Morphological, biochemical and antimicrobial modifications were noted.
