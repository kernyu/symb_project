The present study was undertaken to estimate the occurrence and distribution of multidrug resistance (MDR) among Salmonella serovars isolated from slaughtered pigs at Debre Zeit, Ethiopia. A total of 501 different samples were examined of which 42 (41.6%) of 101 mesenteric lymph nodes, 22 (21.8%) of 101 tongues, 17 (16.8%) of 101 caecal contents, 11 (11.1%) of 99 livers and two (2%) of 99 muscle (diaphragm and abdomen) samples were Salmonella positive. Of the 94 Salmonella isolates representing 15 different serovars, 69 (73.4%) were multidrug resistant (resistance to two or more antimicrobials). Among the Salmonella serovars a high level of MDR was observed in S. Hadar, S. Kentucky, S. Blockley and S. Enteritidis mainly to tetracycline (88.6%), streptomycin (82.9%), nitrofurantoin (74.3%), nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin (42.9% each), sulfisoxazole (21.1%) and spectinomycin (20%). The pattern of MDR varied from two to eight antimicrobials among the resistant Salmonella serovars. The common profiles of resistance among the MDR serovars were the combined resistance to nitrofurantoin, streptomycin and tetracycline (R type NitStrTet, 51.4%), ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin (R type CipNalNit, 10%), ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole and tetracycline (R type CipNalSptStrSulTet, 14.3%) and to ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, streptomycin and tetracycline (R type CipKanNalNeoNitStrTet, 10%). Results of the present study indicate the widespread occurrence and distribution of MDR Salmonella serovars in slaughtered pigs which could be a potential source of human MDR Salmonella infections.
