AIMS: To screen six isoflavones isolated from Erythrina poeppigiana (Leguminosae) for their antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Stem bark of E. poeppigiana was macerated with acetone and the methylene chloride-soluble fraction of the residue was applied to repeated silica gel column chromatography and eluted. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined by a broth dilution method. Inactive compounds that failed inhibiting bacterial growth at 25 microg ml(-1) were further investigated for their combination effects with methicillin and oxacillin. Of the isolated isoflavones, 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8,3'-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)isoflavone (isolupalbigenin) exhibited the highest anti-MRSA activity (MICs: 1.56-3.13 microg ml(-1); MBCs: 6.25-12.5 microg ml(-1)), followed by 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-6-gamma,gamma-dimethylallylisoflavone (erythrinin B). Inactive compounds were combined with methicillin or oxacillin, 5,4'-dihydroxy-(3'',4''-dihydro-3''-hydroxy)-2'',2''-dimethylpyrano[5'',6'':6,7]i soflavone (M-Wi-2) intensifying the susceptibility of MRSA strains to these antibiotics. In all but one strain, the MIC values of methicillin were reduced from > or =100 to 6.25-12.5 microg ml(-1) in the presence of M-Wi-2 (25 microg ml(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: Isoflavones from E. poeppigiana showed two different antibacterial activities against MRSA: direct growth inhibition and intensification of methicillin sensitivity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Isolupalbigenin and M-Wi-2 could lead to the development of compounds for new approaches against MRSA infection.
