The ability of Sensititre YeastOne to discriminate isolates with reduced caspofungin susceptibility was determined against 36 Candida spp. (6 with a known FKS1 mutation). Results were compared with those of M27-A2. The MIC endpoint was 100% growth inhibition. Overall agreement (+/-2 log2) was 87.16%. Sensititre YeastOne detected strains with reduced caspofungin susceptibility.
