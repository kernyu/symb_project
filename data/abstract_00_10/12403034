The antibiogram and Beta-lactamase of 73 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from 235 different human clinical specimens were determined using standard procedures. These various clinical specimens were got from teaching hospitals and some private hospitals in Edo State. The results of the antibiogram showed 100% susceptibiity to Vancomycin, 78.1% to Gentamicin, 71.3% to Chloramphenicol, 69.8% to Erythromycin and 61.6% to Cloxacillin. The results of the beta-lactamase detection showed that 84.1% of the isolates were penicillinase positive, which probably accounted for the 100% resistance obtained for both Ampicillin and Penicillin. This thus suggests that clinicians should enlighten patients on the consequences of indiscriminate use of Penicillin and other antimicrobial agents.
