Three types of serotypically atypical Shigella flexneri strains were isolated from 2007 to 2008 in patients at the Korea National Institute of Health (NIH). These strains were characterized and compared with serologically typical S.flexneri. One type of strain either displayed nonreacting typing or grouping sera, reacting strongly only with polyB antisera, which indicates this strain is S. flexneri (polyB:un). The second type displayed reactions with one of the typing sera (IV) and did not bind any grouping sera (IV:un). The remaining type of strain displayed a plural agglutination pattern, reacted with one typing sera (II), and bound with two grouping sera (II:(3)4,7(8)). Among these atypical strains IV:un and II:(3)4,7(8) strains showed higher multi-antibiotic resistance in ampicillin, streptomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than typical strains. Furthermore, all II:(3)4,7(8) strains harbored integrons. This study suggests that these multiple antibiotic-resistant atypical S. flexneri are new subserotypes of S.flexneri that await further serological classification.
