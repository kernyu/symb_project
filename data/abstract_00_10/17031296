PURPOSE: To report the efficacy of intravitreal voriconazole. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of an interventional case series of five cases of culture-proven fungal endophthalmitis treated with intravitreal voriconazole was done. Only cases found to be resistant to conventional antifungal agents were included in the study. The diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis was established on the basis of clinical as well as microbiological examination. All patients received one or more intravitreal injections of voriconazole. Resolution was determined on the basis of clinical examination. Resolution of infection and final visual acuity were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Resolution of infection was achieved in all five cases. Visual acuity was better in three cases and was maintained in two. Of the three patients who had improvement, two had vision better than or equal to 20/120. Evisceration was avoided in one case with maximal antifungal treatment including voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole definitely adds to the available treatment options for fungal endophthalmitis. Because of its broad spectrum of activity, it is efficacious in even amphotericin-B- and fluconazole-resistant fungal endophthalmitis.
