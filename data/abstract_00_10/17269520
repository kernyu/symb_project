BACKGROUND: In 2003, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control established the Carolina Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS), an active sentinel surveillance system for antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: CARSS includes twelve hospitals. Each hospital was assigned a weighted sample size. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the E-test method. RESULTS: A total of 452 isolates were collected. The prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility in the study was 44.9%. Penicillin intermediate resistance (PCN-I) was 33.2%, and penicillin high-level resistance (PCN-R) was 11.7%. One hundred six (23.5%) isolates were nonsusceptible to one antibiotic. One hundred twenty-four (27.4%) isolates were nonsusceptible to three or more antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: CARSS confirmed the prevalences of antibiotic nonsusceptibility previously reported for South Carolina. However, CARSS suggests resistance is shifting from PCN-R to PCN-I in South Carolina. There is a high prevalence of multidrug nonsusceptibility in South Carolina. CARSS will continue to monitor these trends.
