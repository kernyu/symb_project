Through the enrichment of the active mud obtained from three chemical plants and the domestication with different concentration Ag+ solution, thirty bacteria strains with silver (Ag+)-resistance were isolated, among which, the highest Ag+ -resistant concentration was 80 mg x ml(-1). The plasmids in these bacteria were extracted, with the detection rate of 76.67%. The elimination rate of the plasmid in HAg4 bacteria was 98.75% by 40 mmol x L(-1) sodium benzoate, and 77.78% by 350 microg x ml(-1) acridine orange. It was suggested that the Ag+ -resistance of bacteria was highly correlated with their plasmids.
