A 60-year-old man presented with ureteric obstruction secondary to a mycotic right common iliac artery aneurysm complicating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. The diagnosis of MRSA was not known at the time of surgery, and in situ replacement of the aneurysm using a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis was performed. The patient made a full recovery, and to date there is no evidence of residual or recurrent infection. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of mycotic iliac aneurysm infected with MRSA in the literature. We discuss the consequences and the considerable diagnostic and therapeutic problems that arise.
