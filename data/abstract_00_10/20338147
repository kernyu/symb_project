Since 2008, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has been collecting data from the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) on resistance to first- and second-line drugs against tuberculosis (TB). In 2008, the proportion of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) was 6.0% of the total case load for 25 countries reporting data. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR TB) reporting has increased since 2007 and was observed in 7.3% of the MDR TB cases in 13 reporting countries. MDR TB remains a threat and XDR TB is now established within the EU/EEA borders.
