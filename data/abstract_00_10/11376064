Epidemiological evidence suggests that some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are more prone to dissemination than others. We studied 72 MRSA strains, collected through nationwide MRSA surveillance in 1992 through 1999 and known to be either (i) sporadic, (ii) local outbreak strains spread within one hospital, or (iii) epidemic strains spread among hospitals, by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, hybridization of the mec hypervariable region (HVR), and ribotyping. Our results show that two main groups can be identified among these strains. The first group includes mainly nonepidemic, nonmultiresistant MRSA strains showing a specific mec HVR hybridization pattern, A, in combination with a variety of ribotypes. The other group includes multiresistant strains with mec HVR hybridization pattern B or C in association with closely related ribotype a or b. Sixty-four percent (9 of 14) of Finnish epidemic MRSA strains belong to the latter group. These findings support the existence of differences in epidemic potential among MRSA strains.
