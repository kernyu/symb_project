Brazil has the largest number of HIV cases of any single country in Latin America - over 600,000. Recently, investigators have begun to characterize the extent of neurological morbidity due to HIV in this country. During 2005 and 2006, the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health cosponsored two meetings of experts aimed at summarizing existing knowledge of HIV and its neurological complications in Brazil. Topics addressed ranged from clinical neurobehavioral aspects to molecular biology. Experts attending the meeting considered fruitful directions for future research.
