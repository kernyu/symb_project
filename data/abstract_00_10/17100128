The 'Stichting Werkgroep Antibioticabeleid' (SWAB; Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy) has developed an evidence-based guideline for the empirical antimicrobial treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in hospitalised adult patients. The choice of treatment is based on recent Dutch data on the resistance ofuropathogens to the most frequently used antibiotics. The first choice for empirical antibiotic treatment in a patient with a complicated UTI is a 2nd or 3rd generation cephalosporin or the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin. Amoxicillin-clavulanic-acid intravenously is the second empirical choice. The treatment duration must be at least 10 days. The treatment must be adjusted after the results of the urine culture become known and made more specific if possible. Oral treatment can be given if the patient's clinical situation allows it. There are separate recommendations for the treatment ofUTIs in the following patient categories: men, pregnant women, patients with a urinary catheter, patients with diabetes mellitus and patients with renal diseases, congenital polycystic kidney disease or pyocystis.
