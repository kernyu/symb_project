The objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between molecular epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of MRSA during a four-year period. In this aim, we determined the antibiotype of all MRSA identified during a yearly period of 3 months and typed 50 consecutive non-replicate MRSA isolates of each year. We also recorded antibiotic use. Susceptibility rates to gentamicin, tobramycin and ofloxacin remained stable, respectively, 95, 16 and 4%. In contrast, the proportion of MRSA susceptible to erythromycin progressively increased from 7.0% to 32.5% (P < 0.001). PFGE analysis of genomic DNA from the 200 isolates revealed 15 different clones. We identified two epidemic clones, which contained 150 (clone A) and 28 isolates (clone C), respectively. The proportion of isolates belonging to clone A decreased during the study from 86% to 66%. Conversely, clone C increased from 4% to 22%. The increase of erythromycin-susceptibility within MRSA was caused by the emergence of clone C. Non-epidemic strains were more frequently susceptible to ofloxacin (31.8% vs. 1.1%) and tobramycin (45.4% vs. 16.8%) than epidemic strains. Antimicrobial use had not significantly varied during the study. The proportion of beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and aminosides was 71.8, 13.9, 5.0 and 3.8% of the total antibiotic use, respectively. In our hospital, MRSA isolates became more susceptible to antimicrobial of minor use. The selection pressure exerted by beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones was in favor of the spread of strains resistant to these both major antibiotic classes.
