EAE development in SJL/J mice is age and sex dependent: young males are EAE resistant; females and adult males are EAE susceptible. By studying splenocytes' IFNgamma and NO production and the induction or the suppression of actively induced EAE by manipulating NO systemic levels, we provide evidence that the failure of young male SJL/J mice to develop EAE lies in the activation of the innate immune system by the immunising stimulus.
