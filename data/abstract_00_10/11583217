Hospital infection prevention and control programs rely extensively on diagnostic microbiology laboratory testing. However, specimens for microbiological evaluation are less likely to be obtained from elderly residents of long-term-care facilities (LTCFs). In this article, issues regarding laboratory utilization and the potential role of the microbiology laboratory in infection prevention and control programs in LTCFs are reviewed. The role of the laboratory in infection surveillance, in the management of antimicrobial resistance, and in outbreak investigation are highlighted.
