The management of chronic hepatitis B poses specific problems in the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, because therapeutic approaches have to address both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV infections. Response to interferon (IFN-alpha) is lower in HBV-HIV-coinfected than in HIV-negative subjects, especially in patients in advanced stages of immunosuppression. Thus far, there are no data on the performance of the new pegylated forms of IFN-alpha in HBV- and HIV-coinfected persons. After prolonged use of lamivudine, resistance develops in the majority of HBV-HIV-coinfected patients treated with the drug. The more recently approved tenofovir has shown excellent short-term results, and data from longer follow-up studies are eagerly awaited. Several drugs with combined anti-HIV and anti-HBV activity have recently been approved (emtricitabine) or are currently under development. Preliminary results with some of them are quite promising and probably will widen the therapeutic armamentarium against hepatitis B in patients with HIV infection.
