BACKGROUND: In the last years, highly active antiretroviral therapy has decreased AIDS-associated mortality of patients dramatically. Due to this prolonged lifetime, the emergence of resistance against antiretroviral therapy has increased. Additionally, cross-resistance within the classes of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI) complicates HIV therapy. Development of new classes of therapeutic agents can help avoiding cross-resistance. Fuzeon, the first agent in the new class of fusion inhibitors, should be combined with as many effective antiretroviral agents as possible. CASE REPORT: The course of a 106-week therapy in a patient infected with a multiresistant virus is described. CONCLUSION: Fusion inhibitor Fuzeon represents a new option for patients having multiple resistance against HAART.
