PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic status of the thyroid in children with goiter after the use of iodinated dietary salt for 3 years in a region of endemic iodine deficiency. METHODS: Sixty-six children between 7 and 12 years of age were included in the study. Three groups were constituted according to sonographically measured thyroid volume and urinary iodine excretion levels. Group 1 included 11 children with thyroid volumes greater than the 97th percentile according to age and sex criteria suggested by the World Health Organization International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders and urinary iodine level lower than 100 microg/l. Group 2 included 30 children with thyroid volumes greater than the 97th percentile and urinary iodine level equal to or higher than 100 microg/l. The control group included 25 children who had normal thyroid volume and urinary iodine level. All children were examined by thyroid duplex sonography. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistance index (RI) were measured in the inferior thyroid artery bilaterally. RESULTS: PSV in group 1 was significantly higher than in group 2 and in the control group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). There was no significant difference between the PSV of group 2 and the control group. The RI in groups 1 and 2 was significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). There was no significant difference between the RIs of group 1 and group 2. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an effect of iodination on thyroid hemodynamics before the size of the hyperplastic thyroid returned to normal, in keeping with normalization of the urinary iodine level.
