In order to minimize the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains among common pathogens seen in primary care in Stockholm County, the County Medical Officer in 1995 established a multidisciplinary regional STRAMA-group (Swedish Strategic Programme for the Rational Use of Antimicrobial Agents and Surveillance of Resistance). The group started out by studying antibiotic sensitivity for common pathogens in the County and in Sweden. Then the group analyzed the use of antibiotic drugs and differences in prescribing patterns among different groups of physicians in the County. In order to minimize resistance and achieve the goal of optimal use of antibiotics the group decided to publish guidelines for primary care physicians treating patients with respiratory tract infections (printed in 1997) and urinary tract infections (printed in 1999). In this article we present the guideline for urinary tract infections.
