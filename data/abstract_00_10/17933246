The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of PER-1 type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated in Hacettepe University Adult Hospital. Sixty-seven non-duplicate P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with nosocomial infections between January 2002 and December 2004 were included in the study. The isolates were identified at species-level by Sceptor (Becton Dickinson, USA) system, and all the strains were stored at -80 degrees C until further testing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for the detection of (bla)PER-1 genes, and PFGE analysis was used to investigate their genetic relatedness. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of the PER-1 positive isolates were determined by Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) method. According to the results of PCR, 22.7% (15/67) of the isolates were positive for PER-1 enzyme. Those 15 (bla)PER-1 positive isolates showed eight different PFGE patterns, indicating the presence of multiple clones. Of the PER-1 positive P. aeruginosa isolates, nine were resistant to imipenem/meropenem, and 11 were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and tobramycin. The epidemiological investigation of multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa should give important clues for the initial empirical therapy, especially in certain geographic locations where ESBL-producing P. aeruginosa strains seemed to be highly prevalent.
