The incidence of disease and nosocomial infections produced by non tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) has increased in immunocompetent patients, but also and more frequently, in immunosuppressed patients. Several studies have disclosed that mycobacteria are more resistant to biocides than non-sporulating bacteria; in addition, some species are particularly resistant. The biocide action of sodium hypochloride and glutaraldehyde on Mycobacterium aviumintracellulare, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium chelonae was studied, using a modified Kelsey Maurer test. For the different species, both the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal action time were determined. Effectiveness of sodium hypochloride and glutaraldehyde against the different mycobacterial species varied. The same was true for different isolates of the same species. Sodium hypochloride effective MIC and exposure time (killing of 99.99% of all NTM) were 0.2% and 5 minutes, respectively. In order to achieve 100% killing, 0.5% MIC and 15 minute exposure were needed. In the case of glutaraldehyde, 99.99% of the bacteria were killed with 1% MIC and a 15 minute exposure. An effectiveness of 100% was achieved with a 2% MIC of glutaraldehyde and a 15 minute exposure. Sodium hypochloride and glutaraldehyde are effective biocides for mycobacteria. The first biocide is cheap and effective at low concentrations, but its corrosive and oxidant nature makes it impossible for use in hospitals or with laboratory equipment. Glutaraldehyde (neither corrosive nor oxidant) is a safe alternative for disinfection of this type of equipment. However, it is important to bear in mind that these pathogens may develop resistance to biocides.
