Among 120 Escherichia coli isolates from Thai patients, 37 and 9 isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and suspected ESBL producers respectively while 5 E. coli isolates from 120 Thai healthy adults were suspected ESBL producers. Integrase (intl1) gene was detected in 99% of the clinical and 87% of the non-clinical isolates. Among 37 ESBL producers, percent recovery of bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV) and bla(VEB) was 78%, 78%, 8% and 8%, respectively. Twenty-five isolates of ESBL producers carried both bla(TEM) and bla(CTX-M), 2 isolates carried 3 genes (bla(TEM), blac(CTX-M), and bla(SHV)) and 3 showed no detectable bla gene. Among the 14 suspected ESBL producers, intl1 and bla(TEM) were detected in 13 isolates. ESBL producers from clinical samples were resistant to most of the tested antimicrobial agents compared to non-ESBL producers and isolates from healthy adults with about half of the latter susceptible to all tested antimicrobial agents. Only one clinical isolate was resistant to imipenem. Susceptibility to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole among the clinical isolates in ESBL producer group (27%) and non-producer group (33%) were comparable, whereas the percent susceptibility of the non-clinical isolates was about twice that of the clinical isolates.
