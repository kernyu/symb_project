An isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis was highly resistant to beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors. The resistant determinants of clinical isolate to imipenem, ceftazidim, cefriaxone and cefepime were conjugally nontransferable. The slow or nonenzymically mediated breakdown of imipenem and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams suggested the resistance of P. aeruginosa isolate to these drugs which may be attributed to both permeability and efflux. Impaired penetration of imipenem and other beta-lactams through the membrane was detected by a diminished expression of outer-membrane proteins of approximate molar mass of 46 and 39 kDa, matched to OprD and OprF, respectively. Efflux resistance mechanism for meropenem and beta-lactams has been ruled out since the isolate failed to express outer-membrane protein of approximately 50 kDa which is matched to the OprM protein channel. Thus, reduced permeability in the clinical isolate is the main mechanism conferring resistance against beta-lactams including imipenem.
