Fusarium isolates from 75 Italian patients were identified by molecular methods, and their susceptibilities to antifungals were tested in vitro. Fusarium verticillioides was the species most frequently isolated from deep-seated infections, and F. solani was the species most frequently isolated from superficial infections. F. solani isolates showed high azole MICs, while F. verticillioides isolates showed low posaconazole MICs.
