This study identified Cryptococcus neoformans varieties isolated from 35 patients at teaching hospital of the Federal University of the Triangulo Mineiro and evaluated the susceptibility to antifungal agents among these samples using the protocol M27-A2 from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The gattii variety was identified in 11.4% of the cases (n = 4). The minimum inhibitory concentration (mg/ml) of Cryptococcus neoformans neoformans isolates ranged from 0.062 to 2.000 (amphotericin B), 0.250 to 8.000 (fluconazole), 0.062 to 1.000 (itraconazole) and 0.125 to 1.000 (ketoconazole). The gattii variety presented a minimum inhibitory concentration range of 0.125 to 2.000 (amphotericin B), 0.250 to 16.00 (fluconazole), 0.062 to 1.000 (itraconazole) and 0.125 to 4.000 (ketoconazole). Two isolates resistant to itraconazole and two resistant to amphotericin B (one isolate of each variety per antifungal agent) were found. These data show the importance of determining the variety and minimum inhibitory concentration of Cryptococcus neoformans isolates, in order to monitor resistance development and enable better treatment for cryptococcosis.
