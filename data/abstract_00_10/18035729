Etiological structure, patterns and antibiotic resistance mechanisms of gramnegative nonfermenting pathogens of nosocomial infections isolated from patients in intensive care units and surgical departments were investigated. One hundred thirty one clinical isolates, including 86 (65.6%) isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 45 (34.4%) isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii were tested. Carbapenems and cefoperazone/sulbactam showed the highest activity against the tested isolates. Eleven carbapenem resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were detected. The strains were found to possess genetic determinants of the VIM group encoding metal beta-lactamases.
