Two glycopeptide analogues of vancomycin and teicoplanin have been developed with improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters. Dalbavancin was derived from teicoplanin, and telavancin is a derivative of vancomycin. The half-life of dalbavancin in humans is 147-258 h (6-11 days) allowing for weekly administration. Dalbavancin possesses more potent in vitro activity than vancomycin or teicoplanin. Dalbavancin has been investigated in uncomplicated and complicated skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) in clinical trials and has demonstrated equivalent or superior (versus vancomycin only) efficacy versus comparators. Telavancin exhibits a dual mechanism of action, low potential for resistance development and is active against resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Clinical trials involving SSSIs have demonstrated equivalent or superior (versus vancomycin for MRSA) efficacy compared with a standard therapy. Both telavancin and dalbavancin show promise as alternative treatments for patients with serious infections caused by resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
