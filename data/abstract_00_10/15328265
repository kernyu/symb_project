A nationwide survey was conducted in Finland to estimate prevalence of bovine mastitis, distribution of mastitis pathogens, and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different mastitis pathogens. In total, 12,661 quarter milk samples were collected from 3282 dairy cows at 216 farms. These were randomly selected from a database covering all Finnish dairy farms. Quarter milk samples collected by the dairy advisors were submitted for somatic cell counting, bacteriological examination, and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. If the milk SCC of a cow or of a quarter exceeded 300,000/mL, the cow was defined as having mastitis. The results were compared with those of a previous survey done in 1995. The prevalence of mastitis continued to decrease from 38% in 1995 to 31% in 2001. Compared with the study from 1995, the number of quarters with bacterial growth in 2001 increased significantly from 21.0 to 33.5%. This mainly resulted from increased prevalence of Corynebacterium bovis. Coagulase-negative staphylococci remained the most common bacterial group, comprising almost one-half of the pathogens isolated, whereas the relative number of Staphylococcus aureus isolations decreased from the time of the previous study. According to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the enterococci demonstrated the highest level of resistance. Compared with the other Nordic countries, penicillin resistance among the staphylococci was still at a relatively high level in Finland (52.1 and 32.0% for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively). Streptococci isolated from mastitis were very susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, as also found in the previous survey in 1995.
