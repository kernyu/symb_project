Myxoma is the most common type of cardiac tumour in all age groups. It may simulate infective endocarditis but is rarely infected. We describe one case of infected left atrial myxoma caused by Enterococcus faecalis. Combined therapy, consisting of surgical management and antimicrobial therapy, was used. Histological examination of the excised tumour revealed a typical myxoma with infiltrates of neutrophils. Few cases of infected atrial myxomas have been reported in the literature.
