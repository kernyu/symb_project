Infections of the lower respiratory tract, such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), comprise the more serious respiratory tract infections (RTIs), and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in groups such as the very young, the elderly and those with co-morbid illness. Up to 80% of community-acquired RTIs are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis and are usually treated empirically. However, antibacterial resistance among common respiratory tract pathogens currently threatens the usefulness of existing therapies. The new ketolide antibacterial, telithromycin, has been developed specifically to provide optimal empirical treatment of community-acquired RTIs in the face of widespread antibacterial resistance. Telithromycin 800 mg once-daily offers efficacy equivalent to currently available antibacterials in the treatment of lower RTIs. Moreover, telithromycin demonstrates excellent activity in the treatment of CAP and AECB patients at risk for increased morbidity and mortality, including elderly patients, those with severe infections, and those with CAP complicated by pneumococcal bacteraemia. Telithromycin is also extremely effective in the treatment of patients with lower RTIs caused by atypical and intracellular pathogens (such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Chlamydophila [Chlamydia] pneumoniae--increasingly recognized as important aetiological agents of RTIs, particularly CAP), or by pathogens resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides. Telithromycin therefore represents a promising new agent for the empirical treatment of community-acquired RTIs.
