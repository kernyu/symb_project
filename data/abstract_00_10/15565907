The current document bestows an expert synopsis of key new information presented at the 43rd Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) meeting in 2003. Data is presented on the socio-political aspects of and policies on antimicrobial prescribing, novel mechanisms of resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and current epidemiological trends in global resistance. Novel information on new (and existing) antimicrobial agents--new penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams and oxipenem inhibitors, ketolides, glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones (and hybrids), peptides, daptomycin, aminomethylcyclines, glycylcyclines, and newer formulations of agents such as amoxycillin-clavulanate--provides renewed hope that resistant pathogens can be controlled through use of more potent agents. Improved strategies for the use of existing antimicrobial agents, such as the use of high-dose regimens, short-course therapy, also may delay or reduce the development of resistance and preserve the value of our antibiotic armamentarium.
