Increased risk of coronary heart disease has emerged as a long-term concern among HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. HIV-infected patients may have modifiable risk factors for heart disease that are associated with HIV itself, antiretroviral therapy, or factors unrelated to HIV. Dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus are often multifactorial in origin. Patients with lipodystrophy frequently have a constellation of metabolic changes that may predispose them to accelerated atherosclerosis. There is also concern about contributions of chronic inflammation and prothrombotic tendencies in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease in the HIV-infected population. Several epidemiological studies support an increased relative risk of myocardial infarction in HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Although absolute risk appears low in the short term, patients may accrue significant risk over time. Clinicians are advised to assess coronary heart disease risk in HIV-infected patients and to intervene to reduce the impact of modifiable risk factors.
