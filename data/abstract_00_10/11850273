Amoxicillin at doses of 0.2 to 5 mg/kg of body weight was administered for the treatment of pneumococcal otitis media in a gerbil model. Doses greater than or equal to 2.5 mg/kg, which resulted in concentrations in middle ear fluid of > or = 1.4 microg/ml and concentrations in serum higher than the MIC (1 microg/ml) for > or = 14% of the dosing interval, were both clinically and bacteriologically effective.
