UNLABELLED: Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection is one of the most frequent infections transmitted on sexual intercourse. In the last decades, a significant numbers of gonococcus strains were resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, quinolones and, in the last period, resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines too. The purpose of this study was to monitor the trend of N. gonorrhoeae isolates from 2004-2008, in Suceava County, North-East region of Romania. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae isolates from clinical cases in 48 males and 12 females to penicillin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, augmentin, clarithromycine, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone, was determine by disc diffusion method, using WHO reference strains and NCCLS criteria of interpretation. The isolation and identification of N. gonorrhoeae strains was carried out using classical microbiological algorithm, and miniAPI galleries. RESULTS: A high proportion of strains were resistant to tetracycline and penicillin (70 and 80% respectively); 95% of strains were sensitive to ceftriaxone, one strains was resistant and 2 of them (3.33%), intermediate resistant. For all other tested antibiotics the level of resistant strains varied from 55 to 65%. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first one regarding the level of antibiotics resistance of N. gonorrhoeae strains in Suceava County. Penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycine, amoxicillin, and augmentin can not be indicated as treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infection because of high level of resistance. An active and comprehensive studies for monitoring and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae needs to be established in all regions of the country, as support of new therapeutical treatment scheme.
