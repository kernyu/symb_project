A Real-time PCR assay was developed by using Taqman-MGB probes to screen mutations at codons Ser79 and Asp83 of Streptococcus pneumoniae parC. One hundred and thirty levofloxacin-susceptible and forty-two levofloxacin-resistant clinical strains were assayed. Mutations at codon 79 were found among all the levofloxacin-resistant strains. Mutations at codon 79 or 83 were found in ten levofloxacin-susceptible strains. This procedure is a reliable method for a rapid detection of mutations in the QRDRs of parC gene of S. pneumoniae and could be carried out in a diagnostic laboratory for some high-risk patients or in epidemiological surveys.
