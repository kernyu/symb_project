Leptomycin B (LMB) is a specific inhibitor of Crm1-dependent nuclear export of proteins. The replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) is normally highly sensitive to LMB; a resistant HSV variant, however, was isolated by serial passages of the virus. Analysis of marker transfer and viral DNA sequences revealed that a single amino acid substitution within the ICP27 gene is responsible for conferring this resistance.
