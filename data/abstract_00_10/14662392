Fifty years of making analogs based on less than ten antibacterial scaffolds has resulted in the development and marketing of over 100 antibacterial agents but, with the exception of the oxazolidinone core, no new scaffolds have emerged in the past 30 years to address emerging resistance problems. As the support for antibacterial research shifts away from large pharmaceutical companies, a wave of biotechnology companies have pursued a diverse choice of targets resulting in several novel classes of agent in late-stage development. Although critical for certain resistance niche needs, these agents are unlikely to provide the solution to the requirement for a major novel scaffold class of antibacterials.
