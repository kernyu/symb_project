Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among patients receiving hemodialysis, parenteral nutrition and chemotherapy. Antibiotic-lock therapy (ALT) represents a promising technique in the modern treatment of CRBSIs. In this review, we attempt to clarify the potential role of ALT in the treatment of long-term catheter-related bacteremia, based on the available evidence from published studies reporting on this issue. We identified 28 articles that were considered appropriate to be included in our review, only three of which were comparative studies. There is some evidence that ALT administered concurrently with systemic therapy may represent a significant therapeutic approach for CRBSIs involving long-term catheters. Prolonged infection-free catheter survival in the reported series is suggestive of sterilization of the catheters by ALT. The only reported comparison shows better outcome with ALT than with catheter exchange. Immunodeficient states, such as HIV, and the use of totally implanted devices instead of tunneled catheters may predispose to CRBSI treatment failure. No serious adverse effects, such as emergence of resistance or increased infectious complications, were found to be associated with the use of ALT in the reviewed studies. However, more comparative studies should be performed to examine this important therapeutic issue further.
