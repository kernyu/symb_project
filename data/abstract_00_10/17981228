The global prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and its associated serious sequelae demand technologically advanced techniques of management. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) plays a key role in the diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment of chronic hepatitis B. NAT includes quantitative PCR-based HBV DNA assays, HBV genotyping, tests for mutations associated with resistance to antiviral medications, and assays to detect precore and core promoter mutations. This article reviews the uses of NAT in the diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B.
