A new isoflavonoid, together with four known isoflavonoids, was isolated from the roots of Erythrina poeppigiana. The chemical structure was determined by extensive spectroscopic studies, and then its antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was investigated. The new isoflavonoid was identified as 3,9-dihyroxy-10-gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl-6a,11a-dehydropterocarpan (compound 1). Compound 1 inhibited bacterial growth most potently of the five isolates, and had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 125 microg/ml against thirteen MRSA strains. Inhibitory activity was based on bactericidal action and viable cell number reduced by approximately 1/10,000 after 4 h incubation with compound 1. Despite intense bactericidal action against MRSA, compound 1 never resulted in leakage of 260 nm-absorbing substances from bacterial cells. Compound 1 (12.5 microg/ml) completely inhibited incorporation of radio-labeled thymidine, uridine and leucine into MRSA cells. Although glucose incorporation was also markedly inhibited by the compound, the amount of glucose incorporated by bacterial cells increased gradually with incubation time. These findings suggest that compound 1 exhibits anti-MRSA activity by interfering with incorporation of metabolites and nutrients into bacterial cells or by affecting the nucleic acids of MRSA cells. Furthermore, this new compound could be a potent phytotherapeutic agent for treating MRSA infections.
