Studies published to date regarding on-treatment outcome prediction during chronic hepatitis B therapy were reviewed. Studies have shown that initial virological responses in terms of week 24 serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels are associated with therapeutic outcomes of 1-year pegylated interferon-alpha and entecavir therapy, and weeks 52 or 104 of lamivudine and telbuvudine therapy. HBV DNA levels at week 48 are also associated with long-term adefovir therapy outcomes. Conceptual on-treatment adjustment and strategies have been proposed; however, this approach seems only necessary during therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues with substantial risk of drug resistance. In addition, studies are needed to decide whether switching to or adding on a second drug, and with which drug, is the most cost-effective strategy.
