The mechanism of macrolide resistance was investigated in 251 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates with reduced susceptibility to erythromycin (erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae [ERSP]) collected during the period from 2000 to 2004 in Korea. Among these strains, erm(B) was the most prevalent pneumococcal macrolide resistance genotype. In particular, dual mechanisms of both the erm(B) and mef(A) genes were detected in 77 (30.7%) of 251 ERSP isolates. All of the 77 ERSP isolates, with dual erm(B) and mef(A), showed resistance to 2 or more antimicrobial agents, including penicillin, cefotaxime, clindamycin, tetracycline, and levofloxacin. Serotypes 19F, 23F, 19A, 14, 11A, 6B, 6A, and 9V accounted for 73.3% of ERSP isolates. Most of the strains with serotypes 19F (77.2%) or 19A (87.5%) had the dual erm(B) and mef(A) genes. The prevalence and spread of serotype 19F or 19A isolates may have contributed to the high rate of macrolide-resistant pneumococci in Korea. In addition, we identified the emergence of a macrolide-nonsusceptible nonvaccine serotype 35B, which carries mef(A)-mediated resistance to macrolides. These findings emphasize the need for a continuous monitoring of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae in Korea.
