A case of disseminated Aspergillus terreus infection in a patient with prolonged neutropenia after stem cell transplant for myeloma is reported. The isolate was resistant to amphotericin B in vitro, and the patient was successfully managed with surgical debridement and the recently licensed antifungal agent caspofungin. There are many challenges associated with treating invasive aspergillosis, particularly that due to A. terreus, and the early use of caspofungin should be considered.
