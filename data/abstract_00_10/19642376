OBJECTIVE: To determine the distributions of major pathogenic capsular types and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different serotypes of Streptococcus suis isolated from clinically healthy sows in China. METHODS: Tonsil specimens of clinically healthy sows from 10 different provinces in China were collected, a total of 421 S. suis were isolated. Capsular types of S. suis were decided using the sera agglutination reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using a broth microdilution method and the differences between serotypes were decided statistically. RESULTS: The prevalent capsular types of S. suis isolated from clinically healthy sows were 9 (26.6%), 3 (23.5%) and 7 (15.7%) types, respectively. 7.4% of isolates were confirmed to be S. suis type 2. Overall, differences in antimicrobial susceptibility among serotypes of S. suis were found. By comparison, lower resistance was observed for S. suis type 2 from clinically healthy sows. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of pathogenic S. suis serotypes from clinically healthy sows again indicates S. suis is a conditional pathogenic bacterium. Differential prevention and treatment regimes should be considered according to antimicrobial susceptibility of different serotypes of S. suis.
