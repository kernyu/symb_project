The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in three nursing homes (N=500) was 36.6%. No meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was detected. The following significant risk factors for S. aureus nasal carriage were identified: vascular cognitive impairment [odds ratio (OR)=0.31]; diabetes mellitus (OR=1.82); hypertension (OR=0.30); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR=1.86); stroke (OR=3.31); antibiotic therapy within the previous three months (OR=2.10); and level 2 care (defined as highly dependent, needing help in activities of daily living for up to 4h/day) (OR=1.97). Compared with other countries, the prevalence of MRSA nasal carriage in residents of German nursing homes is low.
