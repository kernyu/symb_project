Treatments for infections with hepatitis B and C viruses have recently developed markedly, and range from nonspecific interferon-based treatments to specific antiviral treatments, such as those that inhibit hepatitis virus-coded protein production or activity. These developments have contributed to the achievement of excellent enhancement of the antiviral effect. On the other hand, the development of specific antiviral therapies has created unprecedented problems. Antiviral drug-resistant strains of viruses have emerged, leading to a poor prognosis for infected patients. Clarification of the mechanisms underlying the emergence of such resistance to drugs will be useful for the treatment of such patients. In this review, we outline pathological conditions associated with hepatitis B and C viruses and their treatments, and discuss the current situation and mechanisms underlying the emergence of antiviral drug-resistant strains.
