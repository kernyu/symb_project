During 11 months 58 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kp) isolates were grown from 10 patients on a neurological early rehabilitation unit. The patients had no signs of infection but were colonized in the nose and trachea, and unusually only one had colonization in the gut. A single clone of ESBL-Kp was identified by pulse field gel electrophoresis. Strong hygienic precautions similar to those for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus patients prevented spread of the bacteria to other wards. However, rehabilitation for patients with severe neurological failures made it very difficult to follow hygienic requirements. Disinfection of mucous membranes was difficult. Eventually the application of a nasal spray containing povidone-iodine proved to be successful.
