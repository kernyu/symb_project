In experimental rabbit meningitis, cefepime given at a dose of 100 mg/kg was associated with concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of between 5.3 and 10 mg/L and a bactericidal activity of -0.61 +/- 0.24 Delta log(10) cfu/mL x h, similar to the standard regimen of ceftriaxone combined with vancomycin (-0.58 +/- 0.14 Delta log(10) cfu/mL x h) in the treatment of meningitis due to a penicillin- and quinolone-resistant pneumococcal mutant strain (MIC 4 mg/L). Compared with the penicillin-resistant parental strain, the penicillin- and quinolone-resistant mutant was killed more slowly by cefepime and ceftriaxone in time-killing assays in vitro over 8 h.
