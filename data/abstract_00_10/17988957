The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency, location and type of katG mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis collected from patients in southern endemic region of Iran. Drug susceptibility testing was determined by using the BACTEC system and CDC standard conventional proportional method. All 28 isolates were resistant to isoniazid (100%), rifampicine (14%) streptomycin (82%) and 8 (28%) was resistant to ethambutol. Mono-resistance to isoniazid was observed in four isolates (14%). In 21 isolates three types of mutations were found in codon 315: AGC-->ACC (Ser-->Thr) (61%), AGC-->AGG (Ser-->Arg) (3.5%) and AGC-->AAC (Ser-->Asn) (11%). Moreover, one type of mutation was seen in codons 311 (32%), 299 (28.5%), and 322 (21.5%). Of 28 isolates 12 (46%) found with one mutation, 7 (27%) had two, 5 (19%) had three and 2 (8%) revealed to have four mutations in katG gene. In nine isolates single mutation was observed in codon 311 (GAC-->TAC). This study indicates presence of multiple mutations in codon 315 and 299 among multiple drug-resistant (MDR) strains of M. tuberculosis collected from patients sputum having secondary infections in adjacent southern endemic border of Iran.
