OBJECTIVE: Elaboration of an empiric antibiotic regimen for women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) for a geographical area in eastern Hungary. STUDY DESIGN: Pathogens were identified by culturing or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 2215 patients with suspected PID between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2001. Empiric guidelines for PID treatment were based on susceptibility testing of the recovered bacteria, patient acceptance and cost-effectiveness of drugs and recommendations of earlier studies. RESULTS: Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 11%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 2%, Streptococcus spp. in 17%, Enterococcus spp. 9%, genital mycoplasmas in 25%, all obligate anaerobic pathogens in 30% of the patients. All antibiotics chosen for our regimen were effective in vitro against one or more recovered pathogens at least in 80%; this regimen produced 98% clinical cure rate in mild cases of PID. CONCLUSION: Early detection and prompt empirical antimicrobial therapy adapted to the local microflora and its resistance pattern can lead to good clinical results.
