Copper(II) alpha,omega-dicarboxylate complexes of general formulae, [Cu(O2C(CH2)nCO2)].xH2O, [Cu(O2C(CH2)nCO2) (phen)2].xH2O and [Cu(O2C(CH2),CO2)(bipy)y].xH2O (n = 1-8; y = 1, 2; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline; bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine) were synthesised. These copper complexes, some related manganese(II) complexes and the metal-free ligands were screened in vitro for their ability to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans. Metal-free 1,10-phenanthroline and all of the copper(II) and manganese(II) phenanthroline complexes were potent growth inhibitors, with only one bipyridine complex, [Cu(O2C(CH2)CO2)(bipy)2].2H2O, having moderate activity. The remaining substances were effectively inactive. Complexes which were active against C. albicans also proved effective against C. glabratta, C. tropicalis and C. kreusi with the manganese complexes retaining superior activity. For the phenanthroline complexes the active drug species is thought to be the dication [M(phen)2(H2O)n]2+ (M = Cu, Mn). Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all of the metal complexes and also to metal-free 1,10-phenanthroline. Only the copper phenanthroline complexes showed intermediate activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
