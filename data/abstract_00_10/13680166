Infectious complications occur in 60-100% of patients following high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and are commonly caused by Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriacea e) and Gram-positive cocci (such as enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci), which should be covered by empiric first-line antibiotic therapy. Less frequently, infections are caused by fungi and anaerobic bacteria, and initial therapy does not necessarily have to cover coagulase-negative staphylococci, oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), anaerobic bacteria and fungi. Patients who already receive antibiotics and develop pulmonary infiltrates should immediately be treated with systemic antifungals. Patients with fever and diarrhea or other signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal or perianal infection should be treated with antibiotics covering anaerobic bacteria and enterococci. Clinically stable patients with skin infections or central venous catheter-related infections can be treated with standard empiric antibiotic therapy including a beta-lactam active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with or without an aminoglycoside, and should only receive glycopeptides if they do not respond to first-line therapy within 72 hours, become clinically unstable, have severe mucositis, or when resistance against the empiric antibiotics is demonstrated. Recombinant hematopoietic growth factors should not be added routinely but may be considered in life-threatening situations such as invasive pulmonary mycoses or sepsis.
