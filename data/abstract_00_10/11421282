Some members of the genus Staphylococcus are important human pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters of pathogenic staphylococci are often responsible for antibiotic resistance and for the uptake of essential solutes and are therefore being considered as targets for novel antistaphylococcal drugs. Other ABC transporters are involved in the biosynthesis of a special class of peptide antibiotics, the lantibiotics, and in self-protection of the producer against them.
