Fungal infections are among the major causes of morbidity in cancer patients. In order to optimize the treatment of such patients, it is critical to determine the type of fungus causing infection as well as its susceptibility to antifungals. This study was undertaken to the study resistance of Candida spp. isolated from blood cultures of cancer patients to ketoconazole (KET), fluconazole (FLU), amphotericin B (AmpB), and flucytosine (FCU). A modified NCCLS M 27-A method was used to evaluate the activity of the species. Of the 56 Candida albicans isolates, 7 (12.5%) were resistant to FLU (MIC > or = 64 microg/ml), 6 (10.7%) were resistant to KET (MIC > or = 64 microg/ml) and 3 (5.3%) were resistant to FCU (MIC > or = 32 microg/ml). One (14.3%) of 7 C. parapsilosis isolates was resistant to FLU (MIC > or = 64 microg/ml). One (33.3%) of 3 C. tropicalis isolates was resistant to KET (MIC > or = 64 microg/ml). None of the C. guilliermondii or C. pelliculosa isolates was resistant to KET, FLU, AmpB, or FCU. Based on these results, AmpB is an effective antifungal agent that can be used against all Candida isolates.
