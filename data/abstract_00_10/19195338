Although the list of clinical complications associated with HIV therapy continues to grow, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Metabolic abnormalities, such as dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease continue to top the list, but there is an increasing appreciation of the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy on body composition, bone metabolism, muscle function and autonomic nervous system control of lipid and glucose metabolism. The 10th International Workshop on Adverse Drug Reactions and Lipodystrophy in HIV brought together physicians and researchers in the area of HIV management with world experts involved in adipose tissue metabolism and lipid regulation, bone and muscle metabolism and renin-angiotensin and blood pressure control to review and discuss recent findings in these areas. The data presented at the meeting highlight that studies of adipose tissue remain a major focus of attempts to unravel the pathophysiology that accompany lipodystrophy associated with HIV infection and/ or its therapy. There is also a growing appreciation and understanding of the direct role of HIV in the development of various comorbidities, including bone disease, cardiac dysfunction and neuropathologies, including peripheral neuropathy. Two key emerging themes were those of mitochondrial dysfunction and a heightened basal inflammatory state, exemplified by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and markers such as C-reactive protein. These might prove to be the common denominators that link HIV-associated pathologies with diverse organ systems.
