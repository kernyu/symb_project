The complex study of 104 vaginal samples from patients with urogenital uroplasmosis was carried out. U. parvum were detected in 67.3% patients, U. urealyticum--in 12.5% and in 20.1% cases--two species were registered at the same time. Isolation of clinical significant concentration of both ureaplasma (> 10(4) CFU/ ml) was detected in about 50% of cases. Expression of inflammation of vaginal mucus depended on the level of concentration of infection agents. U. parvum were associated with bacterial vaginosis, while in urogenital candidosis U. parvum was detected rarer than U. urealyticum. The dominant numbers of clinical ureaplasma were high sensitive to "new" macrolides and chinolons, however the high percent of isolates were resistant to erytromicin and doxiciclin.
