Reduced susceptibility to vancomycin has been reported among clinical isolates of Staphylococcus in previous studies. The present study describes a heteroresistant Staphylococci strain from the cerebrospinal fluid of a 17 day-old premature male infant with neonatal meningitis. Screening was done for 44 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci using Wong 's techniques (Disk-agar method with vancomycin-salt agar to demonstrate satellitism around an aztreonam disk). Strains were susceptible to vancomycin as disclosed by an automated antimicrobial susceptibly test (Microscan System Dade Behring). This is the first report of heterogeneous resistance to vancomycin in Mexico and an early warning for the possible emergence of vancomycin resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococcus in our country.
