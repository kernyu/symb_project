PURPOSE: To determine the safety and efficacy of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with taxane resistant metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three taxane resistant metastatic breast cancer patients were treated with gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 IV infusion over 30 min on days 1 and 8, and with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 by IV infusion over 1 h on day 1 in 21 day cycles. RESULTS: Of the 30 evaluable patients, there were 9 (30%) partial responses and no complete response, an overall objective response rate of 30%. Median time to progression and median survival duration for all study subjects were 7 (95% CI 5.1-8.9 months) and 15 months (95% CI 10.5-19.5 months), respectively. Toxicities included grade 3 and 4 leucopenia in 10 (30%), thrombocytopenia in 6 (18%), anemia in 2 (6%) and oral mucositis in 2 (6%). No grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, or nausea/vomiting was observed, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: The described gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination was found to be an active and tolerable salvage regimen in patients with taxane resistant metastatic breast cancer.
