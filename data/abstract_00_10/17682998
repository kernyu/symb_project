BACKGROUND: The management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection is challenged by the selection of patients for therapy, options for antiviral medications, and inconsistency in published treatment guidelines. METHODS: A survey was sent to 161 sites in a multicenter HIV clinical trials group to assess HBV screening, criteria for initiation of therapy, and treatment choices for patients coinfected with HBV and HIV. RESULTS: Of 161 sites, 78 completed the survey (response rate, 48.4%). Of these sites, 98.7% screened for HBV infection, 86% vaccinated HIV-infected patients who were not immune to HBV infection, and 79% made treatment decisions without referral to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist. Treatment recommendations varied; 42% of the sites initiated therapy when patients' levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were elevated and HBV DNA level was >10(5) copies/mL, whereas 49% of the sites initiated therapy in the presence of any detectable HBV DNA level. Antiviral treatment choices for patients who were not concurrently receiving antiretroviral therapy were lamivudine plus tenofovir, adefovir, or interferon. Patients concurrently receiving antiretroviral therapy received lamivudine plus tenofovir preferentially, followed by tenofovir plus emtricitabine, adefovir, or interferon. Ninety-one percent of the sites screened for hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of HIV-infected patients were screened and vaccinated for HBV infection and underwent surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma. Decisions regarding the performance of liver biopsy, threshold to initiate therapy, and criteria to discontinue therapy varied, reflecting inconsistencies in available treatment guidelines. Treatment decisions reflected concerns regarding future drug resistance in patients who are naive to antiretroviral therapy and the emergence of drug resistance in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.
