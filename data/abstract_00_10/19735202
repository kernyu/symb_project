A prospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence and the gene-cassette content of class 1 integrons in Escherichia coli of poultry and human origin. A total of 235 E. coli isolates were examined; 65 were derived from farm poultry, 80 from hospitalized, and 90 from nonhospitalized patients. Susceptibilities to a range of antimicrobial agents were determined by disk diffusion. Int1-specific polymerase chain reaction, conserved-segment polymerase chain reaction, and DNA sequencing were used to determine the presence, length, and content of integrons. The relatedness among the isolates was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of XbaI digests of genomic DNA. The integron carriage rate for poultry isolates was 49.2%, whereas the carriage rate for hospital isolates was 26.2% and for community 11.1%. Multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics) phenotypes were observed in 96.8% of the integron-positive isolates, whereas only 34.9% of nonintegron-carrying organisms were multidrug resistant (p < 0.001). Seven integron types ranging in size from 663 to 2674 bp were identified; six types were observed in poultry isolates, five in hospital, and three in community isolates. Each integron type carried a distinct gene-cassette combination. The most prevalent gene cassettes belonged to the aad and dfr families. Identical integrons were detected in E. coli of human and poultry origin. A large reservoir of integrons exists in E. coli of poultry origin. The horizontal transfer of class 1 integrons among bacteria of poultry and human origins may contribute in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance.
