We describe the molecular epidemiology of syphilis in San Francisco (SF) using Treponema pallidum specimens obtained from patients examined at the SF municipal sexually transmitted diseases clinic during 2004-2007. Of 69 specimens, 52 (75%) were subtype 14d9. Single subtype predominance might reflect a closely linked sexual network in SF.
