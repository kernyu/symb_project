Epidemiologic data indicate a large increase in cardiovascular risk in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Non-invasive investigations show increases in intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and coronary artery calcifications in patients with SLE, compared to controls. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors may fail to fully explain the high cardiovascular risk in SLE patients. Immunological disturbances and inflammation may indirectly contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease by inducing dyslipidemia and/or insulin resistance. The potential role for glucocorticoid therapy is controversial. Effective control of the disease would be expected to decrease the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. Careful attention should be given to controlling conventional risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity. Hypertension and/or dyslipidemia should be treated optimally. The appropriateness of antiplatelet therapy should be assessed.
