Malaria is one of the most significant causes of infectious disease in the world. The search for new antimalarial chemotherapies has become increasingly urgent due to the parasites' resistance to current drugs. Ellagic acid is a polyphenol found in various plant products. In this study, antimalarial properties of ellagic acid were explored. The results obtained have shown high activity in vitro against all Plasmodium falciparum strains whatever their levels of chloroquine and mefloquine resistance (50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 105 to 330 nM). Ellagic acid was also active in vivo against Plamodium vinckei petteri in suppressive, curative, and prophylactic murine tests, without any toxicity (50% effective dose by the intraperitoneal route inferior to 1 mg/kg/day). The study of the point of action of its antimalarial activity in the erythrocytic cycle of Plasmodium falciparum demonstrated that it occurred at the mature trophozoite and young schizont stages. Moreover, ellagic acid has been shown to potentiate the activity of current antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, mefloquine, artesunate, and atovaquone. This study also proved the antioxidant activity of ellagic acid and, in contrast, the inhibitory effect of the antioxidant compound N-acetyl-l-cysteine on its antimalarial efficacy. The possible mechanisms of action of ellagic acid on P. falciparum are discussed in light of the results. Ellagic acid has in vivo activity against plasmodia, but modification of the compound could lead to improved pharmacological properties, principally for the oral route.
