The drug transporter, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (ABCC2/Mrp2), is known to play important roles in excretion of various drugs. In the present study, we investigated whether Mrp2 is involved in the transport of micafungin, a newly developed antifungal agent. When Sprague-Dawley rats received an intravenous injection of micafungin (1 mg/kg) in combination with cyclosporine, the cyclosporine significantly delayed the disappearance of micafungin from plasma and decreased the systemic clearance and volume of distribution at steady-state of micafungin to 54% and 65% of the corresponding control values, respectively. When Sprague-Dawley rats received a constant-rate infusion of micafungin, cyclosporine significantly decreased the steady-state biliary clearance of micafungin (approximately 80%). A significant decrease in the biliary clearance of micafungin (~60%) was observed in Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats, which have a hereditary deficiency in Mrp2. The present findings at least suggest that Mrp2 is involved mainly in the hepatobiliary excretion of micafungin in rats.
