Yeasts of 17 processed fresh edible (raw) sea urchins obtained from seven countries were analyzed. In total, 45 to 7 x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/g of sea urchins were recovered, and 23 yeast species were identified. Of these species, six pathogenic yeasts (Candida albicans, C. sake, Debaryomyces hansenii, Pichia anomala, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and Trichosporon mucoides) were detected from 11 sea urchins (65%). As these yeasts are opportunistic pathogens, infections in healthy individuals normally will not occur, but it should be understood that processed fresh edible sea urchin includes such opportunistic yeast pathogens.
