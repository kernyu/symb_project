The incidence of inducible clindamycin resistance were studied in Milad Hospital of Tehran, Iran. Of 175 isolates of S. aureus 17 (9.7%) isolates showed inducible clindamycin resistance. Of 17 inducible clindamycin isolates of S. aureus, 11 strains were methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 6 isolates were methicillin susceptible S. aureus) (MSSA). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linozolide. We conclude that it is necessary to perform D-test for detection of inducible clindamycin in staphylococci in routine laboratory practices.
