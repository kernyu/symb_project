The spread of parasitic resistance has necessitated the development of new drugs and drug targets for the treatment of malaria. Microtubules, which have gained outstanding importance as target molecules for the development of anticancer drugs, are likely to be potent antimalarial targets. The clinical implementation of microtubule inhibitors has given rise to a detailed mechanistic understanding of their interaction with tubulin on the molecular level and their effects on the cellular level. By comparison, our knowledge on Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria, is rather poor. This article gives an overview on the microtubule inhibitors that have been explored in the parasite, reviews their effects on parasite growth and assesses their potential as novel antimalarials.
