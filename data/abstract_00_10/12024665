993 surgical site infection aerobic pathogens are isolated over a six-year period (I.1994-I.2000) by the Microbiology Laboratory at University Hospital "Tzaritza Joana". 224 (22.6%) of them are isolated from patients undergoing abdominal surgery in the Emergency Surgery Clinic. The period covers 3 years before the introduction of current single-dose perioperative prophylaxis (i.e. under the conditions of long-term one) as well as the next 3 years following its introduction in the Emergency Surgery Clinic. The changes of pathogens susceptibility patterns to single-dose drug schemes in both hospital elective abdominal surgery and emergency surgery clinics are followed during the whole period. Our microbial susceptibility data support the ecological expedience of single-dose approach categorically.
