Typing analyses of 378 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates collected between the years 2001 and 2005 from three northern representative regions of Tunisia revealed a highly homogeneous population. Indeed, 84.9 % of all tuberculosis (TB) cases were attributed to the Haarlem, LAM or T families. Strikingly, within each family, more than 60 % of TB cases were due to a single genotype. ST50 (Haarlem3) and ST42 (LAM9) genotypes were exceptionally predominant, representing 46.3 % of all typed isolates. ST50 showed an increased tendency for clustering and was more predominant in the extreme north of the country. By contrast, the more widespread ST42, which was apparently prevalent 17 years ago, displayed weak cluster individualization and a low transmission rate, consistent with its stable association with the Tunisian population. It is believed that both mass BCG vaccination, strictly applied for four decades, and the high endogamy rate that characterizes the Tunisian population could have profoundly shaped the population structure of M. tuberculosis by concurrently favouring the selection and accommodation of particular genotypes.
