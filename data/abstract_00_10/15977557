One hundred forty-seven Campylobacter were isolated using 3,204 samples taken from sporadic diarrheic patients from January 2001 to December 2003. The detection rate of Campylobacter in 16 to 30 year old patients (12.9%, 83/641) was significantly higher than that in patients less than 16 years of age, 5%, (29/1,155) (p < 0.001) and more than 30 years of age, 2.5% (35/1,408) (p < 0.001), respectively. The highest detection rate was obtained from the stool of males in the 16 to 30 year old range during the months from May to August, 26% (32/123). If the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoint for resistance of gentamicin (GM), erythromycin (EM), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), tetracycline (TC) were defined tentatively > or = 16 microg/ml, > or = 16 microg/ml, > or = 2 microg/ml, > or = 16 microg/ml, the resistant rate would be 0.0%, 0.0%, 22.0%, 42.8% in C. jejuni, 0.0%, 62.5%, 62.5%, 87.5% in C. coli, respectively. All the Campylobacter isolates were susceptible to GM. Three of the 8 C. coli isolates were multi-resistant in EM, CPFX, and TC. Five highly EM resistant strains with an MIC of > or = 512 microg/ml did not show any zone around the EM disk; 7 susceptible strains with an MIC of less than 16 microg/ml showed = zones of 24mm to 36mm and revealed a good correlation with the Etest method and the agar dilution method. Between the two time periods of January 2001-June 2002 and July 2002-December 2003, the resistant rate of CPFX in C. jejuni decreased from 27.5% to 15.5%, however, that was not significant decrease (p = 0.133).
