In gastroenterologic infections a calculated antibiotic therapy is not only determined by the suspected variety of bacterials usually associated with given symptoms but also by considerations of their potential side effects, pharmaokinetics and penetration as well as an assessment of the immune status of the patient. As some antibiotic combinations show synergistic activity whereas others are antagonistic or result in accumulated toxicity, this manuscript presents the antimicrobial profile of clinically important antibiotics including their side effects, kinetics, penetration and possible combinations. From these data recommendations for a rational and calculated antibiotic therapy of gastrointestinal infections are developed taking the guidelines of the respective scientific societies into consideration.
