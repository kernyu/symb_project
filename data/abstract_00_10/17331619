The in vitro activities of tachyplesin III were investigated against 20 multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates. Methods included minimal inhibitory concentrations, minimal bactericidal concentrations, time-kill studies, checkerboard titration method, endotoxin-binding activity and cytotoxicity assay. Overall the organisms were susceptible to the peptide at concentrations of 0.50-4 mg/l. Tachyplesin III completely inhibits the endotoxin procoagulant activity at 22.36 mg/l concentration. Fractional inhibitory concentration indexes demonstrated synergy between the peptide and betalactams or colistin. In conclusion, the intrinsic antibacterial and antiendotoxin activities and the synergistic interactions demonstrated with clinically used antibiotics make tachyplesin III valuable as potential candidate for new therapeutic strategies aimed to treat P. aeruginosa infection.
