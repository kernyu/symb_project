Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibiting decreased susceptibility to penicillin are isolated with an increasing prevalence in Turkey during the last decade. This study was undertaken to investigate the molecular epidemiology of non-penicillin-susceptible pneumococci isolated in Ankara, Turkey. Among a population of 246 pneumococci, 90 pneumococci with penicillin MIC > or = 0.1 microg/ml were serotyped, genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and sequence typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The overall resistance to penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin were 36.6%, 4%, 27.6%, 10.9%, 5.3%, 22.4%, 4.5%, 2%, and 0, respectively. The most frequent serotypes were 14, 23B, 9V, 19F, 19A, and 23F. PFGE types represented 17 genetic clusters. PFGE and MLST data revealed that there were isolates identical or closely related to the Spain(9V)-3 ST 156 clone, Portugal(19F)- 21 ST 177 clone, and Spain(23F)-1 ST81 clone. Eleven serotype 14 isolates with emerging resistance to penicillin belonged to the ST 230 complex, a predominantly susceptible clone. Serotype 19A, 19F, and 7F variants of the ST 230 clone were also identified in the study population. Eight serotype 23B isolates with a new ST 1349 (18-13-8-6-3-6-8) created another clone with no relation to the currently defined international clones. Although the pandemic clones Spain(9V)-3, Portugal1(9F)-21, and Spain(23F)-1 are present in our region, the emergence of a new 23B clone with a unique ST and the emergence of resistance in the ST230 clone, has presumably contributed to the increase in the prevalence of drug-resistant pneumococci in Turkey.
