Artemisinin and its derivatives are a potent new class of antimalarials, originated from Artemisia annua, L. The clinical efficacy of these drugs is characterized by an almost immediate onset and rapid reduction of parasitaemia. Their efficacy is high in such areas as well where multidrug-resistance is rampant, but in these areas, their combination with other (effective) antimalarials (e.g., mefloquine) is highly recommended. In this short review, the chemical structures, pharmacological properties, and clinical uses of artemisinin drugs are discussed.
