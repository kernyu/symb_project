OBJECTIVE: To evaluate simultaneous diagnosis of infection and molecular resistance testing of Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: Gastric biopsies were obtained from 26 rapid urease-positive and 51 rapid urease-negative test kits used to diagnose H pylori infection. Following glass bead-assisted DNA isolation, amplification of H pylori 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), glmM, and 23S rDNA target genes was performed. RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori DNA was successfully amplified from 100% (26/26) of urease-positive and 3.9% (2/51) of urease-negative gastric biopsies. Subsequent restriction enzyme-mediated digestion of 23S rDNA amplification products revealed that 17% (4/24) of urease-positive and H pylori DNA-positive biopsy specimens contained point mutations (A2142G or A2143G) associated with clarithromycin resistance. Helicobacter pylori DNA from gastric biopsies was successfully amplified 8 weeks following rapid urease testing. CONCLUSION: Helicobacter pylori genotyping may be used to detect macrolide-resistant H pylori in individuals prior to initiation of therapy or in patients refractory to anti-H pylori therapy. Two urease-negative specimens yielded Helicobacter DNA distinct from that of H pylori and indicated the need for further investigations of Helicobacter species present in the human stomach.
