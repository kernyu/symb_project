Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b are most commonly associated with bacterial meningitis accounting for almost 90% of reported cases of acute bacterial meningitis in infants over 60 days of age and young children. This work reviews the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in Europe and in the Mediterranean region as well as the antimicrobial susceptibility of the etiological agents.
