A new natural TEM derivative with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase activity, TEM-134, was identified in a ceftazidime-resistant clinical isolate of Citrobacter koseri. Compared to TEM-1, TEM-134 contains the following mutations: Q39K, E104K, R164H, and G238S. The bla(TEM-134) gene was not transferable by conjugation and, apparently, was chromosomally encoded. Expression studies with Escherichia coli revealed efficient cefotaximase and ceftazidimase activity for TEM-134.
