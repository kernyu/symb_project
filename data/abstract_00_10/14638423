In Escherichia coli, beta-lactam resistance usually depends on beta-lactamase production. AmpC chromosomal cephalosporinase hyperproduction is generally due to mutations in the ampC gene promoter. In order to study ampC expression in E. coli clinical strains, we have compared two methods: conventional and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). With both methods, ampC mRNA was found to be greatly increased in strains presenting -42 or -32 mutations in the ampC promoter, and moderately increased when a -11 mutation was present in the Pribnow box. Real-time RT-PCR represents a powerful tool combining amplification, fluorescent detection and analysis.
