The heavy use of veterinary antibiotics in modern animal production causes concern about risks of spreading antibiotic resistance after manure applications to agricultural fields. We report on a field study aiming at elucidating the fate of sulfonamide (SA) antibiotics in grassland soils and their transport to surface water. Two controlled manure applications were carried out under different weather conditions. After both applications, the SA concentrations in pore water and the total soil content declined rapidly. This stage of fast decline was followed by a second one during which the SA were rather persistent. More than 15% of the SAs applied were still present in the soil 3 months after application, always exceeding 100 microg/kg topsoil. The apparent SA sorption increased strongly with time. Accordingly, the risk for SA losses to water bodies decreased within 2 weeks to very low values. In contrast to SA concentrations in the soil, losses to the brook were strongly influenced by the weather conditions after the two manure applications. The overall losses were 15 times larger (about 0.5% of applied SA) during the wet conditions of May 2003 compared to the dry conditions following the first application (March 2003).
