Cytochrome p450 (CYP) inhibitors provide protection against myocardial infarction following both global and focal cardiac ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). We hypothesized that sulfaphenazole, an inhibitor of CYP2C6 and 9, also attenuates post-ischemic endothelial dysfunction by reducing CYP-mediated superoxide generation (which scavenges nitric oxide (NO)), thereby restoring NO bioavailability and vascular tone. Rat hearts were perfused in the Langendorff mode for 20 min in the presence, or absence, of sulfaphenazole and then subjected to 30 min global no-flow ischemia followed by 15 min reperfusion. Septal coronary resistance arteries were isolated and mounted on glass cannulae for measurements of luminal diameter. Preconstricted arteries were exposed to acetylcholine to elicit endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated vasodilation. Acetylcholine caused near maximal dilation in control tissues not subjected to I/R. Following I/R, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was reduced. Pretreatment with sulfaphenazole restored endothelial sensitivity to acetylcholine. Vasoresponsiveness to endothelium-independent vasodilators, sodium nitroprusside and isoproterenol, were also reduced following I/R. However, sensitivity to endothelium-independent vasodilators was not restored by pretreatment with sulfaphenazole. I/R-induced superoxide production was assessed by dihydroethidium staining of flash frozen hearts. Sulfaphenazole treatment significantly reduced superoxide production in arterial walls following I/R injury. We conclude that sulfaphenazole restores post-ischemic endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated vasodilation by reducing superoxide production, suggesting that CYP2C9 plays a key role in post-ischemic vascular dysfunction.
