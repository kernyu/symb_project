Antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively slows the progression of AIDS. However, drug resistance and/or toxicity can limit the utility of ART in many patients. In this study, we assessed whether a viral vector-based vaccine can be used as a therapeutic vaccine in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected monkeys. The effect of vaccinating SIVmac239-infected rhesus monkeys with an SIV gag and gp120-expressing adenovirus (Ad) vector vaccine and a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine was explored while being treated with ART. Rhesus monkeys were intravenously infected with 10 and 1000 TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of SIVmac239. Two months after SIV infection, the monkeys received a 4-month treatment with ART. Some of the monkeys were immunized with adenovirus-based vaccine and MVA-based vaccine with 2 months interval during ART. Viral load, CD4 count and SIV-specific immune responses were observed for 7 months after interruption of ART. The vaccinated animals had higher (i) CD4 counts, (ii) SIV-specific cell-mediated immune responses and (iii) anti-SIV-neutralizing antibody (Ab) titers than monkeys treated with ART alone. More importantly, the vaccination significantly reduced the SIV RNA load from animals infected with a low dose of SIV (10 TCID(50)). The anti-SIV cell-mediated and humoral responses induced by the vaccination was inversely correlated with a reduction in SIV viral load and positively correlated with an increase in CD4(+) T cell counts. These results suggest that vaccination can improve antiviral cell-mediated and humoral immunity, which may contribute to controlling viral replication.
