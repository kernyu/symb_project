The human multidrug resistance-1 gene (MDR1) is a dominant selectable and amplifiable marker in mammalian tissue culture cells. MDR1 is also being investigated as a gene therapy tool, both to protect normal cells against chemotherapy-related toxicity and to serve as an in vivo selectable marker for the overexpression of non-selectable therapeutic genes. The success of these strategies will depend on whether MDR1 expression can be sustained at levels high enough to confer a survival advantage on target cells. However, the MDR1 selection system is quite stringent, requiring high gene expression for transduced cells to survive in the presence of drug. The current report is a detailed molecular analysis of MDR1 selection stringency compared with the common neo selectable marker. A bicistronic vector encoding MDR1 and neo genes linked through an internal ribosome entry site was transferred into NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and K562 human leukemia cells; cells were then exposed to colchicine (to select for MDR1 expression) or to G418 (to select for neo expression). Surviving populations and individual clones of cells were analyzed for expression levels of MDR1 and neo gene products; resistance to colchicine, paclitaxel, and G418; level and integrity of bicistronic mRNA; and structural integrity, integration number, and copy number of vector DNA. These studies provide direct evidence that colchicine selection is more stringent than G418 selection; that increased selection pressure with colchicine leads to increased gene expression; that increased gene expression can be accommodated primarily by gene amplification, even within an individual transduced clone and starting from a single-copy proviral integration event; and that the clonal diversity of a transduced population of cells is influenced significantly by the stringency of selection. Taken together, these results have important implications for the potential utility of MDR1 as a selectable marker and as a gene therapy tool in hematopoietic cells.
