Genetic recombination and high rate of mutation increase HIV-1 diversity, allowing viruses to escape more easily from the host immune response or antiretroviral drugs. The recombinant nature of full-length HIV-1 genomic sequences derived from viruses infecting five epidemiologically unlinked individuals carrying HIV-1 non-B variants was investigated. Overlapping PCR amplifications followed by direct sequencing of viral products derived from plasma and phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Four viral sequences clustered with CRF06_cpx and one with CRF02_AG. However, subtyping of separate genes within the same genome revealed that four were recombinant forms involving different subtypes and/or CRFs with distinct breakpoints. Two specimens included CRF02_AG and CRF06_cpx sequences with several fragments from other HIV-1 clades along their genomes. Three rapid subtyping tools (Stanford, NCBI, and REGA) showed discrepant results when interpreting these viral sequences. This is the first description of CRF02_AG/CRF06_ cpx recombinants in Spain. The results highlight the tremendous heterogeneity of HIV-1 recombinant strains currently in circulation.
