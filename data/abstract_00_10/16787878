We report a case of refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) successfully treated with a combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FLU/CY). A 68-year-old man with concurrent PTCL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was treated effectively with 3-course CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) therapy, but PTCL relapse occurred and was resistant to ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) therapy. FLU/CY therapy led to complete remission, which was maintained for almost 14 months after a single course. We concluded that a FLU/CY regimen may be useful for attaining long-term remission in patients with refractory relapsed PTCL and should therefore be considered a valuable treatment choice.
