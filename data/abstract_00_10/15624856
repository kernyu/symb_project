OBJECTIVE: To perform the molecular characterization of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from pediatric patients and health care workers at the intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected during an outbreak in June 1996 were analyzed; eight were from patients and seven from health care workers of Mexico's Children's Hospital. Characterization of isolates was carried out by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) and serotyping, beta-Lactamase isoelectric focusing (IEF), and nucleotide sequencing of PCR products. RESULTS: Serotype 61 was predominant and correlated with genomic fingerprints of RAPD and PFGE in 11 of 15 isolates. One SHV-5-producer predominant clone with a high case-fatality rate was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular biology techniques are useful tools to characterize the K. pneumoniae clone isolated from patients and health care workers, suggesting potential cross-transmission. These data call for strengthening control programs to prevent dissemination of nosocomial infections in the studied hospital.
