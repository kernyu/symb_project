Strain differentiation of 66 clinical isolates of Candida albicans obtained from healthy dentate and complete denture wearers was performed. Resistogram method based on differences in the resistance of C. albicans isolates to sodium selenite, boric acid, cetrimide, sodium periodate and silver nitrate was used for strain differentiation. Of the 32 potential strains that can be distinguished, 14 different resistogram strains of C. albicans were found among the 66 isolates tested. Strain-C--was the most predominant (24.3% of total isolates), while strain A-CDE was the least predominant (1.5%). The results showed no particular association of certain strains with Candida infections in complete denture wearers. Sensitivity to antifungal agents showed that isolates from different strains were most sensitive to amphotericin B and nystatin and least sensitive to miconazole.
