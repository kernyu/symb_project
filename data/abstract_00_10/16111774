The construction is described of a HIV-1 proviral, eGFP-tagged plasmid that allows for the recombination of any selected env gene without the use of restriction enzymes and for the quantitation of the infection by the recombinant virus using flow cytometry. The system was tested showing that an isoleucine to valine substitution at residue position 37 of the HIV-1 gp41 impairs the fitness of the virus but does not lead by itself to T-20 resistance.
