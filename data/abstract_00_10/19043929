BACKGROUND: Selection and persistence of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-associated mutations during treatment interruptions (TIs) has been attributed to the long plasma half-life of these drugs. However, little is known about the contribution of variable NNRTI plasma levels before a TI. We evaluated the selection of NNRTI-related mutations and the coefficient of variation of NNRTI plasma concentrations during different TI periods. METHODS: The selection of NNRTI-related mutations was examined in 50 HIV type-1 (HIV-1)-infected patients on a virologically suppressive regimen who underwent TI guided by CD4+ T-cell counts and plasma viraemia. Population and clone-based sequencing of the reverse transcriptase coding region was performed using plasma HIV-1 RNA samples during TI and proviral DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells before TI. NNRTI plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC. RESULTS: In 7/50 treated patients, de novo and transient NNRTI-related mutations appeared when treatment was interrupted. Emergence of resistant variants (including K103N, Y181C or G190S) after interruption was associated with a higher coefficient of variation in NNRTI plasma concentrations during the treatment period. Moreover, minority HIV-1 variants containing different resistance patterns (V1061/A, K103R/E or Y188C/D/H) were detected regardless of NNRTI concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of NNRTI-associated mutations during TI appears to be associated with the variation of NNRTI plasma concentrations during the preceding treatment period. The selection of minority HIV-1 variants with different patterns of NNRTI resistance in the absence of drug pressure should be considered for the efficacy of future NNRTI-containing antiretroviral regimens.
