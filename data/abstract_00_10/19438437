BACKGROUND: An increasing number of antimycotics have become available for the treatment of dermatophytoses; however, there are reports suggesting recalcitrance to therapy or resistance of a dermatophyte against conventional treatment. Lipopeptides represent novel therapeutic drugs with a new mode of action. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of the lipopeptide Pal-Lys-Lys-NH(2) (PAL) alone and in combination with standard antifungal agents, such as fluconazole (FLU), itraconazole (ITRA) and terbinafine (TER) against 24 clinical isolates of dermatophytes belonging to four species. METHODS: A broth microdilution method following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations (M38-A) was used for testing drugs alone and in combination. RESULTS: PAL minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranged from < or = 0.25 to > 16 microg mL(-1) and they were similar to those of FLU and higher than those of either ITRA or TER. Synergy, defined as a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index of < or = 0.50, was observed in 67%, 52% and 15% of PAL/ITRA, PAL/TER and PAL/FLU interactions, respectively. None of these combinations yielded antagonistic interactions (FIC index > 4). When synergy was not achieved, there was still a decrease in the MIC of one or both drugs used in the combination. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that PAL has potential activity against dermatophytes. In addition, the in vitro activity of PAL can be enhanced upon combination with standard drugs. This lipopeptide applied in the form of lacquer, spray or ointment, could represent an interesting new therapy, particularly when combined with conventional treatment in recalcitrant or resistant dermatophyte infections.
