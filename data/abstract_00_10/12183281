The activity of AZD2563 against 250 highly resistant pneumococci and 267 drug-susceptible isolates was determined. The AZD2563 MICs for 50 and 90% of the strains tested were 1 and 2 micro g/ml and 0.5 and 1 micro g/ml, respectively, for the two isolate groups. These MICs were within 1 log(2) dilution of those of linezolid.
