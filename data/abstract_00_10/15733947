Resistance to antibiotics is economically and physiologically costly. Control of antibiotic resistance will require aggressive implementation of numerous strategies. Ongoing surveillance is needed to monitor known antibiotic types and to be able to identify the development of other potential types. Early intervention is needed to combat the rising rate of resistance. Persistent use of hygiene measures and controlled use of antibiotics will limit the spread of antibiotic resistance. Health care providers need to monitor adherence to control measures. Hand and environmental control measures remain a critical component of staff education activities. Active management of infections with non-pharmacologic treatments should be promoted. Motivational campaigns will reinforce positive infection control behaviors. Consistent surveillance of antibiotic use will help fulfill the CDC directive to combat antibiotic resistance and keep the population healthy.
