With increasing frequency, modern medicine directs attention to natural products and biological therapy methods and their use in clinical practice. Bee honey as well as other bee products (propolis, royal jelly and venom) have already found use in medicine not only as immune system stimulants but also as chronic wound healing promoters. The major arguments for implementing apitherapy are the low cost in comparison with conventional therapies and the fact that honey has proved effective against resistant hospital pathogens. Besides antimicrobial characteristics associated with no antimicrobial resistance risk, honey has anti-inflammatory effects. Controlled clinical trials have shown honey to be effective in chronic wound healing and gave rise to medihoney. Nevertheless, further study is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of honey in clinical practice.
