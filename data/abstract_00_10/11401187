A 44-year-old man was treated successfully for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) ventriculitis with intrathecal quinupristin-dalfopristin 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg, and other intravenous antibiotics. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected before and after the 1-mg and 2-mg doses to determine the concentrations of quinupristin-dalfopristin and its active metabolites. Concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration for VREF immediately after unclamping the extraventricular drain and were quantifiable for at least 7 hours.
