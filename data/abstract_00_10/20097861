Bacterial persister cells constitute a small portion of a culture which is tolerant to killing by lethal doses of bactericidal antibiotics. These phenotypic variants are formed in numerous bacterial species, including those with clinical relevance like the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although persisters are believed to contribute to difficulties in the treatment of many infectious diseases, the underlying mechanisms affecting persister formation are not well understood. Here we show that even though P. aeruginosa cultures have a significantly smaller fraction of multidrug-tolerant persister cells than cultures of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, they can increase persister numbers in response to quorum-sensing-related signaling molecules. The phenazine pyocyanin (and the closely related molecule paraquat) and the acyl-homoserine lactone 3-OC12-HSL significantly increased the persister numbers in logarithmic P. aeruginosa PAO1 or PA14 cultures but not in E. coli or S. aureus cultures.
