From 1519 newly diagnosed HIV individuals seen in Madrid between the years 2000 and 2008, 65 (4.3%) were HBsAg(+). Two HIV/HBV-coinfected patients showed the lamivudine resistance mutation M204V in HBV while no drug resistance mutations were recognized in HIV. None of them admitted prior exposure to antiretroviral drugs. Thus, HIV/HBV-coinfected patients might benefit from baseline drug resistance testing for both HIV and HBV to optimize the selection of anti-HBV active antiviral therapy.
