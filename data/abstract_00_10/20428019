The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of antimicrobial agents are the two fundamental pharmacological components which provide a rational for the choice of therapy for skin and skin structure infections, and especially serious infections. The most important PK-PD parameters are well known which can potentiate therapeutic efficacy. Antimicrobial agents ca be subdivided into categories based on whether their activity is dependent on concentration or exposure time. Therefore, a correct dosing regimen for the time-dependent molecules (i.e. beta-lactams, linezolid, tigecycline) should prolong the maximum exposure time to maintain serum levels over the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The concentration-dependent molecules, on the other hand, which include aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, should be given in order to reach maximum concentrations, since they are bactericidal in direct proportion to their concentrations and possess a prolonged post-antibiotic effect.
