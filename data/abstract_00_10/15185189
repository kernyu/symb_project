Diarrhea is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children worldwide. Use of antimicrobial therapy in children with bacterial diarrhea involves consideration of advantages and limitations of use of appropriate agents in the general population and in specific hosts. Antimicrobial agents for bacterial diarrhea should be prescribed with an appreciation of limitations including antimicrobial resistance. Studies from many countries have reported resistance to Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Shigella species, Salmonella species, and shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli. In many geographic areas of the world including the United States, resistance patterns have demonstrated a consistent increase over the course of time, with resistance occurring to several classes of antimicrobial agents. Resistance patterns are influenced by geographic location, year isolates were obtained, classes of antimicrobial agents, pressure exerted by antimicrobial use, and source of the isolate. Because antimicrobial resistance among enteric pathogens is a common finding, has increased over time, and varies by geographic location, constant monitoring of susceptibility patterns is necessary for selection of appropriate antimicrobial agents for therapy when indicated.
