In the last few decades, resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms to classical antimicrobials as well as the emergence of resistance to new antimicrobials has been observed in our environment. Methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci seems to have stabilized at around 30% and 70%, respectively, however, multiresistance of these species to other antimicrobials, emergence of linezolid resistance, and decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides is a cause of concern. Daptomycin has good antimicrobial activity, although some strains with slightly increased MICs have been detected. Among enterococci, vancomycin resistance is less than 5%, but multiresistance among these microorganisms, emerging linezolid resistance and reports of some isolates with decreased susceptibility to daptomycin are worrying. Adequate use of antimicrobials could help to prevent the increase in resistance and dissemination of these pathogens and will allow their efficacy to be guaranteed in the future.
