This study examined the antimicrobial resistance of 1,278 invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from 41 Spanish laboratories participating in the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) during 2000 and 2001. Twenty-nine laboratories participated during both years and provided 950 of the isolates. Each laboratory used its own susceptibility testing methods. External quality assessment was performed annually by each participating laboratory. Significant increases in penicillin and erythromycin resistance were observed between 2000 and 2001. This increase was particularly noticeable in isolates from the laboratories participating during both years and in isolates from children and elderly patients.
