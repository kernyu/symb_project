The objective of this study was to investigate clinical distribution characteristics and drug sensitivity of infection pathogens in hematology department wards of our hospital during recent two years. The isolation and cultivation of pathogens from samples were performed by routine methods. Drug sensitivity tests of bacteria were performed by Kirby-Bauer method. Drug sensitivity tests of fungi were performed by ATBFUNGUS Drug sensitivity strips. The results showed that 102 strains of pathogens were isolated from all detected samples. The composition ratio of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi was 42.2%, 34.3%, 3.5%, respectively. 58.8% of pathogens were isolated from samples of malignant hematopathy patients. 27.5% were isolated from samples of the patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO). 51.0% of pathogens were isolated from samples of the patients who suffered from agranulocytosis or leucocytopenia. Isolated fungi were mostly sensitive to anti-fungal drugs. G+ bacteria were most sensitive to vancomycin. G- bacteria were most sensitive to imipenem. Most bacteria were resistant to multiple antibiotics. It is concluded that the infection in hematology department wards was related with many conditions, such as weakened resistance of patients, leucocytopenia or agranulocytosis, tumor loading, etc. The prompt microbiological examination and drug sensitivity tests are important to rationally select antibiotics, reduce infection incidence and mortality rate, and decrease the occurrence of drug resistant strains.
