We herein report the microbiological features of a Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain isolated from an immunocompetent patient with disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). The strain expressed the IA/IB serovar; was resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin; and had presumably been acquired in Southeast Asia. To date, this is the first case reported in our country of DGI due to an imported multidrug-resistant strain.
