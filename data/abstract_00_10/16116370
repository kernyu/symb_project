Effective hand-washing, including drying to decrease skin surface microbial counts, is recognized as a critical factor in infection control policies. It is also recognized that hand-washing is not always undertaken as it should be. Spending large amounts of time with the hands in water is not enough to control infection as the technique of washing hands is more important than merely the length of time under water. Therefore, ways of promoting hand hygiene must be found, as well as finding ways of ensuring that healthcare workers follow hygiene guidelines.
