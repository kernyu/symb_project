Susceptibility to mupirocin was assessed in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates selected from eras corresponding to differences in usage rate and prescription policies at a Veterans Affairs medical center. The eras studied encompassed from the time of introduction of the drug to its widespread use, through recommended judicious use, and finally to subsequent stringent administrative control. Prescriptions declined from 3.0 to 0.1 per 1,000 patient days. Precipitous declines first in the numbers of isolates with high-level resistance (from 31% to 4%) and then in those with low-level resistance (from 26% to 10%) accompanied prescription control.
