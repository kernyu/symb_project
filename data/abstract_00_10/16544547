In this study, the rate of blood culture contamination, bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities causing nosocomial and community acquired bloodstream infections were investigated prospectively during the period February 2003 to February 2004. In the study period, among the 5994 blood culture samples obtained from 3114 patients, 1091 (18%) yielded positive results. Seventy-four of them (1.2%) were evaluated as false positive, 514 (9%) were pseudobacteremia or contamination. According to patients' clinical features, 503 (8%) blood culture samples were associated with blood stream infections, and 358 of them (71%) were primary episodes. Twohundred and ninetyfour of primary episodes (82%) were hospital acquired and 64 were community acquired bloodstream infections. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated agent in the hospital and community acquired bloodstream infections at the rates of 16% and 20%, respectively. In hospital acquired blood stream infections, Escherichia coil (9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%); in community acquired bloodstream infections Streptococcus spp (17%) and E. coli (15%) were the other most frequently isolated bacterial agents. Methicillin resistance of S. aureus isolates was determined as 54% in hospital acquired blood stream infections and 25% in community acquired blood stream infections.
