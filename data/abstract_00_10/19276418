Salmonella Heidelberg is one of the 3 most frequently isolated serovars from human Salmonella cases in Canada, and the fourth most commonly reported Salmonella serovar in human foodborne disease cases in the United States. Since 1962, Salmonella Heidelberg has been isolated and reported in poultry and poultry products in Brazil. The poultry industry has focused efforts on reducing salmonellae incidence in live production in an effort to reduce Salmonella in the processing plant. A better understanding of the initial infection in chicks could provide approaches to control Salmonella contamination. The objective of the present study was to evaluate 2 Salmonella Heidelberg strains that differed in the presence of virulence genes invA, agfA, and lpfA; antimicrobial resistance profiles; and epidemiologic profiles on aspects of pathogenicity and intestinal morphology. Newly hatched broiler chicks were inoculated with 2 strains (SH23 and SH35) of Salmonella Heidelberg and cecal morphometry, histopathology, electron microscopy, and bacterial counts in the liver and cecum were assessed. The SH23 and SH35 strains resulted in different changes in villi height and crypt depth and inflammatory cell infiltration in the cecum. The SH35 group had higher liver and cecum bacterial cell counts when compared with SH23 strains.
