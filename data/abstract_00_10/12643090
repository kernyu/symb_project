Tuberculosis during childhood is often due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis primo-infection. Tuberculosis is highly prevalent in Madagascar and most people are infected during childhood. Our objectives were to evaluate the primary resistance of M. tuberculosis and to determine the genotypes responsible for recent infection in the population. Thus we studied 142 isolated strains from 97 children (66 with pulmonary tuberculosis and 31 with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis) recruited in different health centers in Antananarivo from 1997 to 2000. Excepting one strain resistant to isoniazide, all strains were susceptible to the four antibiotics (streptomycin, isoniazid, ryfampicin and ethambutol). This result confirms the low rate of primary resistance reported during the two surveys in 1994-1995 and 1999-2000. 67 strains of 1997-2000 were typed with the genetic marker IS6110, 44 has been assigned to 13 clusters containing each 2 to 8 similar strains. Some IS6110 clusters have already been reported in 1994-1995. Some genotypes observed in 1994-1995 seemed to have disappeared in 1997-2000. (As the rate of the frequency of some genetic variants according to the period are more likely due to a difference in strain virulence). Since there is minimal antibiotic resistance versus M. tuberculosis in Madagascar, one can not explain the appearance or disappearance of certain variants because of drug resistance. Rather, this is due to the virulence of the various M. tuberculosis strains.
