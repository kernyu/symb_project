Previously 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) produced by Pseudomonas sp. AMSN isolated from a marine alga, had demonstrated a high level of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) comparable with that of vancomycin. In this study, this substance had bacteriolytic activity against MRSA at 1 microg/ml as well as similar activity against Vibrio parahaemolyticus at 24 microg/ml that suggests a novel antibacterial mode of action by this substance. Heat and pH stability tests showed it to be stable at temperatures ranging from 35 to 70 degrees C and at pHs ranging from 2-7. It was not acutely toxic to mice at levels up to 100 mg/kg.
