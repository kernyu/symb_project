As all therapies, oral antibiotic therapy has its own scientific rationale. Infact, for an optimal oral therapy the drug must be absorbed completely, reach the infection site and diffuse in the tissues. It should also remain active for as long as possible at the minimal bactericidal level of concentration. It is therefore necessary to use drugs with a specific bactericidal action for the pathogens in question and that these drugs be administered at right doses for the necessary duration so that the infection is eliminated. It is an inappropriate therapy that which not only fails to eliminate the infection, but leads to the development of resistance, which is an increasingly serious and diffused problem. In hospital and at home it is possible to switch from an injected antibiotic form to the more practical and less expensive oral form, therefore creating a sequential therapy which is better accepted by patients and their families. The acceptance of prescribed therapies is an aspect that should never be underestimated, especially during the development age. Infact, despite the general understanding that unsatisfactory clinical results are a consequence of unadequate compliance with therapy, the desire to recover is rarely the same as the will to follow such plans, even if the patient expects a quick and full recovery. It is therefore necessary to use those therapies which are best accepted but always effective in order to avoid legal implications.
