HIV-infected patients share traditional cardiovascular risk factors with the general population. Moreover, HIV per se significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Consequently, control of HIV infection with highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) helps to reduce vascular risk in HIV-infected patients. However, there is evidence that HAART increases cardiovascular risk and the use of abacavir, didanosine, lopinavir/ritonavir and indinavir has been associated with the development of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the absolute risk of AMI in patients receiving HAART is very low in relation to the benefit obtained with antiretroviral therapy.
