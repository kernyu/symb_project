The efficiency of the molecular GenoType MTBDRplus (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Germany) assay was evaluated for the rapid diagnosis of rifampicin and isoniazid susceptibility in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) on 168 sputum specimens from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in the Samara Region. The interpretable results from the molecular genetic assay were obtained for 91.7% of the specimens with the rates significantly higher in the sputum specimens graded 2+ and 3+ than in those graded 1+. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for the detection of rifampicin, isoniazid, and multidrug resistance were 96.2%, 97.4%; 97.1% and 90.7%; 83.3%; 88.9%, respectively. Mutations in codon 531 of the rpoB gene and codon 315 of the katG gene were most common in rifampicin- and isoniazid-resistant strains, respectively. The high sensitivity, rapidness-to-use, and the simultaneous treatment of a large number of sputum specimens permit the authors to recommend the GenoType MTBDRplus assay as a major screening tool for the detection of drug resistance in MBT.
