Most routine laboratory detection of Staphylococcus aureus isolates is based on rapid agglutination test systems. Failure of agglutination assays to identify meticillin-resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA) has been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate six commercially available agglutination tests for the detection of meticillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and mecA-positive MRSA strains. The Dry Spot Staphytect Plus test (Oxoid), the Pastorex Staph Plus test (Bio-Rad), the Slidex Staph-Kit and Slidex Staph Plus test (bioMerieux), the Staphaurex Plus test (Remel) and the Staphylase Test (Oxoid) were used. As determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, 52 distinct MRSA strains from five countries, 83 MSSA strains and 150 coagulase-negative staphylococci were included. Species identification and determination of susceptibility patterns were performed using colony morphology, Gram stain, catalase testing, tube coagulase testing, DNase testing, mannitol fermentation, susceptibility testing towards oxacillin by Etest, coagulase gene PCR, fibrinogen receptor gene PCR and PCR of the mecA gene. Sensitivity of the agglutination tests ranged from 82.7 to 100.0 % for MRSA strains and 92.8 to 100.0 % for MSSA strains, respectively. Specificity of the test systems ranged from 91.3 to 99.1 %. None of the six agglutination assays produced correct reactions for all staphylococci tested. Only the Dry Spot Staphytect Plus test correctly identified all 52 MRSA strains. For the other tests kits, sensitivity of MRSA detection was lower than for MSSA isolates. Depending upon the local MRSA prevalence and the parameter of interest (sensitivity or specificity), these test systems may be useful for routine diagnostic purposes.
