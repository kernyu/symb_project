Cefodizime (CDZM) has strong antimicrobial activity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae in vitro. However, multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoea emerged and has been increasing in Japan. To know the effectiveness of CDZM on gonococcal urethritis and uterine cervicitis even in the era of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, a clinical trial of single-dose therapy of CDZM for gonococcal urethritis and uterine cervicitis was conducted. N. gonorrhoeae was eradicated from 100% of patients with gonococcal urethritis and uterine cervicitis by a single dose of CDZM. In conclusion, CDZM is one of most suitable drugs for the treatment of gonococcal genital infection in the era of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae.
