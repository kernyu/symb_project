OBJECTIVES: To investigate the activity of linezolid (an oxazolidinone), a potent choice for community- and hospital-acquired infections, via a worldwide surveillance network called the Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program. METHODS: A total of 4098 Gram-positive strains were collected from 42 laboratories located in North America (five sites in Canada), South America (10 sites), Europe (16 sites) and the Far East (11 sites). Each country or site submitted 200 isolates (Canada submitted 200 isolates for each of five sites; total 1000) for confirmation of organism identification and reference MIC processing. Nearly 25 comparator agents were tested along with quality control strains, and interpretative criteria from the CLSI, formerly the NCCLS, M100-S15 were applied. No linezolid resistance was detected in strains from 16 monitored countries in 2004. RESULTS: Linezolid remained highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC90, 1 mg/L). Against Staphylococcus aureus, linezolid showed 99.5% of results at 0.5-2 mg/L with only one isolate at 4 mg/L. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus rates varied between nations and ranged from 1.4% in Sweden to 29.5% in the UK to 65.2% in Mexico. Linezolid MIC values were generally one log2 dilution step lower for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) when compared with S. aureus. No CoNS strains produced a linezolid result at 4 mg/L. Compared with ZAAPS 2002 and 2003 results for enterococci where seven resistant strains were identified, the 2004 data revealed no resistance and 98.1% of linezolid MIC results were at 1 or 2 mg/L. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (5.3% overall) varied markedly by country including a high of 47.2% in Korea. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid continues to be effective in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens from five continents and no oxazolidinone-resistant strains were identified among the 4098 systemically collected strains (2004) or among 20 158 non-United States isolates for the entire ZAAPS Program (2002-04).
