Respiratory tract infections are one of the most common reasons for public sickness rate. Even though they are usually virus-caused, antibiotic prescription is mostly used in primary care. The increase of resistance of bacterial strains observed in the last decade has much to do with this. This increase is connected mainly with the increasing antibiotics consumption and their selective pressure. That is why in many countries, there is an effort to stop this increase by reducing the useless prescription from etiology point of view. This paper points out a more careful approach to acute bacterial rhinosinusitis treatment in the community, taking into consideration the worsening condition of antibiotics resistance in Slovakia and Europe.
