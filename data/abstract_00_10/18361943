Acinetobacter is a formidable challenge to managing critically ill patients. This pathogen's ability to rapidly develop antimicrobial resistance to all currently available antimicrobial agents is concerning because increasing data support attributable mortality to these bacteria when associated with hospitalized patients with comorbidities and severe illness. The role of dual therapy is currently unclear and might be associated with increased toxicities without proven synergy or ability to prevent the development of resistance. Infection control and antibiotic control measures might have the greatest impact on these bacteria. Continued efforts are needed to develop new antimicrobial agents against this pathogen and assess the ideal currently available agents.
