OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of Candida biofilms to the etiology of denture stomatitis. STUDY DESIGN: Samples of denture acrylic were retrieved from patients with denture stomatitis and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Oral swab and swish samples were taken from the same group of patients and representative C albicans isolates recovered were used to investigate the kinetics of biofilm development in vitro. RESULTS: Candida biofilms could be visualized by SEM directly from denture samples from patients with denture stomatitis. These biofilms showed a propensity to adhere along cracks and imperfections of the denture acrylic. C albicans clinical isolates were able to form biofilms in vitro, although differences in the extent of biofilm formation were observed for different isolates recovered from the same patient. Susceptibility testing indicated that the resulting biofilms showed increased resistance to antifungal treatment. Presence of serum and saliva conditioning films increased the initial adherence of selected isolates but had little effect in overall biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: Candida biofilms play a role in denture stomatitis.
