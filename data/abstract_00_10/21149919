BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy is associated with metabolic complications, including dyslipidaemia, body fat changes and insulin resistance. Healthy volunteer studies have demonstrated a decrease in glucose disposal associated with dosing with specific antiretrovirals. METHODS: HIV-type-1-positive male participants were randomized to receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine, with either fosamprenavir (FPV)/ritonavir or lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir twice daily. A hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp was performed at baseline and at 2 weeks after commencing treatment. The homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was also calculated at these time points. Changes in lipids and lipoprotein subfractions (by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were assessed. A pharmacokinetic assessment was undertaken at week 2. RESULTS: A total of 27 participants were enrolled. There was no significant change in whole-body insulin sensitivity or HOMA-IR from baseline or between groups. Total cholesterol increased significantly, by 6.6% with FPV and 10.9% with LPV. The changes in lipids and lipoprotein subfractions were similar between groups with increases in triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Although the total high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles were not significantly altered, a decrease in small HDL particles was seen. Changes in VLDL and chylomicron particles in both groups and triglycerides and small HDL particles in the LPV group were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-type-1-positive men initiating antiretroviral therapy with FPV- or LPV-based regimens, there were no significant changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity after 2 weeks. A proatherogenic lipid profile characterized by increases in triglycerides, VLDL and chylomicron particles and LDL particles, and a decrease in small HDL particles, was observed in both groups.
