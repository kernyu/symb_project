Treatment of an established BCL1 leukaemia in mice showed that the use of hydrogels is advantageous in comparison with free doxorubicin (DOX), partially due to the different pharmacokinetic profile of the drug release. Pharmacologically active concentrations ranging from 100 to 800 ng/ml were detectable in the bloodstream for more than 4 days when DOX-loaded hydrogels were implanted into mice. Animals treated with free DOX survived for 35 days, survival of hydrogel-DOX treated animals increased up to 60 days and long-term survivors were achieved, when the second hydrogel was implanted 2 weeks after the first one. Hydrogels containing vinblastine (VLB) were ineffective. N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) hydrogels were also used in combined therapy against multidrug resistant leukaemia P388-MDR to achieve a synergistic effect of both the cytostatic drug and chemosensitising agent. It was shown that when 4 times the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of free DOX was incorporated into HPMA-hydrogels, tumour volume was reduced by approximately 50% after implantation of the hydrogel containing DOX and cyclosporine A (CsA) and survival was slightly prolonged.
