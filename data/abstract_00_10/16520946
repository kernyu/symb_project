C1q nephropathy (C1qNP) is a rare cause of childhood nephrotic syndrome (NS). We describe a child with retinoblastoma, lipomyelomeningocele and a chromosome 13 deletion who presented with massive proteinuria due to C1qNP. Despite steroid resistance, successful treatment of the NS was achieved with mycophenolate mofetil.
