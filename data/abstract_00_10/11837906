OBJECTIVES: To investigate the reduced efficacy of ivermectin, abamectin and moxidectin against two field isolates of Haemonchus contortus. These isolates were identified on separate properties in the New England region of New South Wales. PROCEDURE: Reduced efficacy of macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics against two field isolates of H contortus was suspected. These isolates were obtained from sheep on separate farms and pen trials were performed to investigate the efficacy of macrocyclic lactones. The percentage efficacy was calculated for moxidectin, ivermectin and closantel against the isolate from one farm (VHR23) and for moxidectin, ivermectin and abamectin against the isolate from the second (VHR29). The persistent activity of moxidectin against both isolates was investigated. RESULTS: Ivermectin and closantel were found to have efficacies below 80% against established populations of VHR23. Moxidectin was effective against an established population of VHR23 but the persistent activity was reduced to 7 days. Moxidectin was also found to be effective against established populations of VHR29, however, ivermectin and abamectin were found to have efficacies below 80%. There was no evidence of persistent activity of moxidectin against VHR29. CONCLUSION: A reduction in efficacy of abamectin and/or ivermectin against field isolates of H. contortus was identified from two farms in the New England region of New South Wales. The persistent effect of moxidectin was reduced against both isolates.
