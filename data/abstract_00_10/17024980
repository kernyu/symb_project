Potent anthelmintics were introduced into the Swiss market several decades ago. Despite this, gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN), lungworms and the large liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) can successfully inhabit Swiss ruminant farms. This is mainly due to a high reproductive capacity as well as very efficient survival strategies. In addition some species readily develop anthelmintic resistance. GIN-infections in young cattle are under comparatively good control. However, prophylactic measures are compromised where adult stock is also affected due to incomplete development of immune protection. Under these circumstances control measures must include all age groups. This results in fewer helminths in refugia thus may accelerate the development of anthelmintic resistance. This review aims to present a synopsis of the significance of the major helminth infections obtained on pasture by large and small ruminants in Switzerland. Currently available strategies for strategic helminth control are summarized and an outlook is given on new developments which might expand the spectrum of control measures relevant for veterinary practice in the future.
