Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are plant proteins believed to play an important role in the defense against plant pathogen fungals. PGIPs are glycoproteins located in plant cell wall which reduce the hydrolytic activity of polygalacturonases (PGs), limit the growth of plant pathogens, and also elicit defense responses in plant. Furthermore, PGIPs belong to the super family of leucine reach repeat (LRR) proteins which also include the products of several plant resistance genes. Many of the studies show the PGIP properties, molecular characteristics, and PGIP gene expression induced by some elicitors. Some of the studies review individual PGIP gene expression in different signal transduction pathways. This article summarizes the properties, different signal transduction mechanisms, detecting methods, transgenic plants, and function of PGIP. It also presents PGIP gene expression in different stages of maturity, tissues, and varieties. The review especially reports the particular PGIP gene expression induced by different biotic and abiotic stresses, offers some questions, and prospects the future study, which are needed in order to develop efficient strategies for disease-resistant plants. They may be useful for genetic engineering to obtain transgenic plants with increased tolerance to fungal infection, which decrease the use of insecticide.
