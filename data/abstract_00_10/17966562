In the context of rising rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in India, this communication presents some field observations during screening of new cases registered with the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in urban and rural areas of Maharashtra, India. It appears that erroneous categorisation and treatment that contributes to multiple drug resistance results from a lack of patient screening for previous treatment, ambiguity in categorisation and reluctance to disclose a history of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Suggested measures include detailed screening of new cases, computerisation of patient records and an empathetic dialogue between patient and health care provider.
