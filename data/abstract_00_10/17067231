OBJECTIVE: We studied the epidemiological characteristic of tuberculosis in Lorca area, drug resistant and the effect of the immigration population (Ecuador) in this area. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study for six years ago (1999, January to 2004, December) was realized. Epidemiological data, initial diagnostic probability, mycobacteria stain and cultive, drug resistance, treatment response, and epidemiological differences between immigrants and spain population were compared. RESULTS: Within 158 cases registered, 41.7 percent were immigrants with less than one year in Spain, the most part Ecuador population. We observed that extrapulmonar tuberculosis was lower initial diagnostic probability than pleural disease as well too haemoptisis, pleural pain and weight loss. It was identified positive micobacterial stain in 35.4 percent of respiratory samples. It was successfully results in 74 percent of cases and 13.9 percent of patients were lost, this result was frequently registered in immigrants, The isoniazide resistant in patients with not previous treatment was 5.3 percent and it was 9.5 percent in immigrants and 10.8 percent in Ecuador population. CONCLUSION: It is necessary improve: the diagnostic of extrapulmonar tuberculosis and avoid loss patient by programs of capture and then the successfully treatments raise. The isoniazide resistant in this area suggest that we must use initial four drug than tree and this manner not raise the drug resistant in the area.
