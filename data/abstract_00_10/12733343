OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effect of tetrandrine (Tet) on chronic hypoxic pulmonary by observing expression of bFGF in lung tissue of rat with chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. METHODS: 30 rats were divided into 3 groups: hypoxia group, hypoxia + Tet group and control group. On the 21st day of hypoxia, the hemodynamic parameters were measured and the intra acinar pulmonary arteries (IAPA) changes were studied under light microscopes. Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibody against human recombinant bFGF was performed in the paraffin section of rat lung. RESULTS: Tetrandrine could reduce pulmonary artery mean pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), (P < 0.01), decrease the expression of bFGF in wall of IAPA, and inhibit hypoxic structural remodeling of IAPA. CONCLUSION: Tetrandrine could decrease the expression of bFGF in wall of IAPA and in that connection to inhibit remodeling of IAPA and pulmonary hypertension.
