The mosquito-transmitted unicellular parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of malaria disease, still causes more than one million deaths every year in the tropical and subtropical areas of the world. New intervention strategies are needed to contrast the insurgence of resistance to effective drugs and insecticides. The complete annotated genomes of the human parasite P. falciparum and the rodent model P. yoelii is now available thus providing a prediction of their possible gene products. This makes feasible the application of functional genomics to malaria research with the final goal of providing a complete survey of Plasmodium life cycle. Genome-wide approaches to the study of transcriptome or proteome were successfully applied to malaria parasite with the promise for new drug and vaccine candidates in the next future.
