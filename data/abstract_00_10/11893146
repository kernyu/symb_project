To assess the effect of antimicrobial resistance on length of hospital stay, a case-control study compared infections due to four nosocomial pathogens. Significantly increased lengths of stay were associated with infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infections with resistant pathogens are associated with prolonged hospitalization.
