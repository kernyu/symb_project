BACKGROUND: Cyclosporin A is a lipogenic immunosuppressor that can induce posttransplant hyperlipidaemia. Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been recognized as a major atherogenic factor. Tacrolimus seems to be less lipogenic with an apparently better cardiovascular profile than CsA. METHODS: We have studied the lipidic profile and the oxidation of HDL and LDL in 20 renal transplant patients, 12 male and 8 female, mean age 45 +/- 10 year, who where switched from CsA to tacrolimus due to CsA adverse effects. LDL were determined by ultracentrifugation. Oxidation study before and 6 months after conversion to tacrolimus was performed by adding CuSO4. RESULTS: After conversion, systolic blood pressure (BP) decreased from 154 +/- 21 to 133 +/- 21 mm Hg (p = 0.008), diastolic BP from 97 +/- 13 to 77 +/- 15 mm Hg (p = 0.016), total cholesterol from 6.08 +/- 0.9 to 5.68 +/- 1.1 mmol/l (p = 0.02), LDL-chol from 3.29 +/- 1.01 to 2.96 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (p = 0.04) and apo-B lipoprotein from 1.42 +/- 0.28 to 1.15 +/- 0.34 mg/dl (p = 0.003). The oxidation of LDL improved after conversion: the initial dienic compounds decreased from 95 +/- 20 to 63 +/- 12 umol/g and the final DC from 207 +/- 56 to 107 +/- 35 umol/g. Lag-phase increased from 33 +/- 21 to 45 +/- 17 min (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Tacrolimus has improved hyperlipidaemia in our cyclosporin previously treated patients and increased the resistance to oxidation of high and low-density lipoproteins.
