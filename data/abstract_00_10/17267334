Staphylococcus aureus remains one of the most common and troublesome microorganisms causing disease in humans, despite the development of effective antibiotics. Linezolid is a member of a new class of synthetic antibiotics called oxazolidinones, introduced into therapy due to the increasing resistance of Gram-positive pathogens to traditional antibiotics. Information about the pharmacokinetics and tolerability profile of linezolid in the pediatric population mostly derive from adult studies and especially in the neonatal field relatively few data are available. Here we summarize linezolid's characteristics and report data available in the literature regarding linezolid use in newborns and children. For this purpose, a Medline search was performed between 1990 and 2006 involving the term "linezolid" combined with the terms "newborn", "infant", "child", "pediatrics". Additional information was obtained from Reactions Weekly.
