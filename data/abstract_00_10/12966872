The role of enzyme--substrate interactions for the survival of bacteria in natural biocenoses has been analyzed with the systems "lysozyme-antilysozyme", "histon-antihiston" used as models. The conception of a possible universal mechanism for supporting the circulation of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms among eukaryotes, irrespective of their evolutionary status and environment, has been formulated. This mechanism is ensured by the natural resistance of the eukaryotic cells and by persistence factors on the part of the pathogen; as a result, the dynamic system of interactions is formed which facilitates the survival of microorganisms due to their persistence potential. New knowledge thus obtained opens prospects in the study of sanitary and ecological aspects of water biocenoses.
