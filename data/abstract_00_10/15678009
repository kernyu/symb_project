Cerebral malaria is one of the most serious complications of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Its diagnosis may sometimes be difficult. We report the case of a 63-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain and nausea, rapidly followed by delirium and stupor, a few days after a travel in Africa. No prophylactic measures were prescribed. The main clinical features concerning cerebral malaria, diagnostic tools and therapeutic measures are discussed.
