OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in dogs with intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) that had manual expression (ME), indwelling catheterization (IDC) or intermittent catheterization (ITC) for urinary bladder management. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized-clinical trial. ANIMALS: Dogs (n=62) treated with urinary bladder dysfunction requiring surgery for IVDD and control dogs (n=30) that had surgery for reasons other than IVDD. METHODS: Treated dogs were randomly assigned to ME, IDC, or ITC. Urine was collected for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing before and after treatment. Incidence and risk factors for UTI were evaluated. Bacterial isolates and antimicrobial resistance patterns were described. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) time to urination was significantly longer for IDC dogs (7.4+/-2.75 days) than ME dogs (4.2+/-2.63) and ITC dogs (4.9+/-3.12). Thirteen treated dogs (21%) and no control dogs developed UTI: 4/25 (16%) ME, 8/25 (32%) IDC, and 1/12 (8%) ITC. Enterobacter sp. was most frequently isolated (4/13; 31%). Duration of treatment was the only risk factor for UTI and each additional day of treatment increased the risk of UTI 1.5 times. CONCLUSION: For dogs with acute IVDD, the duration of required urinary bladder management establishes the risk of UTI, not the urinary bladder management technique. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Duration of treatment for urinary bladder dysfunction is a risk factor for UTI in dogs recovering from acute IVDD. Treatment for urinary bladder management should be limited where possible and no method of treatment is preferred. For dogs managed by IDC, voluntary urination might occur before clinically suspected.
