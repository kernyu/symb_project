OBJECTIVE: We have sought ways to circumvent resistance, by combining nisin with other antibiotics known to target bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. METHODS: Twenty strains each of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were tested in vitro by standardized methods against nisin alone and combined with bacitracin, ramoplanin and chloramphenicol. RESULTS: Ramoplanin was the most potent compound, and bacitracin had the least activity. Two-way synergy was observed with nisin and ramoplanin. However, chloramphenicol was clearly antagonistic to the activity of nisin. CONCLUSIONS: Observations of synergy between nisin and ramoplanin against MRSA and VRE offer a promising approach to the concept of combining nisin with inhibitors of cell wall peptidoglycan. Further investigations are needed in order to develop this approach as a clinical possibility.
