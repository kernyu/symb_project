Rhizobial strains, rescued from the root nodules of Robinia pseudoacacia growing in Japan and Poland, were characterized for the phenotypic properties, genomic diversity as well as phylogeny and compared with the reference strains representing different species and genera of nodule bacteria. They had a moderately slow growth rate, a low tolerance to antibiotics, a moderate resistance to NaCl and produced acid in yeast mannitol agar. Cluster analysis based on the phenotypic features divided all bacteria involved in this study into four phena, comprising: (1) Rhizobium sp. + Sinorhizobium sp., (2) Bradyrhizobium sp., (3) R. pseudoacacia microsymbionts + Mesorhizobium sp., and (4) Rhizobium galegae strains at similarity coefficient of 74%. R. pseudoacacia nodule isolates and Mesorhizobium species were placed on a single branch clearly distinct from other rhizobium genera lineages. Strains representing R. pseudoacacia microsymbionts shared 98-99% 16S rDNA sequence identity with Mesorhizobium species and in 16S rDNA phylogenetic tree all these bacteria formed common cluster. The rhizobia tested are genomically heterogeneous as indicated by the AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) method. The bacteria studied exhibited high degree of specificity for nodulation. Nitrogenase structural genes in these strains were located on 771-961 kb megaplasmids.
