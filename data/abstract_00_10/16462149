OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the resistances of Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactams developed by stepwise alterations in high-molecular-weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) with a reduced binding affinity of beta-lactams. Among the numerous mutations in pbp genes that alter the affinity for beta-lactams, the decreased affinity of PBP1A, 2X and 2B is especially important in the development of resistances to beta-lactams. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the mutations in pbp1a, pbp2x, and pbp2b genes evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 866 pneumococcal isolates collected from the nasopharynx of Japanese children with acute otitis media. RESULTS: 210 strains (24.3%) exhibited no mutations in the three pbp genes. 333 strains (38.5%) had mutations in the three pbp genes, 78 (9.0%) in two pbp genes, whereas 245 (28.3%) displayed mutations in only one pbp gene. Among the 656 strains with mutations in pbp genes, 620 (94.5%) strains had mutations in pbp2x. The annual prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant S. pneumoniae showed a gradual increase in strains with mutations in the three pbp genes and a parallel decrease in strains without mutations. CONCLUSIONS: PCR-based genotyping can characterize the antimicrobial resistances in pneumococci along with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Physicians should pay attention to the recent increase in antimicrobial-resistant S. pneumoniae when treating pediatric acute otitis media.
