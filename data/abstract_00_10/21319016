Candidemia is an opportunistic infection caused primarily by Candida albicans. We experienced a case of severe Candidemia that developed after surgical treatment for tongue cancer and required considerable labor to diagnose and to treat, though no particular immunodeficiency was seen before. The case was resistant to an antifungal agent, fluconazole, but was successfully treated with amphotericin B. Positive blood cultures, local wound culture, and increased beta;-D-glucan were useful to diagnose the infection. In particular, gallium-67 scintigraphy was remarkably useful for the diagnosis and the evaluation of therapeutic effects in this case. Development of Candidemia following an oral and maxillofacial surgery is extremely rare among young adults, thus this case report serves to draw attention to the risk in oral and maxillofacial surgery.
