We aimed to assess the prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst urinary tract isolates within our clinic. Local protocol has been to prescribe a 3-day course of trimethoprim for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Notes of all culture-proven UTIs (October 1998 to September 1999) were examined. Eighty-six urinary isolates were identified in 84 patients. Seventy-three of the isolates were coliforms with 46 being Escherichia coli. Of the 86 urinary isolates 28 (32.6%) were resistant to trimethoprim, 37 (43.5%) to amoxycillin, 5 (5.8%) to cephradine and 3 (3.5%) to nitrofurantoin. Seventy-four (86%) of the UTIs were known to have been treated; 41 at initial presentation and 33 once sensitivities were available. Of the 41 patients who received treatment initially, 11 needed to return to the clinic for a further course of antibiotics. To try and reduce the number of inappropriate treatments and unnecessary visits a number of options regarding clinic protocol were explored.
