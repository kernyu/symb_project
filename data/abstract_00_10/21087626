Using a variety of antibiotics, it was found that nine separate isolates of spontaneous antibiotic resistant mutants of Escherichia coli K12 pPSX-vioABCDE overproduce the anti-tumour antibiotic violacein. Subsequent analysis showed that seven of these mutations occurred on the plasmid pPSX-vioABCDE. The other two overproducing strains carried spontaneous chromosomal mutations to lincomycin and kanamycin. The kanamycin resistant mutant of E. coli K12 DH10B (AA23) and a lincomycin resistant mutant of E. coli K12 LE392 (AA24) increased the synthesis of violacein. The plasmid pPSX-vioABCDE opv-1 contains a violacein over-production (opv-1) mutation which when introduced into either E. coli K12 AA23 or AA24, resulted in a hyper-production of violacein. Remarkably, E. coli K12 AA23 pPSX-vioABCDE opv-1 produced 41 times the normal level of violacein. In addition, both E. coli K12 AA23 and E. coli K12 AA24 demonstrated an increase in expression of an alpha amylase gene from Streptomyces lividans and the urease gene cluster from Klebsiella oxytoca. These results suggest that selection of antibiotic resistant mutants can increase heterologous gene expression in E. coli K12. Additionally, the increased expression is a general effect applicable to genes and gene clusters cloned into E. coli K12 from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
