BACKGROUND: Many patients treated for H. pylori infection have been taking a proton pump inhibitor beforehand. There is conflicting evidence whether pretreatment influences the efficacy of H. pylori eradication. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of pretreatment on cure rates of H. pylori eradication. METHODS: Patients with H. pylori positive peptic ulcer disease or functional dyspepsia were treated with two-day quadruple therapy (lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily, and colloidal bismuth subcitrate 120 mg, tetracycline 250 mg and metronidazole 250 mg, all eight times a day). Patients were randomised to receive either three-day pretreatment with lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily or no pretreatment. H. pylori was diagnosed using CLO, histology and culture. RESULTS: Twenty-five (66%) of 38 patients with pretreatment and 32 (84%) of 38 patients without pretreatment were cured (p=0.06). After adjustment for diagnosis, smoking status and metronidazole resistance the influence of pretreatment became slightly less pronounced (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.1-1.7). Nonsmokers and patients with peptic ulcer disease were more likely to achieve H. pylori eradication than smokers and patients with functional dyspepsia, respectively (adjusted odds ratios: 4.79 (1.2-19) and 4.32 (1.0-18)). CONCLUSIONS: This two-day quadruple therapy reached an overall cure rate of 75%. Nonsmokers and patients with peptic ulcer disease were more likely to achieve H. pylori eradication. Three-day pretreatment with a proton pump inhibitor may decrease cure rates of this two-day quadruple therapy.
