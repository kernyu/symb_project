The ability of sequential subcultures in subinhibitory concentrations of gemifloxacin, trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin to select resistant mutants was studied in 16 pneumococci [eight with ciprofloxacin MICs (mg/L) 0.25-1; four with 8-16; four with 16-32]. Subculturing was done 50 times, or until mutants with elevated MICs (> or = 4 x) to the selecting drug emerged. Subculturing in gemifloxacin selected six resistant mutants (gemifloxacin MICs 2 mg/L); trovafloxacin selected nine (trovafloxacin MICs 2-4 mg/L); ciprofloxacin selected 11 (ciprofloxacin MICs 8-128 mg/L); gatifloxacin selected 13; and moxifloxacin selected 12 (gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin MICs 2-16 mg/L). DNA sequencing showed that most mutants had mutations in ParC at Ser-79 or Asp-83 and in GyrA at Ser-81 or Glu-85; some mutants also had mutations in ParE or GyrB. Some new mutations were found in ParE or GyrB that have not yet been reported; GyrB mutation might be associated with moxifloxacin resistance. Both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV were thought to be the target of gemifloxacin; gemifloxacin also selected mutants with single modifications in gyrA, parC or parE alone among derived mutants by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of fluoroquinolones. In the presence of reserpine, most mutants had lower MICs of ciprofloxacin and gemifloxacin (4-32 x), and gatifloxacin (4-8 x), suggesting an efflux mechanism; none had lower trovafloxacin and moxifloxacin MICs. All quinolones tested selected for resistance; judicious use and proper dosing will be necessary to avoid resistance selection of newer broad-spectrum fluoroquinolones.
