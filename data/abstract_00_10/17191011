The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and the resistance patterns of Aeromonas spp. in drinking water in Istanbul, Turkey. We investigated a total of 1,680 drinking water samples (840 tap water and 840 domestic water tank samples) for Aeromonas strains between June 2002 and October 2005. A total of 147 Aeromonas strains were isolated from 49 (6%) of 840 tap water samples and from 98 (12%) of 840 domestic water tank samples. Antibiotic susceptibility of Aeromonas strains was determined by the disc diffusion method, according to the CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute) recommendation. Among the 147 Aeromonas strains, the prevalence was: A. hydrophila 68 (46%), A. sobria 50 (34%), A. caviae 11 (8%), A. salmonicida 9 (6%), A. veronii 5 (3%) and A. jandaei 4 (3%). Approximately 55% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, 48% to erythromycin, 41% to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 28% to ceftazidime, 27% to cefoxitin, 26% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, 22% to piperacillin, 14% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 12% to tetracycline, 11% to aztreonam, 8% to meropenem, 6% to imipenem, 2% to nalidixic acid, 1% to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin and gentamicin. None of the strains were resistant to amikacin and netilmicin. In conclusion, Aeromonas spp. isolated from drinking water in Istanbul have a resistance potential and the antibiotic resistance rates of A. hydrophila, A. sobria and A. caviae were usually higher than those of other Aeromonas strains. It should be kept in mind that these microorganisms in drinking water might be a potential risk for public health.
