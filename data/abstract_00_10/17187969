OBJECTIVE: Despite advances in antibiotic therapy strategies and pediatric intensive care, prognosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis remains very poor. To determine the factors associated with hospital mortality of children with pneumococcal meningitis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 73 cases of childhood pneumococcal meningitis admitted in 4 teaching hospitals in the center of Tunisia during a 8-year period (1995-2002). RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 13.7% (10 of 71 patients), and neurologic sequela were observed in 34.5% of survivors. Based on univariable analysis, five variables were associated with the outcome: Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (p < 0.001), coma (p=0.0009), use of mechanical ventilation (p=0.0001), convulsions (p = 0.0449), and shock (p=0.0085). In multivariable analysis, only 2 factors were independently associated with in-hospital mortality: Pediatric Risk of Mortality score and the use of mechanical ventilation. 11.8% of pneumococcal isolates were intermediate and resistant to penicillin. Non-susceptible pneumococcus strains to penicillin and the use of steroids were not associated significantly with the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal meningitis remains a devastating childhood disease. Two variables were independently associated with the in-hospital death in our series (high Pediatric Risk of Mortality score, and the use of mechanical ventilation). According to these data we may recommend the inclusion of vaccination against streptococcus pneumonia in the children's immunization program in Tunisia.
