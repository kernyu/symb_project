The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique has been used as a sensitive method to explore the effect of antibacterial molecules on immobilized bacteria and biofilm formation. In this work, we describe the electrochemical spectroscopy as a powerful method to monitor the effect of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX-Dg) on polyelectrolyte immobilized Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 and the kinetics of cell adhesion on gold electrodes. The experimental impedance data were modeled with a Zview program to find the best equivalent electrical circuit and analyse its parameter's properties. Polyelectrolyte multilayer formation on the electrode surface and bacteria immobilization greatly increased the electron-transfer resistance (R(et)) and reduced the constant phase element (CPE(dl)). The effect of CHX-Dg was studied in a 0.5 x 10(-)(4) mmol l(-)(1) to 0.5 mmol l(-)(1) range. The relation between the evolution of R(et) and CHX-Dg concentration was found to be negatively correlated. When CHX-Dg was added, the electrochemical monitoring of the bacterial kinetic adhesion showed that the electrode's capacity (C(P)) variation remained stable, demonstrating that the addition of CHX-Dg in the broth inhibited bacterial adhesion.
