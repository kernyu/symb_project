Peptic ulcer disease is a common gastrointestinal disease whose management and treatment has changed dramatically over the last 25 years. Treatment of peptic ulcer disease has evolved from dietary modifications and antacids to gastric acid suppression with H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors to eradication of Helicobactor pylori infection. Treatment of patients infected with H pylori using antibiotics has changed the natural history of peptic ulcer disease. As a result of H pylori treatment and other unknown factors ulcer disease is declining and complications from ulcer disease have diminished significantly.
