The frequency of alleles with triple mutations conferring sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in the Peruvian Amazon Basin has declined (16.9% for dhfr and 0% for dhps compared to 47% for both alleles in 1997) 5 years after SP was replaced as the first-line treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Microsatellite analysis showed that the dhfr and dhps alleles are of common origin.
