Thirteen new analogues (32-40, 45-48) of recently discovered potent blood-schizontocidal antimalarial agent, 2-tert-butylprimaquine (2) are synthesized and evaluated for in vivo antimalarial activities against drug-sensitive P. berghei strain and multi-drug resistant P. yoelii nigeriensis strain. Two of the amino acid conjugates (47-48) have exhibited potent antimalarial activities similar to that of 2 against both drug-sensitive and multi-drug resistant strains.
