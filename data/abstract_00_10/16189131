The dhps sequences of 55 Plasmodium vivax isolates (39 from Thailand and 16 from elsewhere) revealed mutant Pvdhps at codons 383 and/or 553 (A --> G) in 33 isolates, all from Thailand. Mutations of Pvdhps and Pvdhfr were correlated. Multiple mutations were associated with high-grade sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance.
