Using a mouse model, we tested the effects of in vivo P-glycoprotein inhibition to enhance the oral uptake and penetration into pharmacological sanctuary sites of the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor (HPI) saquinavir. The HPI ritonavir is frequently coadministered with saquinavir to improve saquinavir plasma levels since it strongly reduces the cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated metabolism of saquinavir. Previously, we demonstrated that ritonavir is not an efficient P-glycoprotein inhibitor in vivo, evidenced by the limited oral uptake of saquinavir and its penetration into brain and fetus. Increasing drug concentrations in these sites using more effective P-gp inhibitors might improve therapy but could also lead to toxicity. We orally coadministered ritonavir and saquinavir to mice, with or without the potent P-glycoprotein inhibitor N-(4-[2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-isoquinolinyl)ethyl]-phenyl)-9,10-dih ydro-5-methoxy-9-oxo-4-acridine carboxamide (GF120918). Upon GF120918 coadministration, two of seven P-glycoprotein-deficient animals died. Using a decreased ritonavir dose, GF120918 coadministration led to a 4.4-fold increase in the saquinavir plasma area under the curve in wild-type mice, whereas no such effect was observed in P-glycoprotein-deficient mice. Despite the decreased ritonavir dose, all mice did suffer from impaired gastric emptying. Including GF120918 in a multiple (twice daily) dosing regimen, we found continued accumulation of saquinavir in brain over several days, resulting in 10-fold higher levels compared with vehicle-treated mice. Transient ritonavir-related neurotoxicity, however, was observed after the fourth and final drug dosing. Clinical attempts to efficiently inhibit P-glycoprotein function for improved HPI disposition may therefore be feasible, but they should be performed without ritonavir and monitored carefully for unexpected toxicities.
