OBJECTIVE: To investigate HBV mutations in reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and precore/basal core promoter (PC/BCP) regions in a chronic hepatitis B patient and to analyze the link between the mutations and drug resistance or HBeAg sero-conversion. METHODS: Eighteen serum samples were collected from a chronic hepatitis B patient during his 14 hospitalizations from June 2002 to September 2007. HBV DNA was extracted and nested PCR was employed for amplification of target gene fragments. Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed followed by analysis with NTI software. The significance of the results was analyzed in combination with the clinical data of the patient. RESULTS: Several mutations were identified in succession, including LAM-resistant mutations M204I/V and L180M+M204V, ETV-resistant mutation S202G, and HBeAg nonsense mutation G1896A. The results were in accordance with the disease progression of the patient. CONCLUSION: Sequencing of HBV RT and PC/BCP regions is valuable for comprehensively checking the viral mutations and thus it is helpful in the surveillance of patients in clinics as a way for adopting reasonable antiviral therapy.
