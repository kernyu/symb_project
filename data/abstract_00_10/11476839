The new oxazolidinone antimicrobial, linezolid, has been approved for the treatment of infections caused by various gram-positive bacteria, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Although instances of linezolid resistance in VRE have been reported, resistance has not been encountered among clinical isolates of S aureus. We have characterised an MRSA isolate resistant to linezolid that was recovered from a patient treated with this agent for dialysis-associated peritonitis.
