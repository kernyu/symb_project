In recent fifty years, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were continuously the predominant in burn infections, the only change seen was a rapid increase in their drug-resistance. Under the pressure of antibiotics, Some opportunistic bacteria that were resistant to all available antibiotics emerged, such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Maltophilia stenotrophomonas. For critically burn patients, basing on early surgical intervention, early and short-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotic is advisable, and it may control the infection promptly, prevent further inflammatory reaction, as well as minimize the emergence of antibacterial resistance. To control infections due to pandrug-resistant bacteria, cyclic use of some old antibiotics may be helpful. In dealing with severe infection, a combination of anti-pathogen and anti-inflammatory reaction measures should be considered.
