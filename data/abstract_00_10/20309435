Staphylococcus aureus is an etiological factor of severe infections in both hospital and ambulatory environments. As methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains spread quickly across healthcare centers resulting in life-threatening infections with increased mortality, they are considered more virulent than MSSA strains. Protein A, encoded by the spa gene, is one of the virulence factors involved in the staphylococcal pathogenesis. It has been suggested that the number of 24-bp tandem repeat units along the X region of the spa gene correlates with the virulence level of the strains. The current work analyzed the relationships between the virulence of MRSA and MSSA strains with region X polymorphism. No obvious correlation was observed.
