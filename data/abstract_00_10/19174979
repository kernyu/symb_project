This article demonstrates how rheumatoid arthritis can be confused with septicemic arthritis. Effective diagnosis and treatment depends on timely and effective confirmation of the cause for arthritis. In the future, if such a case were presented, actions must be taken as soon as the bacteremia has been confirmed since the organism is the primary cause of the inflammation and not rheumatoid arthritis. If this is done immediately, the patient's body will be more effective at fighting off nosocomial infections resulting in a better prognosis.
