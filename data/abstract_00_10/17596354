Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to pyrazinamide (PZA) derives mainly from mutations in the pncA gene. We developed a reverse hybridization-based line probe assay with oligonucleotide probes designed to detect mutations in pncA. The detection of PZA resistance was evaluated in 258 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. The sensitivity and specificity of PZA resistance obtained by this new assay were both 100%, consistent with the results of conventional PZA susceptibility testing. This assay can be used with sputa from tuberculosis patients. It appears to be reliable and widely applicable and, given its simplicity and rapid performance, will be a valuable tool for diagnostic use.
