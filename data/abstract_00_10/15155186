Epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCg), the major catechin present in green tea extracts, has been shown to have several antibacterial activities, limiting bacterial growth and invasion and acting in synergy with beta-lactam antibiotics. In this article, we report that EGCg at doses half and below its calculated MIC of 100 microg/ml, is able to reverse tetracycline resistance in staphylococcal isolates expressing the specific efflux pump Tet(K) and appears to improve the MICs of tetracycline for susceptible staphylococcal isolates as well. The visible effect of EGCg is an increased accumulation of tetracycline inside bacterial cells. This effect is likely due to the inhibition of pump activity, and it is evident not only for Tet(K) pumps but also for efflux pumps of a different class [Tet(B)]. In summary, our data indicate that the observed dramatic enhancement by EGCg of tetracycline activity for resistant staphylococcal isolates is caused by impairment of tetracycline efflux pump activity and increased intracellular retention of the drug, suggesting a possible use of EGCg as an adjuvant in antibacterial therapy.
