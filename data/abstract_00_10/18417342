We report herein the development of a new three-dimensional pharmacophore model for HIV-1 integrase inhibitors which led to the discovery of some 4-[1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-2-hydroxy-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids that are able to specifically inhibit the strand transfer step of integration at nanomolar concentration. The synthesis of the new designed molecules is also described.
