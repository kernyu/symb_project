A simple method to determine frequency characteristics of the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance by transconjugative plasmids of various incompatibility groups into Erwinia carotovora strains has been developed. The proposed method for selection of E. carotovora transconjugates provides for the use of selective medium with pectin and corresponding antibiotic, which permits carrying out reliable counterselection of the donor (Escherichia, Salmonella). The proposed method helped to study horizontal transfer of plasmids RP4 (Inc P), R 391 (Inc J) and pKM101 (Inc N) to some E. carotovora strains and to demonstrate their inheritance as extrachromosomal DNA in Erwinia cells.
