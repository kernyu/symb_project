The results of the Shigella antibiotic susceptibility assay within 1995-2002 are presented. 1472 cultures from 1158 patients with intestinal infections and bacteria carriers were isolated. The isolates were tested for their susceptibility to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, ampicillin and ofloxacin. It was shown that S. flexneri and S. sonnei were resistant to tetracycline. The S. flexneri isolates were highly resistant to chloramphenicol (73.3 to 96.0%) while resistance to it in the isolates of S. sonnei varied from 7.7 to 88.5%. In this connection the Levin medium with tetracycline was used to increase the Shigella isolation. In the study of the culture media efficiency with respect to isolation of Shigella it was observed that the Levin medium with tetracycline provided higher rates of S. flexneri and S. sonnei isolation (2.3- and 1.7-fold increase respectively) vs. the Shigella isolation on the Ploskirev medium without the antibiotic.
