OBJECTIVE: Catheter associated bacteriuria is the most common infection acquired in hospitals. The objective of the study was (1) to study the incidence of bacteriuria following indwelling urethral catheterization in patients with short-term vs long-term catheterization (2) to define the antibiotic resistance pattern among these isolates so that the study can provide guidelines for choosing an effective antibiotic against infections in catheterized patients. METHODS: This is a prospective study carried out over a period of 18 months in Neurology/Neurosurgical patients who had indwelling catheters for > or =48 h. RESULTS: In this study, 68 out of 800 (8.5%) adult inpatients acquired urinary tract infection following indwelling bladder catheterizations. The risk was significantly higher for female, elderly patients, critically ill and patients on prolonged catheterization. Among the bacterial pathogens, Escherichia coli was the commonest organism isolated (32.9%) followed by Pseudomonas sp. (15.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (12.3%). Candida sp. comprised 13.7% of all isolates. Among Gram negative bacterial pathogens maximum number of isolates were sensitive to Amikacin (sensitivity of 42%). All Gram positive organisms were however sensitive to Vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide guidelines for choosing salvage therapy against hospital resistant strains causing infection in catheterized patients. However, antibiotics seem to prevent urinary tract infections but primarily in patients catherized for short duration, i.e. 3-14 days and not in patients with long-term catheterization.
