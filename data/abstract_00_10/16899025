AIM: To determine the proportion of bacteria resistant to amoxicillin and doxycycline in subgingival plaque samples from Mexican subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two subgingival plaque samples were taken from 20 Mexican subjects. Samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on non-antibiotic agar plates and on plates containing 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 microg/ml of either amoxicillin or doxycycline. The proportion of resistant bacteria was calculated based on the total number of colony-forming units present in the non-antibiotic containing plates. RESULTS: On average, 0.4-13.4% and 0.9-20.4% of the total cultivable subgingival microbiota was resistant to the concentrations tested of amoxicillin and doxycycline, respectively. The differences between antibiotics were statistically significant for the 0.5, 2 and 4 mug/ml concentrations (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon's test). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that a relatively small proportion of the total cultivable subgingival microbiota from Mexican subjects was resistant to amoxicillin and doxycycline.
