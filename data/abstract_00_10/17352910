One of the greatest advances in molecular genetics has been the application of selectable transposons in molecular biology. After 30 years of use in microbial genetics studies, transposons remain indispensable tools for the generation of null alleles tagged with selectable markers, genetic mapping, manipulation of chromosomes, and generation of various fusion derivatives. The number and uses of transposons as molecular tools continues to expand into new fields such as genome sciences and molecular pathogenesis. This chapter outlines some of the many uses of transposons for molecular genetic analysis and strategies for their use.
