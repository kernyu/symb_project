The activity of the combination of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim against 16 Salmonella enterica serovar typhi isolates from blood cultures were tested by agar dilution checkerboard technique. When used in combination, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim ranged from 0.5 to 1.25 and from 10 to 125 microg/ml, respectively, and fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) from 0.025 to 0.125 and from 2.5 to 10 microg/ml, respectively. The FIC index was 0.140-0.483, indicating a marked synergy between ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim against trimethoprim-resistant S. enterica serovar typhi isolates (100%) with high MICs for ciprofloxacin.
