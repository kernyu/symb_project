Catalase-peroxidase (KatG) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is responsible for the activation of the antitubercular drug isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) and is important for survival of M. tuberculosis in macrophages. Characterization of the structure and catalytic mechanism of KatG is being pursued to provide insights into drug (INH) resistance in M. tuberculosis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare the INH-resistant mutant KatG[S315T], and the overexpressed enzyme was characterized and compared with wild-type KatG. KatG[S315T] exhibits a reduced tendency to form six-coordinate heme, because of coordination of water to iron during purification and storage, and also forms a highly unstable Compound III (oxyferrous enzyme). Catalase activity and peroxidase activity measured using t-butylhydroperoxide and o-dianisidine were moderately reduced in the mutant compared with wild-type KatG. Stopped-flow spectrophotometric experiments revealed a rate of Compound I formation similar to wild-type KatG using peroxyacetic acid to initiate the catalytic cycle, but no Compound I was detected when bulkier peroxides (chloroperoxybenzoic acid, t-butylhydroperoxide) were used. The affinity of resting (ferric) KatG[S315T] for INH, measured using isothermal titration calorimetry, was greatly reduced compared with wild-type KatG, as were rates of reaction of Compound I with the drug. These observations reveal that although KatG[S315T] maintains reasonably good steady state catalytic rates, poor binding of the drug to the enzyme limits drug activation and brings about INH resistance.
