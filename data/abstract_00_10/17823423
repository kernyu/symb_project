BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic and intervention studies indicate that both diet as a whole and single dietary components are involved in the risk of atherosclerosis. The resistance of LDL to oxidative modification is an ex vivo indicator of risk, which is modulated by dietary components. Coffee contains phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity. These molecules are found in plasma after the consumption of coffee, and it has been shown that, in vitro, they are able to decrease the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of coffee consumption on the redox status of LDL as modulated by the possible incorporation of phenolic acids into LDL. DESIGN: Ten healthy volunteers, after an overnight fast, drank 200 mL filtered coffee. Blood was drawn before and 30 and 60 min after drinking. Changes in LDL redox status were evaluated by the measure of LDL resistance to oxidative modification and the concentration of LDL(-), a mildly modified, electronegative LDL subfraction. Chlorogenic and phenolic acids concentration in LDL were measured by electrochemical HPLC. RESULTS: The resistance of LDL to oxidative modification increased significantly after coffee drinking, but the LDL(-) concentration did not increase. The concentration into LDL of conjugated forms of caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids increased significantly after coffee drinking. CONCLUSION: Drinking 200 mL (1 cup) coffee induces an increase in the resistance of LDL to oxidative modification, probably as a result of the incorporation of coffee's phenolic acids into LDL.
