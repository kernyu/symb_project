BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial agents in food producing animals are a very important public health issue. They are routinely added to animal feed at sub-therapeutic levels for their growth promoting properties. This practice, however, carries many disadvantages, such as the stimulation of microbial resistance to antibiotics. AIM: This study was carried out to determine administered Amoxicillin residues in laying chickens and in their commercial eggs, and the effect of cooking and storage condition on Amoxicillin residues in their eggs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 50 terminal faeces were collected from laying hens in addition, a total of 215 commercial egg samples were randomly selected from the farm treated with Amoxicillin. Microbiological agar diffusion method was used. RESULTS: the withdrawal time of Amoxicillin was 7 days. Its residues were detected in both egg yolks and egg whites for 6 successive days after the last drug administration. In addition, Amoxicillin residues remained until the 7th day from drug administration in eggs stored at room temperature, and at 4 degrees C. Amoxicillin residue was not affected after boiling eggs for 10 minutes. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: eggs should not be distributed to markets until the end of the drug's withdrawal period. It is also recommended to observe the withdrawal period of drugs before poultry slaughter or table egg distribution to avoid antimicrobial resistance and to inform both owners and consumers about the risks of antibiotic residues in egg contents.
