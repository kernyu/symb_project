The aim of presented research was to determine microorganisms which cause intrahospital infections (IHI) with specific anatomical localization and to determine the antimicrobial resistance of these organisms in a group of 5106 patients hospitalized at Surgery Department of the University Clinical Center Tuzla in the period between 1 January to 31 December 2004. The research was conducted in accordance with the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) methodology. The results show that in 73.82% of cases the gram-negative organisms (p < 0.001) have been isolated and identified as the IHI pathogens, while the gram-positive organisms (p < 0.05) have been isolated and identified as the IHI pathogens in remaining 26.18% of cases. Urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, respiratory tract infections and bloodstream infections have been mostly caused by gram-negative organisms, while the other infections have been more often caused by gram-positive organisms. Gram-positive organisms were found to be resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and sensitive to the vancomycin. Gram-negative organisms have shown resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycoside and cephalosporins of third generation. They were well sensitive to cinolones and carbapenems.
