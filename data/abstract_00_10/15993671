In response to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, leading to increasing bacterial resistance and decreasing development of new antibiotics, the Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) has developed criteria to guide appropriate and accurate antibiotic selection. The criteria, which are aimed at optimizing antibiotic therapy, include evidence-based results, therapeutic benefits, safety, optimal drug for the optimal duration, and cost-effectiveness.
