Nine Staphylococcus capitis isolates from blood cultures of newborns were examined for resistance to vancomycin. MICs were within the susceptible range, but population profiling revealed a resistant subpopulation. Only isolates with the largest subpopulation were identified as heteroresistant to vancomycin by Etest. This finding may have therapeutic implications.
