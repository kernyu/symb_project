The synergistic effects of 6-alk(en)ylsalcylic acids, also known as anacardic acids, in combination with methicillin against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 33591 (MRSA) was investigated. The double bond in C15-anacardic acids is not essential in eliciting the antibacterial activity but is associated with increasing the activity. The synergistic effects decreased with increasing the number of double bonds in the alkyl chain. On the other hand, the antibacterial activity of anacardic acids possessing different alkyl chain lengths against the same MRSA strain was found to be a parabolic function of their lipophilicity and maximized with the alkyl chain length of C10 and C12. Notably, the synergistic effects were noted to increase with increasing the alkyl chain length.
