Lymphotactin (Lptn) is a C chemokine that attracts T cells and NK cells. Dendritic cells (DC) are highly efficient, specialized antigen-presenting cells and antigen-pulsed DC has been regarded as promising vaccines in cancer immunotherapy. The aim of our present study is to improve the therapeutic efficacy of DC-based tumor vaccine by increasing the preferential chemotaxis of DC to T cells. In this study, Lptn and/or melanoma-associated antigen gp100 were transfected into mouse bone marrow-derived DC, which were used as vaccines in B16 melanoma model. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with DC adenovirally cotransfected with Lptn and gp100 (Lptn/gp100-DC) could enhance the cytotoxicities of CTL and NK cells, increase the production of IL-2 and interferon-gamma significantly, as compared with immunization with gp100-DC, Lptn-DC, LacZ-DC, DC or PBS counterparts. The Lptn/gp100-DC immunized mice exhibited resistance to tumor challenge most effectively. It was found that the tumor mass of mice vaccinated by Lptn/gp100-DC showed obvious necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. In vivo depletion analysis demonstrated that CD8(+) T cells are the predominant T cell subset responsible for the antitumor effect of Lptn/gp100-DC and CD4(+) T cells were necessary in the induction phase of tumor rejection, while NK cells were less important although they participated in the antitumor response either in the induction phase or in the effector phase. In the murine model with the pre-established subcutaneous B16 melanoma, immunization with Lptn/gp100-DC inhibited the tumor growth most significantly when compared with other counterparts. These findings provide a potential strategy to improve the efficacy of DC-based tumor vaccines.
