A total of 81 isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis were analyzed by antibiotic susceptibility, phage typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Thirty-two isolates came from broiler carcasses and pig feces, and 49 isolates were from humans in Seoul and suburbs of Seoul, Korea. Antibiotic resistance was most prevalent among human isolates. Of human isolates, 89.8% were resistant to more than two antibiotics, while 64.7% of poultry isolates and 13.3% of pig isolates showed multiple resistance to more than two antibiotics. The most common phage type (PT) was PT1, followed by PT30 or 33, PT21 and PT20a. The isolates showed six PFGE patterns with XbaI or SpeI digestion, and five PFGE patterns with NotI digestion. But a single pattern, PFGE X1, S1, or N1, was predominant and the rest of the PFGE patterns differed by only one or two bands. Results indicated the spread of a genetically related clone of Salmonella Enteritidis in foods and humans in Korea and that phage typing as well as PFGE may offer an improved level of discrimination for the epidemiological investigation of Salmonella Enteritidis.
