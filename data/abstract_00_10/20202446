The yield from aspirating lymph nodes and pleural fluid for diagnosing extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis is unknown. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from lymph node or pleural fluid aspirates of 21 patients; 7 (33%) cultures grew XDR M. tuberculosis. Additive diagnostic yield for XDR M. tuberculosis was found in parallel culture of sputum and fluid aspirate.
