The low hydrothermal stability of the raw collagen restricts its usage. To improve the hydrothermal stability of collagen, two kinds of materials with weak astringency were used by experts. The research proved that the synergistic effect was formed during the process. In this study, by using UV, FT-IR, 13CNMR spectra and elemental analysis on the salicylic acid and metal-salicylic complexes, we could get the structural formula of every compound. And then, the hide powder was treated with the compounds. At last, the treated hide powder was tested by DSC. It could be presumed that the Rigid Matrix formed between the collagen doses can increase the hydrothermal stability of raw collagen, The result indicated that salicylic-chrome with large stable constant was better than others in improving the heat resistance of raw collagen, and the denaturalization temperature of hide powder treated with salicylic-chrome was 146.7 degrees C. Salicylic-aluminum was in the second place, the relevant temperature being 145.7 degrees C.
