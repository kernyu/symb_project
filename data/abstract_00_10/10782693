A series of novel 6-O-substituted erythromycin A derivatives has been synthesized. Good in vitro antibacterial activity has been demonstrated for analogues incorporating a variety of structural features. The methodology disclosed is expected to find application in the design of future macrolide antibiotics that target the prevalent bacterial resistance problem.
