Antimicrobial resistance among Clostnridium perfringens isolated from feces of humans and pigs, food and other environmental sources was examined by testing of 201 PCR-confirmed strains for resistance to 7 antimicrobial agents. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the agar dilution method. Overall, C. perfringens showed the highest resistance to tetracycline (56.2%), followed by imipenem (24.9%), metronidazole (9.5%), penicillin G (9%), vancomycin (4.5%), chloramphenicol (3%) and ceftriaxone (1%). The majority of the isolated strains from pig feces (77.8%), environment (72.7%), human feces (44.9%) and food (28%) showed resistance to tetracycline. Strains isolated from human feces only showed low resistance to ceftriaxone (2.5%) and vancomycin (10.1%). Penicillin G had high activity, with overall MIC50 and MIC90 of 0.06 and 1.0 microg/ml, respectively, and low rate of resistance (10-12% for strains isolated from humans, animals and food). Among 62.7% of antimicrobial resistant strains, 39.3% were resistant to a single drug and 23.4% were multiple-drug resistant (MDR). Of overall 47 MDR strains, 63.8% were derived from human feces and were resistant to two to six drugs.
