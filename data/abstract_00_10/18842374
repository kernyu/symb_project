The 1st 9 clinical isolates of multisensitive community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) from Malaysia carry SCCmec type IV and predominantly cause skin and soft-tissue infections. Seven were classified as nosocomially acquired. There was considerable clonal diversity, with both pandemic and novel multilocus sequence types detected. CA-MRSA rates appear to be increasing in our hospital, warranting close surveillance.
