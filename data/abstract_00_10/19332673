Waddlia chondrophila is an emerging cause of miscarriage in bovines and humans. Given the strict intracellular growth of this Chlamydia-like organism, its antibiotic susceptibility was tested by amoebal coculture, cell culture, and real-time PCR. W. chondrophila was susceptible to doxycycline and azithromycin but resistant to beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones.
