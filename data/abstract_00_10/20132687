The antibiotic resistance in Salmonella isolates from 400 imported chicken carcasses in Bhutan and from 178 pig carcasses in Vietnam were analyzed on a random basis against 14 antimicrobial agents. Among the poultry samples tested, 13% were positive for Salmonella. Salmonella Enteritidis dominated with a prevalence of 80.7%, and 40 of the 42 isolates harbored two or more resistance determinants. For the 178 pigs investigated, 49.4% of the swabs and 34.8% of the lymph nodes were Salmonella positive. The most prevalent serotypes in lymph nodes were Salmonella Derby (50.0%) and Salmonella Typhimurium (27.4%). From the Salmonella isolates from pigs, only 6% were sensitive to the antimicrobial agents tested. The high resistance level of Salmonella isolates from pigs and chicken carcasses to different classes of antimicrobials should be emphasized and encourage a prudent use of these agents in animal farming, especially in pig production.
