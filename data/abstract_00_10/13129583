The C-4 side chain modification of lead compound 1 has resulted in the identification of a potent and selective Candida albicans N-myristoyltransferase (CaNmt) inhibitor RO-09-4609, which exhibits antifungal activity against C. albicans in vitro. Further modification of its C-2 substituent has led to the discovery of RO-09-4879, which exhibits antifungal activity in vivo. The drug design is based on X-ray crystal analysis of a CaNmt complex with benzofuran derivative 4a. The optimization incorporates various biological investigations including a quasi in vivo assay and pharmacokinetic study. The computer aided drug design, synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and biological properties of RO-09-4879 are described in detail.
