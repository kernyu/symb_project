A flow cytometric (fluorescence-activated cell sorter [FACS]) assay was developed for analysis of the drug susceptibilities of wild-type and drug-resistant influenza A and B virus laboratory strains and clinical isolates for the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir carboxylate, zanamivir, and peramivir. The drug susceptibilities of wild-type influenza viruses and those with mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) and/or NA genes rendering them resistant to one or more of the NA inhibitors were easily determined with the FACS assay. The drug concentrations that reduced the number of virus-infected cells or the number of PFU by 50% as determined by the FACS assay were similar to those obtained with the more time-consuming and labor-intensive virus yield reduction assay. The NA inhibition (NAI) assay confirmed the resistance patterns demonstrated by the FACS and virus yield assays for drug-resistant influenza viruses with mutations in the NA gene. However, only the FACS and virus yield assays detected NA inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses with mutations in the HA gene but not in the NA gene. The FACS assay is more rapid and less labor-intensive than the virus yield assay and just as quantitative. The FACS assay determines the drug susceptibilities of influenza viruses with mutations in either the HA or NA genes, making the assay more broadly useful than the NAI assay for measuring the in vitro susceptibilities of influenza viruses for NA inhibitors. However, since only viruses with mutations in the NA gene that lead to resistance to the NA inhibitors correlate with clinical resistance, this in vitro assay should not be used in the clinical setting to determine resistance to NA inhibitors. The assay may be useful for determining the in vivo susceptibilities of other compounds effective against influenza A and B viruses.
