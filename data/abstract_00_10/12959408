Macrolide and lincosamide resistance phenotypes and the presence of the erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), and mef(A) genes were determined in 344 bacterial strains belonging to 34 species and nine genera, isolated from the tonsils and nasal cavities of 2-week- and 6-week-old piglets, derived from four different farms. These piglets had never before been treated with macrolides or lincosamides. Macrolide and lincosamide resistance was most frequently present in Streptococcus and Enterococcus strains, of which over two-thirds were resistant. These genera were followed in decreasing order of resistance frequency by Lactobacillus, Rothia, Staphylococcus, Arcanobacterium, Actinomyces, Pediococcus strains. Only five infrequently occurring species did not show resistance. This high frequency of resistance in nontreated piglets indicates that resistant strains circulate in the herds. In streptococci, enterococci, and Lactobacillus strains, resistance was most often encoded by the erm(B) gene and in staphylococci by erm(A) or erm(C). The erm(B) gene was sporadically detected in other bacterial genera (Actinomyces, Rothia, Aerococcus, Pediococcus). The sequence of the erm(B) gene of 29 strains of 11 pigs originating from the four different farms was determined. This sequence was identical in 12 strains and only differed by 1-6 nucleotides in the other strains, indicating that exchanges of resistance genes might occur between bacterial species and genera belonging to the nasal or tonsillar flora of piglets.
