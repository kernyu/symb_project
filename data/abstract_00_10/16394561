Further study of the methanol extract of the stem bark of Allanblackia monticola STANER L.C. resulted in the isolation of a new prenylated xanthenedione, designated allanxanthone C, together with the five known xanthones, garciniafuran, tovophyllin A, rubraxanthone, norcowanin and mangostin and one saponin, stigmasterol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The structure of the new compound was established by detailed spectroscopic analysis to be 1,2-dihydro-3,6,8-trihydroxy-1,1,7-tri(3-methylbut-2-enyl)xanthen-2,9-dione (3-hydroxyapetalinone C). The methanol extract and pure compounds were tested on two strains of Plasmodium falciparum, F32 (chloroquine sensitive) and FcM29 (chloroquine resistant). The IC50 values obtained ranged from 0.6 to 8.9 microg/ml. Their cytotoxicity was estimated on human melanoma cells (A375) and the cytotoxicity/antiplasmodial ratio was found to be between 15.45 and 30.46. The antimicrobial activities against a range of microorganisms of the crude extract and some of these compounds are also reported.
