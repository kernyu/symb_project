Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (S.) serovar Agona plays an important role in Brazil as causative agent of salmonellosis in food-producing animals - in particular, pigs and poultry - as well as in humans. A total of 45 S. Agona isolates collected from slaughter pigs at three different slaughterhouses in Southern Brazil was investigated in this study for their phenotypic and genotypic relatedness. For this, the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the phage types were determined. Molecular analysis included the determination of plasmid profiles as well as the analysis of XbaI- and BlnI-generated macro-restriction patterns. Moreover, a novel typing method called subtracted restriction fingerprinting (SRF) was successfully applied to the S. Agona isolates. Based on all properties determined, a dominant clonal group comprising 33 of the 45 isolates was identified. Members of this group were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested, did not carry plasmids, shared the same phage type and were closely related or even indistinguishable by their EcoRI-PauI SRF patterns as well as their XbaI and BlnI macro-restriction patterns. Members of this clonal group were identified at all 3 slaughterhouses at variable frequencies and originated from pig herds raised in 15 different cities in Southern Brazil which were located up to 450 km apart from each other. Since the S. Agona-carrying slaughter pigs were from various integrated production lines, the results of this study suggest that a specific clonal group of S. Agona had entered numerous pig production lines. This observation supports the requirement for the establishment of monitoring and control programmes in Brazil which should also include molecular techniques to better trace the dissemination of S. Agona and other Salmonella serovars in pigs and other food-producing animals.
