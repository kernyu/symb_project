(1) In patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major factor in the development of chronic respiratory failure and premature death. (2) Over the last two decades, such patients have commonly received long-term treatment with antibiotic aerosols (mainly tobramycin or colistin, in off-licence uses). (3) Tobramycin solution for nebulisation is the first antibiotic preparation to be licensed in the EU for this indication. (4) Comparative evaluation of antibiotic aerosol therapy for chronic bronchial infections due to P. aeruginosa includes two large trials of nebulised tobramycin. (5) A combined analysis of these two placebo-controlled trials, both lasting 20 weeks, showed that tobramycin aerosol delayed the deterioration of respiratory function and reduced the number of hospitalisations. However, an increase in P. aeruginosa resistance to tobramycin was reported. (6) The file on tobramycin includes no precise criteria for stopping treatment, and no data on the long-term impact of the observed increase in bacterial resistance. (7) The main adverse effects of tobramycin aerosol are tinnitus and voice changes. Deafness has also been reported. (8) The available assessment file does not show whether the risk-benefit ratio of tobramycin aerosol differs from that of other nebulised antibiotics used (off-licence) in this setting. However, tobramycin is the best-assessed nebulised antibiotic for this indication. (9) In practice, tobramycin solution for nebulisation may be considered the reference long-term treatment for chronic pulmonary infections due to P. aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis. Assessment should continue, however, especially regarding the possible impact on mortality and the selection of resistant strains.
