Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is increasing. It may be community or hospital acquired and is characteristically difficult to eradicate. Here we report a case of a two-year-old girl who sustained a traumatic tympanic membrane perforation following a minor burns injury. She was seen as an out-patient in a burns unit and subsequently developed MRSA otorrhoea. This was treated with a two-week course of fusidic acid topical drops. At three-week follow up the tympanic membrane had healed and the infection had healed completely. Fusidic acid is safe and effective in the treatment of MRSA otorrhoea. We need to maintain vigilance in the treatment of otorrhoea, as MRSA may become an increasingly common pathogen in the future.
