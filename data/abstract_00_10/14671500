The worldwide burden of respiratory tract disease is enormous. Resistance to penicillins, macrolides, and cephalosporins is now detected among the leading bacterial pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections (RTIs)-Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The increasing role of atypical/intracellular pathogens (eg, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila) in RTIs, as well as their increase in antibiotic resistance prevalence, continues to be of great concern. More recently introduced treatment options for RTIs include the newer respiratory fluoroquinolones, along with the macrolides and azalides. Although these agents demonstrate good activity against common respiratory pathogens, reduced susceptibility to these agents has been reported. The ketolides are recently developed antibacterial agents with targeted-spectrum activity against common respiratory tract pathogens, including atypical/intracellular pathogens, and a low potential for inducing resistance. These promising new drugs have shown in vitro and in vivo efficacy in the treatment of community-acquired RTIs, such as community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis.
