The management of HBV or HCV has improved dramatically over the last decade with the development of new drugs. This paper provides a review of new available and developing treatment options for HBV and HCV associated liver diseases. In the closer future the most realistic therapeutical option for most of the patients with HBV and HCV infection will be combination and/or long-term usage of the new, stronger antiviral drugs, if they maintain good safety profiles, achieve low resistance rates and will be available at lower prices.
