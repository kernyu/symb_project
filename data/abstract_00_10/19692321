Taxane resistance is a common clinical problem in the treatment of many metastatic malignancies. Observational clues or evidence of overcoming such resistance is important for developing treatments that can extend taxane activity. We report a case of the reversal of docetaxel resistance with the addition of antiangiogenic agents bevacizumab and thalidomide to docetaxel and prednisone in a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after PSAWG progression on docetaxel and prednisone. The patient then responded for an additional 7 months. The addition of bevacizumab and thalidomide after progression on docetaxel/prednisone might reverse docetaxel resistance. These or other antiangiogenic agents for overcoming clinical taxane resistance are candidates for further study.
