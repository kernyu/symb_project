We report here on the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against a global collection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae collected between 2004 and 2008 as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial. A total of 6785 S. pneumoniae and 6642 H. influenzae isolates were collected, most from North America. The percentages of penicillin-intermediate resistance and penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae in North America were 27.8% and 14.3%, respectively. Penicillin resistance ranged from 9.3% in Europe to 25.1% in the Asia-Pacific Rim. The rate of beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae was 25.8% in North America, and among the other regions, it ranged from 8.7% in South Africa to 26.8% in the Asia-Pacific Rim. Tigecycline MIC(90)'s were 0.03 to 0.12 mg/L and 0.5 to 2 mg/L, depending on the region considered, against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively. Tigecycline had low MIC(90)'s against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, irrespective of resistance to beta-lactams.
