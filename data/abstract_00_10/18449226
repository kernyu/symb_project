Serratia marcescens is an important nosocomial agent having high antibiotic resistance. A major mechanism for S. marcescens antibiotic resistance is active efflux. To ascertain the substrate specificity of the S. marcescens SdeCDE efflux pump, we constructed pump gene deletion mutants. sdeCDE knockout strains showed no change in antibiotic susceptibility in comparison with the parental strains for any of the substrates, with the exception of novobiocin. In addition, novobiocin was the only antibiotic to be accumulated by sdeCDE-deficient strains. Based on the substrates used in our study, we conclude that SdeCDE is a Resistance-Nodulation-Cell Division family pump with limited substrate specificity.
