Of 1,994 group B streptococcal isolates collected, 26 (1.3%) of the isolates were resistant to levofloxacin, and cross-resistance to other fluoroquinolones was observed. The emergence and prevalence of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance in genetically unrelated isolates were linked to the presence of gyrA, parC, and parE triple mutations in each isolate.
