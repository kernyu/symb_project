Small strongyles (Cyathostominae) are common nematode parasites of horses that have developed resistance to the benzimidazole anthelmintics used to control their populations. Evidence suggests that the principal mechanism of resistance involves a phenylalanine-to-tyrosine mutation at codon 200 in the beta-tubulin proteins that are components of microtubules. Other works, however, suggest that a phenylalanine-to-tyrosine mutation at codon 167, or alternative mechanisms, may be involved. As part of an ongoing project examining the role that these two beta-tubulin mutations may play in benzimidazole resistance, we have cloned the wild-type allele and the two alleles with the phenylalanine-to-tyrosine mutations at codons 167 and 200 of the beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene from the small strongyle Cylicocyclus nassatus. In this work, we describe the construction of expression vectors containing these alleles and their expression in Escherichia coli.
