The present view focuses on the possibility that cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) might, in addition to their killing effects due to permeabilization of microbial membranes, also function similarly to beta-lactam antibiotics to activate nascent autolytic wall enzymes, leading to bacteriolysis. Since the massive release of microbial cell wall components is a major cause of postinfectious sequelae, the in vivo process of bacteriolysis must be controlled. Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria, CAMPs might be useful as an alternative to antibiotics. However, they should be used with caution, since they might also function as a 'double-edged sword' by injuring both the bacteria and host.
