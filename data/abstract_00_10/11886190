Antimicrobial control measures are commonly perceived to lead to an improvement in quality of prescribing, cost-effectiveness and reduction in resistance. All three outcomes have been subject to scrutiny. As proper use of resources needs to be balanced with provision of high-quality health care, the effectiveness of control measures (antibiotic policies or formularies) must be monitored. Measurement of quality by using specific indicators has been suggested as an effective measure of performance. We describe a model for evaluating core aspects of antimicrobial control programmes, aimed at improving the quality of glycopeptide prescribing by 'appropriate use guidelines'. Prioritizing indicator settings within antimicrobial control programmes is essential if limited resources are to be used most effectively. Indicator development, evaluation and feedback ought to be multi-disciplinary to ensure ownership and long-term benefit.
