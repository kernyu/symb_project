An efficient and fast diagnostic assay was developed to detect the point mutation involved in the resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine. The test, based upon a real-time PCR principle and performed with the LightCycler system, was carried out on venous blood isolates from 221 cases of falciparum malaria. The assay provided a quick, sensitive and reliable detection of the T76 Pfcrt mutation and the chloroquine resistance. The results of this study suggest that this LightCycler-based technique could be used to optimise the treatment of imported uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and also for the molecular surveillance of drug resistance among imported cases of this disease.
