Bacterial burden significantly interferes with the healing process in chronic ulcers. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in regulating skin's response to infection and wound healing. In previous studies, we demonstrated that exogenous NO gas (gNO) at 200 parts per million (ppm) exhibits potent antimicrobial effects against a representative range of pathogens. The aim of the present study is to explore the antimicrobial properties of gNO in vivo and to determine skin cells' sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of gNO. To test gNO's antimicrobial effects, full-thickness wounds were infected with Staphylococcus aureus on the dorsal skin surface of New Zealand White rabbit and treated with 200 ppm gNO for 8 hours/day for 3 consecutive days. Significant reduction in wound bacterial content was observed in the presence of gNO. In a separate experiment, primary cultures of human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells were established to test gNO's cytotoxicity in the skin. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium proliferation assays demonstrated that human skin cells, unlike bacterial cells, exhibited significant resistance toward gNO cytotoxicity. In vitro migration studies on keratinocytes and endothelial cells revealed that gNO treatment does not seem to interfere with reepithelialization and angiogenesis during the process of wound healing. Following 24 hours of gNO treatment, fibroblasts expressed significantly higher levels of procollagen and, to a lesser degree, a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase -1 mRNA. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence for the potential application of high doses of gNO as an antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infection in chronic nonhealing ulcers or burn patients, without compromising the viability, and function of skin cells.
