Pyrazofurin (PZF), a cytidine analog and an inhibitor of orotate monophosphate decarboxylase, has been shown to decrease the levels of UTP and CTP in treated cells. When Sindbis virus (SV)-infected Aedes albopictus cells were treated with PZF, the yield of virus was reduced 100- to 1000-fold. By serial passage of our standard SV(STD) in Ae. albopictus cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of PZF, a mutant, SV(PZF), was derived, which was not inhibited by PZF. SV(PZF) is also resistant to adenosine, guanosine, and phosphono-acetyl-N-aspartate, all of which have been shown to decrease levels of UTP and CTP. Analysis of chimeric viruses containing sequences from the SV(PZF) and parental genomes showed that the sequence between nt 5262 and 7999 conferred the PZF-resistant phenotype. Sequencing of this region identified four mutations (nt 5750, 6627, 7543, and 7593), which are predicted to lead to amino acid changes: opal550L in nsP3 and M287L, K592I, and P609T in nsP4. Characterization of viruses containing one or more of these mutations demonstrated that all three mutations in the nsP4 coding region are required to produce full resistance to PZF. Using a molecular model of nsP4 based on the structure of HIV reverse transcriptase, we located amino acid change M287L at the tip of the fingers domain and K592I and P609T at the base of the thumb domain of the viral RNA polymerase. We suggest that these three amino acid changes in nsP4 alter the geometry of the NTP binding pocket so as to increase the affinity of the enzyme for CTP and UTP.
