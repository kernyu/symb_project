Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common bacterial pathogen responsible for a variety of infections in both children and adults. Treatment of infections caused by this organism is problematic due to its resistance to many drugs. Recent reports of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections in patients with no known risk factors have serious public health implications. Therapeutic options for these infections are untested; therefore, the potential exists for high morbidity and mortality. Recently, clinical definitions have been established, and new molecular approaches have allowed investigators to distinguish CA-MRSA more easily from traditional nosocomial-derived MRSA strains. Identifying potential risk factors for CA-MRSA acquisition and fully characterizing the epidemiologic, clinical, and molecular properties of these strains are necessary to provide effective therapeutic guidelines.
