Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates having dipeptide insertions in the fingers subdomain of the reverse transcriptase (RT) show high level resistance to 3 '-azido-3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT) and other nucleoside analogues. Insertions are usually associated with thymidine analogue resistance mutations, such as T215Y. The resistance phenotype correlates with increased ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity, which facilitates removal of thymidine analogues from inhibitor-terminated primers. In this report, we show that substituting Thr, Ser, or Asn for Tyr-215 in a multidrug-resistant RT, bearing a Ser-Ser insertion between codons 69 and 70, leads to AZT and stavudine resensitization through the loss of the ATP-mediated removal activity. The mutation D67N, which is rarely found in insertion-containing strains, had no effect on excision and a minor influence on resistance. Substituting Tyr-215 had a larger effect than deleting the dipeptide insertion. The presence of both the insertion and mutation T215Y in the wild-type BH10 RT conferred significant ATP-mediated removal activity and moderate resistance to AZT. However, resistance levels and unblocking activities were lower than those observed with the multidrug-resistant enzyme. Removal reactions can be inhibited by the next complementary dNTP. Both Tyr-215 and the dipeptide insertion affect RT-DNA.DNA-dNTP ternary complex formation, an effect that was not detected in the presence of foscarnet. Based on crystal structures of binary and ternary complexes of HIV-1 RT, we propose that Tyr-215 exerts its action by facilitating a proper orientation of the pyrophosphate donor molecule, whereas the effects on dNTP binding are indirect and could be related to significant conformational changes occurring during polymerization.
