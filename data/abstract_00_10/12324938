We report two cases of bacteremia with Ochrobactrum anthropi in patients on hemodialysis. Bacteremia became clinically manifest by recurrent febrile episodes during and after dialysis. In one patient, bacteremia persisted after ciprofloxacin therapy and was cleared only by removal of the dialysis catheter and a 3-week course of gentamicin. The second patient remained intermittently bacteremic for more than 3 months, although the dialysis catheter had been replaced. A MEDLINE search revealed only one previous report of O anthropi bloodstream infection in a patient on hemodialysis, but the pathogen is recognized increasingly as a causative agent of human disease, most importantly in debilitated patients. In contrast to most previously described cases, the two patients reported here had no malignancies and were not on immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment of O anthropi infection is challenging because of widespread and unpredictable resistance to antimicrobial agents and discrepancies between in vitro susceptibility and in vivo efficacy.
