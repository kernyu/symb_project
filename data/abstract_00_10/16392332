The study was concerned with investigation of the biochemical properties, antibiotic resistance and the effect of various doses of penicillin on the activity of metabolic enzymes in the bacterial cells of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the pharynx mucosa of healthy subjects. The study revealed an increase in the aggressive properties of the representatives of the mouth normal microflora. It was also observed that the highest percentage of the staphylococcal isolates was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The effect of various concentrations of penicillin on the microbial metabolism was shown to be directed at different targets. Penicillin intensified the aerobic processes and lipid synthesis in the bacterial cells. The reactions of the processes of the amino acid metabolism proceeded in different directions. Some concentrations of penicillin inhibited such processes.
