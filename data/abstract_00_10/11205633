Presented here is a case of septicemia caused by an uncommon, multiresistant, gram-positive microorganism (Pediococcus acidilactici) after long-term antibiotic treatment. Pediococcus spp. are rarely cultivated from clinical specimens, and species differentiation is difficult due to the paucity of phenotypic traits. In this case, a polyphasic approach consisting of phenotypic and molecular genetic analyses was used, and the identification of Pediococcus acidilactici was conclusive. Precise identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of rarely isolated bacteria are required in order to provide adequate treatment to infected patients and to determine the pathogenic role of these organisms.
