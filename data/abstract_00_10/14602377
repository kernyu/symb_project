Antibacterial activity of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) was evaluated against 23 vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) strains isolated from several Asian and European countries, Brazil, South Africa and USA, and against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp (VRE) genotypes A, B and C. DAPG was active against a wide range of VRSA isolates as well as vancomycin hetero-resistant S. aureus (h-VRSA) at MIC 4 mg/l. This substance also had moderate activity against both VRE-A and -B at MIC 8 mg/l, but not against VRE-C at up to 16 mg/l. The activity of DAPG did not directly correlate with levels of vancomycin resistance in VRSA and VRE. These results suggest that DAPG might be useful in developing new antibiotics against VRSA.
