OBJECTIVE: To analyze the types, distribution characteristics and in vitro susceptibility of antibiotic agents of ocular non-viral microbial isolates in children. METHODS: Experimental research.785 specimens obtained from children below the age of 14 in Beijing Tongren Hospital during 1999 to 2004 were cultured and identified for bacterium, fungus and Acanthamoeba respectively at Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology. Microbial culture-positive rate, susceptibility patterns and the organisms distribution of positive cultures were retrospectively analyzed. The results were statistical analyzed by chi(2). RESULTS: Of the 785 specimens, 211 were culture positive. The percentage of positive culture was 26.88%. Of those positive cultures, 176 (83.41%) had pure bacterial infections, 32 (15.17%) had pure fungal infections, and 3 (1.42%) had pure cultures of Acanthamoeba. Of the 176 bacterial positive cultures, polymicrobial infection was present in 38 cases (33 bacterial, 5 fungal and bacterial). Of 214 bacterial isolates, the most common isolate was Neisseria gonorrhoeae (39/214, 18.22%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (37/214, 17.29%), and Corynebacterium spp. (36/214, 16.82%). The most common fungal pathogen isolated was Fusarium spp. representing 25.00% (8/32) of all positive fungal cultures, followed by Aspergillus spp. (15.63%, 5/32). The sensitivity of tobramycin, norfloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, rifampicin and levofloxacin of bacteria was 62.57%, 64.94%, 70.06%, 70.87%, 71.19%, 73.89%, 85.80% and 87.50%. Gram-positive isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. Gram-negative isolates showed high susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin. The fungal isolates were most susceptible to natamycin, followed by terbinafine, but resistant to fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are the most common pathogens in non-viral microbial eye infection in children. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Corynebacterium spp. are the most common bacterial pathogens, which are highly susceptible to levofloxacin and rifampicin. Fusarium spp. and Aspergillus spp. are the most common fungal pathogens, which are highly susceptible to natamycin but resistant to fluconazole.
