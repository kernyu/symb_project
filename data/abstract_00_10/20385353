This study sought to identify mechanisms behind resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin in Irish multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. The most prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes identified were bla SHV-12 and bla CTX-M-15. These were associated with the fluoroquinolone resistance genes aac(6')-IB-cr, qnrA and qnrB, not previously reported in Irish isolates.
