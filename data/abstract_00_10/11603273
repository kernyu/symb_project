MECHANISM OF ACTION: Synercid', an antibiotic designed around the concept of molecular synergism, is composed of 70% dafopristin or spectrogramin A and 30% quinupristin or spectrogramin B. First, dafopristin binds to the ribosomal 50S unit changing the conformation of the ribosome. This increases the affinity of quinupristin that in turn binds to the bacterial ribosome. This double binding interrupts protein synthesis and blocks bacterial growth. ACTIVITY: In vitro, Synercid is particularly active against Gram positive cocci, irrespective of the strain's resistance phenotype. It is notably active against meti-sensitive and meti-resistant S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecium. MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE TO MACROLIDES/LINCOSAMIDES/STREPTOGRAMINS: The most frequently encountered mechanism is a modification of the ribosomal target. Two other mechanisms can also be operating: enzyme inactivation or efflux phenomenon. Another mechanism of resistance, LSA phenotype, remains poorly understood. Only a very small proportion of the patients are concerned by resistance (9 patients in a study enrolling 880 patients).
