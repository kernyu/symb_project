Antibiotic susceptibility of nosocomial Klebsiella isolates from inpatients of 30 medical centres in 15 various regions of Russia was studied. In total 212 strains were tested. The Klebsiella genus was represented by the following species: Klebsiella pmeumoniae ss. pneumoniae (182 isolates, 85.8%), Klebsiella pneumonia ss. ozaenae (1 isolate, 0.5%), Klebsiella oxytoca (29 isolates, 13.7%). The susceptibility was determined by the broth microdilution method. Carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) remained to be the most active antibacterial agents. However, 1 imipenem resistant strain and 2 meropenem resistant strains were isolated. As for the 3rd generation cephalosporins, the lowest MICs were observed with the use of the inhibitor-protected agents, such as ceftazidime/clavulanic acid (MIC50 0.25 mcg/ml, MIC90 64 mcg/ml). 48.8%, 16.9%, 29.7% and only 10.5% of the isolates was susceptible to cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefoperazone respectively. Detecting of the beta-lactamase genes (TEM, SHV and CTX) was performed by PCR in 42 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae ss. pneumoniae. Alone or in various combination the TEM type beta-lactamases were detected in 16 (38.1%) isolates. SHV and CTX were detected in 29 (69%) and 27 (64.3%) isolates respectively. Combinations of 2 and 3 different determinants of resistance to beta-lactams were revealed in 23.8% and 26.2% of the isolates respectively. No isolates producing class B MBL among the carbapenem resistant nosocomial Klebsiella strains were detected.
