HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is one of the main targets for antiviral therapy. Two classes of RT inhibitors can be distinguished: those that are nucleoside or nucleotide analogues (sharing the common NRTIs abbreviation) and those that are not. This review focuses on the NRTIs, which are highly efficient in slowing down viral replication and are used in combination regimens. Unfortunately, the current inhibitors do not completely suppress viral replication and due to the high capacity of adaptation of HIV, allow the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Resistance mechanisms to NRTIs have been extensively investigated and can be divided into two types: improved discrimination of a nucleotide analogue relative to the natural substrate or increased phosphorolytic cleavage of an analogue-blocked primer. This knowledge is important both for the development of new drugs designed to target resistant strains and for the development of new antiviral strategies. The NRTIs currently in clinical trials and new developments in this area are also reviewed.
