INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is associated with morbidity, mortality, and an increase in cost. Our objective was to assess bacterial resistance from cultures of patients with non-complicated urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: We analyzed antibiotic resistance using the VITEK-II system among patients attending the internal medicine unit with non-complicated UTI. RESULTS: 1,479 urine cultures were performed; we excluded: 98 due to contamination, 924 had no bacterial growth, and 57 had missing data. Among the 404 samples that were positive, 240 were found among out patients and 164 among hospitalized patients. E coli were the most frequent pathogen, followed by Enterococcus, and K pneumonia, in out patients; E coli, P aeruginosa, and fungal infections (23% of cases) in hospitalized patients. Samples with E coli among out patients displayed resistance of 50% to fluoroquinolones and 55% to sulfas. Among hospitalized patients, resistance was observed in 71 and 66% respectively. Resistance to P aeruginosa was 38% for amynoglucosides and carbapenems and 100% for piperacillin; Enterococcus had 50% for fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSION: E. coli is the most common pathogen among UTI patients. We must adapt guidelines to recommend antibiotics and design a comprehensive control program to reduce the high levels of bacterial antibiotic resistance among our population.
