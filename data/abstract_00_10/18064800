OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of six culture media (five complex and one mineral) on biofilm formation and response to oxidative stress in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 strains) and Vibrio cholerae non-O1 (3 strains). METHODS: Biofilm formation was quantitatively determined by a crystal violet absorption assay. The bacterial response to oxidative stress evoked by hydrogen peroxide was visualized as a zone of clearing around the disc after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: For both of the bacterial species studied, biofilm formation was the highest after cultivation in tryptone soya broth (TSM) or in TSM supplemented with 8% glucose (TSM+GL), being the lowest in mineral medium (MM). V. cholerae non O1 strains were 1.4 to 4.3 times more responsive on average to oxidative stress depending on culture medium as compared with P. aeruginosa strains. The culture medium had no significant effect on H2O2 evoked by response to oxidative stress in vibrios in contrast to P. aeruginosa. In P. aeruginosa, the highest mean resistance to H2O2 was observed after cultivation in peptone water while the most sensitive cells were found after incubation in TSM+GL and MM. CONCLUSION: The culture medium composition influnced biofilm formation in both of the bacterial species tested and had a considerable effect on response to oxidative stress in P. aeruginosa.
