Gram-positive infections impose a major burden on patients and the healthcare systems globally. The need to treat these infections correctly in an empirical fashion is of paramount importance. Further complicating this changing aetiology is the emergence of resistant strains which are no longer predictably susceptible to standard first-line antimicrobials such as oxacillin or vancomycin. Thus new agents such as linezolid have been developed to assist with initial empirical prescribing in infections where Gram-positive pathogens may be present. The characteristics of linezolid, including spectrum of activity, pharmacodynamic profile, tolerablility and overall efficacy should strengthen confidence when considering initial antimicrobial therapy in patients in risk areas. Future agents also being developed to fight multi-resistant Gram-positive infections include oritavancin, daptomycin and the glycylcyclines; however, these are still in the development phase.
