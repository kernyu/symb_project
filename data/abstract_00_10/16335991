With the increased number of resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains, it is urgently required to decipher the molecular bases of outer membrane permeability. The analyses of the outer membrane from different A. baumannii strains indicated a modification in the expression of two proteins of 29 and 43 kDa, respectively. By electrophoresis and MALDI-MS analyses, the 43 kDa OMP was identified as a protein belonging to the OprD family, a basic amino acid and imipenem porin.
