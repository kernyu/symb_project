We report the failure of the automated MicroScan WalkAway system to detect carbapenem heteroresistance in Enterobacter aerogenes. Carbapenem resistance has become an increasing concern in recent years, and robust surveillance is required to prevent dissemination of resistant strains. Reliance on automated systems may delay the detection of emerging resistance.
