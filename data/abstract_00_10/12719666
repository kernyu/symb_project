At the current epidemic stage, characterized by the rise of antiretroviral drug resistance, it is necessary to administer to HIV-positive patients increasingly effective treatments. This is possible only by means of powerful drugs. In a retrospective study, the authors evaluate 78 patients: 76 pre-treated with multiple drugs and 2 na ves. The 78 patients received LPV/RTV, starting from the fourth 3-month period of 2000 until the first 3-month period of 2002. The average treatment duration was 6.5 ( 5.5) months; the median value 6 months. The efficacy of the LPV/RTV therapeutic regimen was evaluated by a cytofluorimetric count of CD4+ and determination of the HIV viral load. There were 14 drop-out patients (17.9%): 5 because of auto-suspension, 1 due to absence of clinical and virological efficacy, 5 due to side effects (3 hepatopathy, 1 allergy and 1 nausea); three patients were lost on follow-up. There were 64 (82.1%) patients on treatment. Forty patients responded (51.3%) and 13 (16.7%) had uncontrolled viraemia (over than 200 copies/ml). However, the treatment with LPV/RTV was not interrupted for these patients, because in the follow-up they showed an increase in CD4+ values. The authors conclude that the LPV/RTV combination confirms previous findings: it is a drug with a relatively low incidence of side effects, capable of powerful results even in the treatment of patients receiving multiple drugs and thus subjected to the risk of developing antiretroviral drug resistance.
