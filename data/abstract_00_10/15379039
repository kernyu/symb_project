The outcomes of treatment were analyzed in 56 patients with ever-progressive multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis who had been long isolating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT). The patients were divided into 2 groups. In the study group (n = 36), 75% isolated MBT resistant to streptomycin (S), isoniazid (I), rifampicin (R), and kanamycin (K). In this connection, 41.7% of them received only 2 second-line antituberculous drugs and 27.8% took 3 drugs. The control group (n = 20) was comparable with the study group in the rate of bacterial isolation and in the drug resistance of the causative agent. In addition to chemotherapy (CT), dissolved ozone (pO3) was intravenously injected to the patients of the study group twice a week. They received a total of 12 to 55 infusions. Four-month addition of pO3 infusions to CT eliminated the resistance of isolated MBT to I and/or R. MBT became susceptible to I in 38.9% of the patients, R in 16.7%, and to K in 11.2%. By month 4, the isolated MBT became susceptible to I, R, and K in 47.2%. The mechanisms responsible for lowering drug resistance in MBT are discussed. The clinical example shows that patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis may be treated with first-line drugs provided that systemic intravenous injection of pO3 is performed.
