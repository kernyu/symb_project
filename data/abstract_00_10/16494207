The aim of this study was to evaluate a frequency of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains cultured from clinical specimens collected from patients hospitalized in wards and specialistic outpatients clinics of a hospital in Nidzica (01. 09. 2000 -31. 12. 2003). During over three years 392 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were cultured from 16346 clinical samples provided to bacteriological laboratory. P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from 2.5% of examined specimens. Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to antimicrobial agents was tested. The highest in vitro activity against clinical P. aeruginosa strains demonstrated imipenem. One strain was resistant to imipenem. This strain was isolated from a patient of a surgical department. Metalo-beta-lactamase was not detected (MBL-negative strain). Twenty nine strains were ESBL producer (7.4% of all strains). The contribution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to the etiology of nosoconial and ambulatory infections increases. In vitro activity of antibacterial agents against P. aeruginosa strains should be monitored during therapy of infections. Resistance to antibiotics/chemothe-rapeutics may be acquired during treatment with antibacterial agent to which P. aeruginosa strain was susceptible according to the antibiogram.
