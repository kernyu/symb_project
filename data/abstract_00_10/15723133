Strain chi6007 obtained from the parent E. coli strain chi5097 is a result of ptsH5 mutation, which allowed cells to grow without common components of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Segregants of strain chi6007 retaining the Pol+ gene responsible for inability to grow at 37 degrees C, but gaining rifampicin resistance (RifR) were used for cloning of cointegrate plasmids. Pre-integration complexes of HIV-1 were co-integrated with the pBR-322 plasmid and transformed strain chi6018. Sequencing showed that the pPIC91 hybrid plasmid contains full-length genome of HIV-1 with shortened 5-terminal LTR and full-length copy of pBR322. Elimination of the pPIC91 plasmid from chi6018 cells was followed by the appearance of auxotrophic insertion mutants. Sequencing of the insert region showed that chromosome DNA of the host cell includes integrated genomes of pBR-322 and HIV-1.
