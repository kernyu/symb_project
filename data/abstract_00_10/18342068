BACKGROUND: The appearance and worldwide spread of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infections warrant new studies of antibiotic resistance among strains of S. aureus responsible for cutaneous infections seen in general practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicentre study was performed from December 2003 to August 2004 in outpatients of both sexes presenting with a common bacterial skin infection presumed due to S. aureus (primary or secondary impetigo, ecthyma, paronychia, folliculitis, furunculosis). The investigators (n=50) were GPs from seven French regions. Clinical data (history, previous hospitalisation, type of infection, site, previous treatment, etc.) were collected using a standard questionnaire. A bacteriological sample was taken in attempt to isolate S. aureus after which antibiograms were prepared and minimal inhibiting concentrations determined (11 antibiotics). RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty patients of mean age 42 years (range: 2-94 years) were included. S. aureus was isolated from cultures in 205 of 477 samples, i.e. in 197 patients (eight had two strains of S. aureus). Patients with S. aureus had a primary skin infection in 104/197 cases (53%) (24 impetigo, 20 paronychia, 45 folliculitis or furunculosis) and a secondary infection in 93/197 cases (47%), with 4.9% patients being hospitalized within the preceding six months (median: 10 days). Percentages of resistant S. aureus strains were as follows: penicillin: 86%, erythromycin: 32%, ciprofloxacin: 9.3%, tetracycline: 5.8%, oxacillin: 5.8% (representing MRSA strains), fusidic acid: 4.4%, clindamycin: 3.4%, mupirocin: 1% and gentamicin: 0.5%. All S. aureus strains were sensitive to vancomycin and rifampicin. Except for one strain also resistant to tetracycline and fusidic acid, all MRSA strains were also resistant to ciprofloxacin. DISCUSSION: Multiresistant bacterial strains could become a concern in the community in France in the near future. In our study, only 14/197 (6.8%) S. aureus strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, whereas 21/197 (10.7%) were resistant to at least three of them. Compared to a French study performed in private practice in 2000, the level of MRSA is growing only slowly (5.8% versus 3.9%), whereas the percentage of strains of Peni-R/Oxa-S S. aureus are stable (80.5%). CONCLUSION: Common bacterial infections of the skin due to MRSA or to multiresistant S. aureus are not rare in France and have tended to increase slowly in recent years.
