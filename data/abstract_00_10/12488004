Removal of the N-terminal formyl group from newly synthesized proteins by the enzyme peptide deformylase (PDF) is essential for normal growth of bacteria but not higher organisms. Recently, PDF has been explored as a target for novel antibiotics. Screening a collection of natural products for antimicrobial activity identified actinonin and two matlystatin analogs as potent PDF inhibitors. A number of synthetic analogs of these natural products were prepared and their inhibitory potency determined. Previous work has shown that PDF is an iron metalloproteinase also containing a catalytic glutamic acid residue. Ligation of the ferrous cation is an essential feature of potent inhibitors. The structures of actinonin, a matlystatin analog and a synthetic inhibitor complexed with PDF were determined by crystallography. A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method was used to reproduce the geometry of known complexes, to predict the protonation state in the active site and to predict the geometry of additional complexes. The requirement for protonation of the active site glutamate anion is an important factor in understanding the potency of inhibitors with acidic iron-ligating groups such as hydroxamate and carboxylate. Even though potent inhibitors of PDF have been discovered, their bacteriostatic mechanism of action and the rapid development of resistance in vitro may limit their potential as antibacterial drugs.
