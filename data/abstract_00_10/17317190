Aminoglycoside antibiotics act by binding to 16S rRNA. Resistance to these antibiotics occurs via drug modifications by enzymes such as aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferases (AAC(6')s). We report here the regioselective and efficient synthesis of N-6'-acylated aminoglycosides and their use as probes to study AAC(6')-Ii and aminoglycoside-RNA complexes. Our results emphasize the central role of N-6' nucleophilicity for transformation by AAC(6')-Ii and the importance of hydrogen bonding between 6'-NH(2) and 16S rRNA for antibacterial activity.
