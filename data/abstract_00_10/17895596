Panomycocin, the killer toxin of Pichia anomala NCYC 434 (K5), is a 49 kDa monomeric glycoprotein with exo-beta-1,3-glucanase activity (patent pending). In this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of panomycocin against a panel of 109 human isolates of seven different pathogenic Candida spp. using microdilution and time-kill methods. Panomycocin was most active against C. tropicalis, C. pseudotropicalis and C. glabrata with MIC(90) values of 1 microg/ml. It displayed significant activity against C. albicans and C. parapsilosis with MIC(90) values of 4 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. For C. krusei, the MIC(90) value was 8 microg/ml. Panomycocin was fungicidal against all the tested Candida spp. The MFC values were only one or 2 dilutions higher than the MICs with the exception of C. krusei isolates with MFCs greater than or equal to 4xMIC. Results of this study indicated that panomycocin could be considered as a natural antifungal agent against Candida infections and has significant potential for further investigation.
