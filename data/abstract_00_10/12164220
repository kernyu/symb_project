In this study, a new series of 4-(3-coumarinyl)-3-cyclohexyl-4-thiazoline-2-one benzylidene hydrazones (3a-p) were synthesized. Structures of the title compounds were determined by analytical and spectral methods. 3a-p were evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.
