We used data reported from US hospitals to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 3 specific infections: Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonias, and Escherichia coli urinary tract infections. We evaluated the proportion of infections with antimicrobial-resistant isolates and the relative risk of death associated with the resistant pathogen in the period 2000-2004, compared with the period 1990-1994. The proportion of antimicrobial-resistant infections increased, but there was no change in the relative risk of death between the 2 periods.
