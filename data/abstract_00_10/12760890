The influence of reduced susceptibilities to glycopeptides on the activities of vancomycin and teicoplanin against an isogenic pair of clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains in experimental endocarditis was investigated. While vancomycin was similarly active against both strains, teicoplanin was approximately 100-fold less active against the resistant strain and selected for the emergence of more resistant subpopulations.
