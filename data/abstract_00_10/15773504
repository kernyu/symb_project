The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of aminoglycosides (gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin) when combined with other antibiotics (lincomycin, benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, cephalexin, spectinomycin and erythromycin), on selected clinical bacterial strains. The checkerboard method has been selected from the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interaction. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for nine cases (9/112--8%). Additive effects were predominant--73/112--65.2%. In 12.5% neutral effects were shown, but in 11.6% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. The best results were achieved for combinations of dihydrostreptomycin with procaine penicillin because of higher number of cases synergy effect was observed. Antagonism of aminoglycosides and beta-lactams in case of gentamicin and amoxicillin for E. coli and E. cloacea strains were shown. Potential activity for combination of streptomycin and erythromycin was shown.
