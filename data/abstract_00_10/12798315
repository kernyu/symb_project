We previously demonstrated that piperazinyl-linked fluoroquinolone dimers possess potent antibacterial activity against drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, we report the preparation and evaluation of a series of incomplete dimers toward ascertaining structural features of piperazinyl-linked ciprofloxacin dimers that render these agents refractory to fluoroquinolone-resistance mechanisms in Staphylococcus aureus.
