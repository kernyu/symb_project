The CTX-M-1 group was found in 86.8% of the Escherichia coli isolates from Istanbul. A subset study revealed all isolates carrying bla(CTX-M-15) genes flanked by the insertion element ISEcp1. Plasmid typing of transconjugates carrying bla(CTX-M-15) showed that most isolates belonged to the Inc/rep FII group but that one isolate also belonged to the FI group.
