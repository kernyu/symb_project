Bacterial resistance to an antibiotic may result from survival in a suddenly strong antibiotic or in sub-minimum inhibitory concentration of the drug. Their shared proteins responsible for the resistance should be potential targets for designing new drugs to inhibit the growth of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In the current study, comparative proteomic methodologies were used for identification of sharedly altered outer membrane proteins (OM proteins) that are responsible for chloramphenical (CAP)-resistant Escherichia coli and for survival in medium with suddenly strong CAP treatment. Six differential OM proteins and another protein with unknown location were determined to be sharedly CAP-resistant-related proteins with the use of 2-DE/MS, Western blotting and gene mutant methods, in which TolC, OmpT, OmpC, and OmpW were critically altered proteins and potential targets for designing of the new drugs. Furthermore, a novel method of specific antibody combating bacterial growth was developed on these OM proteins. Only anti-TolC showed a very significant inhibition on bacterial growth in medium with CAP when antisera to TolC, OmpC, OmpT, and OmpW were separately utilized. The growth of CAP-resistant E. coli and its original strain was completely inhibited when they bound with anti-TolC and survived in 1/8 MIC of CAP. This observed result is basically the same to the finding that DeltatolC was survived in the same concentration of the antibiotic. Our study demonstrates that the enhancement of expression of antibody target with antibiotic could be very effective approach compared to using a drug alone, which highlights a potential way for treatment of infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
