We have identified mouse sphingomyelin synthase 1 as a novel suppressor of the growth inhibitory effect of heterologously expressed Bax. Yeast cells expressing sphingomyelin synthase 1 were also found to show an increased resistance to a variety of cytotoxic stimuli including hydrogen peroxide, osmotic stress and elevated temperature. Sphingomyelin synthase 1 functions by catalyzing the conversion of ceramide and phosphatidylcholine to sphingomyelin and diacylglycerol. Ceramide is an antiproliferative and proapoptotic sphingolipid whose level increases in response to a variety of stresses. Consistent with its biochemical function, yeast cells expressing sphingomyelin synthase 1 have an enhanced ability to grow in media containing the cell-permeable C2-ceramide analog as well as the ceramide precursor phytosphingosine. We also show that overexpression of AUR1, a potential yeast functional homolog of sphingomyelin synthase, also protects cells from osmotic stress. Taken together, these results suggest that sphingomyelin synthase 1 likely prevents cell death by counteracting stress-mediated accumulation of endogenous sphingolipids.
