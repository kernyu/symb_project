Of the 130 clinical isolates of Mycoplasma hominis from patients with nonspecific inflammatory diseases of the urogenital tract (UGT), approximately 10% contained the tet(M) gene after the course of treatment with tetracyclines. This gene was found in nine (25%) of the 36 Ureaplasma urealyticum clinical isolates. The nucleotide sequence of 13 tet(M) genes in TcR clinical isolates of M. hominis and five genes in U. urealyticum TcR clinical isolates was determined. A comparison of nucleotide sequences of eight tetM genes of different origin and tet(M) genes of Gardnerella vaginalis and M. hominis and U. urealyticum clinical isolates showed that the mosaic structure of the tet(M) gene is completely identical in 11 of 13 M. hominis TcR isolates but belongs to an unidentified allele different from those described earlier, Another new allelic variant of tet(M) was found in two isolates. In three of five TcR clinical isolates of U. urealyticum, a tet(M) gene, whose mosaic structure was identical to that of tet(M) reported previously for ureaplasmas, and also two new allelic variants, which have not been described so far, were found.
