In Arabidopsis, NPR1 (non-expressor of pathogenesis related genes 1, AtNPR1) functions downstream of salicylic acid (SA) and modulates the SA mediated systemic acquired resistance. It is also involved in a cross talk with the jasmonate pathway that is essential for resistance against herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens. Overexpression of AtNPR1 in transgenic plants resulted in enhanced disease resistance. Recently, tobacco transgenic plants expressing AtNPR1 were shown to be tolerant to the early instars of Spodoptera litura (Meur et al., Physiol Plant 133:765-775, 2008). In this communication, we show that the heterologous expression of AtNPR1 in tobacco has also enhanced the oxidative stress tolerance. The transgenic plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to the treatment with methyl viologen. This tolerance was associated with the constitutive upregulation of PR1, PR2 (glucanase), PR5 (thaumatin like protein), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) superoxide dismutase (SOD). This is the first demonstration of the novel function of heterologous expression of AtNPR1 in oxidative stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco.
