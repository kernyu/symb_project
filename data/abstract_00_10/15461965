HIV drug resistance has been associated with treatment failure in Western countries but the lessons learned can be useful in optimization of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) in resource-poor settings. There is a need to improve access to HAART in such regions, but appropriate strategies must be rapidly implemented, such as adapted programs to facilitate adherence to therapy, rational use of genotypic drug resistance monitoring in specific situations, and use of alternative treatment regimens. The implications of HIV genetic diversity must also be considered in management of drug resistance.
