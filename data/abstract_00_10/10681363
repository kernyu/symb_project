The development of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 resistance to delavirdine (DLV) was studied in subjects receiving DLV monotherapy. Phenotypic resistance developed in 28 of 30 subjects within 8 weeks. K103N and Y181C, which confer nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) cross-resistance, were the predominant reverse transcriptase mutations. P236L, which confers DLV resistance but hypersensitivity to other NNRTIs, developed in <10% of isolates.
