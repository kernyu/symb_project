Dermatopathies are common with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, affecting an estimated 90% of HIV patients. Opportunistic infections are common and include viral, bacterial and fungal etiologies. Dermal eruptions from highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) or antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS) are also common, and can be challenging to differentiate from other causes of dermatitis. Presented is a challenging dermatology case involving a six year old male rhesus macaque experimentally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Skin cultures identified multi-antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with incomplete resolution following appropriate antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsy results indicated non-specific dermatitis not consistent with typical SIV dermatitis and with a hypersensitivity component. Fungal culture revealed aspergillosis, and the patient responded favorably to oral itraconazole therapy.
