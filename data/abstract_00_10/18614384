Since the double Deltagrx1Deltagrx2 mutant is hypersensitive to selenite we decided to evaluate mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and establish the roles of other components of yeast glutaredoxin system, in particular glutaredoxin 5 in the selenite resistance. We found elevation in the intracellular and mitochondrial superoxide production in the Deltagrx1Deltagrx2 and Deltagrx5 mutants after Se(IV) treatment. The last effect was more pronounced for cells lacking the mitochondrial Grx5 protein. We also recorded selenite-induced increase in the peroxide production in all strains tested. Nonfermentable carbon sources, glycerol and ethanol, augmented selenite toxicity. Hypo- and anoxia protected against the harmful effects of Se(VI). Augmentation of the intracellular levels of two endogenous antioxidants, erythroascorbic acid and glutathione confers resistance to selenite. We recorded a strain-unspecific, selenite-mediated decrease in the level of acid-soluble thiols. Collectively, our data demonstrate that hypersensitivity to the Deltagrx1Deltagrx2 and Deltagrx5 disruptants to selenite is mediated by altered intracellular redox equilibrium.
