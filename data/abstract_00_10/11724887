Between September 1999 to February 2001, 25 glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium (GRE) isolates were recovered from a Greek hospital. The isolates exhibited 13 distinct chromosomal macrorestriction types by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and all were erythromycin and vancomycin resistant, carrying the genes vanA and ermB. Vancomycin resistance, always linked with erythromycin resistance, was transferable from 17 isolates. The dissemination of erythromycin-resistant GRE strains may, at least in part, reflect the extensive use of macrolides in husbandry in Greece.
