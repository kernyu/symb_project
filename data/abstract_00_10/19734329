Resistance of Nosema ceranae to different exposure conditions has been evaluated by using Sytox green and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to test spore viability. High thermotolerance at 60 and 35 degrees C and resistance to desiccation were observed. However, a significant decrease in viability after freezing and a rapid degeneration of spores maintained at 4 degrees C were also detected.
