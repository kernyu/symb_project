The Gram-positive infections are a problem with increasing significance in the newborn period. LINEZOLID is the first member of the new group antibiotics--oxazolidinones. The most Gram-positive infections, including the resistant of vancomycin, influence by LINEZOLID. We treated twenty newborn babies with LINEZOLID during the period from April 2005 to April 2006. Initial empiric antibiotic therapy appointed all those children. Various Gram-positive cocci were isolated from different biological materials. Five assays were sterile, but the clinical signs were suspect for Gram-positive infection. The treatment with LINEZOLID initialized immediately after the identification of the microbiological agent or when was suspect the resistant of initial antibiotics gram-positive infection. Duration of therapy was determined by the elimination of the microbiological agent or by the involution of the clinical signs, which we observed in the all cases of the treatment with LINEZOLID. Our results received up to date demonstrate the effectiveness and the safety of the LINEZOLID treatment in the newborn period.
