Podiatric physicians often encounter infectious processes in the lower extremity in inpatient and outpatient settings. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a growing concern for clinicians treating these infections, especially in complex patients who have immune compromise such as diabetes. Although a number of antibiotic options are available for the treatment of lower-extremity soft tissue and bone infections, a careful examination of bacterial susceptibilities, drug resistance, and treatment efficacy can result in better patient care and limb salvage.
