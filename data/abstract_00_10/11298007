In general, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are expressed by plants in response to stress conditions like infection, exposure to certain chemicals, wounding and environmental conditions. In some plant tissues, however, PR proteins are constitutively expressed, e.g. in pollens or fruits, tissues that are more likely to be attacked (by insects or fungi) or exposed to atmospheric conditions (e.g. UV irradiation). PR proteins display multiple effects within the plant and possess antimicrobial activity, and can thus be regarded as a part of the plant's defense system. Analyzing known amino acid sequences and functions of characterized (cloned) food allergens, it is remarkable that many of these molecules can be classified as PR proteins. Many PR proteins are stable at low pH, and display considerable resistance to proteases, requirements to act as food allergens. According to sequence characteristics and their enzymatic or biologic activity, PR proteins can be divided into 14 groups. Seven of these 14 groups contain proteins with allergenic properties, six groups contain food allergens.
