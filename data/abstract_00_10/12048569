The susceptibility of a fourth generation Ouh strain (Paranapanema Valley, Sao Paulo, Brazil) of Schistosoma mansoni to oxamniquine (OXA) and praziquantel (PZQ) was studied. Ten groups of 13 female albino mice each were infected with 70 cercariae per animal. These mice were medicated orally on the 50th day after infection. Five groups were given OXA doses of 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/kg (single doses) and the rest were treated with PZQ doses of 0, 100, 200, and 250 mg/kg/5 days. Each group was sub-divided: 8 animals underwent perfusion after 15 days treatment, 5 mice followed up for oviposition and their feces were tested every 15 days for miracidia hatching. The efficacy of the OXA doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg was 66% and 91.4%, respectively and for the 100 mg/kg PZQ dose it was 90.1%. The follow-up groups with 100 and 200 mg/kg of OXA and PZQ, 100 and 150 mg/kg, showed that they re-established the oviposition after a period of 60 to 75 days of treatment. The ED50 was 69.6 mg/kg OXA and 39.4 mg/kg PZQ. The results show the tolerance of the Ouh strain to a dose of 100 mg with both drugs and they appoint the need for a dose review during the follow up of the oviposition and in monitoring phenomena in the field.
