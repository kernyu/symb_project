The antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, was evaluated against 1102 bacterial isolates from 20 centers in Spain. The MIC of tigecycline at which 90% (MIC(90)) of the pneumococci tested were inhibited was the lowest (0.06 microg/mL) of all the antibiotics tested. The MICs of tigecycline against enterococci ranged from 0.03 to 0.125 microg/mL. All staphylococci were inhibited by < or =0.25 microg/mL of tigecycline, and 99.6% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates were inhibited by < or =2 microg/mL of tigecycline. Tigecycline demonstrated good activity against Bacteroides fragilis group organisms with an MIC(90) of 4 microg/mL. The results of this study confirm the excellent activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
