OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of tetrandrine (Tet) in combination with droloxifen (DRL) on the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in K562 and K562/A02 cell lines and its reversal mechanism. METHODS: The activation of NF-kappaB in K562 and K562/A02 cell lines and the effect of Tet or DRL alone or in combination on NF-kappaB protein expression were determined with immunocytochemistry and Western blotting respectively. RESULTS: (1) K562/A02 cells displayed higher level of NF-kappaB protein expression than K562 cells. (2) The application of Tet or DRL alone or in combination had no effect on NF-kappaB expression in K562 cells at 6 h and 12 h (P > 0.05). (3) Tet and DRL alone or in combination could significantly down-regulate NF-kappaB protein expression in nuclei of K562/A02 cells. The effect was more significant in combination than either alone. This effect was more significant at 12 h than at 6 h. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Activation of NF-kappaB may be involved in the mechanism of MDR of K562/A02 cell line. (2)Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation may be involved in the reversal of multidrug resistance in K562/A02 cells by Tet and DRL.
