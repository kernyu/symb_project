Although Candida species are present as normal microflora of the human host, alterations in host defenses can lead to development of disease. Candida infections, ranging from urinary tract infections to bloodstream infections, are common in patients in the intensive care unit. Infections with non-albicans Candida sp are becoming more frequent, and resistance among these isolates is concerning. Candida kefyr is an uncommonly documented fungal pathogen. We report two cases of infection resulting from C. kefyr in our institution. The two patients had underlying disease states and drug therapies that increased the likelihood of developing an immunocompromised state. The C. kefyr isolates obtained from both patients were susceptible to amphotericin B, fluconazole, and itraconazole. Both patients had resolution of infection, one after receiving treatment with amphotericin B and the other with voriconazole.
