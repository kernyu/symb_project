pbp2b gene alterations were analyzed in 102 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (30 penicillin susceptible, 23 intermediate, and 49 resistant) from Korea. On the basis of PBP2B amino acid sequences, penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae belonged to six groups, and 76% of the isolates in groups I to IV showed the same divergent block of amino acid alterations. Thirteen isolates (group II) also possessed a divergent block that was identical to that of Streptococcus oralis. The pbp2b genes of most Korean isolates showed novel mosaic mutations due to horizontal gene transfer. The Thr252 --> Ala substitution, previously thought to be associated only with penicillin-nonsusceptible strains, was also found in three penicillin-susceptible strains. On the basis of their pbp2b nucleotide sequences, all penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates can be detected by multiplex PCR, which can be used as a novel method for detection of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal strains in clinical specimens.
