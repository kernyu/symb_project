UNLABELLED: Urinary tract infections (UTI) in children on dialysis treatment are regarded as indirect contraindication for kidney transplantation. In medication of UTI it is recommended to prescribe antibacterial agent in proper dosage (often in reduced amount) and to choose desired drug in selected period of chronic renal failure (CRF). THE AIM: of the study was the evaluation of UTI incidence in children and adolescents with terminal renal failure on peritoneal dialysis treatment (PD), kind of isolated bacterial strains and their current drug-sensitivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 26 children and young adults (15 girls and 11 boys) on PD for the period longer than 6 months (mean 2.0+/-1.5 years). The mean age of examined children was 13.2+/-4.4 years. Total number of 57 culture-positive UTI episodes were recorded (30 in girls, 27 in boys)--1-episode/11.1 patient-month. In examined group UTI most frequently were present in children with uncorrected urinary tract malformation (1 episode/7.7 patient-month) and in children on immunosuppressive treatment (1 episode/5.7 patient-month). In children with cystic kidney disease infections had accidental character. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent occurring pathogen was bacteria Escherichia coli--13 (22.8%) and Streptococcus faecalis--13 (22.8%) infections. E. coli strains shown sensitivity to second generation of quinolones: ciprofloxacin; third generation of cephalosporin: ceftazidime; partial sensitivity to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, aminoglycosides. Streptococcus faecalis strains revealed only partial sensitivity to nitrofurantoin, vancomycin, teicoplanin.
