OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of FASTPlaqueTB-RIF, a newly introduced bacteriophage assay for rapid detection of rifampicin susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum specimens. METHODS: A comparative study of 40 sputum specimens from patients of pulmonary tuberculosis, using FASTPlaqueTB-RIF and Bactec 460 TB system carried out at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi between September and November 2001. RESULTS: Of the 40 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis tested for rifampicin (RIF) susceptibility using the Bactec 460 TB system, 28 isolates were resistant to RIF and 12 isolates were susceptible. FASTPlaqueTB-RIF identified 24 specimens as resistant to RIF. Three specimens that revealed susceptible isolates on Bactec 460, were resistant by FASTPlaqueTB-RIF while four specimens which revealed resistant isolates on Bactec 460, demonstrated susceptibility to RIF by FASTPlaqueTB-RIF. The sensitivity and specificity of FASTPlaqueTB-RIF were 86% and 73% respectively. The predictive values of positive and negative tests were 0.89 and 0.67 respectively. The overall accuracy of the technique was 82%. The phage assay took 48 hours to perform. CONCLUSION: Early detection of rifampicin resistance by the mycobacteriophage technique direct from sputum specimens is a potentially useful new test which would allow decision regarding appropriate therapy to be made early thus having a positive impact on patient care and on prevention of spread of MDR TB.
