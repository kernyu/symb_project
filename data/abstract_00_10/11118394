We describe 2 patients who were initially positive for antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen and who experienced a strong and sudden increase of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We found that reactivation of HBV replication during HAART can occur independently of lamivudine resistance or withdrawal of lamivudine, and in spite of increasing CD4(+) cell counts.
