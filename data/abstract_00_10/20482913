A 58-year-old man was submitted to our intensive care ward with respiratory failure due to pneumonitis. He had previously been treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma by autologous stem cell transplantation, as a result of which bone marrow function was reduced. Further analysis showed infection with new influenza A(H1N1); typing revealed an oseltamivir-resistant subpopulation (H275Y). The patient was treated with oseltamivir and intravenously with zanamivir, but died of respiratory disease progression. This is the first published case of oseltamivir-resistant new influenza A(H1N1) infection in the Netherlands.
