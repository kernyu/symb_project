A series of antibiotic resistance genes have been sequenced and found to be identical or nearly identical in various ecological environments. Similarly, genetic vectors responsible for assembly and mobility of antibiotic resistance genes, such as transposons, integrons and R plasmids of similar or identical type are also widespread in various niches of the environment. Many zoonotic bacteria carry antibiotic resistance genes directly from different food-producing environments to the human being. These circumstances may have a major impact on the degree for success in treating infectious diseases in man. Several recent examples demonstrate that use of antibiotics in all parts of the food production chain contributes to the increasing level of antibiotic resistance among the food-borne pathogenic bacteria. Modern industrialized food production adds extra emphasis on lowering the use of antibiotics in all parts of agriculture, husbandry and fish farming because these food products are distributed to very large numbers of humans compared to more traditional smaller scale niche production.
