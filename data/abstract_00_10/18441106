Antibiotic-sensitive bacteria have been found to coexist with antibiotic-producing bacteria in biofilms, but little is known about how the former develop in such an environment. Here we isolated pyocyanin-sensitive bacteria belonging to the genus Brevibacillus from a biofilm derived from soil extract and based on the preestablished biofilm of a pyocyanin producer, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain P1. In addition, pyocyanin-resistant strains belonging to the genus Raoultella were isolated from the same biofilm. Microbial relationships within biofilms were examined by using three strains, strain P1, Brevibacillus strain S1, and Raoultella strain R1, each of which individually formed a biofilm within 2 days in a flow cell. Strain S1 did not fully develop on the preestablished biofilm of strain P1 during 4 days of cultivation, whereas a mutant of strain P1 which was deficient in pyocyanin production allowed strain S1 to cocolonize within a biofilm. On the other hand, strain R1 developed on the biofilm of strain P1 regardless of pyocyanin production. When mixed 1:1 inocula of strains S1 and R1 were introduced into the strain P1 biofilm, all three species were found in the 4-day biofilm. In the mixed biofilm, strain S1 was surrounded by the layer of strain R1 and seemed to be separated from strain P1 and the outflow solution. However, strain S1 did not survive in a three-species mixed culture under planktonic conditions. These results indicate that the survival of sensitive bacteria in biofilm with a pyocyanin producer is achieved by covering them with a layer of resistant bacteria. We also evaluated the influence of antibiotic production on the producer.
