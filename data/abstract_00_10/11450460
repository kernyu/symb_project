Sugar beet seeds disinfected with the carbofuran-containing insecticide adifur and the fungicide tachygaren by seed-producing firms were found to be abundantly populated with bacterial microflora. The bacteria isolated from the seed surface were identified to a species level. The selection of bacteria with respect to pesticide resistance may lead to the obtaining of agronomically useful bacterial strains.
