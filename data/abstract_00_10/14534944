E. coli is the most frequently isolate species in community as well as in nosocomial acquired urinary tract infections (UTI). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), is commonly used as empiric treatment for managing uncomplicated UTI whereas the rate of resistance to amoxicilline is increasing. A multicentric retrospective study was conducted from January 1st 1999 to December 31st 2000 to evaluate the prevalence of E. coli isolates from UTI and to guide empiric therapies. Among 6994 urinary isolates, 62.6% were resistant to amoxicilline, this rate fell to 33.6% when amoxicilline was associated to clavulanic acide, 2.7% were producing extended spectrum b-lactamases (BLSE), higher than reported in France and USA. 37.3% were resistant to TMP-SMX. The high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among UTI E. coli isolates emphasizes the necessity to review the empiric therapies. Fluoroquinolones can be considered as an alternative therapy according to their excellent tissue penetration and their wide spectrum of activity.
