BACKGROUND: Expanded access to HIV therapy in the developing world raises serious concerns regarding the potential emergence and transmission of drug-resistant HIV strains. Although HIV drug resistance surveillance is recommended to track transmitted HIV drug resistance among newly infected individuals, the financial constraints in resource-limited countries prohibit such surveillance on a regular basis. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently introduced guidelines to address this issue. METHODS: A survey was conducted in Ethiopia following the WHO guidelines to assess transmitted HIV drug resistance among recently HIV-infected individuals in Addis Ababa. Antiretroviral drug usage started 3 years earlier than commencement of the current expanded access to antiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia. RESULTS: Of 75 eligible samples, 39 (52%) were successfully sequenced and genotyped in the protease and reverse transcriptase region, using both the ViroSeq and TrueGene genotyping systems, and analysed for drug resistance mutations using an algorithm from the Stanford HIV Reverse Transcriptase and Protease Database. The analysis revealed that transmitted HIV drug resistance in Addis Ababa is below the 5% threshold level for all three classes of antiretrovirals. CONCLUSIONS: The current first-line antiretroviral therapy strategy can be used with confidence in Ethiopia at this time; however, Ethiopia should conduct similar periodic surveys that include the capitals of Ethiopia's larger regional states to ensure early detection of any changes in the country's HIV drug resistance trend.
