The release of glutathione disulfide has been considered an important process for the maintenance of a reduced thiol redox potential in cells during oxidative stress. In cultured rat astrocytes, permanent hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress caused a rapid increase in intracellular glutathione disulfide, which was followed by the appearance of glutathione disulfide in the medium. Under these conditions, the viability of the cells was not compromised. In the presence of cyclosporin A and the quinoline-derivative MK571, inhibitors of multidrug resistance proteins (MRP1 and MRP2), glutathione disulfide accumulated in cells and the release of glutathione disulfide from astrocytes during H2O2 stress was potently inhibited, suggesting a contribution of MRP1 or MRP2 in the release of glutathione disulfide from astrocytes. Using RT-PCR we amplified a cDNA from astroglial RNA with a high degree of homology to MRP1 from humans and mouse. In contrast, no fragment was amplified by using primers specific for rat MRP2. In addition, the presence of MRP1 protein in astrocytes was demonstrated by its immunolocalization in cells expressing the astroglial marker protein glial fibrillary acidic protein. Our data identify rat astrocytes as a MRP1-expressin, brain cell type and demonstrate that this transporter participates in the release of glutathione disulfide from astrocytes during oxidative stress.
