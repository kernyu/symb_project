The expected effectiveness of protease inhibitors was assessed according to the Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA (ANRS), Rega and Stanford 2007 resistance algorithms in 93 and 87 antiretroviral therapy-naive patients, respectively, infected with B and non-B subtype viruses. Either B or non-B subtypes were considered fully susceptible to protease inhibitors, except to tipranavir/ritonavir, for which the 2007 ANRS algorithm scored non-B subtypes as naturally resistant when this algorithm was extended to these subtypes.
