Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an emerging problem in horses; however, the epidemiology of infection and colonization is poorly understood. This study evaluated factors associated with MRSA colonization at the time of admission to a veterinary teaching hospital. A case-control study evaluating historical factors was performed. Previous colonization of the horse, previous identification of colonized horses on the farm, antimicrobial administration within 30 days, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and admission to a service other than the surgical service were risk factors for community-associated colonization. A better understanding of risk factors for MRSA colonization is important to elucidate the epidemiology of this emerging veterinary and zoonotic pathogen, and to design evidence-based infection control programs.
