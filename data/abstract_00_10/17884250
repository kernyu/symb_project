The inanimate hospital environment can become contaminated with nosocomial pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) decontamination has proven effective for the eradication of persistent environmental contamination. We investigated the extent of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative rod (GNR) contamination in a ward side-room occupied by a patient with a history of MRSA, VRE and GNR infection and colonisation and investigated the impact of HPV decontamination. Fifteen standardised sites in the room were sampled using a selective broth enrichment protocol to culture MRSA, VRE and GNR. Sampling was performed before cleaning, after cleaning, after HPV decontamination and at intervals over the subsequent 19 days on two separate occasions. Environmental contamination was identified before cleaning on 60, 30 and 6.7% of sites for MRSA, GNR and VRE, respectively, and 40, 10 and 6.7% of sites after cleaning. Only one site (3.3%) was contaminated with MRSA after HPV decontamination. No recontamination with VRE was identified and no recontamination with MRSA and GNR was identified during the two days following HPV decontamination. Substantial recontamination was identified approximately one week after HPV decontamination towards post-cleaning levels for GNR and towards pre-cleaning levels for MRSA. HPV is more effective than standard terminal cleaning for the eradication of nosocomial pathogens. Recontamination was not immediate for MRSA and GNR but contamination returned within a week in a room occupied by a patient colonised with MRSA and GNR. This finding has important implications for the optimal deployment of HPV decontamination in hospitals.
