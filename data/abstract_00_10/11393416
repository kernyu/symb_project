A 58-year-old man developed proteinuria and renal dysfunction following pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin was administered, and prednisolone pulse therapy and plasmapheresis were performed. Subsequently, serum creatinine was decreased. Eight months later, creatinine and CRP were again elevated, and MRSA was detected. Vancomycin was again administered and plasmapheresis was performed. However, renal function was not improved and continuous hemodialysis was initiated. This case indicates that complete eradication of MRSA is necessary to treat MRSA-associated glomerulonephritis, and if this is not attained, a permanent loss of renal function occurs.
