The development of a method to create defined mutants of Leishmania parasites lacking foreign genes conferring resistance to antibiotics has both experimental and practical applications. Mutants deficient in specific virulence genes have potential as attenuated live vaccines, but these can only be of clinical relevance if the antibiotic resistance genes used for selection of the mutants are subsequently removed. In addition, the limited number of antibiotic resistance genes that can be used for genetic manipulation of Leishmania means that a system for recycling them for subsequent use would be highly beneficial when multiple genetic modifications are wanted. In the method we report here, a cassette carrying in tandem the hygromycin resistance gene as a positive marker and thymidine kinase gene as a negative marker is first integrated into the locus of interest and then replaced by a null targeting fragment containing no exogenous DNA. The application of this hit-and-run strategy for removal of one allele of the CPB cysteine peptidase gene array of Leishmania infantum is described.
