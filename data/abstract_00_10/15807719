OBJECTIVES: To assess the antiviral response to optimized therapy following genotypic resistance testing and to identify factors associated with virological response in HIV-1-infected patients failing antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 344 HIV-1-infected patients who underwent genotypic resistance testing because of virological failure. Virological response was defined as a plasma HIV RNA level below 200 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL or a drop of plasma viral load from baseline of more than 1 log10. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with virological response. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 40 years, with a male to female ratio of 4:1. Fifty-one per cent of patients had received the three major classes of antiretrovirals and the median duration of previous antiretroviral therapy was 4.6 years. At baseline, the median plasma HIV RNA level was 4.4 log10 copies/mL and the median CD4 cell count was 274 cells/microL. At 3 months, 55% of patients (188 of 344) had a virological response, which was sustained at 6 months (53%). Predictors of virological response were exposure to two or fewer protease inhibitors [odds ratio (OR) 1.8; P=0.046], and use in optimized therapy of a new class of antiretrovirals (OR 2.9; P=0.006), of more than two new drugs (OR 3.0; P<0.0001), of abacavir (OR 1.9; P=0.03), or of lopinavir/ritonavir (OR 3.7; P=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of patients achieved a short-term virological response in this cohort study. Patients with the least experience of protease inhibitor treatment and in whom a new class of antiretroviral, more than two new drugs, abacavir or lopinavir/ritonavir was used in optimized therapy had the best virological outcome.
