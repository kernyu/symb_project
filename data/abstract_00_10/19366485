Triclabendazole (TCBZ) remains the drug of choice for treating infections of the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica in livestock and has become the main drug used to treat human cases of the disease as well. Cases of resistance in livestock continue to be reported, suggesting that the problem is increasing. In order to address the problem, there is a need for better understanding of drug action. A 'state-of-play' review on different aspects of TCBZ activity was published by the present author in 2005. The main purpose of the current review is to assess what progress has been made in the past four years towards understanding the main aspects of drug activity, including drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and an understanding of the mechanism(s) of resistance. Also, what advances have been made in identifying alternative compounds and using drug combinations to enhance TCBZ activity. Stemming from a number of in vivo studies, it has become evident that fluke isolates of differing sensitivity to TCBZ differ in some of their biological parameters, and information on this interesting phenomenon will be presented. An update on the use of TCBZ for human fascioliasis is also given. The review will indicate what progress has been made, but will also highlight areas that remain inadequately understood and require greater research focus.
