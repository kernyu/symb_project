This study compared the potential synergy of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in combination with cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam or amikacin, against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli by using checkerboard and time kill studies. Moreover, selection of resistance was determined by frequency of mutations and by calculating the increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) after five serial subcultures on antibiotic-containing plates. Synergy occurred more often with levofloxacin combined with imipenem (7/10 strains) and with levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin with amikacin (10/10) than for the other combinations. Time kill studies showed synergy for levofloxacin combined with amikacin, ceftazidime, imipenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, and for ciprofloxacin combined with amikacin, cefepime or imipenem. Antibiotic combinations selected for resistance less frequently than antibiotics alone. Mutation frequency was <10(-12) for all combinations. In conclusion, the combination of a fluoroquinolone with a beta-lactam or amikacin may provide improved antimicrobial activity and help limit the occurrence of resistance in ESBL-producing E. coli strains.
