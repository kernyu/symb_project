Mycobacterium abscessus lung disease is difficult to treat and has been considered a strong relative contraindication to lung transplantation. We performed double lung transplantation in three cystic fibrosis patients with ongoing, and a fourth with recent treatment for Mycobacterium abscessus lung infection. Despite prolonged antibiotic courses and adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy the first three patients developed skin infection and abscesses. At follow-up after 1, 3, 5 and 7years respectively no patient had evidence of M abscessus infection and all had stable lung function. Lung transplantation in patients with M abscessus lung infection is feasible but may involve severe complications.
