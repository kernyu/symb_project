Screening among 9-aminoacridine, 10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b, f]azepine and polyfluoro 5,6-dihydro-1,3,5-oxadiazine derivatives allowed to isolate compounds with potential antibacterial activity. Schemes of the active compounds synthesis are given. The most important is the estimation of the oxydiazines activity against gram-positive microorganisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Special attention is paid to the activity of iminodibenzyl derivatives against multiresistant gram-negative microorganisms.
