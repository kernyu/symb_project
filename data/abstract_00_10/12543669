Alveolar echinococcosis is caused by the parasitic cestode Echinococcus multilocularis. Benzimidazoles, namely, mebendazole and albendazole, are the only drugs available for the treatment of inoperable alveolar echinococcosis. At present, no therapeutic alternative is available for patients with progressive disease under treatment or for patients who are unable to tolerate the side effects of the benzimidazoles. In addition, benzimidazoles are only parasitostatic for E. multilocularis. Thus, new therapeutic options are of paramount importance. In the present study we examined the in vitro effect of amphotericin B on E. multilocularis larvae. E. multilocularis metacestodes grown in the peritoneal cavities of Mongolian gerbils were transferred into a culture system. Vesicles budded from the tissue blocks and increased in number and size during the first 5 weeks. After 6 weeks drugs were added and deleterious effects on the vesicles were observed macroscopically and microscopically. By use of this in vitro tissue culture model we demonstrated that amphotericin B effectively inhibits the growth of E. multilocularis metacestodes. This destructive effect was significantly more rapid with amphotericin B than with the benzimidazoles. Cyclic treatment was effective in suppressing parasite growth. However, amphotericin B appears to be parasitostatic for E. multilocularis larvae, and regrowth occurs even after extended periods. In summary, amphotericin B constitutes the first promising alternative for the treatment of alveolar echinococcosis in cases of intolerance or resistance to benzimidazoles. It holds promise as an effective treatment option for otherwise fatal courses of disease.
