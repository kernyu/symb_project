A series of novel (un)substituted benzotriazolyl oxazolidinone derivatives has been synthesized and tested for in vitro antibacterial activities by MIC determination against a panel of susceptible and resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms, some of which are resistant to methicillin and vancomycin. Compounds 20, 21, 24, 29 and 30 from this series were found to be equipotent or more potent than linezolid in vitro.
