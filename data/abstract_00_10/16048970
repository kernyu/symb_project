PPI-0903M is a novel N-phosphono-type cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and many other gram-positive organisms. This study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of PPI-0903M against 1,478 recent clinical isolates collected from 80 medical centers (22 countries). PPI-0903M demonstrated broader in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci of current clinical concern, than currently available extended-spectrum cephalosporins while maintaining similar activity against gram-negative pathogens.
