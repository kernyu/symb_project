Pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses a low level of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump and shows natural resistance to many structurally and functionally diverse antibiotics. The mutation that has been referred to previously as nfxC expresses an additional efflux pump, MexEF-OprN, exhibiting resistance to fluoroquinolones, imipenem, and chloramphenicol and hypersusceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics. To address the antibiotic specificity of the MexEF-OprN efflux pump, we introduced a plasmid carrying the mexEF-oprN operon into P. aeruginosa lacking the mexAB-oprM operon. The transformants exhibited resistance to fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol but, unlike most nfxC-type mutants, did not show beta-lactam hypersusceptibility. The transformants exhibited additional resistance to tetracycline. In the next experiment, we analyzed the MexEF-OprN pump subunit(s) responsible for substrate selectivity by expressing MexE, MexF, OprN, and MexEF in strains lacking MexA, MexB, OprM, and MexAB, respectively. The MexEF-OprM/DeltaMexAB transformants exhibited MexEF-OprN-type pump function that rendered the strains resistant to fluoroquinolones and chloramphenicol but did not change susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics compared with the host strain. The MexAB-OprN/DeltaOprM, MexAF-OprM/DeltaMexB, and MexEB-OprM/DeltaMexA mutants exhibited antibiotic susceptibility indistinguishable from that in the mutant lacking both types of efflux pumps. The results imply that the MexEF-OprM pump selects substrates by a MexEF functional unit. Interestingly, OprN did not link functionally with the MexAB complex, despite the fact that OprM interacted functionally with MexEF.
