One area of anti-HIV therapy research that has been inadequately addressed is strategies around third line therapy regimens. As a result, there is only a modest amount of data to guide physicians and patients in making treatment decisions in this setting. Third line therapy is usually defined as a regiment for an individual who has developed resistance to at least one drug in all three classes of anti-HIV therapies [nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors] or has failed two treatment regimens. In general, the nucleotide analogue drug, tenofovir (Viread) can be considered an NRTI as it shares some of the same resistance patterns. However, just because someone has developed resistance to some drug in all three classes of anti-HIV drugs does not mean that they have no further treatment options. This article will review some of the options available to people exploring third line regimen choices.
