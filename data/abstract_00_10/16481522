In this study we have evaluated the in vitro activity of antibiotics against 13 new isolates of Coxiella burnetii using a real-time quantitative PCR assay. MICs against doxycycline ranged from 1 to 8 microg/mL, telithromycin from 0.5 to 2 microg/mL, and all strains had MICs > or = 8 microg/mL for erythromycin. We report that strains resistant to doxycycline exist either in humans or animals.
