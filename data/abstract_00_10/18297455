Development of ampicillin resistance in Haemophilus influenzae is a cause of serious concern. Ampicillin resistance in H influenzae is beta-lactamase mediated except in some isolates. Two important issues related to beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains while choosing therapy for infections caused by H. influenzae are (i) whether BLNAR H. influenzae isolates are sufficiently pathogenic to cause respiratory tract infection, and (ii) variability in the magnitude of ampicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations obtained for the isolates. The aim of the present study was to determine the carriage of BLNAR H. influenzae in the nasopharynx of normal healthy children, to test the level of ampicillin resistance and the correlation of ampicillin resistance with resistance to other antimicrobials and to evaluate the frequency of serotype b and biotypes I, II, and III among BLNAR H. influenzae. Of 1001 H. influenzae isolates, 229 (22.9%) strains were ampicillin resistant. A total of 33/229 isolates were BLNAR. beta-Lactamase-positive strains show higher level of resistance to ampicillin as well as to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole. Of the 196 beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae isolates, 112 (57%) were H. influenzae type b, while of the 33 BLNAR isolates, 27 (81.8%) were H. influenzae type b. One hundred and eighty-four of 196 (93.9%) beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae isolates and 30/33 (91.0%) BLNAR strains belonged to biotypes I, II, and III. BLNAR H. influenzae are no less pathogenic than beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae. Higher level of drug resistance was found in beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae in comparison to BLNAR isolates.
