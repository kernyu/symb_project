Gentamicin (GM)-induced nephrotoxicity limits its long-term clinical use. Several agents/strategies were attempted to prevent GM nephrotoxicity but were not found suitable for clinical practice. Dietary fish oil (FO) retard the progression of certain types of cancers, cardiovascular and renal disorders. We aimed to evaluate protective effect of FO on GM-induced renal proximal tubular damage. The rats were pre-fed experimental diets for 10 days and then received GM (80 mg/kg body weight/day) treatment for 10 days while still on diet. Serum/urine parameters, enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, brush border membrane (BBM), oxidative stress and phosphate transport in rat kidney were analyzed. GM nephrotoxicity was recorded by increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. GM increased the activities of lactate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases whereas decreased malate, isocitrate dehydrogenases; glucose-6 and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases; superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and BBM enzymes. In contrast, FO alone increased enzyme activities of carbohydrate metabolism, BBM and oxidative stress. FO feeding to GM treated rats markedly enhanced resistance to GM elicited deleterious effects and prevented GM-induced decrease in 32Pi uptake across BBM. Dietary FO supplementation ameliorated GM-induced specific metabolic alterations and oxidative damage due to its intrinsic biochemical/antioxidant properties.
