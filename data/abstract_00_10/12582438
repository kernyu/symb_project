Salmonellosis is one of the main public health problems in developed countries. The most common serotype is Salmonella enteritidis, followed by S. typhimurium, S. hadar and S. virchow. Each serotype's sensitivity to antibiotics is different, but in general, there has been an increase in the number of isolates resistant to antibiotics. This is especially true for S. hadar and nalidixic acid, although we have not isolated any strains resistant to ciprofloxacin. Our study provides data that may help to control these infections and draws attention to the increase in resistance to certain antibiotics. This should give rise to the implementation of measures to protect public health and control the use of antibiotics, especially in animals.
