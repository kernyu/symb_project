BACKGROUND: Experimental gene transfer can make tumors more immunogenic, leading to local regression and inducing immunological memory sufficient to permit resistance to a tumor rechallenge. However, this rarely had any significant impact on large established tumors. METHODS: To analyze potential immunological effects, we used weakly immunogenic pancreatic carcinomas in syngeneic, immunocompetent Lewis rats and performed in situ adenoviral mediated cytosine deaminase (CD) gene transfer followed by administration of the prodrug, 5-fluorocytosine (5FC). In order to reflect the clinical situation, such treated tumors were surgically resected and animals were rechallenged with parental DSL6A pancreatic tumor cells. Tumor growth and cytotoxic activity of immune cells were determined. RESULTS: CD/5FC treatment of the DSL6A cells revealed significant induction of apoptosis in vitro and slowed down tumor progression in syngeneic hosts. Furthermore, we observed neither significant change in tumor growth nor protective immunity in the rechallenged animals. Analysis of T lymphocytes showed no specific cytotoxic activity against DSL6A cells. There was only a trend towards a minor NK cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Albeit the present study failed to induce protective antitumor immunity, the initial finding of reduced tumor growth argues for the development of multimodal therapeutic options to overcome negative impacts of advanced malignant disease or chemotherapy-related anergy and immunosuppression.
