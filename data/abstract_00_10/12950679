The distribution and expression of CD40, its ligand CD40L (154) and related cytokines interleukin-12 (IL-12), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) were studied in the lungs of B6D2F1 hybrid mice during slowly progressive primary tuberculosis (TB) by immunohistochemistry. CD40 and CD40L are implicated in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) causing activation or apoptosis of infected cells. The phenomenon of apoptosis is associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival. In this study, using frozen lung sections (n = 33), our results showed increased CD40, IL-12 and TGF-beta1 expression in macrophages with progression of disease. High percentages of mycobacterial antigens (M.Ags), CD40L and IFN-gamma expression were maintained throughout infection, and TNF-alpha-expressing cells were decreased. In lymphocytes, the percentage of IFN-gamma-positive cells was increased, but CD40L and IL-12 were maintained with the progression of disease. M.Ags, CD40 and CD40L were expressed in the same areas of the lesions. We conclude that changes in the expression of CD40-CD40L and cytokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection favour the hypothesis that M. tuberculosis causes resistance of host cells to apoptosis causing perpetuation of infection.
