Data from a double-blind randomized clinical drug trial were analyzed to find the comparative responses of two antirelapse drugs, bulaquine and primaquine, against different relapsing forms of Plasmodium vivax infection. A 1-year follow-up study strongly suggests that the duration of preerythrocytic development of P. vivax is a polymorphic characteristic, exhibited by two strains of hypnozoites responsible for early and late manifestations after primary infection. Short-term relapses were significantly higher in the first half year than long-term relapses, and the reverse was true in the second half year. Clinical drug response data showed that the hypnozoites characterized for short-term relapse were not susceptible to either of the antirelapse drugs in the currently administered dose, whereas hypnozoites characterized for long incubation were significantly susceptible.
