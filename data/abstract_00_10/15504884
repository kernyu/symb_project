To determine whether changes in antimicrobial resistance have occurred among viridans group streptococci, we retrospectively examined 50 viridans group streptococcal isolates recovered from patients with infective endocarditis over 3 decades. Resistance rates (percent resistant isolates 1971 to 1986 and 1994 to 2002) were as follows: levofloxacin, 0 and 9; penicillin and clindamycin, 0 and 4; and erythromycin and azithromycin, 11 and 26, respectively.
