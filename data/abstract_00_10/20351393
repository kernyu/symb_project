We present the case of a 54-year-old male with a St. Jude aortic valve replacement who presented with fever and a new diastolic murmur. An echocardiogram identified a pseudoaneurysm that appeared to originate from the left sinus of Valsalva. In anticipation of open valve surgery, a 64-slice computed tomographic (CT) angiogram was performed to characterize the size and location of the pseudoaneurysm. In addition, the CT scan was able to rule out significant coronary artery disease and obviate the need to perform a potentially high-risk catheterdirected angiogram in the setting of an infected pseudoaneurysm.
