ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The increasing resistance of Helicobacter pylori to antibiotics demands the search for novel compounds from plant based sources. Artemisia douglasiana Besser is widely used in Cuyo region (Argentina) as folk medicine for the treatment of gastric ailments. AIM OF STUDY: Based on our previous studies that Artemisia douglasiana exert cytoprotective actions against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury we assayed the anti-Helicobacter pylori effect of the Artemisia douglasiana extract and its active compound, dehydroleucodine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro anti-bacterial activity of Artemisia douglasiana extract and its active compound, dehydroleucodine were determined against one standard strain and six clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori by using the agar dilution methods. RESULTS: The results showed that both dehydroleucodine and Artemisia douglasiana extract had activity against the microorganism with MICs between 1-8 and 60-120 mg/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Artemisia douglasiana may be a useful alternative treatment strategy principally in eradication of metronidazole and clarithromycin-resistant strain.
