OBJECTIVE: To screen metronidazole (MTZ) -resistance associated gene fragments of Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) by suppression subtractive hybridization(SSH). METHODS: The suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to screen the different DNA fragments between MTZ-resistant and -susceptible clinical strains of H.pylori. The resistant strains specific gene fragments were obtained by SSH and identified by dot blotting. RESULT: Among the 120 subtractive colonies which were randomly chosen, 37 DNA fragments were different (>or=2 times) in DNA-copy numbers between resistant and susceptible strains and 17 of them were significantly different (>or=3 times). These 17 DNA fragments were sequenced subsequently. Ten of them were new sequences and the other 7 were duplicated sequences. These sequences represented respectively: depeptide ABC transporter periplasmic dipeptide-binding protein (dppA), permease protein (dppB), et al. CONCLUSION: Gene fragments specific to MTZ-resistant H. pylori strains were obtained by SSH and these genes may associated with MTZ-resistance of H.pylori.
