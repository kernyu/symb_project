The current treatment for leishmaniasis is unsatisfactory due to toxic side effects, high cost, and problems with drug resistance. Various approaches have been used to identify novel drug candidates to treat Leishmania sp. parasites including the use of re-purposed drugs. Furazolidone is a nitrofuran derivative with antiprotozoal and antibacterial activity and is used for the treatment of giardiasis. In the present work, we determined the in vitro antileishmanial activity of furazolidone and its ability to induce ultrastructural alterations of parasites. Promastigotes of Leishmania (L.) chagasi, Leishmania (V.) braziliensis, Leishmania (L.) major, and Leishmania (L.) amazonensis were highly susceptible to furazolidone, with IC(50) values ranging between 0.47 and 0.73 microg/mL. Furazolidone was also very effective against L. chagasi intracellular amastigotes, and despite mammalian cytotoxicity, the selectivity index was 8.0 in human monocytes. The drug also had limited toxicity in mice erythrocytes. Furazolidone demonstrated specific activity against Leishmania, a potential consequence of the lack of macrophage nitric oxide activation. As determined by electron transmission microscopy, drug treatment induced severe damage to the parasite mitochondria and nucleus. This older oral drug is an effective agent for the treatment of L. (L.) chagasi in vitro and is a novel candidate for further experimental studies.
