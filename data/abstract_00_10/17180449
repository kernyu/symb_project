Eleven cattle farms, 8 layer farms, 7 broiler farms and 30 broiler meat samples were investigated in south-eastern Italy throughout 2003 to evaluate the prevalence, the molecular type and antimicrobial resistance of thermophilic Campylobacters. A total of 398 samples were analysed. One Campylobacter isolate for each positive faecal swab and three isolates per positive broiler meat sample were selected for further analysis. Multiplex PCR was performed for species-level identification and PCR-RFLP of the flagellin A gene for genotyping. Resistance to 14 antimicrobials was studied in 188 Campylobacter isolates. Prevalence of campylobacters was high both on farms (100%) and in food samples (73%). On 4/11 cattle farms and on 10/15 poultry farms more than one species was isolated. The presence of more than one genotype was found on 8/11 cattle farms, on 10/15 poultry farms and in 8/22 Campylobacter-positive food samples. High rates of resistance to quinolone were observed: 9/31 (29%) C. jejuni bovine isolates, 4/22 (18%) C. jejuni poultry isolates, and 14/26 (54%) C. coli poultry isolates. Resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim was also observed frequently: 18/26 (69%) of the avian C. coli strains, 25/31 (80%) of the C. jejuni strains isolated from poultry and 15/22 (68%) of those isolated from cattle were resistant. There was a significant difference between the rate of resistance to macrolides of C. coli and C. jejuni isolated in poultry, which amounted to 23% and 3%, respectively. This study provided data on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of thermophilic campylobacters in south-eastern Italy and confirmed that flaA-typing is an efficient tool to study the epidemiology of Campylobacter strains in short-term investigations.
