PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To investigate epidemiologic trends in the bacteriology of acute otitis media, data were recorded during a 10-year period by the same group of investigators during clinical studies in pediatric outpatients. METHODS: Bacterial samples were obtained before antibiotic treatment from 2149 children (age 3 to 36 months) with acute otitis media. All samples were transported, handled and cultured in the same way throughout the 10-year period. RESULTS: From the study patients 1862 samples of middle ear secretion were collected by tympanocentesis and 287 samples were collected from spontaneous otorrhea occurring within 24 h. Pathogens were isolated from 70% of patients. Pathogens included Haemophilus influenzae (40%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (31%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (8%). The incidence of beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae was approximately 20% from 1987 to 1989, was approximately 35% from 1990 to 1995 and increased to 60 and 70% during the last 2 years. The rate of S. pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to penicillin gradually increased from 7% in 1987 to 70% in 1996 and 1997. CONCLUSION: The very high incidence of antimicrobial resistant strains reached during a short period in pediatric acute otitis media in our area, emphasizes the need for frequent epidemiologic studies.
