In September 2003, a 68-year-old man was with renal cell carcinoma(RCC)underwent left radical nephrectomy. The pathological diagnosis was renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, grade 1, pT3bNxMx stage III. Seventeen months later, lung metastasis was detected by CT and treated with recombinant interferon(IFN) -alpha2b (Intron A(R)) 600x10(4) units until the regrowth lung metastasis in May, 2008. Sorafenib, an antiangiogenic molecular-targeted agent, at a dose of 800 mg per day, was administered as the second time treatment. Nevertheless, it was discontinued in 2 months because of an increase in tumor size, severe hand-foot syndrome and thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the treatment was switched to natural human IFNa with tegafur-uracil at 300 mg per day since February 2009. After that, a nearly complete disappearance of the lung lesion was obtained 7 months later and maintained for 9 months.
