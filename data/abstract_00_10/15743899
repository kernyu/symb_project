OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of cefoxitin when used as a surrogate marker for the detection of methicillin resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred and seventy-one strains of Staphylococcus aureus, collected from eight tertiary referral centres serving diverse socio-economic populations, were included in the study using NCCLS disc diffusion and the agar dilution methods. RESULTS: Using cefoxitin and NCCLS criteria for disc diffusion, the sensitivity and specificity for recognizing methicillin resistance were both 100%. Similar results were obtained when the strains were tested by the agar dilution method. The cefoxitin MICs for methicillin-susceptible strains were < or = 4 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Testing with cefoxitin as a surrogate marker for the detection of methicillin resistance was very accurate with both disc diffusion and agar dilution methods. Such testing clearly distinguished methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus from methicillin-susceptible strains.
