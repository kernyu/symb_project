Resistance to lysostaphin, a staphylolytic glycylglycine endopeptidase, is due to a FemABX-like immunity protein that inserts serines in place of some glycines in peptidoglycan cross bridges. These modifications inhibit both binding of the recombinant cell wall targeting domain and catalysis by the recombinant catalytic domain of lysostaphin.
