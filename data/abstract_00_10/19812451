BACKGROUND: Telbivudine is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication without anti-HIV type-1 (HIV-1) activity demonstrated in vitro; however, very few clinical data on HIV-1-infected patients are available at present. Because it represents a therapeutic option in HIV-1-HBV-coinfected patients who do not require antiretroviral therapy, we strictly monitored three HIV-1-HBV-coinfected patients treated with telbivudine monotherapy for chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: We performed molecular analysis of HBV DNA and of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease RNA and DNA sequences in three HIV-1-HBV-coinfected patients treated with telbivudine monotherapy. RESULTS: Despite a transient and deep reduction of HIV-1 RNA, observed in two of the three patients studied, no genotypic resistance mutations were detected on both HIV-1 and HBV viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Telbivudine therapy for 24 weeks showed a potent anti-HBV activity in HIV-1-positive, hepatitis B e antigen-positive patients with high HBV viraemia. No direct anti-HIV-1 activity of telbivudine was demonstrated and no genotypic resistance mutations to anti-HIV-1 drugs was found; however, the transient but deep reduction of HIV RNA, after telbivudine introduction, deserves further investigation and a strict monitoring of HIV-1 viraemia in HIV-1-infected patients on treatment with this drug.
