Western immunoblot analyses of whole cell lysates probed with a human specific monoclonal anti-topoisomerase IIalpha antibody identified a 190 kDa protein over expressed in the arsenite resistant Leishmania donovani strain. The crude nuclear extract of the resistant strain showed higher topoisomerase II-like enzyme activity. suggesting a possible regulatory role of putative topoisomerase II in arsenite resistant Leishmania.
