Most studies looking at the reversal of drug resistance in hematological malignancies have focused on the blockade of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) pump activity, as one of the more important proteins involved in cell resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents used. In model experiments using the IM-9 lymphoblastoid cell line cultured with increasing doses of vincristine (Vcr) in the presence or absence of the Pgp blocker cyclosporin A (CsA) we established two Vcr resistant sublines. By measuring Pgp expression in target cells, and the activity and sensitivity to cytostatics we believe that our results suggest the presence of other mechanisms involved in cell resistance to xenobiotics and that these mechanisms should be considered in the development of clinical trials designed to overcome drug resistance.
