Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa are increasingly reported worldwide. In our study, a total of 70 clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were studied. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, PCR, and PCR product sequencing were designed to characterize the contained ESBLs. The Double Disk Synergy Test in Cloxacillin (250 microg/ml)-containing Mueller-Hinton agar plates with a 20 mm distance between disks was the most reliable ESBL-screening method. Seven out of 70 multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were positive for ESBL and have the bla(SHV-2a) ESBL gene. The bla(SHV-2a)-positive isolates were clonally related according to Enterobacterial Repetetive Intergenic Consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) results. The bla(SHV-2a) gene was found to be chromosomally located, and the flanking IS26 sequence in the immediate upstream region of the bla(SHV-2a) gene was detected in all SHV-2a-producing isolates. This is the first report of SHV-2a-producing P. aeruginosa isolates from Tunisia.
