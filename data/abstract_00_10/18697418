In order to detect the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiple resistant gram-negative bacilli isolated in our hospital, tigecycline susceptibilities of clinical isolates of multiple and/or panresistant 100 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, and 38 carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (17 of which were panresistant), obtained between January 2005 and August 2007, were evaluated by using E-test (AB Biodisc, Sweden). Carbapenem resistance rate was found to be 59% for A.baumannii, using Vitek2 Compact System (Bio-Merieux, France) which is present in our laboratory for routine use. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels for tigecycline were < or =2 mcg/ml in 93% of the isolates while the MIC level was 3 mcg/ml for 7% of the isolates. Tigecycline MIC50 and MIC 90 values were 1.5 and 2 mcg/ml, respectively. Among K. pneumoniae the least resistance was detected against amikacin (52.6% resistant) while tigecycline MIC levels were between 0.13 mcg/ml and 2 mcg/ml. All of the K.pneumoniae strains were susceptible to tigecycline, and the MIC50 ve MIC90 values of these isolates were 1 mcg/ml and 1.5 mcg/ml, respectively. The in vitro susceptibility rates of tigecycline against multiple and/or panresistant A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae isolates are found to be promising for use in therapy.
