Both D- and L-2'-fluoro-4'-thio-2',3'-unsaturated nucleosides were synthesized and their anti-HIV activity against the drug sensitive virus and lamivudine-resistant mutant (M184V) were evaluated. In vitro antiviral evaluation indicated that the L-isomers are more potent than the D-isomers, but unfortunately all were cross-resistant with 3TC. Molecular modeling studies revealed that the unnatural sugar moiety of the L-nucleosides as well as 4'-sulfur atom of the D-isomer has a steric conflict with the bulky side chain of valine 184, resulting in cross-resistance.
