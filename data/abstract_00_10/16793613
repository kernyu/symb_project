OBJECTIVE: To survey mycoplasma infection in female urogenital tract and analyze the drug sensitivity of mycoplasma in Changsha. METHODS: Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) and Mycoplasma hominis (Mh) were detected in 6566 cases of female urogenital tract infection by means of mycoplasma culture and drug sensitivity reagent kit. Sensitivity tests for 10 antibiotics were also performed. RESULTS: A total of 2938 cases were mycoplasma-positive (positivity rate of 44.75%), including 2469 Uu-positive cases (37.6%), 52 Mh-positive cases (0.08%) and 417 cases positive for both Uu and Mh (6.35%). Josamycin, doxycycline, clarithromycin and azithromycin were more effective against Uu infection. Josamycin, doxycycline and thiamphenicol were more effective against Mh infection. Mixed infection with Uu and Mh was more resistant to most antibiotics but Josamycin and doxycycline. CONCLUSION: The female urogenital mycoplasma infection results mainly from Uu. Compared with simple Uu or Mh infection, mixed infection with Uu and Mh has significantly greater resistance to a wider variety of drugs. Josamycin and doxycycline are the primary choice for female urogenital mycoplasma infection in Changsha.
