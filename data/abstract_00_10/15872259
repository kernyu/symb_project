A total of 98 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) isolates from four tertiary-care hospitals in Korea during the period between 1998 and 2004 were analyzed for genotypic characteristics using the multiplex PCR, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and esp gene analysis. Ninety-two isolates of VREF with VanA phenotype and five of six isolates with VanB phenotype possessed the vanA gene. MLST analysis revealed 9 sequence types (STs), which belonged to a single clonal complex (CC78, clonal lineage C1). Five strains showing incongruence between phenotype and genotype (VanB-vanA) did not belong to the same genotypic clone. The esp gene was detected in all VREF strains, showing 12 different esp repeat profiles. Data suggest that an epidemic clonal group of VREF, CC78 with esp gene, is also present in Asia and has differentiated into multiple diverse genotypic clones during the evolutionary process.
