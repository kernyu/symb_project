Urinary tract infection is a common complication after renal transplantation. The etiologies are diverse and the bacterial agents may sometimes be acquired during the hospital stay. We report a patient who developed Burkholderia cepacia urinary tract infection after renal transplantation. The bacteria showed in vivo resistance to all of the available antibiotics. A graft nephrectomy was eventually required to clear the infection. The consequence of some fastidious infection may be catastrophic and early recognition and treatment is necessary to optimize the treatment.
