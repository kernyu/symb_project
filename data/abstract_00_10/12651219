A simple rapid test for detecting praziquantel resistance in Schistosoma sp., involving change in shape of miracidia on exposure to praziquantel, was evaluated in China. Tests on miracidia hatched from eggs collected from naturally infected goats were run in a field laboratory in Jiangxi Province and a research laboratory in Shanghai. The mean values in the two laboratories were not significantly different, but the variation between individual samples in the two laboratories suggests that a delineating dose will be required for routine diagnosis of resistance. Confirmation that resistance would have been detected in Schistosoma japonicum must await the isolation of a resistant isolate. The tests suggested that the infection in the goats was susceptible to praziquantel as did chemotherapy of water buffaloes with 25mg/kg. This gave a 95% cure rate on the first treatment and 100% with a second treatment, similar to that found previously in human patients.
