PURPOSE: To enhance transfection efficacy of pDNA through the application of multifunctional peptide-PEG-tris-acridine conjugates (pPAC) and the formation of biodegradable core-shell polyplexes for gene delivery to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: pPAC-mediated transfection was compositionally optimized in mouse BBB cells (bEnd.3). Cellular uptake and trafficking, and brain accumulation of pDNA was evaluated by fluorescent imaging and histochemistry. We constructed anti-MRP4 siRNA-producing vectors and evaluated the efficacy of MRP4 down-regulation of MRP4 by Western blot and qPCR, and its effect on the uptake of (3)H-AZT, an MRP4 substrate. RESULTS: A core-shell gene delivery system (GDS) was assembled from pDNA and pPAC, carrying multifunctional peptides with NLS, TAT, and brain-specific BH, or ApoE sequences, and biodegradable pLPEI polyamine. This GDS demonstrated better cellular and nuclear accumulation, and a 25-fold higher transfection efficacy in slow-dividing bEnd.3 cells compared to ExGen500. Inclusion of brain-targeting pPAC enhanced in vivo accumulation of functional pDNA in brain capillaries. Treatment by encapsulated anti-MRP4 siRNA-producing pDNA caused transient down-regulation of MRP4, and, after intravenous injection in Balb/c mice, enhanced AZT uptake in the brain by 230-270%. CONCLUSIONS: The pPAC represent novel efficient components of GDS that could find various gene therapy applications, including genetic modulation of the BBB.
