Mycotic infections of the anogenital region are very common in dermatological practice. While dermatophyte infections are more frequent in men, genital candidosis is a more striking problem in women. The increasing prevalence of non-albicans species (esp. C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. guilliermondii) with their resistance against azole derivatives may be responsible for therapeutic failures and a relapsing course in some instances. Most superficial infections of the anogenital area respond satisfactorily to topical antifungal treatment, especially if provocative factors and the possibility of sexual transmission are considered. Systemic treatment is recommended in cases of widespread dermatophyte infections, candidosis or systemic mycosis.
