The use of prophylactic antibiotics in orthopaedic surgery is effective in reducing surgical site infections in hip and knee arthroplasty, spine surgery, and open reduction and internal fixation of fractures. To maximize the beneficial effect of prophylactic antibiotics while minimizing adverse effects, the correct antimicrobial agent must be selected, the drug must be administered just before incision, and the duration of administration should not exceed 24 hours.
