Direct hyphenation of analytical-scale high-performance liquid chromatography, photo-diode array detection, mass spectrometry, solid-phase extraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HPLC-PDA-MS-SPE-NMR) has been used for accelerated dereplication of crude extract of Haplophyllum acutifolium (syn. Haplophyllum perforatum). This technique allowed fast on-line identification of six quinolinone alkaloids, named haplacutine A-F, as well as of acutine, haplamine, eudesmine, and 2-nonylquinolin-4(1H)-one. Acutine and haplacutine E, isolated by preparative-scale HPLC, showed moderate antiplasmodial activity with IC(50) values of 2.17+/-0.22 microM and 3.79+/-0.24 microM, respectively (chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain).
