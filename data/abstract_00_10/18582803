BACKGROUND: Survival for heart transplantation (HTx) patients is limited by nephrotoxicity of the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus. To determine whether genetic factors are involved in the development of renal dysfunction under immunosuppressive therapy, we screened various genes for sequence variations. METHODS: In a case-control study we analyzed in parallel polymorphisms within the transforming growth factor-beta1 gene (TGF-beta1; L10P, R25P), the multidrug resistance gene MDR 1 (A893T/S) and the CYP3A5 gene (CYP3A5*1/*3 allele). In total, we included 53 cardiac allograft recipients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >or=1.8 mg/dl and glomerular filtration rate <50 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and 53 patients with normal renal function as controls. The controls were matched with patients for age, gender and post-HTx time. The polymorphisms were assessed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and direct sequencing. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the association between different gene variants and renal dysfunction. RESULTS: No significant (p > 0.05) relationship was found between the polymorphisms investigated and the susceptibility of renal insufficiency under immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not justify genotyping of the investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess the development of renal dysfunction post-HTx.
