The fact that antibiotics exert no effect on Mycobacterium tuberculosis may be attributable to the production of their persistent forms. A correlation was studied between the expression of the genes Rv3286c, Rv2626c, Rv2031, and Rv3133c and the phenotypical tolerance to antibiotics in relation to the physiological condition of M. bovis BCG. The anaerobic growth conditions ("Wayne dormancy model") were found to be attended by the increased expression of all the studied genes, by the higher tolerance to rifampicin, and by the decreased phenotypical resistance to metronidazole.
