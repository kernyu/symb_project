Antibiotic resistance is a subject of growing concern throughout the medical community. Addressing drug resistance requires that practitioners understand the mechanisms of resistance and the methods of treating infections effectively while minimizing the emergence of resistant organisms. When making antibiotic selections, clinicians should consider a number of factors in addition to the drug's antimicrobial activity. These include the epidemiology of regional resistance and the antibiotic's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. Combination therapies should be considered and appropriate durations of therapy addressed. Developing clear practice guidelines for managing infectious disease can help practitioners reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and minimize the emergence of resistance.
