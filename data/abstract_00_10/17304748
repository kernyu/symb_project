Mayotte is a little French island, located in the Indian ocean, between Madagascar and Mozambic. Officially there is a population of 150000 inhabitants, but in fact, there are probably about 200000 people, largely due to numerous illegal immigrants, especially coming from Anjouan the nearest Comorian island. There is only one hospital, with 252 beds. The malaria incidence reaches about 3000 cases per year; and treatments until august 2001 were generally haphazard. This is changing with the use of the Optimal rapid diagnostic test (DiaMed, Cressier Switzerland). More precise statistics should be available in the coming years. In 2000, 252 patients were hospitalised with malaria fever. Preventive measures were scarce. These have been reenforced this year, with the arrival of an entomologist, the use of reenforced pesticide pulverisation in high-risk areas, the distribution of impregnated bednets to pregnant women, and media based information campaigns. Common drugs resistance is becoming a real concern in Mayotte. First-line treatment was: chloroquine; second-line: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and third-line: quinine. In vitro studies have shown high levels of resistance, therefore another antimalarial drug therapy will be introduced at the end of the year: first-line: artemether-lumefantrine, second-line: mefloquine or halofantrine, third-line: quinine. To conclude, solutions exist but a real policy from the decision makers is necessary to implement them. The eradication of malaria remains a dream, but we can expect "zero death" in Mayotte, considering that the fight against this disease may help to start a regional health program.
