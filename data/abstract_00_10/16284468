The administration of single-dose nevirapine to women in labor and their infants can prevent HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission. We examined nevirapine resistance in infants who were HIV-1 infected despite single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis, including 18 Ugandan infants (HIVNET 012 trial, nine subtype A and nine subtype D) and 23 Malawian infants (NVAZ trial, all subtype C). Nevirapine resistance was more frequent in infants with subtype C than with subtypes A and D (87 versus 50%, P = 0.016).
