BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that ranitidine bismuth citrate-based, clarithromycin-containing triple therapy achieves a higher eradication rate than proton pump inhibitor-based regimens in areas with a high prevalence of metronidazole resistance. AIM: To evaluate whether this higher efficacy of ranitidine bismuth citrate over proton pump inhibitor can be extended to non-clarithromycin-containing regimens. METHODS: Helicobacter pylori-positive dyspeptic patients were randomized to receive either ranitidine bismuth citrate, 400 mg, amoxicillin, 1000 mg, and metronidazole, 400 mg, or omeprazole, 20 mg, amoxicillin, 1000 mg, and metronidazole, 400 mg, each given twice daily for 1 week. H. pylori eradication was confirmed by 13C-urea breath test 5 weeks later. The side-effects of the treatments were documented. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-nine patients were eligible for analysis. By intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis, the eradication rates were 77% and 79%, respectively, in the ranitidine bismuth citrate-amoxicillin-metronidazole group and 77% and 82%, respectively, in the omeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole group (P = 0.58 and P = 0.65). However, patients in the omeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole group reported a significantly higher incidence of minor side-effects when compared to those in the ranitidine bismuth citrate-amoxicillin-metronidazole group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ranitidine bismuth citrate-amoxicillin-metronidazole was equally as effective as omeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole triple therapy, and may be considered as an alternative non-clarithromycin-based regimen in the Chinese population.
