The accuracy of antifungal susceptibility testing is important for the clinical management of patients with serious infections due to fungus. Our primary objective was to analyze the results of antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida species performed at Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital and usage of antifungal agents. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by the CLSI M27-A2 method. Yeast-like fungi were isolated from 6% of 6,730 samples. All isolates were Candida species, i.e., C. albicans (50%), C. parapsilosis (28%), C. guilliermondii (9%), C. krusei (5%), C. glabrata (4%), and C. tropicalis (4%). The results of the minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the strain tested (MIC90) were 1 microg/mL for fluconazole, 0.5 microg/mL for miconazole, 0.06 microg/mL for itoraconazole, < or = 0.03 microg/mL for micafungin, respectively. The results of non-albicans species were 32 microg/mL for fluconazole, 8 microg/mL for miconazole, 0.5 microg/mL for itoraconazole, 1 microg/mL for micafungin, respectively. All Candida species were susceptible to the available antifungal agents, except C. krusei that was resistant to fluconazole. Thus, antifungal susceptibility varies greatly according to fungal species. The accuracy of identification of the fungus and antifungal susceptibility would contribute to the proper management of patients with serious fungal infections.
