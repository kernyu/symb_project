Direct heteroduplex analysis and a universal heteroduplex generator assay were performed to detect rifampin resistance rapidly in Turkish Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Cross-resistance to rifapentine, rifabutin, and rifalazil was investigated. A relationship between specific mutations and resistance patterns, which can guide the choice of an appropriate therapeutic regimen for tuberculosis patients, was identified.
