The most effective strategy for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in lung transplantation has not been conclusively established. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of preemptive ganciclovir therapy for this purpose. Twenty-five consecutive adult patients positive for CMV before transplantation and surviving more than 30 days after the procedure were studied. Mean follow-up was 732.2 days (range, 210-1125). All patients received intravenous (IV) ganciclovir prophylaxis for the first 21 days and subsequently underwent frequent CMV antigenemia monitoring: weekly for the first 3 months, every 15 days between 3 and 6 months, and monthly thereafter. IV ganciclovir was given when antigenemia results were greater than 10 infected cells per 100,000 polymorphonuclears. The study group was compared with a historical group of 30 consecutive patients who had received IV ganciclovir prophylaxis and continued on oral ganciclovir up to day 120 posttransplantation. Eighteen of the 25 patients (72.0%) presented episodes of CMV infection. Six of the 25 patients (24.0%) had CMV disease, including 3 viral syndromes and 3 cases of pneumonitis. Four patients debuted with CMV disease, 1 of them with pneumonitis. CMV resistance to ganciclovir was observed in 2 patients. The incidence of infection was higher than in the historical group (72.0% vs 46.7%; P < .05), but there were no significant differences in the incidence of CMV disease (24.0% vs 40.0%; P = not significant [NS]). Mean time before onset of the first episode of disease was lower in the preemptive therapy group than in the comparison patients (82.8 days; range, 42-240 vs 175 days; range, 90-243; P < .05). In conclusion, preemptive therapy for CMV disease is as effective a prevention strategy as oral ganciclovir prophylaxis. However, the early appearance of CMV disease with preemptive therapy can make this approach inadvisable.
