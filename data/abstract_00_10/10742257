The effects of oxygen limitation, low redox potential, and high NaCl stress for 7 days in vitro on the rifampin-resistant biocontrol inoculant Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0-Rif and its subsequent persistence in natural soil for 54 days were investigated. Throughout the experiment, the strain was monitored using total cell counts (immunofluorescence microscopy), Kogure's direct viable counts, and colony counts (on rifampin-containing plates). Under in vitro conditions, viable-but-nonculturable (VBNC) cells of CHA0-Rif were obtained when the strain was exposed to a combination of low redox potential (230 mV) and oxygen limitation. This mimics a situation observed in the field, where VBNC cells of the strain were found in the water-logged soil layer above the plow pan. Here, VBNC cells were also observed in vitro when CHA0-Rif was subjected to high NaCl levels (i.e., NaCl at 1.5 M but not 0.7 M). In all treatments, cell numbers remained close to the inoculum level for the first 12 days after inoculation of soil, regardless of the cell enumeration method used, but decreased afterwards. At the last two samplings in soil, VBNC cells of CHA0-Rif were found in all treatments except the one in which log-phase cells had been used. In the two treatments that generated high numbers of VBNC cells in vitro, VBNC cells did not display enhanced persistence compared with culturable cells once introduced into soil, which suggests that this VBNC state did not represent a physiological strategy to improve survival under adverse conditions.
