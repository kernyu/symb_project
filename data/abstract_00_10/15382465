OBJECTIVE: The management of urinary tract infection in children faces the problem of the emergence of resistant strains to antibiotics. The aim of this study is to precise the frequency of the different germs and their susceptibility to antibiotics. METHODS: We report a retrospective study concerning 200 cases of urinary tract infection hospitalised in the paediatric department of Monastir between January 1995 and December 2000. There were 58 boys and 142 girls aged between two months and 14 years with a mean age of 5 years. The frequency of urinary tract infection is 1.85%. RESULTS: The most common causative agent is Escherichia coli in 75.5% of cases, followed by Proteus mirabilis (10%) then by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%). Escherichia coli is predominant in girls, whereas Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are likely encountred in boys. Of all the strains, 96% are resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin and cefalotin, 67% to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and 34% to cotrimoxazole. A resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin and cefalotin is noted in 96% of the germs. The resistance is of 67% for amoxicillin + clavulanic-acid and of 34% for cotrimoxazole. However, third generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides remain usually active on the majority of strains incriminated in these infections a part from Pseudomonas.
