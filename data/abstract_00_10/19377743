OBJECTIVE: Determine antibiotic resistance of community-acquired uropathogen Escherichia coli and infer therapeutic options. MATERIAL AND METHODS: E. coli strains isolated from urine during a one-year period were studied. Identification and susceptibility tests were performed. RESULTS: A total of 652 isolates were included from patients in two institutions, a healthcare clinic 303 (46.5%) and a hospital 349 ( 53.5%). The antimicrobials with higher resistance rates were ampicillin 67.2%, trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole 59.2%, cefazolin 35.6% and ciprofloxacin 24.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin used for empiric treatment in community urinary infections is high, and there are few available treatment options.
