Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum needs to be monitored in the field for effective malaria control strategies. A point mutation K76T in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) protein has recently been proposed as a molecular marker for the faster detection of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in field. We describe here the evaluation of this marker in Indian P. falciparum isolates. A total of 274 Indian P. falciparum isolates were analyzed for the K76T mutation. This mutation was detected in all the clinical isolates obtained from the in vivo chloroquine non-responders. But majority of the clinical isolates from chloroquine responders (71 of 74 patients, i.e. 96%) also harbored this mutation. The K76T mutation was indeed highly prevalent (91%) among 213 clinical isolates. There was a significant association between K76T mutation and the in vitro chloroquine response (P<0.05) but six isolates showed discordant results. In conclusion, the K76T mutation fails to differentiate majority of the chloroquine responders from that of the non-responders and thus will be of limited use in the field in India.
