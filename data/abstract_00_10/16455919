A cefoxitin-based selective broth was evaluated for its efficiency in detecting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by the use of laboratory reference strains, clinical isolates of different clones, and clinical samples. The cefoxitin-based broth was proved to be more sensitive and rapid for the detection of MRSA strains, especially heterogeneously resistant strains, than the oxacillin-based broth.
