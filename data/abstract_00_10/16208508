BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides are naturally occurring cationic peptides. The first-line of defense in infected burns is the innate immune system, of which antimicrobial peptides are essential parts. To facilitate their topical use in infected partial-thickness burns, the efficacy of a mixture with fibrin glue in vitro and in vivo was tested. METHODS: After in vitro tests, 15 male Sprague-Dawley rats received partial-thickness burns. Afterwards, the wounds were infected with multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The animals received PG-1 (100 microg/ml, n=5), fibrin glue (n=5), or a mixture of both (n=5) topically. The efficacy of the materials was previously proven by radial diffusion assay. After 24 h, the infected and burned skin was harvested and quantitative bacterial counts per gram of skin performed. RESULTS: The biologic effect of the peptides was confirmed in vitro. The PG-1 and fibrin glue groups did not show significant differences in bacterial numbers, whereas the mixture group showed significant reduction in Pseudomonas in vivo (P<0.04 and P<0.01). CONCLUSION: A mixture of an antimicrobial peptide and commercially available fibrin glue is capable of significantly reducing bacteria in infected partial thickness burns in vivo compared to controls.
