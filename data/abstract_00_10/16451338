OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug resistance of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense strains isolated from sleeping sickness patients in Tanzania. METHOD: We first screened 35 T. b. rhodesiense strains in the mouse model, for sensitivity to melarsoprol (1.8, 3.6 and 7.2 mg/kg), diminazene aceturate (3.5, 7 and 14 mg/kg), suramin (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) and isometamidium (0.1, 1.0 and 2 mg/kg). A 13 isolates suspected to be resistant were selected for further testing in vitro and in vivo. From the in vitro testing, IC(50) values were determined by short-term viability assay, and MIC values were calculated by long-term viability assay. For in vivo testing, doses higher than those in the initial screening test were used. RESULTS: Two T. b rhodesiense stocks expressed resistance in vivo to melarsoprol at 5 mg/kg and at 10 mg/kg. These strains had high IC(50) and MIC values consistent with those of the melarsoprol-resistant reference strain. Another isolate relapsed after treatment with 5 mg/kg of melarsoprol although it did not appear resistant in vitro. One isolate was resistant to diminazene at 14 mg/kg and another was resistant at both 14 and 28 mg/kg of diminazene. These two isolates had high IC(50) values consistent with the diminazene-resistant reference strain. Two isolates relapsed at a dose of 5 mg/kg of suramin, although no isolate appeared resistant in the in vitro tests. Two isolates were resistant to isometamidium at 1.0 mg/kg and had higher IC(50) values. Two isolates were cross-resistant to melarsoprol and diminazene and one isolate was cross-resistant to suramin and isometamidium. CONCLUSION: The reduced susceptibility of T. b. rhodesiense isolates to these drugs strongly indicates that drug resistance may be emerging in north-western Tanzania.
