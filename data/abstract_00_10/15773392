A total of 234 M. tuberculosis isolates were used to demonstrate the leading role of mutations in, respectively, codon 531 of gene rpoB (90.0%) and codon 315 of gene katG (92.9%), in the development of resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid by the methods of reverse hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and the sequencing of gene stretches. The levels of primary resistance of M. tuberculosis to rifampicin, isoniazid and multiresistance, according to the molecular-genetic analysis, were 41.0%, 57.7% and 37.2% respectively. The coincidence of the results of the bacteriological and molecular-genetic analyses of the antimicrobial resistance of the isolates was 90.4% and 95.3% for isoniazid and rifampicin respectively. The prevalence of individual types of mutations, linked with antimicrobial resistance, in the presence of a considerable spread of strains of the family Beijing in the region may be indicative of the limited number of M. tuberculosis clones circulating in the region.
