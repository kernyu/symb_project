OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between the expression of serum amyloid A (SAA) and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. METHODS: 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with different concentrations of dexamethasone (10, 100, and 1000 nmol/L) for 48 h to establish cell models of insulin resistance at different resistant levels (models 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The degree of insulin resistance of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was assayed by 2-deoxy-[(3)H]-D-glucose uptake. Semi- quantitative RT-PCR was performed for quantification of SAA mRNA expression. SAA concentrations in the culture medium were determined by ELISA. RESULT: Dexamethasone did not affect the basal glucose transport (P>0.05). Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly decreased by 15% (P<0.05), 40% (P<0.01), and 55% (P<0.01) in models 1, 2, and 3 in comparison with the untreated group, respectively; the expressions of SAA mRNA were upregulated by 2.5 (P<0.01), 3.33 (P<0.01), and 4.08 folds (P<0.01) and SAA concentrations increased by 2.05, 3.13, and 4.23 folds, respectively. The expressions of SAA mRNA were positively correlated to the degree of insulin resistance (r=0.773, P<0.01) and SAA concentration (r=0.832, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: A cell model of insulin resistance has been established in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by dexamethasone exposure. SAA is closely associated with insulin resistance and may serve as a marker of insulin resistance.
