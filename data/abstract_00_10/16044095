The third round of the International Interlaboratory Quality Control Program for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in HIV infection (QC-program) consisted of the analysis not only of plasma samples but also of patient cases. The case was composed of different topics related to the therapeutic drug monitoring of antiretroviral drugs. The participants were asked to give recommendations concerning dose adjustments, changes to the regimen, and drug-drug interactions to observe whether the expert recommendations were comparable. Of the 30 participants of the QC-program, 16 returned their comments and recommendations with regard to the patient case. The drug level was easy to judge: approximately 90% were able to correctly do so. Almost half of the recommendations (44%) given were satisfactory. Levels of knowledge regarding HIV treatment appeared to be variable among the respondents and for this reason were partly incomparable.
