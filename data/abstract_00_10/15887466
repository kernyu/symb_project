Oral candidiasis can be an early sign of illness or disease progression in HIV/AIDS and other immuno-compromised states. Oral lesions associated with fungal infections present in a variety of forms, including a few of previously unknown etiology. Diagnosing these variants of disease can be challenging because of their atypical clinical presentation. Moreover, the emergence of new candida species, drug resistance and immature immune systems add to the complexity of this condition, especially in children.
