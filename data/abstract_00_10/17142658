PURPOSE: Anesthesiologists managing patients with drug-eluting stents (DES) face the challenge of balancing the risks of bleeding vs perioperative stent thrombosis (ST). This article reviews DES and the influence of antiplatelet medications related to their use. A perioperative management algorithm is suggested. Novel P2Y12 antagonists currently under investigation, including cangrelor and prasugrel are considered, as well as their potential role in modification of perioperative cardiovascular risks and management of patients with DES. SOURCE: A PubMed search of the relevant literature over the period 1985-2005 was undertaken using the terms "drug-eluting stent", "coronary artery stent", "bare metal stent", "antiplatelet medication", "aspirin", "clopidogrel." PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Delayed re-endothelialization may render both sirolimus-eluting and paclitaxel-eluting stents susceptible to thrombosis for a longer duration than bare metal stents. Stent thrombosis may be associated with resistance to antiplatelet medication. In patients with a DES, a preoperative cardiology consultation is essential. Elective surgery should be postponed if the duration between DES placement and noncardiac surgery is less than six months. For semi-emergent procedures, both aspirin and clopidogrel should be continued during surgery unless clearly contraindicated by the nature of the surgery. If the risk of bleeding is high, then modification of antiplatelet medications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. CONCLUSION: A profound increase in the number of patients with DES requires anesthesiologists to be familiar with their associated antiplatelet medications, and strategies for risk modification of ST and possible hemorrhagic complications in the perioperative setting.
