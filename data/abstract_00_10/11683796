OBJECTIVES: To assess trends in quinolone susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a large university hospital. METHODS: Between 1992 and 1998, bacterial isolates were collected each year during a 3-month period to evaluate annual changes in susceptibility. In addition, the activities of fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) against nalidixic acid-resistant strains were determined by disk diffusion and MIC methodologies during the first and last year of the study. RESULTS: The susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae to nalidixic acid was unchanged between 1992 and 1998 (86% versus 85%). However, at the species level, the susceptibility rates to nalidixic acid decreased for Escherichia coli from 92% to 89%, and for Enterobacter cloacae from 87% to 82%. In contrast, there was a 10% increase in the nalidixic acid susceptibility rates for Klebsiella pneumoniae (74% versus 83%), which was thought to be due to the control of the spread of epidemic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains. The overall susceptibility of the Enterobacteriaceae to the fluoroquinolones remained high during the study period, greater than 90% in the case of ciprofloxacin. However, nalidixic acid-resistant Escherichia coli showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin between 1992 and 1998, as reflected by a decrease in median zone diameter (26 mm to 19 mm), an increase in MIC(50) (0.25 mg/L to 1 mg/L) and a shift in MIC distribution (unimodal in 1992 to bimodal in 1998). This has resulted in the reduced susceptibility of Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones between 1992 and 1998 (pefloxacin, 95-90%; ciprofloxacin, 99-95%). CONCLUSIONS: The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to quinolones has decreased, and the level of susceptibility of the resistant strains has increased over the 7-year study period.
