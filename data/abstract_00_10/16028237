Trauma, whether caused by an accident or in an intentional manner, results in significant morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to develop a novel biomaterial surface in vitro and ex vivo that provides both localized infection resistance nd hemostatic properties. Our hypothesis is that a combination of specific surface characteristics can be successfully incorporated into a single biomaterial. Functional groups were created with woven Dacron (Cntrl) material via exposure to ethylenediamine (C-EDA). The antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) was then applied to the C-EDA material using pad/autoclave technique (C-EDA-AB) followed by surface immobilization of the coagulation cascade enzyme thrombin (C-EDA-AB-Thrombin). Antimicrobial activity by the C-EDA-AB surface persisted for 5 days compared with Cntrl and dipped controls, which lasted <1 h. C-EDA-AB-Thrombin surfaces had 2.6- and 105-fold greater surface thrombin activity compared with nonspecifically bound thrombin and Cipro-dyed surfaces, respectively. Surface thrombus formation ex vivo was evident after 1 min of exposure, with thrombus organization evident by 2.5 min. In contrast, C-EDA-AB and Cntrl segments showed only blood protein adsorption on the fibers. Thus, this study demonstrated that Cipro and thrombin can be simultaneously incorporated onto a biomaterial surface while maintaining their respective biological activities.
