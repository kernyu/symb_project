An fljB-negative, multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar 4,5,12:i:- phage type DT U302 strain (resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulfonamide, gentamicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim) emerged and spread in Spain in 1997. Sequences specific for Salmonella serovar Typhimurium and phage type DT 104 and U302 were present in this atypical Salmonella strain, suggesting that it is a monophasic Salmonella serovar Typhimurium variant.
