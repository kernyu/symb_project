'Solid-phase' PEGylation, in which a conjugation reaction attaches proteins to a solid matrix, has distinct advantages over the conventional, solution-phase process. We report a case study in which recombinant interferon (rhIFN) alpha-2a was adsorbed to a cation-exchange resin and PEGylated at the N-terminus by 5, 10, and 20 kDa mPEG aldehydes through reductive alkylation. After PEGylation, a salt gradient elution efficiently purified the mono-PEGylate of unwanted species such as unmodified IFN and unreacted PEG. Mono-PEGylation and purification were integrated into a single, chromatographic step. Depending on the molecular weight of the mPEG aldehyde, the mono-PEGylation yield ranged from 50 to 65%. Major problems associated with the solution-phase process such as random or uncontrollable multi-PEGylation and post-PEGylation purification difficulties were overcome. N-terminus sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrophometry confirmed that the PEG molecule was conjugated only to the N-terminus. A cell proliferation study indicated reduced antiviral activity of the mono-PEGylate compared to that of the unmodified IFN. As higher molecular weight PEG was conjugated, in vitro bioactivity and antibody binding activity, as measured by a surface plasmon resonance biosensor, decreased. Nevertheless, trypsin resistance and thermal stability were considerably improved .
