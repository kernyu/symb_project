We determined the faecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(ESBL)-producing bacteria in the community in Saudi Arabia. A total of 716 faecal specimens (from 505 healthy individuals and 211 community outpatients) were screened for ESBL using the double-disk synergy test and confirmed by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute combined disk method. We found 91 (12.7%) isolates were ESBL-producers. Of these, 87 (95.6%) were Escherichia coli and 4 (4.4%) Klebsiella pneumoniae. A similar rate of faecal carriage of ESBL-producers was demonstrated in community outpatients and healthy individuals: 62 (12.3%) healthy persons and 29 (13.7%) outpatients. We conclude that the community could be a reservoir of these ESBL-producing bacteria and enzymes.
