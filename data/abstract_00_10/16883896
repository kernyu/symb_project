OBJECTIVE: To explore the change in mobility of staphylococcus and its drug resistance etiology investigation and clinical treatment. METHODS: The routine biochemical identification was used for staphylococcus differentiation. Minimal inhibitory concentrations was used for drug-resistance determination. Some drug-resistance determination were detected by K-B method. The inducible resistance of erythromycin to clindamycin was checked by D-test. RESULTS: Staphylococcus was in the first place in the hospital infection. The rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus were 54.1%. The drug-resistance rates of staphylococcus to penicillin, oxacillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, SMZCO, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin antibacterials were 93.2%, 54.1%, 85.1%, 56.7%, 45.9%, 48.6%, 58.1%. 45.9%, 31.1%, 0%, 0%. D-test positive rate was 37.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The results are helpful in study of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance characteristics in staphylococcus infection.
