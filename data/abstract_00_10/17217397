ATP-dependent drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multi-drug resistance associated protein (MRP2) and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) are expressed at the brush border membrane of enterocytes. These efflux transporters excrete their substrates, among other various classes of antibiotics, into the lumen thus reducing net absorption as indicated by a low bioavailability after oral administration. Oxytetracycline (OTC) has been used for decennia in veterinary medicine for its extensive spectrum of antimicrobial activity. A major limitation has been, and still remains, its low bioavailability following oral administration. The present study aimed to investigate to what extent this low bioavailability is attributable to the fact that OTC is a substrate for one or more efflux transporters. As an experimental model to study the transmembrane transport of OTC, differentiated Caco-2 cells grown as monolayers on permeable supports were used. With this model it was shown that the secretion of OTC is slightly higher than its absorption. PSC833, a potent inhibitor of P-gp, decreased the secretion of OTC without affecting its absorption, while the MRP-inhibitor MK571 did not exert any effect. These data indicate that OTC is a substrate for P-gp. The affinity of OTC to these transporters seems to be rather low, as suggested by the low efflux ratio of 1:1.3. In competition experiments, OTC decreased the effluxes of other P-gp substrates such as Rhodamine123 and ivermectin. These findings are of clinical relevance, as they clearly indicate potential drug-drug interactions at the level of P-gp-mediated drug transport.
