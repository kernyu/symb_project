The incidence of virulence factors among 48 Enterococcus faecium and 47 Enterococcus faecalis strains from foods and their antibiotic susceptibility were investigated. No strain was resistant to all antibiotics, and for some strains, multiple resistances were observed. Of E. faecium strains, 10.4% were positive for one or more virulence determinants, compared to 78.7% of E. faecalis strains. Strains exhibiting virulence traits were not necessarily positive for all traits; thus, the incidence of virulence factors may be considered to be strain specific.
