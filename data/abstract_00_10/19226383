AIMS: To determine the antimicrobial resistant profiles and clonality of Campylobacter coli isolated from clinically ill humans and retail meats. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 98 C. coli isolates (20 from humans and 78 from retail meats) were phenotypically characterized. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using agar dilution method for ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, erythromycin and doxycycline. Seventy C. coli isolates including humans (n = 20) and retail meats (n = 50) were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in 29% and 15% of isolates from retail meats and humans. We observed 61 PFGE profiles using two enzymes (SmaI, KpnI) with an Index of discrimination of 0.99, whereas MLST generated 37 sequence types. Two clonal complexes were identified with 58 (82%) C. coli isolates clustered in the ST-828 complex. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin was identified in C. coli obtained from retail meats and ill humans. PFGE typing of C. coli isolates was more discriminatory than MLST. Grouping of C. coli isolates (82%) by MLST in ST-828 clonal complex indicates a common ancestry. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A high frequency of resistance found to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin is concerning from food safety perspective. PFGE using single or double restriction enzymes was found to be more discriminatory than MLST for genotyping C. coli. Overall, the C. coli populations recovered from humans and retail meats were genotypically diverse.
