The causes of the unique phage resistance of the pectinolytic phytopathogenic strains of Erwinia carotovora were studied with the use of temperate bacteriophage ZF40. It was shown that, in these bacteria, the bacteriophage-cell interaction can be substantially blocked at the adsorption level. An adequate indicator for studying the temperate bacteriophages of erwinias was developed on the basis of mutants resistant to macromolecular bacteriocins. Various restriction-modification systems, which influence cell resistance to bacteriophages, were revealed for the first time in E. carotovora. The phage resistance was shown to be determined by the wide occurrence of homoimmune temperate viruses in pectinolytic erwinias.
