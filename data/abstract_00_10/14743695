Helicobacter pylori is a relevant pathogen for gastroduodenal diseases in human beings. Although its eradication often improves gastroduodenal diseases, H pylori is acquiring an elevated rate of resistance to various antimicrobials, such as metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline and amoxicillin. Multi-drug resistance is a major problem to select the appropriate treatment of infectious diseases. To improve our understanding on the complexity of the problem, in this article we review the resistance mechanisms and give an update on H pylori antimicrobial resistance.
