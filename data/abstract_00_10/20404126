Bacterial resistance presents a difficult issue for fluoroquinolone treatment of bacterial infections. In previous work, we reported that 8-methoxy-quinazoline-2,4-diones are active against quinolone-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli. Here, we demonstrate the activity of a representative 8-methoxy-quinazoline-2,4-dione against quinolone-resistant gyrases. Furthermore, 8-methoxy-quinazoline-2,4-dione and other diones are shown to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus gyrase and topoisomerase IV with similar degrees of efficacy, suggesting that the diones might act as dual-targeting agents against S. aureus.
