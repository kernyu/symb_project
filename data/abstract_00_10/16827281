The authors of the study demonstrate that Helicobacter pylori (HP) strains with the cytoxin-associated protein Cag A are more frequent in patients suffering from duodenal ulcer (DU) or lymphocyte gastritis. DU is more severe and often displays a recurrent character in cases with persistent Cag A-positive HP strains. The authors studied the sensitivity of HP strains with the cytoxin-associated protein Cag A to various antibacterial preparations. The study shows that resistance of HP to metronidazole is found mostly among Cag A strains (58.5% of cases).
