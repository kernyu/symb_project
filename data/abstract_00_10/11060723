Ribozymes are RNA molecules that possess the ability to cleave and thus destroy other RNA molecules. As a result of this ability, they are ideal specific agents to use against the messenger RNAs of important genes found to be linked with disease (of cellular and viral origin). This review will briefly describe the different types of ribozyme and the potential they have as therapeutic compounds against viruses, oncogenes and drug resistance in haematological settings. The latest news from the various Phase I and II ribozyme clinical trials is discussed, as is the potential for the ribozymes' future as therapeutic agents.
