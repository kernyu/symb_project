The efficacy of amodiaquine (AQ) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was assessed in 310 symptomatic children from western Kenya with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. A non-blinded, randomized, 14-day study was performed and parasitologic criteria were used. Of 310 patients included, 238 (77%) completed the study: 120 received AQ and 118 received SP. In those treated with AQ, there were sensitive (S) infections in 107 patients (89.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 82.2, 94.1%), RI resistance in 10 (8.3%, 95% CI = 4.1, 14.8%), RII resistance in 1 (0.8%, 95% CI = 0, 4.6%), and RIII resistance in 2 (1.7%, 95% CI = 0.2, 5.9%). In those treated with SP, there were S infections in 74 patients (62.7%, 95% CI = 53.3, 71.4%), RI resistance in 21 (17.8%, 95% CI = 11.4, 25.9%), RII resistance in 11 (9.3%, 95% CI = 4.7, 16.1%), and RIII resistance in 12 (10.2%, 95% CI = 5.4, 17.1%). Resistance rates were consistently higher in the SP-treated patients (P < 0.001). Resistance to SP in this area has reached such levels that it should no longer be the first-line treatment. Alternative treatment, such as SP plus AQ combination treatment or artemisinin combination treatment, is urgently needed.
