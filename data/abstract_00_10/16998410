An 11-year-old boy was transferred to a regional burn center after sustaining 53% TBSA burns. Initial wound cultures grew multiple organisms. Multiresistant Klebsiella was cultured from the patient's blood. When the patient indicated worsening hip pain, radiographs revealed a spontaneous hip dislocation. Immediate arthrotomy revealed left hip synovial fluid infected with Klebsiella. The patient remained afebrile and was discharged home 6 months after admission.
