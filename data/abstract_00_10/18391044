The genetic environment of the 16S rRNA methylase gene rmtD was investigated. rmtD was flanked by a novel ISCR motif located downstream of class I integron In163 in the original Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain. rmtD found in Klebsiella pneumoniae appeared to have been mobilized from P. aeruginosa by an IS26-mediated event.
