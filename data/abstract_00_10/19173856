OBJECTIVE: To study the HIV-1 drug resistance (DR) situation among newly infected persons in Dehong. METHODS: 1048 HIV-1 positive blood samples from July to December in 2006 from Dehong prefecture of Yunnan, were collected. HIV drug resistance were tested using TruGene in newly infected people that were distinguished with BED-CEIA, while the subtype were determined with phylogenetic analysis using a set of reference sequences available on the Los Alamos Database. RESULTS: Of sixty-four successfully analyzed samples, drug resistance mutations were detected in 4 samples with the resistance rate as 6.25%. Minor mutation in PR region such as M361/V, L63P and H69K appeared frequently and the rates were 81.25%, 70.31% and 65.63% respectively. The predominantly prevalent strains were seen as C/CRF07 _ BC/08 _ BC(65.63%, 42/64) in this study. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of genotypic drug resistances in HIV-1 recent infections in Dehong prefecture appeared to be at moderate level. Drug-resistance surveillance program among HIV-1 infections should be continued and strengthened.
