Biofilm formation in 92 unrelated strains of Acinetobacter baumannii isolated in a multicentre cohort study was investigated using a microtitre plate assay. Fifty-six (63%) isolates formed biofilm. These isolates were less frequently resistant to imipenem or ciprofloxacin than were non-biofilm-forming isolates (25% vs. 47%, p 0.04; and 66% vs. 94%, p 0.004, respectively). All catheter-related urinary or bloodstream infections and the sole case of shunt-related meningitis were caused by biofilm-forming strains. Multivariate analysis revealed that treatment in an intensive care unit, ciprofloxacin resistance and isolation from a respiratory sample were associated with non-biofilm-forming isolates, while previous aminoglycoside use was associated with biofilm-forming isolates.
