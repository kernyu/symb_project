Laboratory bioassays were conducted to determine the toxicity of four insecticides (ethyl parathion, chlorpyrifos, malathion, and carbofuran) to insecticide-susceptible and resistant populations of greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani). These bioassays were used to develop and validate a discriminating concentration for assessing insecticide resistance in greenbug populations in the field. Samples from wheat and sorghum in two states, Oklahoma and Kansas, indicated that insecticide resistance persists in greenbug populations over a large area at a low level.
