Tn501 random mutagenesis was applied to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild-type strain PAO1 to select for mutants hypersusceptible to aminoglycoside antimicrobial agents. One such mutant, called 19A, was found to be hypersusceptible to a wide range of antibiotics including aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, colistin, erythromycin, rifampin, and glycopeptides. Light microscopy of the mutant strain revealed abnormal morphology characterized by large, filamentous cells. The drug supersusceptibility of 19A was accompanied by loss of motility, reduced resistance to osmotic and heat shock stress, and impaired growth at low temperatures. The insertion site of the Tn501 transposon in mutant 19A has occurred in an open reading frame (PA5550 according to the PAO1 genome project), whose gene product shows amino acid sequence similarity to the DeoR family of transcriptional repressors. The gene, which we called glmR, is located between the glmS (PA5549) and glmU (PA5552) homologues of E. coli, responsible for the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-P, a precursor of both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan. We showed that GlmR represses the transcription of the adjacent glmS homologue (PA5549) in P. aeruginosa, possibly affecting the pool of precursors for peptidoglycan and LPS synthesis. To our knowledge GlmR is the first regulator in P. aeruginosa that affects susceptibility to a large variety of antibiotics and is therefore a potential target for novel anti-infective agents.
