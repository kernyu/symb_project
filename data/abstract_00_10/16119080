Antimicrobial proteins and peptides produced by bacteria, termed bacteriocins, are widely acknowledged to be important contributors to their producer organism survival. Enterocin A, enterocin B, enterocin P and enterolysin A belong to the best studied enterocins, i.e., bacteriocins produced by enterococci and streptococci. Twenty-one enterococcal and seven streptococcal isolates were analysed for bacteriocin-like activity production and resistance by overlay test. Up to 50% of tested strains showed antibacterial activity at least against one indicator strain. The occurrence of enterocin B structural gene in several isolates was confirmed by PCR method. The results of this study should broaden knowledge of bacteriocin-like activity production and resistance among gram-positive bacteria.
