We describe here a severe flare of hepatitis caused by lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus(HBV) in an HIV/HBV co-infected individual.Lamivudine-resistant HBV was detected 6 months before the development of severe hepatitis. Sequencing of the HBV genome isolated from the patients' serum did not identify compensatory mutations in the HBV polymerase that may have restored viral replication. However, a strong HBV-specific CD8 T-cell response was identified and may have resulted in the severe hepatitis.
