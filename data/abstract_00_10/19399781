The antibacterial and hemolytic activities of the amphiphilic helical, membrane-active, lipopeptaibol trichogin GA IV and its [Leu(11)-OMe] analogue were compared to those of the partially helical or non-helical 8-meric or 4-meric, C-terminal short sequences, respectively. The study on trichogin GA IV was extended to several methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Using a large set of enzymes, we also evaluated the resistance to proteolysis of all of the four peptides.
