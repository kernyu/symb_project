Platelet microbicidal proteins (PMPs) are small antimicrobial peptides secreted by mammalian platelets. In vitro resistance of Staphylococcus aureus strains to PMPs correlates with more extensive disease in experimental infective endocarditis (IE). To determine whether this same relationship exists in human S. aureus IE, we evaluated the in vitro PMP susceptibility phenotype of isolates from 58 prospectively-identified patients with definite S. aureus IE. On multivariate analyses, patients with S. aureus IE complicating an infected intravascular device were significantly more likely to have IE caused by a PMP-resistant strain (P=.0193). No correlations were detected between in vitro PMP resistance among S. aureus strains and the severity of human IE. This work supports the concept that in vitro PMP resistance in clinical S. aureus strains is associated with important clinical characteristics of S. aureus endovascular infections in vivo.
