Kluyvera Spp is an enterobacterium rarely isolated in medical microbiology, an opportunistic pathogen the clinical significance of which remains unclear. Four strains of Kluyvera Spp were isolated for the first time in the Ibn Rochd Teaching Hospital microbiology laboratory. These strains were isolated in hemocultures of four patients hospitalized in the same medical ward, at the same time, and presenting with bacteriemia. An antibiotic susceptibility study allowed identifying the wild phenotype in the first isolate, the three next isolates had acquired resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamycin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin, and produced broad-spectrum betalactamase. The epidemiological investigation in the patients' environment made after isolating the fourth strain was negative. The four patients evolved uneventfully without antibiotic treatment. This raises the question of the real pathogenic capacity of these strains, their epidemic power, and their ability to acquire resistance.
