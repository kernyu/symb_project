Widespread, inadequate and inappropriate treatment of gonococcal infections are facilitating antibiotic resistance in Jos Nigeria. We present an antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains in this study. Thirty-one strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were isolated by inoculating swabs onto prewarmed heated blood agar and Thayer Martins medium and incubated overnight at 35 to 37 degrees C. The isolates were then screened for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk diffusion method. About 93.6% were susceptible to azithromycin, 90.3% to ciprofloxacin, 87.1% to ceftriaxone, 80.7% and 64.3% to erythromycin and ofloxacin respectively. Less than half were each susceptible to spectinomycin (38.7%) and gentamicin (32.8%), while 12.9% and 4.6% were susceptible to tetracycline and penicillin respectively. These findings suggest that gentamicin, tetracycline and penicillin may not be recommended in this environment for treating gonococcal infections. Azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone are the suggested alternatives. Prompt diagnosis, treatment and indeed continued surveillance are hereby recommended for an effective management of gonococcal infections.
