We describe the identification of a variant of the "Rome clone" of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), responsible for an outbreak involving 5 patients in a Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit (CS-ICU) of a tertiary-care University Hospital in Rome. All strains isolated from patients and from nasal swabs obtained from four members of the CS-ICU personnel, belonged to the same identified clone. The characteristics of this clone were: (1) resistance to ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, rifampin, spectinomycin, and tetracycline; (2) vancomycin and teicoplanin MICs respectively of 2 and 4 mg/L; (3) heteroresistant subpopulations in the presence of 4 and 6 mg/L of vancomycin (10(-3) and 10(-5), respectively); (4) clonal type I::J::C determined following an established protocol (mec A::Tn 554 ::PFGE); (5) sequence type ST247 (3-3-1-12-4-4-16), obtained by multilocus sequence typing (MLST); and (6) the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCC) IA, obtained by multiplex PCR method. This new strain had different characteristics from the epidemic clone circulating in the same hospital from 1997 and designed "Rome clone," which was susceptible to erythromycin, clindamycin, and spectinomycin and belonged to the II::NH::C genetic background. A high genetic similarity between this Rome clone and the previously classified Archaic and Iberian clones was found, because they shared the same allelic profile (ST247), probably originating from the same S. aureus ancestor of the Iberian MRSA strains. Therefore, the strains responsible for the outbreak, with vancomycin MICs 2-4 mg/L, are variant clones, showing the genotype of the "Rome clone," the ST247 in association with SCC mec type IA (ST247-MRSA-IA), and are characterized by a uniform susceptibility to fosfomycin.
