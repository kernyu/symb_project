Imatinib mesylate binds to the inactive conformation of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, suppressing the Philadelphia chromosome-positive clone in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Clinical studies of imatinib have yielded impressive results in the treatment of all phases of CML. With the higher rates of complete cytogenetic response with imatinib, molecular monitoring of disease has become mandatory in assessing response and determining prognosis. The practical aspects of the treatment of CML with imatinib are discussed. The emergence of imatinib resistance, albeit in a small percentage of patients, has prompted an evaluation of innovative treatment strategies.
