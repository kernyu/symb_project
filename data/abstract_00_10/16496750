Steatosis and hepatitis C are two common liver diseases. Epidemiological and experimental data indicate that hepatitis C predisposes to non alcoholic fatty liver disease and the prevalence of coexistent hepatitis C and steatosis is two-three times higher than it would be expected if these were completely independent processes. Two conditions have been defined in course of hepatitis C: the "metabolic fat", characterized by a correlation between steatosis and metabolic alterations and the "viral fat", characterized by a direct action of HCV. Actually, "mixed forms" are often present. Up to today, most of the authors believe that the presence of steatosis accelerates the progression of fibrosis, and therefore the progression to cirrhosis, increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, and decreases the antiviral therapy response percentage. The treatment must associate the common antiviral therapy with all the measures fit for facing the metabolic problems, with particular reference to the antioxidant therapy.
