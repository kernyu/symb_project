Adherence factors and enterotoxins are major virulence factors of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Antibiotics have been used frequently for the treatment and prevention of ETEC infection in piggeries worldwide, including Korea. Therefore, data on both virulence profiles and antibiotic resistance patterns are useful in the epidemiological study of ETEC. A total number of 198 E. coli field isolates were examined. The most prevalent pathotype was F1, followed by a combination of F1 and EAST1. All of the 71 isolates were resistant to more than 2 antibiotics used in a disk diffusion test, and 87.94% of the isolates were found to be resistant to more than 4 antibiotics. Investigations were also conducted to correlate the virulence gene profiles with antibiogram and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Although a high degree of polymorphism was noted among strains having the same virulence patterns, the highest similarity pattern was observed carrying the same virulence profiles and similar antibiogram. Thus, investigation of both virulence profiles and antibiogram is essential to the epidemiological study of ETEC. Moreover, the PFGE method might be applicable as a tool to reveal genetic relatedness among E. coli strains from piggeries in Korea.
