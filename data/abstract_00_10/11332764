Novel fluorescent analogs of penicillin V were synthesized and evaluated for efficacy in the detection of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). These molecules include the full structure of penicillin V, with the potent Bodipy fluorophore attached to the para-position of the penicillin V phenyl group. The green fluorescent Bocillin FL and the near-infrared (IR) fluorescent Bocillin 650/665 probes were shown to bind to PBPs, both purified and from membrane preparations, with high affinity and specificity. These reagents allow for facile detection of 2-4 ng of purified PBP with the aid of a fluorescent scanner.
