The objectives of the study were to investigate the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the persistent Salmonella Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) isolates in two integrated broiler chicken operations, with attention focused mainly on the epidemiological approach. In the distribution of virulence genes, Salmonella enterotoxin (stn), invading host cell (invA), and Salmonella plasmid virulence (spvC) genes were widely distributed among the S. Enteritidis irrespective of their source of isolation, and Salmonella fimbrial (sefC) and plasmid encoded fimbrial (pef) genes were present in 28 and 20 S. Enteritidis strains, respectively. A total of 5 different XbaI-PFGE types were obtained from 31 S. Enteritidis isolates. Twenty-one types were divided on the basis their PFGE pattern, phage type and antimicrobial resistance pattern determined. There was a significant difference in phenotypic and genotypic characterization by two integrated broiler operations. Also, 8 isolates shown susceptible to all antimicrobials and 11 isolates with resistance to nalidixic acid were partly classified by XbaI PFGE pattern and by the phage type.
