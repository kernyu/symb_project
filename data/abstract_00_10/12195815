During the last few years, antibiotic multiresistance has been increasing, not only in hospitals, but also, more worryingly, in general medicine. Different ways are being explored to bypass this problem. RNA-acting antibiotics such as aminosides (aminoglycosides) bind to bacterial RNA causing premature termination of proteins and mistranslation in bacteria. It is now possible to study the interactions of such antibiotics with their target by in-vitro selection of RNA molecules that recognize these antibiotics (RNA aptamers, SELEX method). The knowledge of the antibiotic-RNA interactions represents a promising way for the rational design of new bioactive compounds less susceptible to bacterial resistance.
