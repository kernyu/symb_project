Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported to be a leading cause ofnosocomial infections. Resistance of this notorious bacterium to commonly used antimicrobial agents is becoming an increasing clinical problem and a recognized public health threat because there are limited number of antimicrobial agents including the antipseudomonal penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones with reliable activity against it. This study was therefore carried out, using Bauer-Kirby method, to determine the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from in-patients and out-patients attending the University College Hospital, Ibadan in Nigeria between June 2004 and May 2006. The isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in clinical specimens was found to be 16.8% with the highest occurrence of 41.9% in ear swab followed by 39.3% occurrence in wound swab. The susceptibility pattern showed that 78.3% were sensitive to amikacin and 72.0% to ciprofloxacin. The isolates from the in-patients showed higher resistance to all the antibiotics tested than the isolates from the out-patients, most especially amikacin and ciprofloxacin. However, no consistent antibiotic susceptibility pattern could be established for this pathogenic bacterium based on sources. In conclusion, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa species harboured by in-patients showed higher rates of antibiotic resistance than those of the out-patients. Also amikacin and ciprofloxacin were the two antibiotics found to be most potent against this pathogen.
