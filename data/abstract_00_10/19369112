The recognition of plant pathogens activates local defense responses and triggers a long-lasting systemic acquired resistance (SAR) response. Activation of SAR requires the hormone salicylic acid (SA), which induces SA-responsive gene expression. Recent data link changes in gene expression to chromatin remodeling, such as histone modifications and histone replacement. Here, we propose a model in which recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes to SA-responsive loci controls their basal and SA-induced expression. Basal repression of these loci requires the post-translational modifier SUMO (SMALL UBIQUITIN-LIKE MODIFIER). This is of particular relevance because SUMO conjugation has been shown to control the activity, assembly and disassembly of chromatin-modifying complexes to transcription complexes. Chromatin remodeling could be instrumental for priming of SA-responsive loci to enable their enhanced reactivation upon subsequent pathogen attack.
