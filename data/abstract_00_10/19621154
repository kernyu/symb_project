The objective of this multicenter study was to determine tigecycline susceptibility rates, measured by agar diffusion, in nine hospitals in Santiago and to compare these rates with other antimicrobials. Each center studied 20 strains per month. All intermediate and fully resistant strains as well as 10% of susceptibile strains were also studied by the broth microdilution method. Overall, 2301 strains were studied displaying the following susceptibility rates for tigecycline: 100% for Streptococcus sp, Enterococcus sp, and E. coli respectively, 99.8% for Staphylococcus sp, 93% for Klebsiella and 80% for Acinetobacter baumarmii. For Proteus, Providencia and Morganella the susceptibility rates were 4%. For cefotaxime-resistant Klebsiella and imipenem-resistant A. baumarmii susceptibility rates were 95% and 80% respectively. The agar diffusion and broth dilution method were 100% concordant for tigecycline susceptible strains but only 27% for resistant or intermediate strains represented mostly by Acinetobacter baumannii. The majority of these strains (57/59) proved to be susceptible after retesting. The great majority (96,6%) of strains tested from nine Chilean hospitals proved to be susceptible to tigecycline with exception for Proteus, Providencia and Morganella (66% resistance). Using the agar diffusion method for measuring tigecycline susceptibility to A. baumannii may be misleading.
