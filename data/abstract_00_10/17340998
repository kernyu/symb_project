The aim of the study was evaluation of susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from patients hospitalized in different wards of Rydygier's Hospital in Krakow in 2005. Bacteria were identified on the basis of typical morphology confirmed by Gram-staining microscopy and by biochemical tests--ID 32 GN strips using ATB system (bioMerieux, France). The susceptibility of all isolates to a panel of antimicrobial agents was performed using disk diffusion method. The highest in vitro activity against clinical strains demonstrated ceftazidime (88.6% of susceptible strains) while the lowest in vitro activity against clinical strains demonstrated imipenem (50.4% of susceptible strains). It was also observed that 40.2%(53) of strains were resistant to meropenem and imipenem. Carbapenem resistant P aeruginosa strains were tested for MBL production. We performed disk synergy test for MBL detection with EDTA, 2-MPA and ceftazidime, imipenem. The presence of a distorted inhibition zone was interpreted as a positive result for MBL production. Positive results of disk synergy tests were confirmed by Etest MBL strips. Metalo-beta-lactamases were detected in 13 isolates resistant to carbapenems.
