The manganese peroxidase produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which catalyzes the oxidation of Mn(2+) to Mn(3+), is easily inactivated by the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) presented in the reaction. We attempted to increase H2O2 resistance by the conformational stabilization around the H2O2-binding pocket. Based on its structural model, engineering of oxidizable Met273 located near the pocket to a non-oxidizable Leu showed a great improvement. Furthermore, after treatment at 1 mM H2O2 where the wild-type is completely inactivated, full activity can be retained by engineering the Asn81, which might have conformational changes due to the environment of the pocket, to a non-bulky and non-oxidizable Ser.
