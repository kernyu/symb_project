Antimicrobials used as growth promotion agents in the livestock and poultry industries appear to result in the spread of drug-resistant pathogens to humans such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci, fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter jejuni, and multidrug-resistant strains of Salmonella enterica. We present some epidemiologic evidence supporting this link and suggest that the use of antimicrobial agents for nontherapeutic purposes in food animals should be severely limited, if not banned altogether.
