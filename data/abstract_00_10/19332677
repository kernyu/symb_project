This multinational study from Asia revealed that reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.125 to 1 microg/ml) in nontyphoid Salmonella isolates was common in Taiwan (48.1%) and Thailand (46.2%) and in S. enterica serotype Choleraesuis (68.8%) and S. Virchow (75.0%) from all countries. Reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC, 2 to 8 microg/ml) remained uncommon in Asia, except in Taiwan (38.0%) or in S. Typhimurium (25.0%) from all countries.
