Interferon-alpha was detected in IFN pool produced by human leukocytes in the presence of gamma-globulin fraction proteins, copper and zinc cations, and metal-modified gamma-globulins. The cytokine appeared in culture medium at early terms (24 h) of incubation, is characterized by acid resistance, and is neutralized by antibodies to IFN-alpha. The content of IFN-alpha in supernatants of induced leukocytes reached 60-90 pg/ml and correlated with antiviral activity of the samples. Zinc bound to human serum gamma-globulin attenuated and copper stimulated the realization of IFN-inducing characteristics of the protein at early terms of incubation.
