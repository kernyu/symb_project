Resistance to 13 antimicrobial agents, resistance to the bactericidal activity of human serum, hydrophobic properties, lipolytic activity and production of histamine were determined in a total of 50 clinical Acinetobacter spp. strains (A. baumannii, A. lwoffii, A. calcoaceticus, A. haemolyticus). None of the tested isolates showed resistance to meropenem and none of A. lwoffii, A. calcoaceticus and A. haemolyticus strains were resistant to amikacin. Forty-six strains (92%) manifested resistance to ampicillin, 90% to cefuroxime, 68% to ciprofloxacin, 58% to piperacillin, gentamicin and cotrimaxazole, 50% to cefotaxime, 44% to amikacin, 42% to ceftazidime, 38% to piperacillin/tazobactam, 24% to netilmicin and 16% to ampicillin/sulbactam. In particular, A. baumannii and A. calcoaceticus strains showed considerable antibiotic resistance. Thirty-one isolates (62%) showed serum resistance; intermediate sensitivity was found in 19 isolates (38%). The majority of the strains (72%) demonstrated a strongly hydrophobic character; 16% of isolates exhibited moderate hydrophobic properties. All strains showed lipolytic activity; production of histamine was detected in 14 of 43 strains examined.
