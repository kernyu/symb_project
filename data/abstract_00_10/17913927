A fully automated commercial antifungal susceptibility test system (VITEK 2; bioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) was compared in three different laboratories with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the NCCLS) reference broth microdilution method (BMD) by testing 2 quality control strains, 10 reproducibility strains, and 426 isolates of Candida spp. against amphotericin B, flucytosine, and voriconazole. Reference BMD MIC endpoints were established after 24 and 48 h of incubation. VITEK 2 system MIC endpoints were determined spectrophotometrically after 9.1 to 27.1 h of incubation (mean, 12 to 14 h). Excellent essential agreement (within 2 dilutions) between the VITEK 2 system and the 24- and 48-h BMD MICs was observed for all three antifungal agents: amphotericin B, 99.1% and 97%, respectively; flucytosine, 99.1% and 98.8%, respectively; and voriconazole, 96.7% and 96%, respectively. Both intra- and interlaboratory agreements were >98% for all three drugs. The overall categorical agreements between the VITEK 2 system and BMD for flucytosine and voriconazole were 98.1 to 98.6% at the 24-h BMD time point and 96.9 to 97.4% at the 48-h BMD time point. The VITEK 2 system reliably detected flucytosine and voriconazole resistance among Candida spp. and demonstrated excellent quantitative and qualitative agreement with the reference BMD method.
