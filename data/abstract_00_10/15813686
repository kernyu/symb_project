Numerous species of filamentous fungi were isolated from lemon on different plantations in the province of Tucuman, Argentina. The techniques suggested by the Subcommittee of Antifungal Susceptibility of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, (USA) were adapted. The effect of three different concentrations of the fungicides imazalil, guazatine, SOPP and thiabendazole on the fungi Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium moniliforme, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus clavatus, Geotrichum candidum, Rhizopus sp, Penicillium sp, Penicillium digitatum and Mucor sp were studied. All the tested strains were resistant to thiabendazole. We assayed a mixture of SOPP (5%), guazatine (350 ppm) and imazalil (100 ppm), which showed a synergic effect on Rhizopus sp. Mucor sp was the only fungus resistant to the four fungicides tested as well as to the above mentioned mixture.
