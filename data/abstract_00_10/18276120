Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) form a substantial clinical and financial burden, with the increasing complication of antimicrobial resistance. This resistance may compromise the use of many empirically prescribed antimicrobials. The new respiratory fluoroquinolones have been developed to overcome this burgeoning resistance. This group includes gemifloxacin, an enhanced-affinity fluoroquinolone that has been approved for clinical use in several countries and is characterised as a potent dual-acting agent with excellent in vitro activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains (MIC90)=0.03-0.06 microg/mL). Gemifloxacin given once daily for 5-7 days has been shown to be non-inferior to, or in some instances superior to, comparator agents for the treatment of common lower RTIs. Moreover, it is generally well tolerated and is as safe as many frequently empirically prescribed antimicrobials. In addition, studies have shown gemifloxacin to be a cost-effective agent for some lower RTIs.
