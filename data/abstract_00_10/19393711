This study monitors the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) in hospitalized children up to 60 months of age before (February 2001-October 2004) and after (November 2004-January 2007) the introduction of a national risk group immunization program with "Prevenar" in Austria. The IPD incidence rates, per 100,000, for IPD were 7.6 before and 6.4 after the risk group immunization program, while there was a significant reduction (p<0.05) for meningitis, 3.1 before and 1.6 after. Overall, the most commonly observed serotypes were 14 (34.2%), 6B (11.7%), and 23F (6.7%). 71.7% of the identified strains were vaccine types; 12.5% were vaccine-related serotypes. No clinically relevant changes in the incidence rate of IPDs or shift/replacement of serotypes was documented. Antimicrobial resistance predominated against erythromycin (32.5%) and clarithromycin (26.7%). Our data show that this risk group vaccination program had no impact on the incidence of IPD in young children.
