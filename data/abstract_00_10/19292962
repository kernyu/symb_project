OBJECTIVE: To investigate the resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) to antimicrobial agents in adolescents. METHODS: One hundred and eight adolescents (6-18 years old) underwent a gastroscopy examination. H. pylori strains were isolated from gastric mucosa. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by means of Kirby-Baner. RESULTS: Thirty-six H. pylori strains were identified. The resistant rate of H. pylori strains to clarithromycin, fruranzolidone and amoxicillin was 8.3%, 16.7% and 33.3%, respectively. H. pylori strains showed a high resistance to metronidazole (94.4%), while no strain was resistant to gentamicin and levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: The H. pylori strains from the adolescents in Zhejiang showed a high resistance to metronidazole and amoxicillin but a low resistance to clarithromycin and fruranzolidone. All of H. pylori strains were susceptive to gentamicin and levofloxacin.
