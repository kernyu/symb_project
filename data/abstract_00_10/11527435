Experimental infection of BALB/c- or C57BL/6-gamma-interferon-knockout (GKO) mice with Cryptosporidium parvum results in infection in both strains with different outcomes of disease. The BALB/c-GKO mice recover from infection, whereas the C57BL/6-GKO mice succumb to infection in less than 2 weeks. Differences in cytokine mRNA expression suggested that recovery may involve other cytokines. To determine whether the addition of either a Th1 or Th2 cytokine could alter the outcome of infection, we treated GKO mice with either recombinant (r)IL-4 or rIL-12 1 day before infection (DBI) or daily. No effect on the oocyst shedding patterns in either strain nor an increase in survival of the C57BL/6-GKO mice was observed in the rIL-4-treated mice. Whereas one dose of 0.5 microg rIL-12 given 1 DBI had no effect on oocyst shedding, we found that daily doses of rIL-12 administered intraperitoneally exacerbated C. parvum infection in both animal models. Administration of rIL-12 shortened the survival time in the C57BL/6-GKO mice and prevented BALB/c-GKO mice from recovering from infection. Specific proliferation of T cells to cryptosporidial antigen and Th1 and Th2 mRNA cytokine expression was markedly decreased in rIL-12-treated mice. Nitric oxide (NO) may have played a minor role in the decreased proliferation observed since levels of NO present in the splenocyte cultures from rIL-12-treated mice in response to parasite antigen stimulation were higher than those observed in controls. Thus, we propose that resistance to and recovery from C. parvum infections involves a fine balance in the amount and timing of Th1 and Th2 cytokines.
