At this time, many antibiotics have decreased activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major agent of infectious disease. In this study, we evaluated antibiotic susceptibility and serogroups of strains isolated from bacteraemia, meningitis and acute otitis media in adults and children over the 1997-2003 period in Brittany, France. In 2003, 62% of the isolates were not susceptible to penicillin and 11% were fully resistant. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance was 63%. Resistance rates were higher among isolates recovered from children than adults. Serogroups 19 and 14 were the most frequently isolated, especially the 19 one among children. The emergence of this serogroup might be a consequence of the use of heptavalent conjugate vaccine introduced in 2001 in France. Future surveillance after vaccination will be needed to detect emerging serogroups and resistance among S. pneumoniae.
