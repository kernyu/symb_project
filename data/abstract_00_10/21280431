BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality among children in the developing world Antibiotic resistance is increasing. Knowledge of pathogens causing infection in pediatrics patients is essential for devising management strategies. OBJECTIVES: To assess the bacteriologic profile and the resistance pattern of clinical isolates from pediatric patients in Gondar University Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was done on different clinical specimens that were submitted and processed for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing during a period of September 2000 and October 2007. RESULTS: A total of 823 bacterial pathogens were isolated from 7886 different clinical specimens. The overall culture positivity rate was 10.4%. The three most frequent isolates were S. aureus (30%), E. coli (16.5%) and Shigella spp. (11.7%). All isolates showed intermediate level of resistance (60-80%) to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline. Low level of resistance (< 60%) observed to chloramphenicol, gentamicin, penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Majority of the isolates (80.3%) showed multiple drug resistance (resistance to two or more drugs). In general ciprofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective drugs against the tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: This study shows resistance to the commonly accessible and affordable drugs has been observed in most bacterial pathogens. The detection of multi drug resistant isolates may further limit therapeutic options. Timely microbiologic surveillance and assessment of antimicrobial resistance is important for dealing with pediatric infections.
