One hundred and ninety-three isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were tested against oxacillin by agar dilution, disk diffusion, and Vitek (GPS-105 card), and the presence of the mecA gene determined by multiplex PCR. The results obtained by all testing methods were in agreement for 190 isolates. Two mecA-negative isolates (S. lugdunensis and S. haemolyticus) had MICs of < or = 0.25 microg/ml by agar dilution and Vitek but were resistant by disk diffusion. One mecA-positive isolate was resistant by Vitek and disk diffusion but had an agar dilution MIC of < or = 0.25 microg/ml. For the species of CoNS tested, oxacillin susceptibility results obtained with the Vitek GPS-105 card and disk diffusion correlated well with results obtained by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards agar dilution and with the presence of the mecA gene.
