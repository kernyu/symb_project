BACKGROUND/AIMS: In order to prevent the occurrence of drug-resistant mutants associated with treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, combination therapy is being developed. To determine the efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) plus emtricitabine (FTC) combination therapy in chronic HBV infection. METHODS: Thirty treatment-nai ve, HBeAg-positive patients were randomized to combination ADV plus FTC (n=14) or ADV plus placebo monotherapy (n=16) for 96 weeks. HBV DNA was measured by polymerase chain reaction. Treatment was stopped in those with HBeAg seroconversion. RESULTS: The median decrease in HBV DNA at week 96 was higher in the combination group (-5.30 vs. -3.98 log(10)copies/ml, p=0.05). More patients in the combination group had normalization of alanine aminotransaminase and HBV DNA<300 copies/ml at week 96 when compared with the monotherapy group [11 of the 14 patients (78.6%) vs. 6 of the 16 patients (37.5%), p=0.03]. However, HBeAg seroconversion at week 96 was similar in the 2 groups [2/14 (14.3%) vs. 4/16 (25.0%), p=NS]. No ADV or FTC resistance was detected at week 96. In those with HBeAg seroconversion, 50.0% had post-treatment relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Combination ADV plus FTC resulted in more potent suppression of HBV DNA over 96 weeks of therapy.
