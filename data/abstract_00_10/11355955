Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine) is used for topical treatment of breast cancers. It has been shown previously that a high percentage of breast carcinomas express MDR1 or MRP. We investigated the sensitivity of MDR1 -expressing cells to treatment with miltefosine. We show that cells overexpressing MDR1 (NCI/ADR-RES, KB-8-5, KB-C1, CCRF/VCR1000, CCRF/ADR5000) were less sensitive to miltefosine treatment when compared to the sensitive parental cell lines. HeLa cells transfected with MDR1 exhibited resistance to the compound, indicating that expression of this gene is sufficient to reduce the sensitivity to miltefosine. The resistance of MDR1-expressing cells to miltefosine was less pronounced than that to adriamycin or vinblastine. Expression of MDR2 did not correlate with the resistance to miltefosine. As shown by a fluorescence quenching assay using MIANS-labelled P-glycoprotein (PGP), miltefosine bound to PGP with a K(d)of approximately 7 microM and inhibited PGP-ATPase activity with an IC(50)of approximately 35 microM. Verapamil was not able to reverse the resistance to miltefosine. Concentrations of miltefosine up to approximately 60 microM stimulated, whereas higher concentrations inhibited the transport of [3H]-colchicine with an IC(50)of approximately 297 microM. Binding studies indicated that miltefosine seems to interact with the transmembrane domain and not the cytosolic nucleotide-binding domain of PGP. These data indicate that expression of MDR1 may reduce the response to miltefosine in patients and that this compound interacts with PGP in a manner different from a number of other substrates.
