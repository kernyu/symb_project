OBJECTIVE: To isolate and identify a new protein involved in drug-resistance from culture supernatants of isoniazid (INH)-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: Bovine albumin of Middlebrook 7H10 culture supernatants of INH-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis was removed using diethylamine ethylcellulose affinitive gel chromatography. A specific protein from culture supernatants of three INH-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was separated reproducibly by high performance liquid chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, and identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). RESULTS: The protein was trehalose-phosphate phosphatase involved in the biosynthesis of trehalose of cell wall, molecular a eight 46000, isoelectric point 5.3. It could be detected repeatedly from supernatants of three INH resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. CONCLUSION: Trehalose-phosphate phosphatase represents an excellent potential target site for chemotherapy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a new marker in the detection of drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
