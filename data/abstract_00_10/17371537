In total, 172 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were tested for susceptibility to colistin by agar dilution, Etest and the Vitek 2 system. Isolates with a colistin MIC < or =2 mg/L were considered to be susceptible. Fifty-four (31%) Gram-negative isolates were resistant to colistin. Categorical agreement between agar dilution and Etest was 87%, and between agar dilution and Vitek 2 was 82%. Based on the data obtained, the Vitek 2 system was unreliable for detecting colistin resistance, and results obtained by Etest may require confirmation by a standard MIC susceptibility testing method.
