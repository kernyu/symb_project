The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and endotoxin in soil after land application of biosolids. Soil was collected over a 15 month period following land application of biosolids, and antibiotic resistance was ascertained using clinically relevant antibiotic concentrations. Ampicillin, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline resistance were all monitored separately for any changes throughout the 15 month period. Endotoxin soil concentrations were monitored using commercially available endotoxin analysis reagents. Overall, land application of biosolids did not increase the percentage of antibiotic-resistant culturable bacteria above background soil levels. Likewise, land application of biosolids did not significantly increase the concentration of endotoxin in soil. This study determined and established a baseline understanding of the overall effect that land application of biosolids had on the land-applied field with respect to antibiotic-resistant bacterial and endotoxin soil densities.
