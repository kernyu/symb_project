The prevalence of 31 virulence factors was analyzed among nalidixic acid-susceptible and -resistant Escherichia coli strains from phylogenetic group B2. Hemolysin, cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, and S and F1C fimbriae genes were less prevalent among nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli strains. Quinolone resistance may be associated with a decrease in the presence of some virulence factors.
