Campylobacter are a leading cause of human diarrhea. The usual source of infection is contaminated food, particularly poultry but pork has also been described. The veterinary use of antimicrobial drugs has been suggested to be largely responsible for resistance in human isolates of this zoonotic pathogen. A study was carried out to investigate the occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter isolated from French fattening pigs. From March 1998 to June 1999, stomach samples were collected at slaughter from 240 fattening pigs originating from 24 different farms. Half of the pigs were found to be positive for Campylobacter but considerable variation was observed between farms. Isolates all belong to the Campylobacter coli species. Susceptibilities of the strains were determined for five antimicrobial drugs using agar dilution. Resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin was high (79 and 55%, respectively). For nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin and ampicillin, resistance was observed in 34, 15 and 20% of the isolates, respectively. More than one-third of the strains was resistant to at least three antimicrobial drugs. A Thr86Ile modification in GyrA was observed in the enrofloxacin-resistant strains studied. The multiresistant strains analyzed expressed the multidrug transporter CmeB at a high level. Results indicated a high prevalence of C. coli in the stomach of the French pigs examined. In addition, a high proportion of the strains was resistant to antimicrobial drugs, particularly to tetracycline and erythromycin, or were multiresistant.
