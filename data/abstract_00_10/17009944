The epidemiology and treatment approach to bacterial meningitis has changed dramatically since the advent of antimicrobial therapy. New vaccines against meningeal pathogens have been implemented into national immunization programs successfully around the world. Antibiotic resistance has had a considerable impact on the efficacy of several therapeutic agents. In this review, the authors will discuss the principles of antibiotic chemotherapy, focusing on new agents for the treatment of penicillin-resistant pneumococci and adjunctive treatments to reduce the inflammatory response to bacterial infection of the meninges.
