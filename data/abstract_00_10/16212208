We investigated antimicrobial resistance patterns and plasmid profiles of uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates from inpatients and outpatients at Jordan University Hospital in 2000 and 2001. E. coli accounted for 32.4% and 37.4% of all isolates respectively. The lowest susceptibility was for ampicillin (11%), cotrimoxazole (23%) and tetracycline (26%). The relative incidence of resistant isolates of E. coli to nalidixic acid, gentamicin, norfloxacin, cefuroxime and nitrofurantoin was significantly greater for inpatients than for outpatients (P< 0.05). A large, transferable R-plasmid of 28 kb was found in most E. coli isolates (67%) that were resistant to at least ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and tetracycline. This R-plasmid reservoir may contribute to the spread of multiple antibiotic resistance in our Region.
