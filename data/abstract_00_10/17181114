BACKGROUND: Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a common medical problem affecting a large percentage of the population. The disease will most often follow a viral upper respiratory tract infection. METHODS: Appropriately diagnosed, ABRS is best treated with antibiotics, but other medications may play a role in some circumstances. Increasing antibiotic resistance to the common bacteria causing ABRS has occurred in the past 20 years, driven largely by inappropriate or unnecessary antibiotic use. RESULTS: There are many antibiotics available that may be used for the treatment of ABRS. The selection of the best antibiotic option is determined by evaluating a number of factors, with the potential antibiotic resistance being an important consideration. CONCLUSION: This article reviews current recommendations for the antibiotic treatment of ABRS.
