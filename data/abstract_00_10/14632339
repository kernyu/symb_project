AIM: To evaluate the effect of a change in antibiotic protocol on pathogens that cause neonatal sepsis. METHODS: Suspected sepsis was treated with amikacin together with ceftazidime in 1995-1998 and piperacillin/tazobactam in 1999-2002. RESULTS: The annual rate for Klebsiella sepsis fell from 2.5 to 0.45 cases per 1000 admission days (p = 0.0001) between the two periods studied. CONCLUSION: The change from ceftazidime to piperacillin/tazobactam is associated with a decrease in the incidence of Klebsiella sepsis.
