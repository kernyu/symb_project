A large international collection of Streptococcus pneumoniae (21605 strains) was analyzed to determine the comparative activity of selected oral (cefuroxime and cefpodoxime) and parenteral (ceftriaxone and cefepime) cephalosporins when tested against different antimicrobial resistance phenotypes including penicillin-resistant strains and strains displaying additional resistances to other agents (erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). The multidrug-resistant (MDR) rate ranged from 17.6% (penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant only) to 5.7% (resistance to all 5 drugs). The parenteral cephalosporins retained wider activity for all MDR phenotypes studied with the resistance rates (minimum inhibitory concentration > or = 4 mug/mL) being lower for cefepime (1.3-1.9%) when compared with ceftriaxone (3.0-4.4%) or the orally administered cephalosporins, cefpodoxime (64.4-74.1%), and cefuroxime (69.3-79.1%). Our findings confirm that the parenteral cephalosporins, cefepime, and ceftriaxone possess significant activity against those MDR pneumococci responsible for an increasing number of serious respiratory tract infections.
