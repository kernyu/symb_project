We studied the antimicrobial susceptibility of 322 Streptococcus pyogenes throat isolates from French children and their serotype and genomic diversity. A total of 22.4% were erythromycin resistant, and 69.4, 4.2, and 26.4% of these isolates harbored ermB, ermA, and mefA, respectively. Increasing resistance in France is mainly associated with a few emm type 28 clones.
