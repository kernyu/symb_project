The paper gives the results of a demonstration project to introduce a test for drug sensitivity to second-line antituberculous agents for patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis at a routine large Russian laboratory. Two hundred and thirty MDR isolates were examined; of them 8.7% had extreme drug resistance. The cost of this test was estimated to be US $ 33.4. The introduction of this test is possible and essential for the precise and timely choice of antituberculous therapy for patients with MDR tuberculosis.
