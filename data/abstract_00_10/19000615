We investigated the formation of biofilms by 3 type strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus fructivorans, as representatives of LAB that cause food deterioration or contamination. Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum JCM1149 and Lactobacillus brevis JCM1059 appeared to adhere and accumulate on glass cover slips. Lactobacillus fructivorans JCM1117 cells made thin cellophane-like biofilms, and most of the biofilm cells became longer than the planktonic cells. We tested the resistance of biofilm and planktonic L. plantarum subsp. plantarum JCM1149 cells to acetic acid and ethanol, which strongly inhibit the growth of bacteria and are important in food preservation. The biofilm cells were more resistant than the planktonic cells and the surfaces of the treated planktonic cells were badly damaged, whereas those of the biofilm cells were only slightly damaged. We isolated 43 LAB from onions and the biofolm cells of an isolate, L. plantarum M606 also had high resistance. These results demonstrate the significance of studying biofilms of LAB in the food industry.
