In recent years, novel antiretroviral drugs have become available for multi-experienced HIV-infected patients with limited options. We enrolled seven advanced HIV-patients, failing multiple previous HAART regimens, in virological failure on their current HAART regimen and showing recent clinical and immunological progression. All patients were prescribed a double-boosted tipranavir plus enfuvirtide based regimen, in addition to zidovudine, tenofovir and lamivudine for salvage therapy. To assess susceptibility to tipranavir, the tipranavir genotypic resistance score was calculated and two years later this was re-evaluated on an updated tipranavir genotypic score algorithm. At baseline, CD4 were 139/mcL (more or less 145), HIV-1 RNA was 822,700 cp/mL. All patients achieved HIV-1 RNA levels less than 400 cp/mL between 12 weeks and 24 weeks of observation; two reached less than 50 cp/mL during this period. At 48 weeks three patients had reached less than 50 cp/mL; three other patients had HIV RNA less than 200 cp/mL. At 72 and 96 weeks HIV viraemia was less than 50 cp/mL in six patients; CD4 T-cell counts 285/mcL (more o less 198). No AIDS-defining events were recorded. Adverse events did not need to stop or change HAART. Strong 3 NRTI backbone could help efficacy and durability, and frequent evaluations in complex patients can help to manage toxicity.
