Medical care of HIV-infected patients has been greatly improved during the last four years with the combination of new highly active drugs and routine monitoring of plasma viral load. Three-drugs regimens including a protease inhibitor are the recommended treatments. The objective is the suppression of viral load below detectable levels and the correction of immune deficit. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can be used in new therapeutic regimens. To ameliorate efficacy of the antiretroviral treatment and to avoid viral resistance, the tolerance and the ability to adhere are an important challenge.
