The chemistry, microbiology and mode of action of teicoplanin, as well as the mechanism, control and epidemiology of glycopeptide resistance, are discussed in detail. The antibacterial activity of teicoplanin against Gram-positive bacteria, including those expressing resistance to unrelated compounds, is similar to that of vancomycin but with increased potency, particularly against Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp. Some strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp, particularly S. haemolytieus, are less susceptible to teicoplanin than to vancomycin. Teicoplanin is active against vancomycin resistance caused by VanB and VanC, but is not active against VanA resistant strains. The epidemiology of GISA and VISA strains of S. aureus is, as yet, poorly understood with more work necessary to elucidate the sequence of events leading to their evolution. Despite the increasing importance of glycopeptide resistance, teicoplanin has proved its clinical worth and continues to have important potential in the treatment of life-threatening Gram-positive sepsis.
