Oxacillin susceptibility of coagulase negative staphylococci as assessed by conventional methods was confirmed by a modified Etest method, extended to detect heteroresistance. Verification of susceptibility was followed by successful treatment for six consecutive children with deep seated infections. Physicians' trust in such a validated method will contribute to the appropriate use of antibiotics.
