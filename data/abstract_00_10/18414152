Multidrug-resistant viridans group streptococcus (MDRVS) strains have emerged as important pathogens. Treatment of MDRVS infections is problematic. The use of fluoroquinolones for treatment of MDRVS osteomyelitis has not been established. We present the first case of MDRVS osteomyelitis of the mandible successfully treated with sequential intravenous then oral moxifloxacin, and review the literature on the subject.
