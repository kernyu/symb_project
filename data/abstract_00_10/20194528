Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a prominent infection in transplant recipients. The immunosuppressive drug mizoribine was shown to have anti-CMV activity in vitro and was reported to have an anti-CMV effect in renal transplantation. This study characterized the anti-CMV activity of mizoribine in vitro and its synergistic activity with ganciclovir. Mizoribine suppressed replication and at the EC(50) for plaque inhibition of 12.0 microg/ml. Mizoribine and ganciclovir exerted a strong synergism in anti-CMV activity. Mizoribine depletes guanosine nucleotides by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and may increase the ratio of ganciclovir to guanosine in treated cells, resulting in a strong synergistic augmentation of the anti-CMV activity of ganciclovir. Two clinical isolates with UL97 mutations were less susceptible to mizoribine than the Towne strain but were equally susceptible in the presence of guanine. Two mizoribine-resistant strains were isolated after culture for 3 months with 100 microg/ml mizoribine, but they were as sensitive to ganciclovir as the parent Towne strain. The anti-CMV activity of mizoribine was antagonized by 2'-deoxyguanosine. Mizoribine inhibited CMV replication directly, and the sequence of mizoribine-resistant mutants of UL97 and UL54 was identical to that of the parent Towne strain, indicating the different anti-CMV action from ganciclovir, foscarnet, and maribavir. Mizoribine as an immunosuppressive and anti-CMV drug in the clinical regimen was suggested to suppress replication of CMV in vivo and control CMV infection in transplant recipients in combination with ganciclovir.
