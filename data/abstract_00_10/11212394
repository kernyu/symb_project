During first 3 days after patient hospitalization with pneumonia or chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogens in sputum were studied according NCCLS standards (for 1999 year). Among 93 pathogens isolated in pneumonia the most frequent were S. pneumoniae (41.9%), H. influenzae (21.5%). Among 232 pathogens isolated in COPD the most frequent were S. pneumoniae (35.5%), H. influenzae (16.8%). Other pathogens were staphylococci, moraxella, gram-negative bacteria. No penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, were isolated, the strains with moderate penicillin resistance were less than 3% in both groups. Among H. influenzae isolated from patients with pneumonia 25% were beta-lactamase producers, from COPD patients 21% strains produced beta-lactamase. Totally among all studied pathogens only 58% were sensitive to ampicillin in pneumonia groups and 48% in COPD groups, for azithromycin 70.7% and 71% respectively, for cefuroxime 84.5% and 85% respectively. Ampicillin efficacy for empirical treatment of community-acquired low respiratory tract infections was substantially less than that of modern antibiotics.
