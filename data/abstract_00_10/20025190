In 1998 UNAIDS implemented the national drug access initiative (DAI) in Cote d'Ivoire. The Ivorian government took the DAI over in 2000 with the support of the Global Fund and Presidential Emergency Program For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The ensuing affordability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), medical staff training, and healthcare equipment allowed Ministry of Health to improve HIV care throughout the country. Since 2008 ART and follow-up monitoring have been free of charge for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). In January 2009 a total of 57,833 PLWHA received ART and follow-up at 274 HIV care centers. Use of ART has improved the life expectancy of PLWHA. However morbidity and mortality remained high during the first year of ART implementation with respective frequencies of 5-10% person-year (PY) and 2-3% PY. Morbidity was mainly related to infectious disease (tuberculosis and bacteriaemia) and earlier onset of adverse events (AE). In most cases ART has been well tolerated. The main adverse effects have been anemia, neuropathy, skin toxicity and liver enzyme elevation. The incidence of stage 3/4 AE has been low (< 2 %PY). Although overall compliance has been good (<80%), data among children and adults suggest the need for further work to reinforce support mechanisms. Convincing results have been obtained in the management of PLWHA. Nevertheless greater funding and commitment must be given to management of opportunistic infections and side effects and to development of nutrition support services.
