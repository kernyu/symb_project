Malarone (atovaquone-proguanil) is an effective drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria. However, first cases of resistance have been reported, which are associated with mutations at codon 268 of the parasite's cytochrome b gene. We report the first case of Malarone treatment failure from Central Africa.Drug concentration was well within curative range. Pre- and post-treatment Plasmodium falciparum isolates revealed codon 268 wild-type alleles, and no other mutations of the putative atovaquone-binding domain.These findings illustrate the spread of atovaquone-proguanil-resistance in Africa and question the usefulness of codon 268 as the only target for the surveillance of its emergence.
