The discovery in 1998 that triclosan has a site-specific action in the bacterial cell as an inhibitor of NADH- or NADPH-dependent enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase led to a lively debate in the scientific press. The thesis of this debate was that such a mode of action may allow triclosan to induce resistance and cross-resistance in bacterial cells. The debate last saw review in 2004, and this paper aims at updating our knowledge in this area, given recent research on the topic.
