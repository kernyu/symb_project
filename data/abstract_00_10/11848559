This study determined the prevalence of Salmonella on beef animal hides and carcasses and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles against a panel of 13 antibiotics. In each of the eight commercial packing facilities, of which five processed primarily heifers and steers and the remaining three processed primarily cows and bulls, hide and carcass sponge swab samples were obtained immediately before hide removal and before carcass chilling, respectively. Overall, prevalence of Salmonella on external surfaces (hides) of cattle was 15.4% (49 of 319), whereas prevalence after dehiding and other slaughtering/dressing processes, including the application of decontamination treatments, was, as expected, reduced (P < 0.05) to 1.3% (4 of 320) on carcass surfaces. From 53 total Salmonella-positive hide and carcass samples, 526 biochemically confirmed isolates were obtained to determine antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Of 53 Salmonella-positive samples, individually, 24 (45.3%), 17 (32.1%), 17 (32.1%), 11 (20.8%), 8 (15.1%), 8 (15.1%), 8 (15.1%), 4 (7.5%), and 2 (3.8%) samples yielded at least one isolate resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfonamides, ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively. None of the Salmonella-positive samples yielded an isolate resistant to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, or levofloxacin. Although none of the samples yielded an isolate simultaneously resistant to three or four antimicrobials, a total of eight samples yielded at least one isolate resistant to five or more antimicrobials tested. Included among the 18 group B-positive samples were three samples that, individually, yielded at least one Salmonella Typhimurium var. Copenhagen DT104 isolate resistant to at least six antimicrobials tested. Results from this study support current prudent therapeutic and subtherapeutic antimicrobial use recommendations.
