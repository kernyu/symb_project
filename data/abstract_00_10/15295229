A human immunodeficiency virus-infected boy with Scedosporium apiospermum otomastoiditis and a girl with diabetes mellitus and Mucor sinusitis and orbital cellulitis had life-threatening disease progression despite antifungal treatment. Interferon-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were added, with good functional outcome in both children. Adjunctive therapy with interferon-gamma, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor can be considered for refractory invasive fungal infections.
