We discuss two cases of abdominal candidiasis in critically ill patients with multiple organ failure and sepsis. Microbiological and clinical courses remained unresponsive to apparently appropriate antifungal therapy with azole or polyene derivatives. Both microbiological and clinical outcomes dramatically improved after starting caspofungin therapy. Lack of cross-resistance, lack of toxicity and potent fungicidal activity make caspofungin a very attractive drug in life threatening abdominal candidiasis. The optimal treatment of life threatening candidiasis remains a controversial issue. Because of recent advances in the field, we propose a critical review of the problem of refractory candidiasis.
