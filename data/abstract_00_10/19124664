Dalbavancin, a long-acting lipoglycopeptide, was evaluated against 81,673 isolates of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected from 33 countries during worldwide resistance surveillance (2002 to 2007). Regardless of susceptibility to oxacillin, comparable potencies for dalbavancin against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci from all countries were noted (MIC(90), 0.06 to 0.12 microg/ml). Vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus spp. had dalbavancin MIC(90)s comparable to those for staphylococci, whereas vancomycin-resistant strains were more resistant (MIC(50), >4 microg/ml). beta-Hemolytic and viridians group streptococci were very susceptible to dalbavancin (MIC(90), <or=0.03 microg/ml). Overall, dalbavancin was >or=16-fold more active than vancomycin against the monitored gram-positive species.
