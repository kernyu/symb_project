Antimicrobial resistance patterns and capsular groups of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRP; MIC penicillin G > or = 0.5 mg/ml) in Sweden between 1997 and 2003 were described, and trends in resistance and antibiotic sales during the same period were compared. The most common serogroups were in descending order 9, 19, 14, 23, and 6. Despite a low and stable annual PRP rate (proportion of PRP out of all pneumococci) of around 2% during the study period, the proportion of PRP resistant to other antibiotics increased. Of all tested PRP isolates, 82% were also resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 32% had additional resistance to tetracycline, and 26% to erythromycin. Antibiotic sales figures for all studied antibiotic subgroups decreased during the same period. Little correlation was found between antibiotic sales and PRP resistance rates, indicating that there are still other poorly defined factors contributing to the reported resistance levels in the population. However, although PRP strains in Sweden are becoming more commonly resistant to antibiotics other than beta-lactams, the low and further reduced antibiotic sales still might have delayed the development and rapid spread of PRP in the population.
