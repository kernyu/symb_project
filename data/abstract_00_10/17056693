Plantaricin 423 is a class IIa bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from sorghum beer. It has been previously determined that plantaricin 423 is encoded by a plasmid designated pPLA4, which is now completely sequenced. The plantaricin 423 operon shares high sequence similarity with the operons of coagulin, pediocin PA-1, and pediocin AcH, with small differences in the DNA sequence encoding the mature bacteriocin peptide and the immunity protein. Apart from the bacteriocin operon, no significant sequence similarity could be detected between the DNA or translated sequence of pPLA4 and the available DNA or translated sequences of the plasmids encoding pediocin AcH, pediocin PA-1, and coagulin, possibly indicating a different origin. In addition to the bacteriocin operon, sequence analysis of pPLA4 revealed the presence of two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a putative mobilization (Mob) protein that is homologous to the pMV158 superfamily of mobilization proteins. Highest sequence similarity occurred between this protein and the Mob protein of L. plantarum NCDO 1088. ORF2 encodes a putative replication protein that revealed low sequence similarity to replication proteins of plasmids pLME300 from Lactobacillus fermentum and pYIT356 from Lactobacillus casei. The immunity protein of plantaricin 423 contains 109 amino acids. Although plantaricin 423 shares high sequence similarity with the pediocin PA-1 operon, no cross-reactivity was recorded between the immunity proteins of plantaricin 423 and pediocin PA-1.
