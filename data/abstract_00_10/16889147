Spinal tuberculous abscesses usually respond to anti-tuberculous drugs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of surgical drainage after failure of first-line anti-tuberculous drugs. Patients with spinal instability or vertebral collapse were excluded from the study. The authors retrospectively reviewed 11 patients. The operation was successful in all patients. Anterior/posterior spinal fusion or curettage was not performed. Drains were removed after two to three days. None of the patients required a second operation. Complications, such as spinal instability, vertebral collapse, or death did not occur.
