The determination of the prevalence of primary resistance to antiretroviral therapy in different places of the world is of extreme importance in molecular epidemiology monitoring, and it can guide the initial patient therapy in a given geographical area. The frequency of drug resistance mutations (DRM) and the genetic variability of HIV-1 isolates from newly diagnosed HIV-infected pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics of the Lucrecia Paim and Augusto N'Gangula maternities, Luanda-Angola, were determined. Thirty five out of 57 samples (61.4%) were sequenced and one mutation associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected. Additionally, two mutations associated with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were also detected. No primary mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI) were found. Subtypes A1, C, D, F1, G, H, CRF 13, CRF 37, and other mosaics were detected.
