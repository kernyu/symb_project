Much controversy exists regarding the best diagnostic method for acute sinusitis, the efficacy of antibiotics, the best choice of antibiotics, the most appropriate duration of therapy, and the efficacy of ancillary measures and nasal corticosteroids. The therapeutic goal is to identify those children who are more likely to have bacterial sinusitis and unlikely to resolve spontaneously, who may require treatment with antibiotics. The inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms complicates further the management of these children. Acute sinusitis is expected to resolve spontaneously in most cases, including many cases of bacterial sinusitis. Antibiotics are needed only for a minority of non-self-resolving infections. Based on current resistance considerations, approximately 80% of bacterial infections are expected to respond to standard doses of amoxicillin. High-dose amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or other b-lactam antibiotics should be considered for children at high risk for carrying resistant organisms. Evidence for the effectiveness of ancillary measures is limited.
