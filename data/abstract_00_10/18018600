We report a case of pulmonary infection caused by Mycobacterium chelonae. The patient was a healthy breastfeeding 29 year-old female. An abnormal shadow had been pointed out by the chest X-ray in the regular checkup of the office workers. The chest X-ray film showed consolidation at right lower lung field, which initially suggested pulmonary tuberculosis. The chest CT scan showed scattered consolidation. Smears and cultures of the sputum were repeatedly positive for mycobacteria, which was identified as M. chelonae. By chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, and clarithromycin on the basis of susceptibility test, sputum converted to negative within 2 months, abnormal shadows on the roentgenogram and laboratory data showed improvement. There are no signs of recurrence after completion of the treatment for 12 months.
