UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to investigate the antibiotic resistance profile of 58 Gram negative bacilli strains (GNB): 36 non-fermentative GNB (NGNB), including 19 strains of Acinetobacter spp., 11 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 22 enterobacterial strains (14 strains of KEHSs, 6 belonging to the group Proteus-Providencia and 2 Escherichia coli) isolated from nasal, pharyngeal exudates and also from bronchial secretions, from immuno-depressed patients admitted in the Intensive Care Unit of Fundeni Clinical Institute. METHHODS: the antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI 2009 recommendations and the production of beta-lactamases was investigated by ESBL chromogenic media, double disc diffusion test, ESBL E-test, Amp C E-test and MBL E-test. RESULTS: 68% of the enterobacterial strains produced extended-spectrum beta- lactamases (ESBL), 13.63% of them expressing simultaneously the Amp C enzyme. All enterobacterial strains were susceptible to carbapenems (Imipenem and Ertapenem). Metallo-beta lactamases production among NGNB strains with resistance to Imipenem was high (80%), these strains being also multi-resistant to the majority of tested antibiotics with the exception of colistin. CONCLUSIONS: our results showed that the majority of the analyzed strains were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic multi-resistance and the increasing number of severe infections caused by these strains are a major issue for ICU, where patients with severe diseases and destabilized physiological condition are often admitted.
