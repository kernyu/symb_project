The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of 419 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from intensive care unit patients was determined. Amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most active antimicrobials evaluated. Fifty isolates (11.9%) were resistant to antimicrobials from > or =3 classes. Ninety-six percent of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates remained fully susceptible to colistin (polymyxin E).
