Bioprospecting for novel antimicrobials increasingly relies on extremely small samples unsuitable for conventional bulk extraction and assay. We developed a microtitre plate assay for minimal amounts of test materials which is rapid, extremely sensitive, allows time-course analysis and reduces false negatives. Developed for the analyses of antimicrobial sensitivity and resistance, the technique is appropriate for assays where source materials are scarce.
