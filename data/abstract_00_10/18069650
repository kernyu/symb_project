BACKGROUND: A number of synthetic fungicides are not effective when confronted by oomycete pathogens because many fungicide targets are absent from oomycetes. Moreover, resistance to fungicides has already arisen in oomycete species, and thus development of new, effective and safe compounds for use in oomycete disease control is necessary. RESULTS: Zoospore lysis began at 10 microg mL(-1) of thiobutacin, and most of the zoospores were collapsed at 50 microg mL(-1). Thiobutacin also revealed inhibitory activity against the cyst germination and hyphal growth of Phytophthora capsici at 50 microg mL(-1). Treatment with thiobutacin exhibited protective activity against development of Phytophthora disease on pepper plants. CONCLUSION: The authors verified in vitro antioomycete activity of thiobutacin against P. capsici and its control efficacy against Phytophthora blight in vivo. This is the first report to demonstrate in vivo antioomycete activity of the novel antibiotic thiobutacin against P. capsici infection.
