SETTING: A hospital-based study at the Makati Medical Center, Makati City, Philippines, a hyperendemic area for tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: To determine the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of drug susceptibility tests (DST) of M. tuberculosis isolated from 1995-2000. RESULTS: Resistance to ciprofloxacin was 26.8%, ofloxacin 35.3%, and multidrug resistance (MDR) was 17.2%. Of the MDR strains, 51.4% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Acquired resistance was significantly higher for all first-line drugs and for ciprofloxacin, but not for ofloxacin. A significant increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin was noted compared to 1989-1994, while resistance to the firstline drugs was not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are now a significantly less effective alternative therapy in tuberculosis, particularly MDR-TB, due to a selection pressure from their widespread use in the treatment of TB and possibly other infections in the community, which is hyperendemic for tuberculosis.
