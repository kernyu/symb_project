Low microbial load diets for patients with haematological malignancy were examined for enterococci and listeria using pre-enrichment, enrichment and selective plating. Enterococci were highly prevalent and their ecology diverse; 100/211 samples yielded 132 isolates made up of 67 strains distinguishable by PFGE. Listeria monocytogenes was not found. Screening of enterococci for antibiotic resistance showed low level vancomycin resistance (6-12 microg/ml) in six isolates of E. gallinarum and high level streptomycin resistance (> or = 1000 microg/ml) in eight isolates from various foods. No strains showing high level glycopeptide or gentamicin resistance were found. The high prevalence of enterococci in food processed for safety indicates a possible route for the acquisition of antibiotic-resistant strains by vulnerable hospital patients.
