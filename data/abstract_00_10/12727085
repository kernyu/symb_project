Seventeen strains of Arcobacter butzleri and thirteen of Arcobacter cryaerophilus, were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility to 26 antimicrobial agents. Among beta-lactams agents in this study, imipenem was the most active agent against both A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus isolates with MIC(90) values of 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. The most active cephalosporin tested was cefepime, although it was more active against A. butzleri (MIC(90) 8 mg/l) than A. cryaerophilus (MIC(90) 64 mg/l). Levofloxacin, marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the best-performing fluoroquinolones against these species. Of the aminoglycosides, amikacin was the most active agent against both A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus strains with MIC(90) values of 64 and 16 mg/l, respectively. All isolates showed high levels of resistance to penicillins, macrolides, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and vancomycin.
