It is postulated that P. aeruginosa in monoculture or in association with Staphylococcus aureus keeps its leading position in chronic bacterial inflammatory broncho-pulmonary processes in children with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotic resistant strains of Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophila, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans were revealed (7.1% of the strains). P. aeruginosa strains were susceptible to aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin, and polymixin B. Susceptibility of smooth and mucoid forms of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime stayed at the level of 49.6-57.1%. Such microbial associations as P. aeruginosa sm. + S. aureus, P. aeruginosa sm. + P. aeruginosa muc. + S. aureus were mainly susceptible to ciprofloxacin, aminoglycosides and resistant to ceftasidime. Meropenem, cefepim and ciprofloxacin are highly effective antibiotics for the treatment of broncho-pulmonary processes exacerbations at children with chronic P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis. Intravenous use of antibiotics out of hospital for the treatment of the children with cystic fibrosis is clinically effective, and is economically and psychologically reasonable. It should be used more widely in medical practice.
