This review summarizes the current developments in therapy for visceral leishmaniasis. With the recent introduction of new drugs, the main limits in reducing deaths from visceral leishmaniasis are difficulty in diagnosis in the field and health inequality--patients lack of access to treatment. No new drugs are currently in the early stages of development. There are good reasons for the use of combination therapy; to prevent further development of resistance against the limited therapeutic options available.
