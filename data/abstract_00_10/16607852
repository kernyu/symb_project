Meropenem is a new carbapenem with excellent activity against different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Its good antibacterial activity is closely related to high hydrolysis resistance by bacterial beta-lactamases. The aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial activity of meropenem by comparison that of oxacillin, gentamicin, clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin against 458 staphylococci collected during 2004 period from healthy individuals. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution technique. Meropenem has an activity clearly superior to the other tested agents. Resistance rate is zero for all investigated strains.
