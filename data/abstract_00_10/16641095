Single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 can select nevirapine (NVP)-resistant variants, but the frequency, duration, and clinical significance of this resistance is not well defined. We used a sensitive allele-specific PCR assay to assess the emergence and persistence of NVP-resistant variants in plasma samples from 22 women with HIV-1 subtype C infection who participated in a study of sdNVP for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. The women were categorized into three groups on the basis of detection of NVP resistance by standard genotype analysis. Group 1 (n = 6) had NVP resistance detected at 2 and 6 mo after sdNVP, but not at 12 mo. Group 2 (n = 9) had NVP resistance detected at 2 mo, but not 6 mo. Group 3 (n = 7) had no NVP resistance detected at any time point. Allele-specific PCR analysis for the two most common NVP resistance mutations (K103N and Y181C) detected NVP-resistant variants in most (16 of 21) samples that were negative for NVP resistance by standard genotype, at levels ranging from 0.1% to 20% 1 yr after treatment. The frequency of NVP-resistant mutations decreased over time, but persisted above predose levels for more than 1 yr in > or = 23% of the women. These findings highlight the urgent need for studies assessing the impact of sdNVP on the efficacy of subsequent antiretroviral therapy containing NVP or other nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
