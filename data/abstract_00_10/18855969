A major problem associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) for the treatment of HIV is their vulnerability to mutations in the allosteric binding site of reverse transcriptase that can result in the development of a resistant virus. Herein we present the optimization of a series of 5-aryloxy imidazoles, which possess a balanced pharmacological profile against both wild-type enzyme and the clinically relevant mutations K103N and Y181C. Subtle structural changes were used to probe structure-activity relationships relating to both potency and metabolic stability, which led to an imidazole derivative with an impressive overall profile.
