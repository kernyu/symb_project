Targeted antisense and gene replacement mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that only the murA1 gene and not the murA2 gene is required for the normal cellular growth of Bacillus anthracis. Antisense-based modulation of murA1 gene expression hypersensitizes cells to the MurA-specific antibiotic fosfomycin despite the normally high resistance of B. anthracis to this drug.
