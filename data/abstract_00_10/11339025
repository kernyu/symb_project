Antimicrobial resistance in bacterial respiratory tract pathogens is a rapidly evolving and increasingly disconcerting problem. Major factors that have contributed to resistance are inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for viral infections and the use of antibiotics with poor activity. The treatment of respiratory tract infections is significantly affected by resistance in organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Resistance to beta-lactams, sulfonamides, and macrolides continues to rise. Evidence-based guidelines, founded on clinical and bacteriological outcomes, are imperative to treat patients effectively, to limit the spread of these pathogens, and to minimize further development of resistance. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters have recently been shown to correlate with clinical outcome, and offer a more rational approach to predicting antimicrobial efficacy and determining clinically relevant susceptibility breakpoints.
