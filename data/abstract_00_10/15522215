This represents the first report of purification of a glutamine-rich antifungal peptide from family Amarylliaceace. The peptide, designated as nartazin, was purified from the bulbs of the Chinese daffodil Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis by means of ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. Its molecular mass was 7.1kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration. Nartazin stimulated proliferation of mouse splenocytes and bone marrow cells but inhibited proliferation of leukemia L1210 cells. It also inhibited translation in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The sequence of its first 20 N-terminal residues was characterized by an abundance of glutamine. The peptide possessed antifungal activity on four phytopathogenic fungi. Its activity was retained after incubation with bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin (enzyme: substrate ratio 1:10 w/w) at 37 degrees C for 1h but was attenuated after treatment with proteinase K. The data revealed its pronounced resistance to proteolytic digestion.
