In the present position paper, an attempt was made to establish clinical breakpoints of amoxicillin to classify porcine respiratory tract pathogens as susceptible, intermediate or resistant based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations of amoxicillin. For this, a thorough review of the published literature with regard to swine-specific pharmacological data (including dosages of amoxicillin applied and routes of administration used), clinical efficacy, and in vitro susceptibility of the target pathogens was performed. Based on the comparative analysis of the results, the working group "Antibiotic Resistance" of the German Veterinary Medical Society (DVG) proposed to classify porcine respiratory tract pathogens that show MIC values of amoxicillin of < or =0.5microg/ml as "susceptible", those with MICs of 1microg/ml as "intermediate", and those with MICs of > or =2microg/ml as "resistant".
