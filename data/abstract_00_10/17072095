The aim of this work is to develop a highly sensitive assay system for P-gp-mediated transport by using two methods, induction of P-gp and short-term culture of Caco-2 cells. To induce P-gp in Caco-2 cells, cells were cultured in vinblastine-containing medium. The mRNA level of P-gp was approximately 7-fold higher in Caco-2 cells cultured with vinblastine (P-gp-induced Caco-2 cells) than in control cells. Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in P-gp expression. After cell differentiation, the mRNA level of P-gp was downregulated, however, P-gp-induced Caco-2 cells still possessed a 5.6-fold higher mRNA level of P-gp compared to control cells. Polarized transport of substrate drugs was greater in the monolayer of P-gp-induced cells than in that of control cells. Moreover, we found that P-gp expression in Caco-2 cells could be further enhanced by applying the higher concentration of vinblastine. Transport activity of P-gp in Caco-2 cells cultured with higher concentration of vinblastine was markedly higher than that in P-gp-induced Caco-2 cells and was comparable with that in MDR1-MDCKII cells. In conclusion, this study provided a stable and highly sensitive in vitro assay system that can identify compounds that are subject to P-gp-mediated efflux.
