This investigation had an aim to establish the incidence of Enterococcus faecalis in vaginal smears and its correlation with antibiotics used for the treatment of genital and extragenital diseases, as well. By this prospective study 300 women in reproductive period have been involved. An average age was 34.5 years and 282 of them are married. They have been divided in 4 groups, 75 in every group. First group consisted women who have not been treated by an antibiotic in last 6 months; second group--women who have been treated due to infections of genital tract; third group--women were treated for unspecific colpitis and last one group were women treated for extragenital infections.

Enterococcus faecalis has been found in 112 patients (37.33%); in first group in 13 (17.33%) cases, in second group in 26 (34.66%), in third group 39 (52%), and in last group in 34 (45.33%) patients, which significantly different. Investigation on sensitivity showed a minimal sensitivity on Penicillin and Streptomycin and no resistance on Vancomycin. In conclusion, it could be said that Enterococcus faecalis was found in 17.33% patients who has not been treated by antibiotics and in 44% who used antibiotics, which differ significantly (p<0.01).
