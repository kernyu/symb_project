Greater understanding of programmed cell death (PCD) responses in pathogenic fungi may offer a chance of exploiting the fungal molecular death machinery to control fungal infections. Clearly identifiable differences between the death machineries of pathogens and their hosts, make this a feasible target. Evidence for PCD in a range of pathogenic fungi is discussed alongside an evaluation of the capacity of existing antifungal agents to promote apoptosis and other forms of cell death. Information about death related signalling pathways that have been examined in pathogens as diverse as Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Magnaporthe grisea and Colletotrichum trifolii are discussed.
