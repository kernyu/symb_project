Thirty-four pyrazinamide-resistant and 37 pyrazinamide-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains were analyzed for pncA gene mutations. None of the sensitive strains had any mutations, apart from silent mutations, whereas all but one resistant strain showed pncA mutations. By using sequencing as a means of early resistance detection, the inconsistency of phenotypic pyrazinamide assays can be circumvented.
