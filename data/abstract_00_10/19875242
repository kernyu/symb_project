PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of daptomycin and other comparator agents against bacterial strains isolated from diabetic foot infections (DFI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All diabetic patients hospitalized for a first episode of DFI (stage 2 to 4, according to the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot classification) were selected in Nimes University hospital between June 2006 to August 2007. MIC were determined using E-test strip (AB Biodisk) and custom broth microdilution panels against bacterial strains isolated from foot samples. RESULTS: Two hundred strains were studied. Daptomycin was active against 99.5% of all the strains especially Streptococcus sp. (100%), Enterococcus sp. (100%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (100%) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (100%). Exclusively, one methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain was not covered by this antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin, a new broad spectrum antimicrobial agent against Gram-positive cocci, is qualified to belong to the therapeutic arsenal package of complicated skin and soft tissue infections in diabetic patients after microbial documentation.
