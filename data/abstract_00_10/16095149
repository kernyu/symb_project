The aim of this study was to isolate, identify and determine a drug susceptibility of bacterial uropathogens cultured from outpatients in 2002-2003. In total, 4211 urine samples were examined, among which 1942 were positive. 2086 bacterial strains were cultured. Escherichia coli strains (1094) dominated, which were etiological agents of over a half of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Uropathogens isolated from outpatients were susceptible to many antibacterial agents.
