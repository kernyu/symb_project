The bactericidal activities of 35 commercially available disinfectants against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and vancomycin-sensitive enterococci (VSE) were investigated under both clean and dirty (albumin added) conditions using a microtitration plate method. No differences in bactericidal time were observed with any of the test disinfectants when comparing activity against VRE or VSE. Isopropyl alcohol (70 v/v%), alcohol-containing preparations such as Welpas, Wellup and Maskin W . ethanol solution, 0.2% of cation surfactant disinfectants such as Osvan solution 'daigo', Germitol 'Maruishi' 10% and Hyamine solution, and 0.5% of amphoteric compound disinfectants such as TEGO-51, Hygieel and Hypal No.3, were the most effective compounds when compared with other disinfectants. These results suggest that the use of a disinfectant with activity against VRE may be one appropriate method for preventing infections caused by this micro-organism.
