Recent studies have shown that mutations in two amino acid positions of the Pneumocystis carinii dihydropteroate synthase gene are significantly more common in immunocompromised patients with P. carinii pneumonia who fail sulfa or sulfone prophylaxis. This paper reviews the studies that suggest that these mutations may be responsible for some failures of prophylaxis in P. carinii.
