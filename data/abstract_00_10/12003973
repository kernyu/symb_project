Ninety clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates from separate patients were examined phenotypically and genotypically for susceptibility to methicillin/oxacillin. Thirty were methicillin/oxacillin susceptible and 60 were methicillin and oxacillin resistant (MRSA). The 60 MRSA isolates examined were subdivided into two groups according to their antibiotic profiles and comprised 30 non-multidrug-resistant (NMDR) isolates, resistant to less than two non-beta-lactam antibiotics, and 30 multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates, resistant to three or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics. Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of methicillin/oxacillin showed that despite use of the guidelines published by the NCCLS for the testing of S. aureus susceptibility to methicillin/oxacillin, MIC values of some NMDR MRSA isolates fell below the NCCLS-recommended breakpoints. Etest strips failed to detect two NMDR MRSA isolates tested with oxacillin and four tested with methicillin. Lowering the NCCLS-recommended oxacillin screen agar concentration from 6 to 2 mg/L and temperature of incubation to 30 degrees C, improved the specificity and sensitivity of NMDR MRSA detection from 87% to 100%. On PFGE analysis these NMDR MRSA strains were genotypically different. Genotypic tests, such as multiplex PCR for the mecA/nuc genes and DNA hybridization for the mecA gene, or phenotypic monoclonal antibody-based tests to detect penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) offer advantages for problematic isolates in detecting or confirming low-level phenotypic heterogeneous mecA expression of oxacillin and methicillin resistance in NMDR MRSA.
