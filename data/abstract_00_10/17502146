5-Deoxy-5-episubstituted arbekacin derivatives have been designed and efficiently synthesized. The synthetic compounds showed potent antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In particular, these derivatives were superior to arbekacin against MRSA strains expressing the bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2''). The antibacterial activity of the 5-deoxy-5-episubstituted arbekacin derivatives against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was markedly influenced by the efflux system of MexXY/OprM. The 6'-N-methyl derivative of the 5-epi arbekacin was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa expressing the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme AAC(6').
