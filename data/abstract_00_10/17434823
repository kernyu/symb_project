Some new features of the in vitro activity of ceftibuten, an oral third generation cephalosporin, have been studied in reference to respiratory and urinary tract pathogens included in its antibacterial spectrum. At 0.25XMIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and 0.5XMIC levels, ceftibuten was able to affect the biofilm production in 2/3 of both Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains, and reduced the number of strains capable of adhering to epithelial cells by about 35% in comparison to the control. Surface hydrophobicity was also influenced by ceftibuten and the other drugs at 0.25-0.5XMIC. In general, no marked variation in the virulence traits of the pathogens studied were found by exposing bacteria to sub-MICs of ceftibuten. Plasmid loss (from 1.8 to 37.2%), and Flac transfer inhibition (about 30-50% reduction in the number of recombinants) were detected under the experimental conditions used. This study confirms the excellent antibacterial properties of ceftibuten by adding new information about the effects of this antibiotic against pathogens often involved in respiratory and urinary tract infections that may be treated with this compound, supporting the appropriate use of this cephalosporin.
