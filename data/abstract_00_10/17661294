Alterations in the erm(A) regulatory region of six clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and one of Staphylococcus haemolyticus displaying a constitutive resistance phenotype were investigated. Anovel deletion of 10 bp with respect to the corresponding sequence of Tn554 was identified in the attenuator of a constitutively expressed erm(A) gene of one of the S. epidermidis isolates. Thus far, this is the smallest deletion conferring constitutive resistance in the translational attenuator of erm(A) in a naturally occurring S. epidermidis strain of human origin.
