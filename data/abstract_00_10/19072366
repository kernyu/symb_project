Treatment of chronic hepatitis B with oral nucleos(t)ide analogs is evolving rapidly with newer compounds gaining approval. Recently, the US FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) have approved telbivudine, a potent anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific agent with a hitherto excellent safety profile. This review focuses on the efficacy of this agent in chronic hepatitis B compared with lamivudine, evaluated clinically in Phase II and a large Phase III study. Monitoring of the virologic response under treatment with sensitive HBV-DNA assays has been applied, aiming at increasing efficacy and reducing HBV resistance. The results are critically presented and the evolving concept of effective long-term telbivudine and other nucleos(t)ide analog therapy, predicted by the extent of suppression of HBV replication at week 24, are analyzed and discussed.
