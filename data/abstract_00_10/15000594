Single witness: The current development of guidelines for antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings raised the issues of the possible use of drug resistance testing (DRT) in middle- and low-income countries, especially in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) programmes. Although resource limitation make it clear that DRT cannot be recommended as an essential part of clinical management of HIV-infected pregnant women in Africa, it is important to monitor the prevalence and incidence of drug resistance on a population basis as ART is scaled up worldwide and programmes for the prevention of MTCT will be implemented. Moreover, even in low-resource countries there are some special settings where DRT may be available for patient care and its use may be considered.
