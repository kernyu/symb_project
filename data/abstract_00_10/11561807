A ketolide (telithromycin), an azalide (azithromycin) and a macrolide (erythromycin) were tested against 2,733 isolates of gram-positive cocci gathered from 11 different medical centers. Telithromycin was active against erythromycin-resistant staphylococci that were susceptible to clindamycin but was not active against those that were resistant to clindamycin. More than 99% of all Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were susceptible to 1 microg/ml of telithromycin including erythromycin- and azithromycin-resistant strains. Telithromycin was not only more potent than azithromycin against macrolide-susceptible strains, it was also active against most macrolide-resistant strains. Although the prevalence of macrolide-resistant pneumococci increased from 19% to 27% between 1997 and 1999, macrolide resistance among other gram-positive cocci did not change substantially in that 2-year period.
