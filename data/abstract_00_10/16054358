Novel oxazolidinones were synthesized containing a number of substituted five-membered heterocycles attached to the 'piperazinyl-phenyl-oxazolidinone' core of eperezolid. Further, the piperazine ring of the core was replaced by other diamino-heterocycles. These modifications led to several compounds with potent activity against a spectrum of resistant and susceptible gram-positive organisms, along with the identification of ranbezolid (RBx 7644) as a clinical candidate.
