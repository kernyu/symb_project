Resistance to the HIV fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide is associated with mutations in the first heptad repeat region of gp41, but little is known of their impact on replicative fitness in vivo. We followed seven patients undergoing salvage therapy that included enfuvirtide in order to document the temporal generation of genotypic and phenotypic resistance in parallel with replicative fitness. Resistance to enfuvirtide was not associated with decreased replicative fitness of HIV strains infecting these patients.
