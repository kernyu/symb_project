AIMS: This study examined vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus (VSE) from deli salads for streptogramin resistance and presence of cpd, agg and gelE genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifteen VSE from retail salads were isolated for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing by MicroScan, Etest and agar diffusion. Clinical vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (n = 32) and animal VSE (n = 17) were included for comparative purposes. Multiplex PCR was used to detect the following genes: agg, gelE, cpd, vatD, vatE and sodA. Results showed fewer streptogramin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium isolated from salad (1/6, 17%) and animals (6/10, 60%) than from clinical (26/29, 90%) sources. A low level of erythromycin susceptibility was detected among salad (2/6, 33%) and animal (3/10, 30%) Ent. faecium isolates. Food and animal VSE demonstrated similarities in antimicrobial resistance profiles. All Enterococcus faecalis carried one or more of the selected genes cpd (40%), gelE (33%) and agg (27%). The vatD or vatE genes were not detected in any of the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Experiments demonstrated that streptogramin resistance and virulence genes agg, cpd and gelE are present in enterococci isolated from deli salads. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides useful information regarding streptogramin resistance and virulence determinants in enterococci from foods associated with multi-component ingredients.
