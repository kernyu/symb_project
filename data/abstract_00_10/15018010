Dermatologic infections are treated to improve the elderly patient's quality of life and prevent disability and death. Pharmacokinetic changes, social issues, and the risk for adverse effects and drug interactions, however, increase the challenge to achieve successful treatment of those over age 65 as compared with younger patients. This challenge grows ever larger when coupled with the increasing trends of resistance among bacteria and fungi. The clinician can effectively face this challenge through careful consideration of diagnosis, patient risk factors, antimicrobial pharmacology, and resistance patterns.
