PURPOSE: Imatinib mesylate (IM) has rapidly become the front-line treatment of Philadelphia-positive (Ph-pos) chronic myeloid leukemia, but the number of patients who were treated and are being treated with IM second-line is still substantial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have monitored and analyzed the cytogenetic and molecular response to IM 400 mg/d in a cohort of 277 late chronic phase (LCP) patients who were resistant or intolerant to interferon-alpha and were observed for 48 to 79 months (median, 72 months). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three patients (55%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCgR). Seventy-seven percent of them were still in CCgR after 5 years. The rate of response loss did not increase over time. The 6-year progression-free survival and overall survival of these 153 complete cytogenetic responders were 90% and 91%, respectively. Molecular response was less than major in 21%, major in 78%, and complete in one patient only. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that, in LCP the CCgR rate to IM is 50% to 60%, and show that CCgR is stable and is associated with a prolonged survival, even if leukemia continues to be molecularly detectable.
