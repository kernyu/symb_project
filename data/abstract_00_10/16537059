INTRODUCTION: The genetic mechanisms and changes in resistance of Streptococcus pyogenes to clarithromycin and clindamycin were studied in 480 strains from a children's hospital in Barcelona (1996-2003). RESULTS: There was a progressive increase of strains with the MLSB phenotype (55.6% of resistant strains in 2002) and a relative decrease in the M phenotype. The overall rate of macrolide resistance was 29.8%, with an increase from 27.4% in the 1996-2001 period to 35.8% in the 2002-2003 period. The MefA gene was detected in M phenotype strains, the ermB gene in constitutive MLSB strains and the ermTR gene in some inducible MLSB strains. CONCLUSION: The increase of the resistance and the changes in the implied mechanisms reduce the effectiveness of macrolides and clindamycin as an alternative treatment.
