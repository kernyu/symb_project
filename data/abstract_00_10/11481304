Three hundred and three strains of group A streptococci (GAS) isolated from adults with pharyngitis were tested to evaluate their phenotype of resistance to macrolides-lincosamides and to search for macrolide resistance genes. MICs of clarithromycin were determined. The overall rate of resistance to both erythromycin and clarithromycin was 9.6%. Constitutive, inducible and M phenotypes of resistance were detected in 4.3, 2 and 3.3% of strains, respectively. All constitutive phenotypes harboured ermB genes, whereas inducible phenotypes had the ermTR gene and M phenotypes had the mefA gene. In France, the current resistance rate of GAS to erythromycin and clarithromycin remains low.
