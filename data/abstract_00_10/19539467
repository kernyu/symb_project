A series of non-basic building blocks was synthesized and introduced to the C7 position of the quinolone nucleus 7-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid to afford the corresponding fluoroquinolones in 46-85% yield. The antibacterial activity of these new fluoroquinolones was evaluated using a standard broth microdilution technique. The sulfur-containing quinolone, 7-(2-thia-5-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-5-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydr o-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid exhibited a superior antibacterial activity against quinolone-susceptible and multidrug-resistant strains in comparison with the clinically used fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, especially to the Streptococcus pneumonia and multidrug-resistant S. pneumonia clinical isolates.
