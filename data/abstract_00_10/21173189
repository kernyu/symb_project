TEM-154, identified in Portugal in 2004, associated the substitutions observed in the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) TEM-12 and in the inhibitor-resistant penicillinase (IRT) TEM-33. This enzyme exhibited hydrolytic activity against ceftazidime and a low level of resistance to clavulanic acid. Surprisingly, the substitution Met69Leu enhanced the catalytic efficiency of oxyimino beta-lactams conferred by the substitution Arg164Ser. Its discovery confirms the dissemination of the complex mutant group of TEM enzymes in European countries.
