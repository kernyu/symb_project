INTRODUCTION: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori remains a problematic treatment issue in clinical practice. The intention is to find a treatment that achieves a high rate of eradication at a low price and treatment options that are now used give us the opportunity to achieve this goal. Recently published results showing a low rate of resistance and better compliance with moxifloxacin-based treatment regimens indicate the need to investigate its efficacy in H. pylori eradication. This study is based on proving the efficacy of moxifloxacin in H. pylori eradication within the triple therapy. AIMS AND METHODS: The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of one week of moxifloxacin-based treatment with the standard treatment for H. pylori eradication. Patients with H. pylori infection and non-ulcer dyspepsia (n = 277) were randomly divided into four groups to receive: moxifloxacin 400 mg/d, metronidazole 400 mg twice daily, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily (MML group); moxifloxacin 400 mg/d, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily (MAL group); clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, metronidazole 400 mg twice daily, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily (CML group); clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily (CAL group). The patients were assessed for prevalence of H. pylori using the CLO test, histology and culture on gastric biopsy samples obtained during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy before randomization and 4-6 weeks after completion of treatment. Bacterial sensitivity to clarithromycin and moxifloxacin was determined with the E-test. RESULTS: 265 (95.6%) patients completed the study forming the basis for PP analysis. Eradication rates of H. pylori in ITT and in PP analyses were: in the MML group 93.5% (58/62) and 96.7% (58/60), respectively; in the MAL group 86.4% (57/66) and 90.5% (57/63); in the CML group 70.4% (50/71) and 75.8% (50/66); and in the CAL group 78.2% (61/78) and 80.2% (61/76). Moxifloxacin treatment protocols were significantly more effective on both ITT and PP analyses than the clarithromycin based protocols with only one exception (MAL vs. CAL on ITT analysis). Among 238 patients (86% of the entire study group), strains showing primary resistance to clarithromycin were found in 10.8% and to moxifloxacin in 5.9%. Eradication of moxifloxacin sensitive/resistant strains was 98.1%/75% for MML (p < 0.01) and 91.1%/66.7% for MAL (p = n.s.); comparison of eradication of sensitive strains in MML and MAL regimens was 98.1%/91.1% (p < 0.05), and for resistant strains 75%/66.7% (p = n.s.). CML and CAL protocols did not differ in efficacy of eradication of clarithromycin sensitive or resistant strains. CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin-based triple therapies showed higher eradication rates with few side effects and good drug compliance when compared with standard H. pylori treatments. Moreover, the increased prevalence of clarithromycin resistance suggests that moxifloxacin-based regimens could be safe and effective options in treatment of H. pylori infection.
