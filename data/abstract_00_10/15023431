The minimal inhibitory concentrations of tetracycline, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin and azithromycin for 28 Singapore clinical Mycoplasma hominis strains were studied using the Etest method. Different incubation conditions did not affect susceptibility categories, except for tetracycline intermediate-susceptibility strains. Tetracycline-susceptibility was only 35.7%. All strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones and clindamycin but resistant to azithromycin.
