INTRODUCTION: The Shigella spp. is an organism with an ongoing changing resistance pattern to different antibiotics, thus making its appropriate treatment difficult. Nalidixic acid has been one of the most common agents used for the treatment of shigellosis. Recently, some studies have reported an emerging resistance to this agent. METHODS: In this study, we compared the resistance of Shigella isolates during the period 2001-2003 with the period 2004-2006. RESULTS: Shigella spp. resistance was increased totally and in each subgroup, except for Shigella sonnei. CONCLUSION: Our results showed an increasing resistance of the Shigella spp., thus identifying an emergent need for an alternative agent for the treatment of shigellosis in future.
