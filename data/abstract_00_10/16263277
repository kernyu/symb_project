Design principles are delineated for non-nucleoside inhibitors for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (NNRTIs). Simultaneous optimization of binding affinity for wild-type RT, tolerance for viral mutations, and physical properties is pursued. Automated lead generation with the growing program BOMB, Monte Carlo simulations with free-energy perturbation theory for lead optimization, and property analysis with QikProp are featured. An initial 30 microM lead has been optimized rapidly to the 10 nM level.
