A multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli strain from a human-associated pulsotype within sequence type ST131 (O25:H4) colonized three of five dogs and cats within a household. Of the four other colonizing strains identified, two were MDR and two colonized multiple hosts. The ST131 strain uniquely exhibited high resistance and virulence scores.
