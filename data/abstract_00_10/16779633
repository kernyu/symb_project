A total of 560 invasive and 1062 non-invasive isolates were collected. The antimicrobial susceptibility of invasive versus non-invasive Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were evaluated using the E-tests. The equal domination of Gram-negative among both invasive and non-invasive pathogens was estimated in our study if contaminants were excluded. The emergence trend of Gram-positive microbes especially of coagulase negative staphylococci may be proved only after application of exclusive algorithms. Due to similar susceptibility, the data of non-invasive Gram-negative pathogens can be useful to predict resistance of invasive ones. Also, the surveillance of invasive pathogens provides useful information about the general susceptibility of pathogens.
