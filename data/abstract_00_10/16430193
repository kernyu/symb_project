A systemic review is presented of all studies that have evaluated the inhibitory quotient (IQ). The IQ is defined as the ratio between (trough) drug concentration and level of drug resistance of the HIV isolate. From the studies presented, it can be concluded that for protease inhibitors (PIs) and efavirenz, the phenotypic IQ is associated with virological response. The genotypic IQ (GIQ) for PIs was also demonstrated to be associated with virological response. An intrinsic limitation of the GIQ is that it is only applicable for PIs, of which resistance is based on the cumulative effect of mutations. As the IQ can be modified by adjustment of the drug dosage, it may be of clinical value. Its application in patient care should therefore be further investigated.
