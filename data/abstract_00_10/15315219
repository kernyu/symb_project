Antibiotics are used for prophylactic and therapeutic indications. Since the conditions caused by bacteria resistance are in constant modification the regime has to be verified at regular intervals and adapted to the new conditions. The prescription of antibiotics in oral surgery and medicine should be administrated with reservation. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis is imperatively required during treatment of high-risk patients, especially in cases of endocarditis. An antibiotic therapy is absolutely indicated in acute osteomyelitis as well as in spreading and multispacial abscesses.
