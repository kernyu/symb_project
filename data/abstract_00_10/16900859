The purpose of the study was a comparison of the sensitivity to three disinfectants of psychotropic and termotropic bacteria isolated from milking equipment. The study shows that psychotropic bacteria was more resistant on disinfectants used in experiments than termotropic. Bacteria's capability to acquire a resistant to disinfectants cause to search the new and more advance substances. Incorrect use of the antibacterial chemicals could accelerate this process.
