Three new antimalarial drugs have recently been registered in the Netherlands: atovaquone-proguanil, artemether-lumefantrine and artemotil. These drugs are effective against parasites with multiple resistance. Atovaquone-proguanil and artemether-lumefantrine seem in practice to be equivalent for the treatment of non-severe Plasmodium falciparum infections for respectively persons of more than 11 kg and persons aged 12 years and older (35 kg). Artemotil (intramuscular injection) is registered for the treatment of severe malaria in children up to 17 years of age. Atovaquone-proguanil is also registered for prophylactic use in adults. The intravenous administration of quinine is preferable in the case of seriously ill patients. In patients with non-severe malaria for whom parenteral treatment is indicated, artemotil is a good alternative for quinine.
