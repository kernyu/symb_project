OBJECTIVES: Strains of Acinetobacter baumannii producing the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) PER-1 are widespread in Turkey and have also been reported from Korea and France. In contrast, A. baumannii producing the ESBL VEB-1 have only been reported from France, where one strain was responsible for a nationwide outbreak in 2003-2004. Here we describe the emergence of strains of A. baumannii producing VEB-1 and PER- 1 in Belgium. METHODS: Belgian hospitals were alerted in December 2003 to the emergence in France of VEB-1-producing A. baumannii susceptible only to meropenem and colistin. Isolates with a compatible susceptibility profile were sent to a single central laboratory for VEB-1 confirmation, molecular characterization and typing. RESULTS: From December 2003 to March 2005, three hospitals located close to the French border and one in the Brussels area reported isolation of eight A. baumannii isolates compatible with the French epidemic clone. Using PCR, six were identified as VEB-1-positive and two as PER-1-positive. All the VEB-1-positive isolates were clonally related by PFGE and by integron analysis to the French epidemic strain. The PER-1-positive strains were indistinguishable by PFGE but not related to the known French isolate or to several Turkish isolates. Both genes were chromosomally encoded. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates the inter-country spread of VEB-1-producing A. baumannii isolates as well as the emergence of PER-1-producing A. baumannii strains in Belgium.
