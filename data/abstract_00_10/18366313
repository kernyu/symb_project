The Honduran Ministry of Health (MOH) HIV antiretroviral treatment program began widespread treatment in 2003. We investigated the prevalence of antiretroviral genotypic resistance in specimens collected and archived from HIV-1-infected antiretroviral-naive patients presenting to initiate treatment between 1 July, 2002 and 30 June, 2003 in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Of 416 specimens collected, 336 (80.8%) were successfully genotyped. All genotypes were HIV-1, group M and 99.1% were subtype B. The prevalence of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations was 7.7% with M184V and T215F/Y present in 6.0% and 3.0%, respectively. The prevalence of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations was 7.1%. K103N mutations were present in 3.0% of study specimens. The prevalence of major protease inhibitor mutations was 2.7%. Overall, 9.2% of the specimens harbored clinically significant mutations that predict at least intermediate resistance to the Honduran first-line antiretroviral medications. These mutations were more common in San Pedro Sula (14.0%) than in Tegucigalpa (6.5%, p = 0.02). A significant number of patients presenting to initiate antiretroviral therapy in Honduran MOH clinics harbored HIV-1 isolates resistant to the MOH's first-line regimen and resistance varied by region. Further studies to assess the impact of the Honduran antiretroviral program on genotypic resistance are warranted.
