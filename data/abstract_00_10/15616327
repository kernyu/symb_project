The fungal burdens (number of CFU per pair of lungs) in mice infected with Aspergillus fumigatus AB16.4 (for which the amphotericin B [AMB] MIC was elevated) and W73355 (drug-susceptible parent) were reduced by 21 and 81%, respectively, after 5 days of AMB treatment (2 mg/kg/day), indicating that AB16.4 also shows reduced susceptibility to AMB in a murine pulmonary aspergillosis model.
