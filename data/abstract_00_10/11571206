Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) were isolated from sewage and chicken feces but not from other animal fecal sources (dog, cow, and pig) or from surface waters tested. VRE from hospital wastewater were resistant to > or =20 microg of vancomycin/ml and possessed the vanA gene. VRE from residential wastewater and chicken feces were resistant to 3 to 5 microg of vancomycin/ml and possessed the vanC gene.
