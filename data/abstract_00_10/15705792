The p53 system is highly stress sensitive and integrates diverse intracellular signals in a complex and poorly defined manner. We report on the high dependence of stress-induced p53 activation on mitochondrial activity. Down-regulation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTMP) by inhibitors of electron transport (rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA)) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis (oligomycin) prevented stress-induced p53 protein accumulation and abrogated p53-dependent apoptosis in a wild-type p53 leukemia cell line MOLT-3, in primary leukemia cells and in normal T lymphocytes. Using genome-wide gene expression analysis, stress-induced up-regulation of the p53 transcriptional targets and their specific inhibition by oligomycin has been demonstrated. Oligomycin did not impair p53-independent apoptosis and caused only a slight reduction of intracellular ATP levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) localized to mitochondria decreased in the presence of oligomycin, and stress-induced p53 activation showed strong ROS sensitivity both in leukemic and normal cells. These observations identify mitochondrial activity, described by MTMP and ROS levels, as a critical intracellular determinant of the p53 stress sensitivity and suggest potential implications of this linkage in the mechanisms of chemoresistance of acute leukemia cells.
