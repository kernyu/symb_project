OBJECTIVE: To update knowledge regarding the pattern of Serogroups and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonellas causing gastroenteritis in children at the King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the period of 1st April 1996 to 30th September 1999. METHODS: The case records of 416 children, from whom Salmonella species were isolated from stool cultures between April 1996 and September 1999 were reviewed. The isolates and susceptibility of these Salmonella were carried out accordingly to standard microbiological methods. RESULTS: During a period of 3 and 1/2 years a total of 412 non-typhoidal Salmonellas were isolated from stool cultures of 416 children who presented to King Khalid University Hospital complaining of gastroenteritis. The majority of these children (70%) belonged to the age group 0-4 years. Eighty seven percent of the Salmonella isolates were Serogroup D1, B and C1. The Serogroups and antimicrobial susceptibility of these Salmonellas differed from those previously reported from this country and other parts of the world. CONCLUSION: Salmonella gastroenteritis is an important clinical condition in infants and children in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Salmonella Serogroups D1, B and C predominate as causative agents of this condition. Most of the salmonella serogroups isolated in this study were highly susceptible to commonly used antimicrobial agents but ampicillin showed a rising resistance pattern. This may make it unsuitable therapy for Salmonella gastroenteritis.
