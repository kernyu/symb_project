Anthelmintic resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes among small ruminants is widespread in South Africa and Dorper sheep and Boer goats have been imported into Switzerland from this country on a number of occasions. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the occurrence of avermectin (AVM) resistant gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) in these breeds in Switzerland. A total of 24 Boer goat farms and 12 Dorper sheep farms participated in the study. According to the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) AVM-resistant GIN populations were confirmed in 7 of the 24 Boer goat farms and suspected in a further 8 farms. Likewise AVM-resistance was confirmed in 2 of 12 Dorper sheep farms and suspected in a further 6 farms. Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus spp. were the dominant resistant species according to larval cultures. In the farms with detected AVM-resistance the animals were additionally treated with levamisole after natural reinfection. With the exception of one farm with a 'close-to cutoff-result' the FECRT gave no indication for resistance against levamisole. The results indicate that AVM-resistance is widespread in Swiss small ruminant farms keeping Boer goats and Dorper sheep. The common tradition of grazing animals from different farms on prealpine and alpine pastures could favour the spread of resistant populations within the country.
