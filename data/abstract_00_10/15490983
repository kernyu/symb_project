BACKGROUND: Peritonitis is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). We studied the efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin monotherapy in the treatment of PD-related peritonitis. METHODS: We performed an open-label, randomized control study comparing imipenem/cilastatin monotherapy (treatment group) versus cefazolin plus ceftazidime (control group) in the treatment of PD peritonitis. The result was further compared to a historic group treated with cefazolin plus netilmycin. Outcome measures were primary response rate at day 10 and complete cure rate. RESULTS: We enrolled 51 patients in the treatment group, 51 in the control group, and identified 96 in the historic group. The primary response rate to the assigned antibiotics was 49.0%, 51.0%, and 49.0% for the treatment, control, and historic groups, respectively (p = 0.97). The primary response rate allowing for change in antibiotic was 82.4%, 90.2%, and 82.3%, respectively, for the three groups (p = 0.41). The complete cure rate was 72.5%, 80.4%, and 82.3%, respectively (p = 0.60). Tenckhoff catheter removal was needed in 6 cases in the treatment group, 6 cases in the control group, and 13 cases in the historic group (p = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that monotherapy of imipenem/cilastatin has similar efficacy compared to the two standard regimens of cefazolin plus ceftazidime or netilmycin in the treatment of PD peritonitis.
