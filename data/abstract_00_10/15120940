Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor induces apoptosis and erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. During this erythroid differentiation, c-Myc and cyclin D1 transcripts are transiently downregulated. Accordingly, we studied the effect of cyclin D1 overexpression on erythroid differentiation. After treatment with 250 nM STI571, 90% of K562 and 25% of K562/D1 cells underwent erythroid differentiation. The basal expression of glycophorin A in K562/D1 cells was markedly diminished compared with that by parental cells. STI571 treatment failed to induce glycophorin A expression in K562/D1 cells. During STI571 treatment, ERK activity was downregulated in parental cells, while it was constantly activated in K562/D1 cells. These results suggest that ectopic expression of cyclin D1 causes the resistance of K562 cells to erythroid differentiation by modulating ERK regulation.
