In The Netherlands, both an increase in and regional differences in erythromycin resistance of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli have been reported. To determine the accuracy of routine tests for erythromycin resistance, 48 erythromycin-resistant isolates from various laboratories that participate in the Dutch surveillance of Campylobacter infections were reinvestigated. Initial susceptibility testing for erythromycin had been performed by disk diffusion in six and MIC-based methods in two laboratories. Reinvestigation was carried out using broth microdilution as a reference standard, as well as E-test and genetic resistance testing. Of 36 C. jejuni isolates reported by the initial laboratories as erythromycin-resistant, four (11%) and five (14%) were confirmed as erythromycin-resistant using broth microdilution according to CLSI and EUCAST resistance criteria, respectively. Erythromycin resistance was found in eight of 12 (67%) C. coli isolates according to both criteria. Results of E-tests were in accordance with these results in all isolates. Resistance-associated mutations in the 23S rRNA gene (A2059G and A2058T) were found in all isolates showing high-level resistance, whereas none were found in susceptible isolates. Routine determination of the erythromycin resistance of C. jejuni and C. coli shows unacceptable interlaboratory variation. In the absence of standardized protocols and interpretive criteria for disk diffusion, and while we await the development of easily applicable and reliable methods for molecular resistance testing, the use of broth microdilution remains the best method.
