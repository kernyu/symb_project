The SDS-PAGE profiles of out membrane protein(OMP) of 27 Et strains showed diverse patterns and they could be divided into six types. Between 21 pathogenic strains and 6 non-pathogenic strains there were obviously difference. The pathogenic strains isolated from China belong to E type and were simary to ATCC 15947. The OMP bands of pathogenic strains were more and denser than those of the non-pathogenic strains, and the strains from same souce had the identical patters. Interestingly, the non-pathogenic strains from different sources also had the almost same OMP profiles. What's more, they were also high resistant to some antibiotics such as Smx, Gem Tet and so on, while the 18 pathogenic strains were sensitivity to these.
