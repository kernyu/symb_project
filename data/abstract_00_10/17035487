The INNO-LiPA.Rif TB test (LiPA) has only been applied to a limited number of clinical specimens. To assess the utility of this test for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA and rifampin (RMP) resistance, 420 sputum samples comprising specimens from untreated (n=160) and previously treated (n=260) patients from 11 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America were tested. DNA was extracted from sputum samples by using a modification of the Boom's method, while the rpoB core region was amplified by nested PCR. The results were analyzed in conjunction with those obtained by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) microscopy and by culture on solid media. The LiPA test was positive for M. tuberculosis complex DNA in 389 (92.9%) specimens, including 92.0% (286 of 311) ZN-positive and 94.5% (103 of 109) ZN-negative specimens. Of these, 30.6% were RMP resistant. In contrast, 74.3% of the specimens were positive for M. tuberculosis by culture, and 30.8% of them were RMP resistant. LiPA detected M. tuberculosis complex DNA in 92.4% (110 of 119) of the culture-positive and 100.0% (41 of 41) of the culture-negative specimens from untreated patients. There was a 99.6% concordance between the RMP resistance as determined by culture and by the LiPA test. With an optimal DNA extraction method, LiPA allows rapid detection of M. tuberculosis complex DNA and RMP resistance directly from sputum specimens. LiPA can still provide useful information when culture fails for various reasons. The rapid availability of this information is necessary to adjust patient treatment and avoid the risk of amplification of drug resistance.
