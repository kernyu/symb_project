We have shown that "reversed chloroquine molecules" constructed from chloroquine-like and resistance "reversal-agent"-like cores can be powerful drugs against malaria ( J. Med. Chem. 2006 , 49 , 5623 - 5625 ). Several reversed chloroquines are now presented that probe parameters governing the activities against chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-sensitive malaria strains. The design is tolerant to linker and reversal agent changes, but a piperazinyl group adjacent to the quinoline, at least for the group of compounds studied here, may be detrimental.
