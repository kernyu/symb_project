The Burkholderia cepacia complex comprises 10 closely related Gram-negative organisms all of which appear capable of causing disease in humans. These organisms appear of particular relevance to patients with cystic fibrosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important virulence determinant in Gram-negative pathogens. In this review, we highlight important data within the field commenting on LPS/lipid A structure-to-function relationships and cytokine induction capacity of Burkholderia strains studied so far.
