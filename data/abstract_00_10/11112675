We present a study of a nosocomial outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis in 31 patients, 30 of whom were infected with human immunodeficiency virus; all 31 died of progressive tuberculosis. All M. bovis strains had identical spoligotyping patterns and showed resistance to 12 antituberculosis drugs. Reinfection was suggested in 11 cases and confirmed in 4 by molecular typing methods. The causative strain was named "B strain."
