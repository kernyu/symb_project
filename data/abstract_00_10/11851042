Antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has become an increasing problem worldwide during the last 10-20 years. The wide use of antimicrobial agents in ambulatory practice has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the community, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The pneumococcus has developed resistance to most antibiotics used for its treatment. Classes with important resistance problems include the beta-lactams, the macrolides, the lincosamides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and the tetracyclines. Unfortunately, resistance to more than one class of antibiotics is common. In Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics is the main concern currently. It is important to know the local resistance pattern of the most common respiratory tract pathogens in order to make reasonable recommendations for an empirical therapy for respiratory tract infection, when antibiotic therapy is indeed indicated.
