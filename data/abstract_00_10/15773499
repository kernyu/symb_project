A total of 98 isolates of Branhamella catarrhalis were examined for their susceptibility to antibiotics using serial dilution method. Nitrocefin test was employed for detection of beta-lactamase activity. It was found that most of the isolates (71%) were resistant to ampicillin. Resistance to this antibiotic was accompanied by ability to beta-lactamase production. On the other hand, all isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid combination. Almost all isolates were susceptible to cefaclor (99%), cefuroxime (94%), cefotaxime (100%), ciprofloxacin (100%), tetracycline (91%), cotrimoxazole (93%) and erythromycin (93%).
