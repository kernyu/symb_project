This study evaluated the antimycobacterial activity of econazole against multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC(>99.99)) against MDR strains were found to be 0.120-0.125 microg/mL and 0.125-0.150 microg/mL, respectively, demonstrating the antimycobacterial potential of econazole.
