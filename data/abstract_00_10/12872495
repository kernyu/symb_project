Solutions of glutaraldehyde (GTA) and ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) can both be used for low-temperature disinfection of endoscopes. Currently, GTA is being replaced by OPA (an aromatic dialdehyde) at the San Matteo Hospital, as OPA is less dangerous for health care workers than GTA, but has a similar capacity to kill viruses, bacteria and spores. The aim of the study was to compare air levels of GTA and OPA in several endoscopy units at our hospital. The air samples were analysed by means of both Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) and HPLC-UV (High Performance Liquid Chromatography with UV detection). The HPLC method gave a much lower aldehyde value when using OPA (8.4 micrograms/m3) compared to that obtained when GTA was used to disinfect endoscopes (21.279.3 micrograms/m3). Both HPLC and IR methods detected low levels of OPA in air, the mean values being below 10 micrograms/m3. In addition, we studied the resistance of various types of gloves to OPA. Tests showed that OPA permeated vinyl gloves more rapidly (26,628 ng/cm2 per hour) than nitrile gloves (13.9 ng/cm2 per hour).
