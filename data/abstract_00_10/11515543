Yeast is an excellent model system of eukaryotes for the study of molecular mechanisms of ATP-binding cassette transporters. Pdr5 protein is a yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP-binding cassette transporter conferring resistance to several unrelated drugs. Here, we described a novel drug screening system designated to detect compounds that inhibit the function of Pdr5. An indicator strain with increased drug sensitivity was constructed with an ergosterol-deficient background (delta syr1/erg3 null mutation). The sensitivity of the indicator strain (delta syr1/erg3 delta pdr5 delta snq2) to the Pdr5 substrates, cycloheximide and cerulenin, was increased 16-fold and 4-fold against wild type, respectively. The screening system is mainly based on the growth inhibition of the PDR5-overexpressed indicator strain with the combination of a sample and cycloheximide or cerulenin. The effect of an mdr inhibitor, FK506 on the screening system was clearly detected even at a low concentration (approximately 0.5 microg/ml). In addition, accumulation of rhodamine 6G in the cells was detected as a result of Pdr5 inhibition by FK506. These results indicated that the screening system is useful for a sensitive screening of Pdr5-specific inhibitors with low toxicity.
