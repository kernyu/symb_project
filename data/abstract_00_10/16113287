Neisseria gonorrhoeae acetylates its cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) at the C-6 position on N-acetylmuramic acid. To understand the effects of PG acetylation on PG metabolism and release of PG fragments, we have made mutations in the genes responsible for PG acetylation. An insertion mutation in a putative PG acetylase gene (designated pacA) resulted in loss of PG acetylation as detected by a high-performance liquid chromatography-based assay. Sequence analysis of a naturally occurring non-acetylating strain revealed the presence of a 26-bp deletion in pacA. Introduction of the deletion mutation into wild-type gonococci resulted in lack of acetylation, and the phenotype was complemented by the addition of a wild-type copy of pacA at a distant location on the chromosome. Mutations were also introduced into three genes downstream of pacA. The gene directly downstream of pacA was required for acetylation and was designated pacB, whereas the next two genes were not required. Sequences highly similar to pacA and pacB were also found in N. meningitidis and N. lactamica strains, and an insertion in the meningococcal pacA eliminated PG acetylation. Phenotypic analyses of an N. gonorrhoeae pacA mutant did not show any decrease in lysozyme resistance or serum resistance, and the release of PG fragments during growth was unchanged. However, purified PG from the wild-type strain was significantly more resistant to the action of human lysozyme than was PG purified from the pacA mutant. Interestingly, the pacA mutant was more sensitive to EDTA, a compound known to trigger autolysis.
