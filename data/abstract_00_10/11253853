STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and antiviral effect of protease inhibitors (PIs) over 36 months in pediatric patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). DESIGN: Observational study SETTING: Pediatric immunodeficiency clinic. PATIENTS: Twenty-one children. INTERVENTION: Demographics, dosage regimens, genotype data, viral RNA and CD4+ lymphocyte counts, adverse drug events (ADEs), laboratory tests, and compliance were evaluated over 3 years. Data were analyzed by chi2, repeated measures analysis of variance, and paired t tests. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one pediatric patients (aged 3 mo-15 yrs) received PIs over the study period. Average daily doses were ritonavir 26 mg/kg in 12 patients, nelfinavir 94 mg/kg in 16, indinavir 49 mg/kg in 5, and saquinavir 43 mg/kg in 4. Five patients developed resistance to an existing PI. Overall compliance was 70%. Baseline HIV-1 RNA plasma concentrations were significantly higher than average follow-up concentrations during 3-36 months in patients taking ritonavir (p<0.001) and nelfinavir (p<0.001). Sample size was insufficient for indinavir or saquinavir. Sixty ADEs occurred, diarrhea being most common. Of patients with ADEs, 55% required increased monitoring and 43% treatment. Ritonavir was associated with the most ADEs (28), followed by nelfinavir (16), indinavir (11), and saquinavir (5). Significant increases between baseline and follow-up cholesterol levels were found with ritonavir (p=0.02) and nelfinavir (p=0.001), and for serum creatinine (p=0.02) and triglycerides (p=0.02) with ritonavir. Follow-up triglycerides were significantly higher than baseline for indinavir (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Nelfinavir and ritonavir were effective in decreasing HIV-1 viral loads and improving CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Ritonavir was associated with more ADEs than other PIs. Changes in cholesterol, serum creatinine, and triglycerides were noted with some PIs.
