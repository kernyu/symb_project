The release of nitric oxide (NO) from polymers has proven to be highly effective at inhibiting platelet adhesion and thus enhancing the blood compatibility of medical implants. Micropatterning techniques were used to design surfaces that release NO while preserving the underlying substrate for other applications (e.g., sensors). Micropatterned NO-releasing substrates based on aminosilane-containing methyltrimethoxysilane sol-gels were prepared and characterized in terms of stability, NO surface flux, and resistance to in vitro platelet adhesion. We have found that surface-localized NO release from substrates modified with sol-gel micropatterns exhibit enhanced blood compatibility relative to controls.
