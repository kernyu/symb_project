One hundred eight vaginal lactobacilli were isolated from Korean women and characterized in terms of their antibiotics susceptibility and PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism) pattern. The in vitro antibiotics susceptibilities of 108 vaginal isolates to 13 antimicrobial agents were determined by broth dilution method based on NCCLS reference protocol. High rates of resistance were demonstrated for gentamicin, kanamycin, metronidazole, and streptomycin whereas all the isolates were susceptible to erythromycin. The concentrations of gentamicin, kanamycin, metronidazole, streptomycin, and erythromycin at which 90% of the vaginal isolates were inhibited (MIC90) were 100, 200, >200, 200 and 0.39 microg/mL, respectively. For molecular identification, PCR-RFLP analysis was employed where the 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR and the PCR products were digested with 8 different restriction endonucleases prior to being electrophoresed in agarose gels. Based on PCR-RFLP results, approximately half of the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus crispatus. Several isolates were further identified by DNA sequence analysis of their 16S rDNA.
