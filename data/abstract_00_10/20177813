We studied the effect of sodium selenate on insulin resistance of Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. Rats were kept on standard laboratory chow with and without i.p. injections of sodium selenate (0.173 mg/kg body weight) for 14 days, and then subjected to the glucose clamp. The glucose clamp studies confirmed an improvement in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in GK rats treated with sodium selenate, with respect to both insulin sensitivity and responsiveness. This amelioration of insulin resistance may be partly due to a direct effect of the sodium selenate on peripheral tissues. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake in sodium selenate-treated adipocytes was increased and the insulin findings suggest that sodium selenate increases not only insulin sensitivity but also insulin responsiveness. Sodium selenate also accelerated glucose incorporation into adipocytes of rats, suggesting that the action of sodium selenate is peripheral. Interestingly, sodium selenate at a high concentration (about 1 mmol/L) was more effective than insulin in enhancing glucose uptake. The present study suggested that sodium selenate treatment led to substantial improvement in peripheral insulin resistance.
