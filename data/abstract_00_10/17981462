A series of original 4-aryl-substituted 2-trichloromethylquinazoline derivatives was synthesized using a microwave-assisted Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling approach. Antiplasmodial activity was evaluated on both chloroquino-resistant and -sensitive Plasmodium falciparum strains, and the selectivity indexes for THP1 and HepG2 human cells were also calculated, revealing their antiplasmodial potential.
