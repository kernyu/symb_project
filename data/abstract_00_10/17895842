OBJECTIVES: Suicide gene therapy with FCY1 gene, encoding cytosine deaminase (CD), together with FUR1, encoding uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT), has been proposed for pancreatic cancer therapy in vivo. We ascertained whether gene therapy with FCY1-FUR1 is effective in killing pancreatic cancer cells after 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) treatment. METHODS: AsPC1, BxPC3, Capan1, MIA PaCa2, and Panc1 cell lines were transfected using 2 plasmid vectors expressing CD only (pRSV-CD) or the chimera CD-UPRT (pRSV-CD-UPRT). Control and pRSV-CD- or pRSV-CD-UPRT-transfected cell lines were treated with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mM of 5-FC for 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 13 days. RESULTS: FCY1 alone did not confer sensitivity to 5-FC. The CD-UPRT-transfected BxPC3 and Panc1 were sensitive to very low 5-FC doses (0.1 mM). 5-Fluorocytosine-sensitive transfected cell lines rapidly converted 5-FC into 5-fluorouracil, whereas the 5-FC resistant cell lines had an impaired 5-FC conversion. CONCLUSIONS: Suicide gene therapy with the FCY1 gene alone was ineffective in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in vitro. The pRSV-CD-UPRT construct conferred 5-FC sensitivity to some pancreatic cancer cell lines. Therefore, the application in vivo of suicide gene therapy with FCY1 alone or in combination with the FUR1 gene is probably destined to fail.
