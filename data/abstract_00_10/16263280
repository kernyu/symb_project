A library of acylhydrazone iron chelators was synthesized and tested for its ability to inhibit the growth of a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Some of these new compounds are significantly more active than desferrioxamine DFO, the iron chelator in widespread clinical use and also than the most effective chelators.
