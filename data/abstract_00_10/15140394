Mature dairy cattle were sampled over a 2-year period (2001-2002) on six farms in New Mexico and Texas. Fecal samples (n = 1560) were collected via rectal palpation and cultured for Salmonella, and one isolate from each positive sample was serotyped. Three isolates of each serotype, with the exception of Salmonella Newport (n = 12), were examined for susceptibility to 17 antimicrobial agents. Twenty-two different serotypes were identified from a total of 393 Salmonella isolates. Montevideo was the predominant serotype (27%) followed by Mbandaka (15%), Senftenberg (11.4%), Newport (6.4%), Anatum (4.8%), and Give (4.8%). Salmonella Typhimurium and Dublin, two frequently reported serotypes, accounted for only 1% of the observed serotypes in this study. Sixty-four percent of the serotypes were susceptible to all 17 antimicrobials, 14% were resistant to a single agent, and 22% were multiresistant (2-11 types of resistance). All isolates tested were susceptible to amikacin, apramycin, imipenem, ceftriaxone, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin. The most frequent types of resistance were to sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, streptomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin (ranging from 8.9 to 22.4%). Serotypes demonstrating multiple resistance included Dublin and Give (resistant to three or more antibiotics), Typhimurium (resistant to five antibiotics), and Newport (four and two isolates resistant to six and nine antibiotics, respectively). Class 1 integrons were present in only two Salmonella Dublin isolates and one Salmonella Newport isolate. The most prevalent resistance patterns observed in this study were toward antimicrobial agents commonly used in cattle, while all Salmonella isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin, antibiotics used in human medicine.
