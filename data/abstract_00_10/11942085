Both wild-type virulent and mutant strains of pseudorabies virus (PrV) were used in this study. Mutants used were derived from the plaque purified strain PrVmAIP. A total of six drug resistant mutants, three bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) resistant and three iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) resistant, respectively, were isolated and passaged in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells. The DNA of these PrVs were compared with the wild-type isolates by means of the restriction fragment pattern (RFP) findings produced with Bam HI, Kpn I, Hind III and Bgl II restriction enzymes (RE). Compared to the wild-type PrVs (PrV-VBA1-parental strain of PrVmAIP; PrV-VBA2; PrV-VBA3), the RFP of PrVmAIP showed the presence of mutations within the RE sites studied. Both PrV-VBA1 and PrV-VBA2 appeared to be closely related but their RFPs differed from PrV-VBA3. Significant differences either in the number, size or migrations of the DNA fragments could also be detected in the BUdR resistant strains. Even though different features of cytopathic effect (GPE) were observed in the IUdR resistant PrVs, the RFP findings remained identical. The PrVs studied showed considerable differences from the reference PrV (PrV-CD).
