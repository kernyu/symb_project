Drug-resistant (including multidrug-resistant) bacteria increase continuously with the wide use of antibiotics, which have seriously threatened the human health. It is an important way to fight against drug-resistance by screening and developing novel drugs based on the various mechanisms of the bacterial drug tolerances. Meanwhile, the basic research related to the new drug R. & D. and studies on the new screening methods for the antimicrobial agents should be taken seriously and strengthened, so as to accelerate the process of finding new drugs and meet the challenge of new pathogens and new drug-resistant strains.
