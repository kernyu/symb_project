The synthesis of 9-substituted tetracycline derivatives has been accomplished by the reaction of C9 diazonium tetrafluoroborate tetracycline salts with organotin reagents under modified Stille coupling conditions. Several of these unreported derivatives show promising in vitro biological activity against tetracycline resistant and antibiotic resistant bacteria.
