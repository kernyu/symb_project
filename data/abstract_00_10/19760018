PURPOSE: To establish a model of Candida albicans biofilms and to examine the effect of matrine on C.albicans biofilms and ultrastructure. METHODS: C. albicans collection strain ATCC76615 was obtained and propagated. Biofilms were formed in 96-well microtiter plates. Antifungal susceptibility testing of C. albicans biofilms were assessed with the tetrazolium salt (XTT) reduction assay. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and dead/live fluorescent staining technique were combined to detect the effects of Matrine on preformed C. albican biofilms' composition and ultrastructure. RESULTS: Matrine was active against different growth stages (early,middle,mature) of biofilms; The bioactivity and drug-resistance of C. albican biofilm increased with culturing time. CLSM showed that C. albicans biofilms were inhibited and growth were predominantly composed of yeast cells and pseudohyphae. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Matrine has potent activity against C.albicans biofilms in vitro and potential therapeutic implication for biofilm-associated candidal infections.
