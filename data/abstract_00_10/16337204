In plants, the ABC transporter PDR (pleiotropic drug resistance) subfamily is composed of approximately 15 genes, few of which have been analyzed. We have identified NtPDR3, a Nicotiana tabacum PDR gene belonging to a cluster for which no functional data was previously available. NtPDR3 was found to be induced in suspension cells treated with methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, 1-naphthalene acetic acid, or cembrene, a macrocyclic diterpene. In agreement with the identification of a putative iron deficiency element in the NtPDR3 transcription promoter region, we found that iron deficiency in the culture medium induced NtPDR3 expression, thus suggesting a new function of the PDR transporter family.
