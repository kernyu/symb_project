Broad use of antiretroviral drugs is becoming a factor that is important to consider for understanding the HIV-1 epidemiology. Since 1993, we observe that a proportion of new infections within major risk groups in Amsterdam is caused by azidothymidine (AZT)-resistant viruses. After the introduction of combination therapy in The Netherlands in 1997, new infections with drug-resistant viruses have not been documented. Large-scale monitoring of anti-HIV-1 therapy failures revealed that antiretroviral drugs may yield previously undescribed resistant viruses, which contain a two amino acid insertion (68SS/V69) within their reverse transcriptase genes in combination with mutations at codons 67 and 215. These viruses are highly resistant to AZT, 3TC, and d4T, and moderately resistant to ddI and ddC.
