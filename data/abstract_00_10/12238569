We aimed to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of 28 Bacillus anthracis strains isolated from cutaneous anthrax cases to various antimicrobial agents using the Sceptor automatic system in an anthrax endemic area. All strains tested were susceptible to penicillin (MIC < or = 0.03 microg/ml). Piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems showed good activity towards all strains. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefepime had no activity. Strains were also tested with other antimicrobials.
