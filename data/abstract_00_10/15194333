OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of infections caused by multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria on the clinical outcome of liver transplant recipients. METHODS: Retrospective study including all episodes of bacterial infection diagnosed in patients undergoing liver transplantation from January 19, 1999, to June 30, 2002. The diagnosis of bacterial infection required microbiological documentation. Mortality associated with episodes of infection by MDR bacteria was compared to that observed after antibiotic-susceptible bacterial infections. RESULTS: Among 99 patients undergoing liver transplantation during the study period, there were 57 episodes of bacterial infections. Gram-negative bacilli were the predominant etiologic agents (76%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent bacterial species found in these cases (23 isolates, 28%). Thirty-six episodes of infection (63%) were caused by MDR bacteria. Mean time after transplantation to the diagnosis of infection was 17 days. Mortality associated with episodes of MDR bacterial infections (nine deaths, 25%) was not significantly different from that observed during episodes of antibiotic-susceptible bacteria (five deaths, 24%; P =.92). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents does not have an impact on the mortality associated to bacterial infections in liver transplant recipients.
