AIMS OF THE STUDY: This study examines the activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem compound compared with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin+tazobactam, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole against 316 anaerobes. METHODS: Inoculum preparation and agar dilution method were performed according to the CLSI method for anaerobes (M11A7). RESULTS: At a concentration of 4mug/ml doripenem and imipenem (IMP) inhibited 122 (96 %) and 126 (99 %) strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, respectively. In contrast, doripenem appeared more potent than IMP against Gram-positive anaerobes inhibiting at the same concentration of 4mug/ml 145/145 strains (100 %) versus 115/145 for IMP (79.3 %). Against 316 anaerobic strains, the carbapenem doripenem had an MIC(50) of 0.25mug/ml and an MIC(90) of 2mug/ml. Results were similar to those for imipenem (MIC(50) of 0.125mug/ml and MIC(90) of 4mug/ml). If we consider the resistant breakpoints of the two carbapenems as defined by EUCAST, the resistance rate for doripenem (MIC>4mug/ml) 1.6 % is similar to that of imipenem (MIC>8mug/ml) 1.3 %. CONCLUSION: Thus independently of the PK/PD parameters the two carbapenems demonstrated very close activity; doripenem was more potent on Gram-positive anaerobes and slightly less potent against Gram-negative anaerobes mainly the B. fragilis group. Further clinical studies are needed to assess its usefulness in patients.
