PURPOSE/METHOD: To report a clinical case of a 21-year old male with a severe corneal abscess due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa refractory to intensive treatment with topical Ciprofloxacin. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: A corneal scrapping performed after a wash-out period showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa specimens, which were not sensitive to any of the fluoroquinolones tested. A fortified topical treatment with Ceftazidime healed the corneal abscess. Nowadays, the possibility of resistance to fluoroquinolones should be kept in mind, and we recommend treatment guided by the results of a microbiological study in severe and sight-threatening cases.
