Specific primer pairs were selected for the PCR amplification of 14 tetracycline resistant genes commonly found in Gram positive and Gram negative organisms. Combinations of primer pairs were used in multiplex PCR reactions to detect specific groups of tet genes as follows; Group I tet (B), tet (C), tet (D); Group II tet (A), tet (E), tet (G); Group III tet (K), tet (L), tet (M), tet (O), tet (S); Group IV tetA (P), tet (Q), tet (X). To test the multiplex PCR, Groups I and II were used on 25 clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104. Group III primers were used to investigate 19 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Multiplex PCR should result in significant savings in terms of labour and cost in analysis of a large number of strains when compared with using an individual PCR for targeting each gene. It may also be a useful method to differentiate the types of tetracycline resistance when used as an additional marker for the purpose of outbreak investigation and surveillance.
