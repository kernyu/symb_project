Resistance of Teladorsagia circumcincta in goats to ivermectin In 2005, suspected ivermectin resistance of gastrointestinal nematodes was investigated in 17 goats on a farm in the Netherlands, using a faecal egg count reduction test combined with faecal larval cultures. Eight goats were treated orally with 0.2 mg/ kg ivermectin on 1 August 2005 and the other nine goats served as untreated controls. Faeces were collected from all goats on 1 August and on 12 August. Faecal egg counts were reduced by 80.6% in goats receiving ivermectin. On the basis of faecal larval cultures and the egg counts, ivermectin was found to be 100% effective against Haemonchus contortus, 15.0% effective against Teladorsagia circumcincta, and 93.3% effective against Trichostrongylus spp. The effect of levamisole and oxfendazole on gastrointestinal nematodes was also evaluated. Nine goats were treated subcutaneously with 5 mg/kg levamisole and seven goats orally with 4.5 mg/kg oxfendazole on 12 September On the basis of faecal egg counts performed on 12 and 22 September, levamisole reduced the total egg count by 95.4% and oxfendazole reduced the egg count by 85.8%. Differentiation of pooled faecal larval cultures revealed that levamisole was 99.9% effective against H. contortus, 81.9% effective against T. circumcincta, and 99.5% against Trichostrongylus spp. Oxfendazole was 75.5% effective against H. contortus, 33.2% effective against T. circumcincta, and 100% effective against Trichostrongylus spp. On 28 October the nine goats that were still present on the farm were orally treated with 0.4 mg/kg ivermectin. Faecal egg counts and differentiation of pooled larval cultures of faecal samples collected on 28 October and 9 November, respectively, revealed that total egg counts were reduced by 93.1%. Ivermectin was 49.1% effective against T. circumcincta but 100% effective against H. contortus and Trichostrongylus spp. Thus H. contortus appears to be resistant to oxfendazole and T. circumcinta appears to be resistant to oxfendazole and ivermectin. This is the first documented case of ivermectin resistance of a gastrointestinal nematode of small ruminants in the Netherlands.
