A multidrug-resistant strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in The Netherlands during a nosocomial outbreak among 36 patients who mainly had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After the commencement of barrier nursing and short-term ceftriaxone-rifampin eradication therapy, the epidemic ceased. However, eradication therapy failed in 3 patients, and follow-up investigation of these patients showed the emergence of rifampin-resistant isolates.
