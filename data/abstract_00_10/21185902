Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) develops after cessation of alcohol intake in alcoholic patients characterizing psychiatric symptoms and changes in autonomous nervous systems. We studied cardiovascular changes during different phases of AWS (1, 2, 3 and 10 days after admission for detoxification; n=34) and compared them with those in early recovery (at least 1 month of abstinence; n=30). The results study showed that cardiovascular system underwent significant changes during AWS characterizing the decrease of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and total peripheral resistance. Stroke index was lower during AWS than in early recovery. As the decreased stroke index was compensated by increased heart rate, cardiac index did not differ during AWS from that in early recovery. Increased functioning of noradrenaline (along with other central and peripheral regulating mechanisms) may be an important factor associated with cardiovascular changes in AWS. Normalization of this function after AWS leads to returning of cardiovascular parameters to baseline levels.
