Two patients presented with the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), which had developed slowly and progressively. One patient underwent brain imaging of the dopaminergic system, the results of which were compatible with PD. However, both patients showed no response to L-dopa or oral dopaminergic medication. They also had optic nerve atrophy of unknown etiology. The severe motor symptoms of both patients were conspicuously alleviated by apomorphine delivered subcutaneously. One patient underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, which also proved effective.
