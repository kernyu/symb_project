IgA multiple myeloma is the second most frequent variant of multiple myeloma. The median survival is about 3 years and depends on presence, or not, certain prognostic factors. Cytogenetic status has become the most important of them. The presence of the chromosome 13 deletion is an independent adverse prognostic marker in multiple myeloma and is associated with specific biological features. Patients with the chromosome 13 alterations are less likely to respond to treatment and have a shorter median overall survival. We present a case of IgA multiple myeloma, which was even resistant to new therapeutic strategies (thalidomide, bortezomib).
