Despite recent advances in antifungal therapy, the incidence of invasive Candida infections and resulting mortality have remained unchanged in the last few years. In surveillance studies published to date, the estimated incidence of candidemia differs depending on the geographic area and is significantly higher in North America than in Europe. The main predisposing conditions for candidemia are neutropenia, cellular immunity deficit, and alteration of normal microbial flora. Some independent risk factors have been identified, such as previous colonization, antibiotic therapy, central venous catheters, neutropenia, and renal dysfunction. In the last two decades, the proportion of infections due to non-albicans Candida has markedly increased. Although fluconazole use has been considered one of the main causes for the epidemiologic change in invasive candidiasis, especially in the increase of species less sensitive to this agent, this association remains unproven. These recent epidemiological changes are highly important when selecting treatment for candidemia. The echinocandins, which include anidulafungin, represent a step forward in the treatment of these infections. The clinical efficacy, tolerability and safety of anidulafungin have been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials in candidemia and invasive candidiasis. Current recommendations include this antifungal agent in the initial empirical therapy of certain patients, especially in those with a critical clinical situation, previous azole exposure, or the possibility of developing adverse events or drug interactions.
