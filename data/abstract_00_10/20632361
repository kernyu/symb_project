A new class of specific breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors was identified, showing no inhibition of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters P-gp and MRP1. Some of these modulators inhibit BCRP with high potency; they are only slightly less potent than Ko143 and could serve as promising lead structures for the design of novel effective BCRP inhibitors. These inhibitors are structurally related to tariquidar (XR9576) and belong to a library of multidrug-resistance modulators synthesized by our research group. The absence of the tetrahydroisoquinoline substructure appears to play a crucial role for specificity; we found that the presence of this substructure is not essential for interaction with BCRP. To determine the type of interaction between pheophorbide A and compounds with and without the tetrahydroisoquinoline substructure, various substrate pheophorbide A concentrations were used in enzyme kinetics assays. The resulting data show that these compounds share a noncompetitive-type interaction with pheophorbide A. Experiments with imatinib and pheophorbide A revealed a mixed-type interaction. The combination of imatinib and compounds with and without the tetrahydroisoquinoline substructure resulted in a positive cooperative effect, indicating that imatinib engages a binding site distinct from that of the new compounds on one side and distinct from that of pheophorbide A on the other side as well. The results of this study suggest that the category of BCRP-specific inhibitors, which includes only fumitremorgin C, Ko143 and analogues, and novobiocin needs to be extended by this new class of inhibitors, which possess three key characteristics: specificity, potency, and low toxicity.
