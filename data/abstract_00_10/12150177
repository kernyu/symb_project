BACKGROUND: Lipodystrophy syndrome in HIV-infected adults is characterized by a variety of physical and/or metabolic abnormalities, including fat redistribution, hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia) and peripheral insulin resistance. Many studies suggest that antiretroviral therapy is the underlying cause of the condition. Few data exist for HIV-infected children. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study evaluating HIV-infected children age 2 to 16 years. Fat redistribution was identified by physical examination and parental questionnaire. Fasting blood analysis included cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin and C-peptide. RESULTS: Forty HIV-infected children were recruited. Seven children (18%) exhibited physical signs of fat redistribution. Twenty-seven (68%), 11 (28%) and 3 (8%) children exhibited evidence for hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance, respectively. Eleven children (28%) had no physical signs or laboratory evidence of lipodystrophy. Statistical analysis did not reveal any significant association between the presence of lipodystrophic features and patient age, HIV-1 viral load, exposure to specific antiretroviral medications or duration of protease inhibitor or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy. Drug dosing was significantly associated with the development of lipodystrophy features. Children receiving pediatric dosing regimens vs. adult dosing regimens were less likely to develop lipodystrophy (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Features associated with lipodystrophy syndrome arise in some HIV-infected children. Subjects receiving pediatric dosing regimens were less likely than those receiving adult regimens to develop lipodystrophy.
