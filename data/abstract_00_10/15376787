Combined effects of arbekacin (ABK) with biapenem (BIPM) were examined on both in vitro and in vivo model of a mixture of MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As a result, significant effect in vitro was observed in combined use of ABK (1/2 MIC) with BIPM (1/4 and 1/2 MIC) against MRSA as compared with ABK or BIPM alone. Against P. aeruginosa combined effect was also observed, showing reduction of viable cells to the limitation of detection within 2 hours. Moreover, with respect to the protective effect on mixed systemic infection of MRSA and P. aeruginosa, the combined treatment with ABK and BIPM showed more excellent efficacy as compared with the single use of each drug.
