Toxicity, adherence problems, and virological failure may limit treatment by protease inhibitor-containing regimens at standard doses. Addition of low-dose ritonavir results in a high plasma concentration of coadministered protease inhibitor resulting in decreased pill burden, a reduction in the number of doses, fewer food and/or fluid restrictions, and a higher rate of virological suppression. These effects are due to improved pharmacokinetics of coadministered protease inhibitors.
