The microbicidal action spectrum of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is broad - even after short onset times. Unlike local antibiotics and other antiseptic substances, no resistance develops. The high degree of bactericidal efficiency in respect of highly resistant gram-positive pathogenic micro-organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococcus strains, is particularly significant for hospital hygiene. An in vitro study with 10 genotypically different MRSA isolates showed an optimum bactericidal effect (logarithmic reduction factor value >5) without protein load after just 30 s exposure and even in a dilution of Betaisodona solution (Mundipharma GmbH) of 1%. With protein load (0.2% albumin), the optimum in microbicidal effectiveness shifts to concentrations > or = 10% Betaisodona solution referring to an exposure time of 30 s. Since recent results are now also available on the toxicological safety of PVP-I preparations for the ciliated epithelium of the nasal mucosa and the good tolerability on skin and other mucous membranes is a known factor, a controlled clinical study is currently being carried out to eliminate colonizations of MRSA. Evidence has also recently been produced of the antiviral activity of PVP-I against herpes simplex, adeno- and enteroviruses, as well as its high degree of efficiency against Chlamydia. Hence alongside the classical fields of application, such as the disinfection of the skin and hands, mucosa antisepsis and wound treatment, there are also useful indications for the substance, i.e. rinsing of body cavities and joints and application to the eye.
