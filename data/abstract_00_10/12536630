Adenosine triphosphate is a kind of necessary metabolites in living cells. The authors detected ATP contents by using bioluminescence method in 111 strains of L-form bacteria after exposing to 5 kinds of antibiotics. The results showed that the mean value of CPM was less than (35 +/- 10.2)%.s-1. Thus, the value could be acted as a critical concentration between susceptibility and resistance. The conincidence rate of this method and K-B method was 95.3%. It indicates that the bioluminescence method has a high sensitivity. It can be used to detect L-form bacterium-drug susceptibility quickly and may play an important role for choosing the antibiotics.
