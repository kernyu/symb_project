The categorical agreement among MIC results for the fluoroquinolones tested (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin and gemifloxacin) was high (99.16-99.85%), and error rates were nil or very low when 1 compound was used as a surrogate for predicting susceptibility (not resistance) to another agent in the class. No error was observed when levofloxacin was selected as the group surrogate for pneumococcal testing.
