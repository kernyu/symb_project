Genetic heterogeneity and drug susceptibility patterns of 43 Candida albicans isolates from patients with respiratory infections in China were compared with those of 52 isolates from Japanese patients. Of the 43 strains, 17 were genotype A, 17 were genotype B, 8 were genotype C, and 1 was genotype E. Drug susceptibilities against amphotericin B, flucytosine, 3 azoles, and micafungin of the 43 strains and the 52 Japanese isolates were compared. All strains in China were susceptible to all drugs tested, and susceptibility patterns of the two countries were similar. Four Japanese isolates showed trailing growth for azole antifungals; Chinese strains did not.
