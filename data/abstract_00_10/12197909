For the therapeutic management of Helicobacter pylori infection, the Maastricht 2-2000 Consensus Report have introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. According to this consensus statement, the first-line therapy for H. pylori eradication is a combination of the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) and claritromycin plus either amoxicillin or metronidazole. The second-line treatment is suggested to be PPI-quadruple therapy for a minimum of 7 days. If bismuth compounds are not available, PPI-based triple therapy will have to be used as a second-line treatment only after susceptibility testing. Since no considerable progress has been made during the past year in treatment regimens, there is still a need for new compounds that are specific for H. pylori, which could constitute future therapies.
