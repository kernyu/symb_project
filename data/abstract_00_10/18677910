UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and antifungal susceptibility profile of Cryptococcus spp. isolated from patients in northeast Romania. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Fungi isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were identified by ID32C strips (bioMerieux, France). Susceptibility testing was performed using ATB FUNGUS2 strips (bioMerieux, France). RESULTS: A total of 20 significant strains have been isolated. Overall, Cryptococcus neoformans was the most frequent isolate (95%). We mention the first Cryptococcus albidus meningitis in Romania (strain with multiple resistance). All cryptococci tested were susceptible to amphotericin B with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) =1 microg/mL; 90% strains were susceptible to flucytosine. Resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was observed in 2 and 1 case, respectively. Most of the patients had an associated infection, tuberculosis in 37.5% cases. Despite appropriate therapy 4 patients died (21%). CONCLUSION: First choice induction therapy with amphotericin B plus flucytosine followed by fluconazole is highly recommended since resistance to antifungal agents is still very low.
