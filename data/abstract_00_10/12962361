The in vitro activity of telithromycin, a new ketolide, was compared with beta-lactam antimicrobials against pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections. These pathogens were collected during 1999-2000 as part of the ongoing PROTEKT surveillance study. Globally, penicillin nonsusceptibility among Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3362) was 36.3%, ranging from 21.5% (Australasia) to 68.0% (Far East). Telithromycin showed higher potency (MIC90 0.12 mg/L) than beta-lactams against S. pneumoniae; 99.9% of all and 99.6% of multi-resistant isolates were susceptible to telithromycin. Among Streptococcus pyogenes isolates (n = 1485), 100% were susceptible to beta-lactams, and the telithromycin MIC50 and MIC90 were both 0.015 mg/L. Among Haemophilus influenzae (n = 2948), 16.6% produced beta-lactamase, which reduced the activity of ampicillin, cefaclor and cefprozil. 99.9% of H. influenzae were susceptible to telithromycin and the MIC range for M. catarrhalis was 0.004-0.5 mg/L. The first year results of PROTEKT confirmed high potency for telithromycin against common respiratory tract pathogens, including beta-lactam-resistant strains.
