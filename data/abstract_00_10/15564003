Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections in many countries, and multiple factors contribute to the ability of these bacteria to disseminate and spread in hospitals. In Brazil it has been demonstrated that a multiresistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus clone, the so-called Brazilian epidemic clone, is widespread geographically. This clone was first detected in 1992 in Brazil, and recently from many other countries within South America, Europe and Asia. The study describes the detection of a gentamicin-susceptible heterogeneous MRSA clone that resembles another MRSA clone widely spread in US and Japanese hospitals, and supports the premise that the detection of heterogeneous MRSA isolates by some recommended methods is a challenging task that may, occasionally, result in MRSA misidentification.
