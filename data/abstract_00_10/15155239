We determined the prevalence of erythromycin-resistant bacteria in the oral cavity and identified mef and erm(B) as the most common resistance determinants. In addition, we demonstrate the genetic linkage, on various Tn1545-like conjugative transposons, between erythromycin and tetracycline resistance in a number of isolates.
