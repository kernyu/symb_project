The relationship between virulence and chromosomal elements containing glycopeptide resistance genes was experimentally assessed for two transconjugant strains of Enterococcus faecalis (VanA and VanB phenotypes) and compared to that for a susceptible wild-type strain. Microbiologic and inflammatory effects were assessed in a polymicrobial rat model of peritonitis. Mean peritoneal enterococcus concentrations +/- standard deviations at day 1 were 2.1 +/- 1.9, 1.3 +/- 1.1, and 1.7 +/- 2.0 log(10) CFU/ml for susceptible, VanA, and VanB strains, respectively (P < 0.05). At day 3 also there were lower concentrations of glycopeptide-resistant enterococcal strains in peritoneal fluid (3.2 +/- 3.4, 1.8 +/- 1.8, and 2.1 +/- 2.4 log(10) CFU/ml for susceptible, VanA, and VanB strains, respectively [P < 0.05]). Transconjugant glycopeptide-resistant strains were associated with increased peritoneal cell counts at the different evaluation times of the experiment (P < 0.001). Plasma alpha1-acid glycoprotein concentrations were lower in the presence of the susceptible strain (667 +/- 189 mg/liter) than in the presence of the VanA or VanB strain (1,193 +/- 419 or 1,210 +/- 404 mg/liter, respectively [P < 0.05]), while concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 in peritoneal fluid remained similar for the strains. These results suggest a trend toward variation of virulence of transconjugant strains compared to the wild-type strain in this peritonitis model.
