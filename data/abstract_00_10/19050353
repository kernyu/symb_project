Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a major cause of pediatric pharyngotonsillitis. In this study we determined the T serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility of GAS isolates from Japanese children. From January to December 2006, a total of 438 isolates of GAS were obtained from pharyngeal swabs of 438 children with pharyngotonsillitis. The commonest T serotype was type 1 (110 strains, 25.1%), followed by type 12 (107, 24.4%) and type 4 (77, 17.6%). All GAS isolated from pharyngeal swabs were susceptible to beta-lactams (benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, panipenem, and cefditoren) and vancomycin, but 19.6, 19.6, 3.2, 11.6, and 27.6% were resistant to erythromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, minocycline, and norfloxacin, respectively. Resistance varied considerably with the T serotype. In particular, type 4 isolates had the highest resistance (67.5, 67.5, 26.0, and 53.2% were resistant to erythromycin, clarithromycin, minocycline, and norfloxacin, respectively).
