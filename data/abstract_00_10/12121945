Salicylate induces multiple antibiotic resistance in various bacterial species. Here we investigated the effect of salicylate on the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to a range of antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs. In the presence of salicylate, the killing effects of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RMP), ethambutol (EMB), streptomycin (STR), and p-aminosalicylate (PAS) were reduced, as shown with a tetrazolium redox dye viability assay and a bacterial survival assay. Salicylate-induced resistance was more pronounced for PAS, STR, and EMB but was not apparent for INH and RMP when salicylate and the anti-TB agents were incorporated into 7H11 plates. The significance of these findings for TB treatment needs to be further evaluated in vivo.
