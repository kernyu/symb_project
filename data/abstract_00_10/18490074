BACKGROUND/AIMS: The frequency of mixed hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes in chronic HBV (CHB) and genotype changes during natural disease evolution and as a result of antiviral therapy were investigated. METHODS: Serum samples from 103 CHB patients were included in a cross-sectional study. Longitudinal study of HBV genotypes was performed in 22 patients, 17 of them under antiviral therapy (lamivudine and/or adefovir). HBV genotyping was done by the INNO-LiPA HBV assay. RESULTS: Genotypes observed in the cross-sectional study: A 32% of cases, D 42%, C 2%, F 2%, and mixed genotypes 22% (mainly A/D, followed by A/G). Genotype G was found in 7% of patients, always combined with other genotypes. In the longitudinal study, genotype changes were observed only in treated patients (9 cases). Genotype A strains were positively selected in 6 of them, mainly as mixed A/D. In 6 patients, selection coincided with a decrease in HBV-DNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of mixed HBV genotypes was observed in our setting. Selection of genotype A strains during treatment is likely an indication that sensitivity to therapy differs between genotypes A and D. The absence of changes in untreated patients suggests that HBV genotype is stable without external factors.
