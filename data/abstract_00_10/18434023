Prevalence of anthelmintic resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) of goats has necessitated studies for alternative means of control. The objective was to determine the effectiveness of dietary copper sulfate for control of GIN in meat goats. Naturally infected buck kids received 0 (LC), 78 (MC) or 158 (HC) mg copper sulfate (CS)/kid daily mixed with concentrate supplement for 63 days. After 42 days the HC group was re-randomized into either the LC or MC treatment. In another study, naturally infected yearling does were offered trace mineral mix with and without CS and intake was estimated to be 140-200mg CS/day. Goats grazed bermudagrass pastures and were rotated among two or three pastures to minimize pasture effects. Fecal egg count (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV) were determined every 7 days in the first experiment and 14 days in the second experiment, and goats were weighed every 28 days. On Days 49 and 56 FEC were lower in the HC-treated kids (copper by day, P<0.02), but FEC were similar on all other days in the first experiment and were similar between the two groups of does in the second experiment. Blood packed cell volume was similar among treatment groups throughout both studies. Body weight was greater in LC compared with MC or HC-supplemented kids on Days 42 and 63 (copper by day, P<0.04). Body weights of does were similar on Days 0 and 56, but were reduced in those consuming trace mineral with CS on Day 28 (copper by day, P<0.03). Dietary CS failed to control GIN in this study.
