This editorial summarizes the mechanisms of mupirocin resistance and the conditions that promote its development. While there is increasing evidence that high-level mupirocin resistance is developing during systematic use of mupirocin as prophylaxis against Staphylococcus aureus, the appearance of resistance does not preclude the beneficial effect of regular prophylaxis. Vigilance has to be exercised to notice larger-scale resistance that may require limiting the use of mupirocin.
