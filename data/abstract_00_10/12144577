BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of patients with Helicobacter pylori resistant to metronidazole has not been established. AIM: To compare the efficacy of quadruple and furazolidone-based triple therapy in the eradication of H. pylori resistant to metronidazole. METHODS: Duodenal ulcer patients (n = 70) in whom initial eradication therapy failed and who harboured H. pylori strains resistant to metronidazole were randomized to receive one of the following 7-day regimens: colloidal bismuth subcitrate, 240 mg, tetracycline, 750 mg, and furazolidone, 200 mg, each given twice daily (BTF), or omeprazole, 20 mg b.d., colloidal bismuth subcitrate, 240 mg b.d., tetracycline, 500 mg q.d.s., and metronidazole, 500 mg b.d. (OBTM). H.pylori status was assessed by culture, histology and rapid urease test before treatment and 4-6 weeks after therapy. Susceptibility to metronidazole was assessed by the agar dilution method. RESULTS: H. pylori eradication rates with intention-to-treat/per protocol analyses were: BTF, 85.7%/90.9%; OBTM, 74.2%/89.6%. Duodenal ulcers were healed in nine of 10 (90%) patients in the BTF group and in all patients (12/12) (100%) in the OBTM group (P = N.S.). A significantly lower rate of adverse events was observed in the BTF group than in the OBTM group (31.4% vs. 60%, P = 0.03), but there was no difference in terms of discontinuation of treatment (2/35 vs. 6/35, P = N.S.). CONCLUSIONS: The 1-week BTF regimen was as effective as the OBTM regimen, and produced less adverse events. Thus, it may be used in patients in whom resistance of H. pylori to metronidazole is suspected.
