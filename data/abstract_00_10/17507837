OBJECTIVES AND GOAL: To clinically and microbiologically identify reproductive tract infections (RTI), including sexually transmitted infections (STI), and to monitor the antibiotic susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae among women attending a gynecology outpatient department in Vientiane, Laos. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and laboratory-based cross-sectional study. Women aged 15 to 49 years underwent a pelvic examination, and specimens were taken for laboratory testing. RESULTS: Of 1125 study participants, 82% clinically presented with an RTI syndrome. However, only 64% had an etiologically diagnosed RTI, including 11% with an STI. Endogenous infections were most prevalent (candidiasis 40%; bacterial vaginosis 25%), followed by STI [Chlamydia trachomatis 4.1%; N. gonorrhoeae (NG) and Trichomonas vaginalis, both 3.7%]. The 41 NG isolates showed 20% resistance to ciprofloxacin, 98% to penicillin, and complete to tetracycline. CONCLUSIONS: High RTI/STI level combined with high NG resistance emphasizes that concurrent with syndromic case management, periodic evaluations of etiological diagnosis should be available to ensure adequacy of treatment algorithms and prescribed medications.
