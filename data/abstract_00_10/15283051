OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of etoposide/ methotrexate/actinomycin D/etoposide/cisplatin (EMA/ EP) chemotherapy in patients with chemorefractory gestational trophoblastic tumor (GTT). STUDY DESIGN: Fifteen patients with chemorefractory GTT were treated with EMA/EP. RESULTS: Twelve of the 15 cases were choriocarcinoma, and the last 3 were metastatic placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT): International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, 2 cases; stage III, 10 cases; stage IV, 3 cases. Seven cases have FIGO score 7-10; the scores of the remaining 8 cases were > 10. Fifteen patients received a total of 93 cycles of the study regimen. The median number of courses for each patient was 6.2. Eleven cases (73.3%) achieved complete remission, while 3 (20%) had partial remission; 1 case (6.7%) showed no response. The main complications of EMA/EP chemotherapy were myelosuppression and gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: The EMA/EP regimen is effective for chemorefractory GTT, and the chemotherapeutic results can be improved when combined with surgery and arterial infusion chemotherapy in selected patients. The EMA/EP regimen should be considered for primary management of metastatic PSTT.
