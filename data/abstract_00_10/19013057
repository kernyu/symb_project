In this study, we examined the presence of integrons and Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) and assessed their contribution to antimicrobial resistance as well as determining the extent of the mutator phenotype in Salmonella isolates. A total of 81 Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium isolates were examined for the presence of integrons and SGI1 and for hypermutators using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the mutator assay, respectively. An additional 336 Salmonella isolates were also used to screen for hypermutators. Fourteen S. Typhimurium isolates carried class 1 integrons, of which six were shown to possess SGI1. Five putative mutators, S. Typhimurium ST20751, S. enterica serotype Heidelberg 22396 and S. enterica serotype Enteritidis 17929, 17929N and 17929R, were identified among the 417 Salmonella isolates. Complementation analysis with the wild-type mutH, mutL, mutS and uvrD genes indicated that none of the five mutators contained defective mismatch repair (MMR) system alleles. DNA sequence analysis revealed that single point mutations resulting in aspartic acid (codon 87) substitution in the gyrA gene conferred resistance to nalidixic acid and/or other fluoroquinolone drugs (ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin) among four isolates. Our findings indicated that integrons and SGI1 play an important role in multidrug resistance in Salmonella. The incidence of hypermutators owing to defective MMR in Salmonella appears to be rare.
