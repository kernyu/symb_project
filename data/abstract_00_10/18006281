We compared the efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin versus vancomycin, alone or in combination with rifampicin, in a rabbit model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced arthritis. Vancomycin, alone or in combination with rifampicin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin+rifampicin were significantly more effective than quinupristin/dalfopristin alone.
