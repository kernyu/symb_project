We investigated the efficacy of disinfection of the upper airway using povidone-iodine against nosocomial pneumonia in geriatric wards. Cases of nosocomial pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed between January 1991 and March 1995 in geriatric wards (190 beds). Moreover, the relationship concerning methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates between patient and environment was investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with the SmaI restriction enzyme. The incidence of nosocomial pneumonia decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Major causative organisms of nosocomial pneumonia were MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which significantly decreased. PFGE studies showed that the patterns of MRSA isolates show a strong association between patient and environment. Our study indicates that disinfection of the upper airways by povidone-iodine is very important in the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia in geriatric wards.
