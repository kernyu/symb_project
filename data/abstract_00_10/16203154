In an effort to develop new and more effective therapies to treat tuberculosis, a series of benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide derivatives were synthesized and their in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare was evaluated. One of the compounds, 8c, exhibited potent anti-tubercular activity, particularly for the resistant strains and thus prompted us to investigate its in vivo profile. However, the in vivo testing in a mouse model of tuberculosis infection did not show significant anti-tubercular activity, probably because of its poor bioavailability.
