With the advent of artemisinin resistance, it is timely to revisit the biological basis for the controversial suggestion that this class of antimalarial exerts its activity by inhibiting a calcium ATPase (PfATP6) that is most similar to sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCAs). Herein, evidence is discussed that relates to this hypothesis as alternative suggestions for how artemisinins might act have been reviewed elsewhere.
