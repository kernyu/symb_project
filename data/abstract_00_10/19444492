The aim of this study was to investigate the presence in the United Kingdom (UK) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates carrying pUO-StVR2-like virulence-resistance hybrid plasmids that originated from pSLT. One hundred and fifty ampicillin-resistant isolates of S. Typhimurium, collected in different regions of the UK during 2006, were screened for the presence of bla (OXA-1) carried by an InH-like integron (2000 bp/bla (OXA-1)-aadA1) characteristic of pUO-StVR2. Positive isolates were tested for the presence of a large plasmid that hybridised with probes specific for the bla (OXA-1) and spvC genes, used as resistance and virulence markers of the hybrid plasmid, respectively. Eleven out of the 150 isolates fulfilled both criteria and were assigned to the S. Typhimurium pUO-StVR2 group. Nine were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin/spectinomycin, sulfonamides and tetracycline, encoded by bla (OXA-1), catA1, aadA1-like, sul1 and tet(B), respectively, and carried a pUO-StVR2-like plasmid of ca. 130 kb. Two contained hybrid plasmids of smaller size and lacked resistance(s) to chloramphenicol or chloramphenicol and tetracycline. The eleven isolates, which showed five and six closely related XbaI and BlnI profiles, respectively, were resistant to nitrofurantoin. In conclusion, multidrug-resistant S. Typhimurium isolates of the pUO-StVR2 group, which are endemic in Spain, were also detected in the UK, albeit with a low frequency (7.3%).
