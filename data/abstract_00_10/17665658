BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa plays a predominant role as an etiological agent involved in serious infections in burned patients. Treatment of these infections is frequently complicated by antibiotic resistance, a problem that is is increasing in recent years. AIM: The objective of this study is to analyze epidemiological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolates within the burned patients admitted in our intensive care department. METHODS: During a period of 4 years (2000/2003), 828 burn patients were admitted. RESULTS: The survey of antibiotic susceptibility of P. aeruginosa showed high percentages of resistance to the different antibiotics. 60.9% of strains were resistant to piperacillin, 53.4% to ceftazidime, 37.6% to imipenem, 70.6% to cefsulodine, 59.3% to tobramycin, 80% to gentamicin, 62.4% to amikacin and 53.4% to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to implement urgent measures to prevent the spreading of this multiresistant strain. These measures include: sensible limitation of the use of antimicrobial agent, strict disinfection and hygienic procedures.
