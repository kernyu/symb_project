The efficacy of praziquantel against schistosomiasis mansoni has been measured in 10-14 years old schoolchildren in a highly endemic area of north-west Ethiopia. The egg reduction rate was 97% and the cure rate was 94%, as assessed by a single Kato smear. No evidence for praziquantel resistance was detected.
