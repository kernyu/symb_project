OBJECTIVES: To test the efficacy of EDP-420, a new ketolide, in experimental pneumococcal meningitis and to determine its penetration into the CSF. METHODS: The experimental rabbit model was used in this study and EDP-420 was tested against a penicillin-resistant and a penicillin- and quinolone-resistant mutant. EDP-420 was also tested against both strains in time-killing assays over 8 h in vitro. RESULTS: In experimental meningitis, EDP-420 produced a bactericidal activity comparable to the standard regimen based on a combination of vancomycin with ceftriaxone against a penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and a penicillin- and quinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae isolate. The penetration of EDP-420 into inflamed meninges was 38% after an i.v. injection of 10 mg/kg. The bactericidal activity of EDP-420 was also confirmed in in vitro time-killing assays. CONCLUSIONS: EDP-420 is an efficacious alternative treatment in pneumococcal meningitis, especially when resistant strains are suspected.
