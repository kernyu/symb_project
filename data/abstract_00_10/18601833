INTRODUCTION: This study has been designed to know the use of these antibiotics (ATB) in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A multicentric, prospective, observational study was conducted. In cluded as cases were the indications of vancomycin (VAN), teicoplanin (TPN), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and linezolid (LZD). RESULTS: A total of 826 indications (VAN 52.1%, TPN 36.6%, LZD 11.6% and Q/D 0%) were analyzed, 793 (96%) as treatment and 33 (4%) as prophylaxis in 818 patients. Serious sepsis or septic should occurred in 55.9% of the patients treated. The most common infections were pneumonia and catheter-related bacteremia, 48.3% of all the infections being acquired in ICUs. LZD was used mostly in mechanical-ventilation related pneumonia (p = 0.001), VAN in community Central Nervous System infections (p = 0.01) and in catheter-related bacteremia (p = 0.001), TPN in community pneumonia (p = 0.01) and in catheter-related bacteremia (p = 0.001). Treatments were empirical in 65.8% and diagnosis of gram positive cocci was confirmed in 48.3% of them. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated more in the LZD-treated group. Initial treatment was modified 224 times, this occurring more frequently in the VAN-treated group. The reason for this change was clinical failure 59 times, this being more frequent in the TPN group and less frequent in the patients treated with LZD, which was the drug used the most in rescue therapies (43/69, 62.3%). Adverse events, probably related to the ATB, were identified in 36/826 (4.4%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: The most common use of this ATB was to treat ICU-acquired infections. VAN was the most frequently used drug. Treatments with LZD were modified less frequently for clinical failure and this drug was the one most used in rescue therapies. This information indicates an appropriate use of these ATB in an important percentage of critically patients.
