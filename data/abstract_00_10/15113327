Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci are heterogeneous in their expression of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Different recommendations regarding screening methods for routine use have been published. In this study, the susceptibility to oxacillin of 232 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) was determined by agar dilution, Etest and presence of the mecA gene. When an oxacillin resistance breakpoint of > or = 0.5 mg/L was used, the sensitivity and specificity for agar dilution were 97.6% and 100%, and those for Etest were 100% and 95.4%. The current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards oxacillin breakpoint recommendation will categorise accurately the CoNS species encountered commonly.
