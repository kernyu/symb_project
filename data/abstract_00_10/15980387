By use of a time-kill methodology, the antipneumococcal activity of telithromycin was determined against macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates having mutations in the 23S rRNA gene and changes in the ribosomal proteins L4 and L22. Telithromycin had MICs ranging between 0.03 and 0.25 microg/ml and was bactericidal against four of seven strains after 24 h at two times the MIC.
