A deletion mutation (codons 595 to 603) in the cytomegalovirus (CMV) UL97 gene was recently reported after sequence analysis of leukocyte DNA from a patient receiving ganciclovir. The corresponding viral phenotype was examined by transfer of this mutation to a laboratory CMV strain (strain Towne). The recombinant virus was resistant to ganciclovir (8.4-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration), was sensitive to foscarnet, and replicated normally in cell culture.
