The b-Zip transcription factor Yap1p plays an important role in oxidative stress response and multidrug resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have previously demonstrated that the KNQ1 gene, encoding a multidrug transporter of the major facilitator superfamily in Kluyveromyces lactis and containing two potential Yap1p response elements in its promoter, is a putative transcriptional target of KlYap1p, the structural and functional homologue of ScYap1p. In this work, we provide evidence that KlYAP1 controls the expression of the KNQ1 gene. Using a P(KNQ1)-gusA fusion construct we showed that the expression of KNQ1 is induced upon cell treatment with the oxidizing agents H2O2 and menadione and that this induction is mediated by KlYap1p. These results were confirmed by Northern-blot analysis showing that the expression of KNQ1 is responsive to hydrogen peroxide and dependent on the presence of KlYap1p. The role of KlYAP1 in the control of KNQ1 expression was further demonstrated by EMSA experiments and drug resistance assays. These results clearly demonstrate the involvement of the KlYap1p transcription factor in the control of KNQ1 gene expression.
