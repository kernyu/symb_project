BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tend to suffer from rhinosinusitis because irradiation causes damage to sinonasal tissue; however, their bacteriology is lacking in the literature. The aim of this study was to determine the bacteriology and antibiotic resistance in acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) of these patients. METHODS: We collected nasal purulent discharge for bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility tests in irradiated NPC patients with ARS. Middle meatus discharge was aspirated for culture with endoscopic assistance. RESULTS: A total of 33 episodes of ARS were documented in 25 patients. Staphylococcus aureus comprised 42% of all aerobes. Thirty-six percents of aerobic isolates were Gram-negative bacilli. Peptostreptococcus micros and Veillonella spp were the most frequently isolated anaerobes. CONCLUSION: The bacteriology in irradiated NPC patients with ARS was distinctive in the following: first, the most common pathogen was S. aureus; second, frequently isolated Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes; and third, polymicrobial infections. The beta-lactamase-producing pathogens were highly prevalent.
