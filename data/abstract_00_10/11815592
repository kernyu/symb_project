We examined the utility of a semi-solid agar antifungal susceptibility screening (SAAS) test in real-time management of eight immunocompromised patients with invasive yeast infections. Tests of amphotericin B and fluconazole concentrations of 0.5 and 2 mg/L and 1, 8 and 40 mg/L, respectively, were performed on Candida albicans (two), Candida tropicalis (two), Candida krusei (one), Candida glabrata (one) and Trichosporon species (spp.) (two). All but the Trichosporon spp. and C. glabrata isolates were resistant to fluconazole at > or = 40 mg/L, and patients were successfully managed accordingly. Real-time antifungal susceptibility screening can assist in clinical management of invasive yeast infections.
