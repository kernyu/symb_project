BACKGROUND AND AIM: Failure of primary anti-H. pylori therapy results in a high rate of antimicrobial resistance. Here, we investigated the efficacy of high-dose dual therapy and quadruple therapy as salvage treatments for eradication of H. pylori resistant to both metronidazole and clarithromycin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with at least one treatment failure and infected with H. pylori resistant to both metronidazole and clarithromycin, were randomized to receive either omeprazole 4 x 40 mg and amoxicillin 4 x 750 mg; or omeprazole 2 x 20 mg, bismuthcitrate 4 x 107 mg, metronidazole 4 x 500 mg and tetracycline 4 x 500 mg. Both regimens were given for 14 days. In cases of persistent infection, a cross-over therapy was performed. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were randomized. Cure of H. pylori infection was achieved in 31 patients after dual therapy and in 35 patients after quadruple therapy (per protocol: 83.8% (95% CI, 67.9-93.8) and 92.1% (95% CI, 78.6-98.3), respectively (p=0.71); intention to treat: 75.6% (95% CI: 59.7-87.6) and 81.4% (95% CI: 66.6-91.6), respectively (p=0.60)). Cross-over therapy was performed in six of nine patients, four of whom were cured of the infection. CONCLUSION: Both high-dose dual therapy and quadruple therapy are effective in curing H. pylori infection resistant to both metronidazole and clarithromycin in patients who experienced previous treatment failures.
