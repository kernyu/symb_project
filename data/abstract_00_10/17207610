The evolution of imipenem disk-diffusion susceptibility results of 2652 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7596 Escherichia coli isolated during the period 2000-2005 were analysed. Screening for production of metallo-beta-lactamases was performed using the EDTA-synergy method. The percentage rate of K. pneumoniae isolates having a zone diameter < or =25 mm increased from 20% in 2000 to 41% in 2005, whereas the respective rate of isolates having a zone diameter > or =30 mm decreased from 48 to 23%. These changes were more evident during 2000-2002, followed in 2003 by the isolation of the first imipenem-resistant strains. Regarding E. coli, a similar decrease was observed (the rates of isolates having a zone diameter < or =25 mm and > or =30 mm changed from 7% and 68% in 2000, to 32% and 36% in 2005, respectively) following the respective changes of K. pneumoniae. A total of 20 K. pneumoniae strains, but no E. coli, were confirmed as metallo-beta-lactamase producers. In conclusion, a decrease of the imipenem susceptibility prior to the isolation of the first resistant strains in a tertiary care hospital was detected, as well as differences in this decrease between the two species. These findings indicate that monitoring of the evolution of imipenem susceptibility in real-time may help in unveiling forthcoming resistance and in implementing the appropriate diagnostic techniques.
