Changes in myocardium were studied during oxidative stress induced by infusion of hydrogen peroxide in the coronary vessels of isolated rat heart. Moderate concentrations of H2O2 increased the heart rate but decreased the contractile force, whereas higher concentrations of H2O2 decreased both parameters and increased the end diastolic pressure. The effect of H2O2 was stable, cumulative, and was associated with disturbance in respiration of mitochondria, increased production of ROS in them, and decrease in activities of antioxidant enzymes in the myocardium. Changes in the antioxidant status of the myocardium induced by long-term addition of coenzyme Q(10) into food was accompanied by decrease in the negative inotropic effect of H2O2, whereas the levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase after oxidative stress were virtually unchanged. The activities of these enzymes displayed a high positive correlation with the cardiac function. The findings suggest that coenzyme Q(10) should increase resistance of the myocardium to oxidative stress not only by a direct antioxidant mechanism but also indirectly, due to increased protection of antioxidant enzymes.
