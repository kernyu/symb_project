Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative skin disorders whose pathogenesis is poorly understood. Cytokines and chemokines are important factors which can modify the cutaneous microenvironment allowing the accumulation of lymphocytes. Most of these neoplasms seem to be T helper-2 cells. While interferon gamma is the natural inhibitor of clonal T-cell proliferations, interferon resistance has been recently found in these cells. This interferon resistance may be an Achilles heel that can be targeted by molecular therapeutic interventions.
