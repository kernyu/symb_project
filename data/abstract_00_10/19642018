The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially tetracycline- and beta-lactam-resistant bacteria, poses a great threat to human health. The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a suitable gene microarray for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes. We isolated 463 strains of bacteria from a hospital, a veterinary station, an animal nursery, and living environment of Changchun, China. After screening, it was found that 93.9% of these bacteria were resistant to tetracycline, 74.9% to ampicillin, 55.6% to deoxycycline, and 41.7% to ciprofloxacin. For amplification of antibiotic genes, we designed 28 pairs of primers. In addition, 28 hybridization probes for these genes were developed. The DNA microarray analysis was performed at 42 degrees C for 5 h. We were successful in detecting 12 resistance genes by microarray analysis. After detection, we also evaluated the sensitivity of the microarray analysis. The LDL (Lowest Detection Level) of the microarray was 1 x 10(6) copies/ml of template DNA. It is believed that such microarray-based determination of tetracycline and beta-lactam resistance genes can have a potential application in clinical studies in the future.
