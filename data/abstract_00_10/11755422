Resistance to innate immunity is essential for salmonellae pathogenesis. The salmonellae PhoP/PhoQ regulators sense host environments to promote remodeling of the bacterial envelope. This remodeling includes enzymes that modify lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Modified LPS promotes bacterial survival by increasing resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides and by altered host recognition of LPS.
