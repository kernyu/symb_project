We report a high frequency (35%) of the Beijing genotype among multidrug-resistant isolates recovered in and around Mumbai, India. Further restriction fragment-length polymorphism typing showed that these strains were closely related. We also report a high frequency of the Delhi genotype (31% of isolates). Our data indicate considerable ongoing transmission of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains of the Beijing genotype in Mumbai.
