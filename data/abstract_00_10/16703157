To determine whether carriage of resistant Gram-positive organisms by residents increases over time, the dominant hand of pediatric residents was cultured. Among first-year residents, 53 Gram-positive organisms were isolated; 12 were resistant to oxacillin, 13 to clindamycin. Six residents had organisms resistant to both; 14 carried at least one resistant to either. Among third-year residents, 46 Gram-positive organisms were cultured; 9 were resistant to oxacillin, 6 to clindamycin. Three residents carried organisms resistant to both; 10 carried at least one resistant to either. Colonization with resistant Gram-positive organisms did not increase with length of training.
