Immunodeficient patients can develop malabsorption, mimicking celiac disease clinically and histologically. Such individuals may also occasionally require immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune disorders. We have identified a patient with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)-associated sprue complicated by duodenal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection following corticosteroid and ancillary immunomodulatory therapy. Ganciclovir and a modification of the immunosuppressant regimen improved both clinical symptoms and villous atrophy. To our knowledge, this is original documentation of duodenal CMV infection secondary to immunomodulatory therapy for steroid-refractory CVID-sprue.
