Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 117) from patients attending a tertiary care centre in western Nepal were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Eighteen (15.4%) were methicillin-resistant. Susceptibility among methicillin-resistant isolates varied from 0% (penicillin) to 16.6% (erythromycin and gentamicin), but varied among methicillin-susceptible isolates from 39.4% (penicillin) to 97.0% (ciprofloxacin). Fourteen (77.8%) of the methicillin-resistant isolates were resistant to all agents tested. Implementation of an appropriate antibiotic policy would reduce the risk of further development of antimicrobial resistance.
