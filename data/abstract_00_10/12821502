Of 500 group A streptococci isolated from pharyngeal swabs, 72 (14.4%) were macrolide resistant, compared to 2.1% in 1997. Of these, 66 (92%) were of the M phenotype and 6 (8.3%) were of the MLS phenotype. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis found that two clones, with patterns identical to those of serotypes M1 and M4, accounted for 19.4 and 68.1% of the macrolide-resistant isolates, respectively.
