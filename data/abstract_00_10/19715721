Staphylococcus simulans biovar staphylolyticus, the lysostaphin-producing organism, contains five plasmids designated pACK1-pACK5. pACK4 was found to be relaxable and to share sequence similarity with a number of well-characterized mobilizable plasmids from other staphylococci. All mobilizable staphylococcal plasmids characterized to date mediate resistance to various antibiotics, but pACK4 is unique because it contains no recognizable antibiotic resistance genes. pACK4 was found to contain an origin of transfer (oriT) region that shares inverted repeat regions and the same nic site as several other mobilizable staphylococcal plasmids. The presence of this conserved oriT region suggested that pACK4 might be mobilized in the presence of a conjugative plasmid. Filter mating studies revealed that pACK4 was mobilized by the conjugative plasmid pGO1. In addition, pACK4 was found to be virtually identical to the recently described plasmid pVGA from Staphylococcus aureus, except that pVGA contains an additional region (vgaA) that confers resistance to pleuromutilin, streptogramin A, and lincosamide. The high sequence similarity among pACK4, pVGA, and several previously described mobilizable staphylococcal plasmids suggests a common origin for these plasmids.
