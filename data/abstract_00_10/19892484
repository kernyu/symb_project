AIM OF THE STUDY: Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of 96 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa recovered in a Tunisian teaching hospital during a 16-month period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the isolates were characterized by serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility typing and genotyping with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA). RESULTS: Forty-one isolates out of 96 (43%) were recovered from two intensive care units (medical and chirurgical). Most of the isolates (48%) belonged to serotype O:11. Among the 13 antibiotypes, three multidrug resistant ones were mostly observed within the two intensive care units. Genotyping showed 83 RAPD types and 52 MLVA types. Isolates showing the same serotype could show different genotypes. A limited number of clusters was highlighted with MLVA typing, of which an outbreak of nine cases within the surgical intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Except this outbreak of nine cases, the heterogeneity observed for most of the P. aeruginosa isolates showed that outbreak situations were rare in the F. Bourguiba hospital during the study period. MLVA genotyping is a good tool for genotyping P. aeruginosa clinical isolates.
