A method for rapid identification of antiseptic- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) based on 3 loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays was developed. LAMP targeting the femB gene identified S. aureus with 100% specificity, and LAMP targeting the mecA gene associated with methicillin resistance identified methicillin-resistant staphylococci with 100% specificity. LAMP targeting the qacA/B gene encoding an efflux pump responsible for antiseptic resistance identified high-acriflavine-resistant (MIC>/=100 mg/L) MRSA (92.5% positive) and acriflavine-susceptible (MIC<25 mg/L) MRSA (100% negative). They were performed under the same reaction conditions within 60 min at 63 degrees C. The combined LAMP assays will be useful for rapid identification of S. aureus isolates and determination of their antibiotic and antiseptic resistance patterns with regard to methicillin and organic cationic substrates.
