Beta-lactamases are resistance enzymes for beta-lactam antibiotics. These enzymes hydrolyze the beta-lactam moieties of these antibiotics, rendering them inactive. Of the four classes of known beta-lactamases, the enzymes of class D are the least understood. We report herein the high-resolution (1.9 A) crystal structure of the class D OXA-10 beta-lactamase inhibited by a penicillanate derivative. The structure provides evidence that the carboxylated Lys-70 (a carbamate) is intimately involved in the mechanism of the enzyme.
