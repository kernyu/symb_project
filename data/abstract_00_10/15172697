A total of 52 Haemophilus parasuis and 80 Histophilus somni isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by MIC-determinations. None of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ceftiofur, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, florphenicol, penicillin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, tiamulin, or tilmicosin. Two H. parasuis isolates were resistant to trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole. Six H. parasuis isolates had reduced susceptibility (0.06-0.5 microg/ml) to ciprofloxacin and 10 reduced susceptibility to TMP + sulfamethoxazole (1-2 microg/ml). This study showed that Danish isolates of H. parasuis and H. somni in general are fully susceptible to antimicrobial agents currently used for treatment of infections with these pathogens.
