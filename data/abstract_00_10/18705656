The present study provides the first data about the prevalence of Salmonella contamination of broilers and slaughterhouses in the region of Constantine, Algeria. The serotypes and anti-microbial resistance phenotypes of the isolates were determined, and risk factors contributing to the contamination were evaluated. A total of 2490 samples, 1800 originating from 30 broiler farms and 690 from 15 slaughterhouses, were taken during two periods: March 2005-June 2006 and September 2006-March 2007. Salmonella contamination concerned 37% of the broiler farms and 53% of the slaughterhouses. Among the 55 isolates recovered, 10 different serotypes were identified. The most frequently recovered serotypes in both slaughterhouses and breeder farms were S. Hadar (36%, n = 20), S. Virchow (16%, n = 9), S. Infantis (10.9%, n = 6), S. Albany (11%, n = 6) and S. Carnac (7%, n = 4). Isolates belonging to S. Heidelberg (2%, n = 1) and S. Rissen (2%, n = 1) were found only in farms, while those belonging to S. Typhimurium (9%, n = 5), S. Enteritidis (4%, n = 2) and S. Montevideo (2%, n = 1) were recovered only from slaughterhouses. Thirty-nine isolates (80%) were resistant to at least one anti-microbial and 51% were multi-resistant, i.e. resistant to two or more anti-microbial molecules. About 58% (n = 32) were resistant to streptomycin, 36% (n = 20) to tetracyclines, 27% (n = 15) to nalidixic acid, 13% (n = 7) to ofloxacin and one isolate to enrofloxacin. Finally, seven distinct anti-microbial resistance profiles were identified. In parallel, four risk factors were found to be significantly associated with Salmonella contamination. Together with the huge spread of Salmonella in the broiler production chain in Constantine, Algeria, these risk factors highlight the hazards of the broiler channels, particularly linked to poor technical and hygiene practices.
