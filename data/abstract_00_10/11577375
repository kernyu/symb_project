We describe a case of CMV ventriculoencephalitis in a severely immunocompromised bone marrow transplant recipient who was receiving combination therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet for treatment of viremia and retinitis. Analysis of sequential viral isolates recovered from the patient's cerebrospinal fluid suggested that disease developed because of the presence of viral resistance and, possibly, low tissue penetration of antiviral agents.
