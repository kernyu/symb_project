Regarding the different reports about increasing drug resistance of Pseudomonas, this study was done in Tabriz Pediatric Medical Center. In a cross sectional study, during 3 years, 84 positive culture of pseudomonas were obtained from the records of microbiology laboratory. Information about the patients and pattern of drug resistance were analyzed statistically. 81.9% of patients were below 2 years of age and all of them had one or more medical intervention. Most of the positive cultures were isolated from bronchial and eye discharges. Eighty one percent of positive cultures were from intensive care unit and neonatal wards. Resistance to Ampicillin, Ceftizoxime, Cotrimoxasol and Cefotoxime has been more than 95%. Resistance to Ceftazidime was seen in 50% and lowest resistance was to Ciprofloxacin. At present time Ciprofloxacin is relatively effective antibiotic for Pseudomonas infection. Since, there is increasing resistance to this drug and limited use of this drug in children, newer antibiotic discs should be used in antibiogram.
