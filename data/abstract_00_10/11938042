OBJECTIVE: As conflicting results have been observed by some authors in liver recipients, the aim of the study was to evaluate lamivudine therapy in 3 groups of patients with chronic hepatitis B: non-transplanted patients, liver and kidney recipients. METHODS: All patients were studied for clinical symptoms, hepatic enzymes, hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology, serum HBV DNA load, and HBV polymerase genotype (mutations associated with lamivudine resistance). RESULTS: During the 48-144 week-long follow-up (mean: 75 weeks), 23 non-transplanted patients, 5 liver and 6 kidney recipients were studied. A sustained biochemical and virological response was obtained in 19 out of the 23 non-transplanted patients and in 4 of 6 kidney recipients, while the 5 liver recipients did not respond. After the development of lamivudine resistance, mutations rtM204V and rtL180M were detected in all studied patients, mutation rtM207I in one, with similar results from traditional nucleotide sequencing and a commercial line probe assay. CONCLUSION: The poor response to lamivudine in liver recipients requires further studies.
