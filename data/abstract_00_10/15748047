Studies done between 1997 and 2003 are reviewed to give an overall picture of antimalarial drug resistance in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of the World Health Organization (WHO). The situation in 8 countries where resistance has been reported is detailed. It has been difficult to abandon chloroquine as first-line treatment even though resistance to it is widespread. Resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has also been detected. The spread of resistance could be slowed down by the adoption of effective national policies and control programmes. Coordination between counties and with other WHO regions, as opposed to working in isolation, could further reduce the spread of resistance.
