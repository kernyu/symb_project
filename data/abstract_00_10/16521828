The effects of L-arginine and inhibitors of NO-synthase on the level of stable NO metabolites and nitrosothiols have been investigated under conditions of toxic damage of liver induced by CCl4. The L-arginine improved resistance of hepatic cells to damaging action of tetrachloromethane, but inhibition of NO-synthase increased hepatotropic action of CCl4. The existence of some base level of nitrosothiols, acting as a reserve pool of nitric oxide in organism, has been supposed.
