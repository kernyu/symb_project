The emergence of antimicrobial resistance among Salmonella is a matter of great public health concern, more so in the case of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, since these antimicrobials are normally regarded as the drugs of choice for complicated cases of infection. This study was designed to determine the occurrence of resistance mediated by the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) enzymes belonging to the TEM family. Only two isolates were detected after analysis of the 278,308 Salmonella isolates from the last 10 years. In both cases, the gene involved was a bla (TEM-52)-like, and infections were linked with foreign travel. ESBL-TEM enzymes remain very rare in Salmonella in England and Wales, and no domestic cases have been detected to date.
