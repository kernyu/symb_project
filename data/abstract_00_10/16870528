Despite dramatic declines in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality as a result of highly active antiretroviral therapy, management of heavily treatment-experienced patients remains complex and challenging. Treatment response rates with subsequent antiretroviral regimens are lower than with initial antiretroviral therapy. Additionally, increased mortality has been associated with multidrug-resistant HIV. We review data relevant to management of such patients and offer a systematic approach to constructing a salvage antiretroviral regimen.
