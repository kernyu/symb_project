The intraoperative samples taken from 15 patients with acutely progressive drug-resistant fibrocavernous pulmonary tuberculosis were studied. There were typical signs of granulomatosis inflammation, a predominance of an exudative tissue reaction, and an extensive vascular bed lesion. Two types of perifocal cellular infiltrates were identified. Mononuclear infiltrates with epithelioid cellular transformation along the periphery were defined as specified. Nonspecific infiltrates were composed of foam macrophages-lipophages and they reflected lipid metabolic disturbances. In addition, the severity of the process was determined by an extensive specific bronchial lesion of all generations. A morphological study of the samples could reveal the tissue and cellular features of respiratory organs in drug-resistant tuberculosis and identify the diagnostically significant signs of specific and nonspecific inflammation.
