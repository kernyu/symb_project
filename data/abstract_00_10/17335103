The increasing emergence of pathogenic bacterial strains with high resistance to antibiotic therapy has created an urgent need for the development of new antibacterial agents that are directed towards novel targets. We have focused our attention on the Mur ligases (MurC-F), which catalyze the early steps of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and which to date represent under-exploited targets for antibacterial drug design. We show that some of our phosphinate inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl:D-glutamate ligase (MurD) also inhibits UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate:L-lysine ligase (MurE). To obtain new information on their structure-activity relationships, three new, structurally related phosphinates were synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of MurD and MurE.
