Recent data suggest that gut microbiota plays a significant role in fat accumulation. However, it is not clear whether gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiology of type-2 diabetes. To address this issue, we modulated gut microbiota with two combinations of antibiotics in two different mouse models with insulin resistance. Treatment with norfloxacin and ampicillin for 2 weeks reduced the cecal bacterial DNA below the level of detection in ob/ob, diet-induced obese and insulin resistance (DIO) mice, and significantly improved fasting glycemia and oral glucose tolerance of the treated animals. The enhanced insulin sensitivity was independent of food intake or adiposity because pair-fed ob/ob mice were as glucose intolerant as the untreated ob/ob mice. The reduced liver triglycerides, increased liver glycogen and improved glucose tolerance in the treated mice indicate broad impacts on metabolism by gut decontamination. The treatment with non-absorbable antibiotics polymyxin B and neomycin significantly modified cecal microbiota profile in the DIO mice, and the modified intestinal microbiota was associated with a gradual reduction in glycemia during a washout period. In summary, modulation of gut microbiota ameliorated glucose intolerance in mice and altered the hormonal, inflammatory and metabolic status of the host.
