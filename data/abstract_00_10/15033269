The ability of bifidobacteria isolated from infant feces to inhibit enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 in vitro and reduce its adhesion to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells was evaluated in comparison to American Type Culture Collection bifidobacterial reference strains. Five Bifidobacterium isolates from infant feces were identified and characterized by morphology, fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) assay, polymerase chain reaction using bifidobacterial 16S rDNA specific primers, carbohydrate fermentation patterns, resistance to lysozyme, acid, bile and hydrogen peroxide as well as their ability to inhibit E. coli O157:H7 using the agar spot technique. Infant isolates showed greater resistance to bile, acid, lysozyme and more antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7 than ATCC strains. Two infant isolates identified as B. bifidum RBL 71 and B. bifidum RBL 460 showed good adhesion and significant potential for reducing adhesion of E. coli O157:H7 to Caco-2 cells. This effect was dependent on bifidobacterial cell concentration. These results show that bifidobacteria isolated from infants may be useful for improving probiotic formulae with respect to protection against E. coli O157:H7 infection.
