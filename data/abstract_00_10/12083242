We documented a case of occupational human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) despite postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with a combination drug regimen after percutaneous injury with a needle from a sharps disposal container in the hospital room of an HIV-infected patient. This failure of PEP with a combination drug regimen may have been related to antiretroviral drug resistance, other factors, or both. This case highlights the importance of preventing injury to prevent occupational transmission of HIV.
