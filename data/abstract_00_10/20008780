A novel plasmid-borne resistance gene cluster comprising the genes erm(T) for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance, dfrK for trimethoprim resistance, and tet(L) for tetracycline resistance was identified in a porcine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sequence type 398 (ST398) strain. This erm(T)-dfrK-tet(L) region was flanked by copies of the novel IS element ISSau10. The erm(T) region resembled that of Streptococcus pyogenes plasmid pRW35. The erm(T) gene of pKKS25 was expressed constitutively due to a 57-bp deletion in the erm(T) translational attenuator.
