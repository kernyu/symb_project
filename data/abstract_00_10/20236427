A hundred and eleven Gram-negative bacilli from community-acquired infections were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, screened for class 1 and 2 integrons, and statistically evaluated for the association between antibiotic profile and the presence of integrons. The frequency with which integrons were harbored was 28.8%. Three E. coli strains contained a dfrA17 variant inserted in a class 1 integron. Results of PFGE indicated that some E. coli strains carrying integrons were clonally related. Carriage of gene cassettes was significantly associated with resistance to certain antibiotics (P < 0.05).
