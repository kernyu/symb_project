To investigate the effects of bacteria (Burkholderia cepacia) on metal uptake by the hyperaccumulating plant, Sedum alfredii, a hydroponic experiment with different concentrations of Cd and Zn was conducted. It was found that inoculation of bacteria on S. alfredii significantly enhanced plant growth (up to 110% with Zn treatment), P (up to 56.1% with Cd treatment), and metal uptake (up to 243% and 96.3% with Cd and Zn treatment, respectively) in shoots, tolerance index (up to 134% with Zn added treatment), and better translocation of metals (up to 296% and 135% with Cd and Zn treatment, respectively) from root to shoot. In the ampicillin added treatment with metal addition, stimulation of organic acid production (up to an increase of 133% of tartaric acid with Cd treatment) by roots of S. alfredii was observed. The secretion of organic acids appears to be a functional metal resistance mechanism that chelates the metal ions extracellularly, reducing their uptake and subsequent impacts on root physiological processes.
