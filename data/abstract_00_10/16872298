Several studies from developed countries have documented the association between trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis failure and mutations in the Pneumocystis jirovecii gene coding for dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). DNA was extracted from Giemsa-stained smears of 70 patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia seen in Porto Alegre, Brazil, from 1997 to 2004. Successful PCR amplification of the DHPS locus was obtained in 57 of 70 cases (81.4%), including five cases (8.7%) that had used sulfa prophylaxis. No DHPS gene mutations were seen. These results suggest that DHPS mutations are currently as rare in Brazil as in other developing countries.
