TEM-71, a novel extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from a Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate, had an isoelectric point of 6.0 and a substrate profile showing preferential hydrolysis of cefotaxime over ceftazidime. It differed from TEM-1 by two substitutions, Gly238Ser and Glu240Lys, and was under the control of the strong P4 promoter.
