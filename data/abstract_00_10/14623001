The identification of a series of compounds that specifically inhibit efflux by the MexAB-OprM pump system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is described. Synthesis and in vitro structure-activity relationships (SARs) are outlined. Early leads lacked activity in animal models, and efforts to improve solubility and reduce serum protein binding by the introduction of polar groups are discussed.
