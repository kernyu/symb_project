The antimicrobial activities of three chitosans with different molecular masses against six gram-negative and three gram-positive bacteria were examined. Campylobacter spp. were the microorganisms most sensitive to chitosan, regardless of their molecular mass. The MIC of chitosan for Campylobacter ranged from 0.005 to 0.05%, demonstrating the global sensitivity of campylobacters to chitosan. Chitosan caused a loss in the membrane integrity of Campylobacter, measured as an increase in cell fluorescence due to the uptake of propidium iodide, a dye that is normally excluded from cells with intact membranes. As cells entered the stationary phase, there was a change in cell membrane resistance toward a loss of integrity caused by chitosan. This study demonstrates that chitosans could be a promising antimicrobial to control Campylobacter.
