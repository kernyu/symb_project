Previous studies have found that Asian patients transplanted for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection had worse outcomes than white patients. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes in Asian and white patients listed for liver transplantation for HBV infection. Data of all patients with HBV infection listed for liver transplantation between January 1996 and June 1998 from 20 centers in North America were collected using a survey. Total patients enrolled were 325 (171 whites, 126 Asians, 28 other races). There was no difference in demographics, liver biochemistry, and HBV replicative status between Asians and whites at the time of listing. More Asians had hepatocellular carcinoma and fewer Asians had hepatitis C or D virus coinfection. At the time of this survey, 70 Asians (55%) and 99 whites (58%) had been transplanted. Actuarial 2-year survival posttransplantation for Asians (88%) and whites (92%) was similar. Recurrent HBV infection occurred in 8 (11%) Asians and 12 (12%) whites. Five patients with recurrent HBV infection died, 4 of whom were Asian. Actuarial 2-year survival for Asians versus whites with recurrent HBV infection was 60% versus 90% (P =.04). In this large cohort of patients, overall survival and recurrent HBV infection posttransplantation were comparable between Asians and whites. However, Asians with recurrent HBV infection posttransplantation had significantly higher mortality.
