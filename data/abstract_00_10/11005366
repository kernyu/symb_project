Nephrotoxicity, as evidenced by renal insufficiency is a well-known consequence of gentamicin therapy. We report two patients with gentamicin-induced syndrome of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and hypomagnesemia. Both had complete recovery of renal tubular function after cessation of antibiotic therapy. These cases emphasize the need to routinely monitor patients receiving gentamicin therapy for electrolyte abnormalities to avoid potential morbidity.
