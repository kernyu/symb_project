ErmSF is one of four gene products responsible for the resistance of Streptomyces fradiae to the autogenous antibiotic, tylosin. It catalyzes the methylation of a single adenine residue (A2058) of 23S rRNA to produce dimethyl adenine from monomethyl adenine or unmodified adenine. This reduces the affinity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics for the peptidyltransferase circle and confers resistance to these antibiotics. We earlier cloned ermSF from Streptomyces fradiae, ligated it into pET23b with a T7 promoter and transformed it into E. coli. The transformants were resistant to erythromycin, but most of the expressed protein was present as an inclusion body. In the present work, the protein was extracted from the inclusion bodies, solubilized with 6 M guanidine-HCl, and purified by metal ion (Ni2+) affinity chromatography yielding 171 mg of denatured protein per liter of culture. Renaturation of the protein was achieved by step-wise removal of the guanidine-HCl. Most of the refolded protein appeared to assume the natural conformation, as judged by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The yield of refolded protein increased as the protein concentration in the renaturation medium was lowered, but the activity of the renatured protein tended to increase with protein concentration. The highest yield of renatured protein, 107 mg/L of culture had 55% of the activity of the naturally folded protein. Refolding was also carried out by removing denaturant by a simple two-step dilution-dialysis method. With that method, the yield of the refolded protein was lower and the activity higher than with step-wise refolding. The yields and activities did not seem to be affected by the concentration of denaturant, suggesting that renaturation under the conditions employed occurred spontaneously with a strong tendency to fold to the native state, even though ErmSF contains two domains.
