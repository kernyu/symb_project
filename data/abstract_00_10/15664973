A dominant selectable marker for Candida albicans and other Candida species, which confers resistance to nourseothricin, was characterized. In a heterologous promoter system and a recyclable cassette, the marker efficiently permitted deletion and complementation of C. albicans genes. Neither growth nor filamentous development was affected in strains expressing this marker.
