BACKGROUND: Recurrent acute pharyngotonsillitis remains a common illness in children and young adults and can lead to serious complications if not treated. cefpodoxime proxetil is a second-generation oral cephalosporin, which shows potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and high stability in the presence of beta-lactamases. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of second-generation cephalosporins in the prophylaxis of recurrent pharyngotonsillitis in children. METHODS: A total of 180 children aged between 4 and 14 years with recurrent pharyngotonsillitis were randomized to receive either cefpodoxime proxetil (100 mg twice a day, 6 days a month for 6 months) or placebo (at the same dosage). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that treatment with cefpodoxime proxetil may be effective in reducing symptoms of recurrent pharyngotonsillitis and preventing recurrences without causing side effects or developing bacterial resistance.
