Linezolid is a novel antibiotic administrable by the intravenous as well as the oral route. It is aimed by its re-imbursement conditions at treating proven beta-lactam- or glycopeptide-resistant staphylococcal and enterococcal infections in the hospital and post-discharge outpatient. It has various indications: pulmonary infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, infections in the febrile neutropenic patient, urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, chronic osteitis. Bacteriologic documentation of the infection is required to avoid overconsumption and development of resistance. The oral forms exhibit complete bio-availability. Caution is recommended with regard to linezolid's MAO inhibitory effect and the risk of thrombocytopenia requiring weekly hematologic monitoring.
