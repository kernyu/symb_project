The somatostatin analogues have an excellent symptomatic therapeutic effect (60-90% responses in carcinoid syndrome) which permits an amelioration in the quality of life, particularly in patients with metastatic tumours. The availability of long-acting somatostatin analogues assuring stable plasma concentrations over several weeks (thanks to progressive liberation) further facilitates the use of these medications by allowing a reduction in the number of injections. Interferon also has an anti-secretory effect, albeit inferior to that of the somatostatin analogues, but potentially of interest in the case of resistance to these products.
