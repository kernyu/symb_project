Data on 485 patients with recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis were studied. At the beginning of the study, all the patients underwent a triple sputum smear test and sputum was cultured in 338 cases. Among persons with a negative smear, sputum inoculation yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) in 50%. By taking into account these observations, bacillary excretion was detected in 72.2%. It was established most frequently by both methods (42%), slightly less frequently by the smear test (38%) and inoculation (20%). Drug resistance in MBT was revealed almost equally frequently in bacillary recurrences in patients with positive and negative sputum smear tests (68 and 62.3%, respectively). The bulk of the strains obtained were found to be polyresistant as well as quite often multiresistant. In the group of patients who had received chemotherapy by the WHO standards at primary detection of tuberculosis, polyresistance and multiresistance were encountered significantly more frequently in those who had been treated in previous years. The resistance of MBT to various drugs was also studied. Recommendations are given on the basis of the results of the study.
