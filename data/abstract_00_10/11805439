The emergence of resistance to antiretroviral drugs represents one of the main reasons for treatment failure in HIV-infected persons. Resistance to multiple nucleoside analogues may result from rearrangements in the HIV pol gene, in particular one insertion of two amino acids at position 69. Herein, we examined the prevalence of this resistant genotype and its genetic heterogeneity in a group of 475 healthy pretreated HIV-positive subjects in Spain. Only 4 (0.8%) carried the codon 69 insertion. It was always found coupled to the T69S mutation. The extra amino acids were S-S in 2 subjects and S-G in the other 2. The presence of the insert was seen only in subjects previously exposed to AZT monotherapy for at least 6 months.
