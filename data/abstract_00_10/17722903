Oxazolidinones represent a new and promising class of antibacterial agents. Current research in this area is mainly concentrated on improving the safety profile and the antibacterial spectrum. Oxazolidinones bearing a (pyridin-3-yl)phenyl moiety (e.g., 3) generally show improved antibacterial activity compared to linezolid but suffer from potent monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibition and low solubility. We now disclose the finding that new analogues of 3 with acyclic substituents on the pyridyl moiety exhibit excellent activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including linezolid-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Generally, more bulky substituents yielded significantly reduced MAO-A inhibition relative to the unsubstituted compound 3. The MAO-A SAR can be rationalized on the basis of docking studies using a MAO-A/MAO-B homology model. Solubility was enhanced with incorporation of polar groups. One optimized analogue, compound 13, showed low clearance in the rat and efficacy against S. pneumoniae in a mouse pneumonia model.
