Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antifungal agent voriconazole were determined using the Etest and compared with those of amphotericin B, itraconazole and fluconazole using 1986 clinical isolates of Candida spp. Voriconazole MICs were also compared with those of amphotericin B and itraconazole using 391 clinical isolates of Aspergillus spp. Voriconazole was found to have more potent activity and lower MIC values than amphotericin B, itraconazole and fluconazole against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. kefyr. Against C. glabrata and C. krusei, voriconazole was more active than either of the other two azole antifungals but had similar activity to amphotericin B. For species of Aspergillus, MIC values of voriconazole were lower than those of amphotericin B and itraconazole against A. fumigatus and A. flavus, and were similar to those of amphotericin B against A. niger. Against A. terreus, MIC values for voriconazole and itraconazole were similar. A. terreus is known to be resistant to amphotericin B, and this was reflected in higher MIC values compared with those of voriconazole and itraconazole. Voriconazole therefore compares very favourably with other antifungal agents against a large number of clinical isolates of Candida and Aspergillus spp.
