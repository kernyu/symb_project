From the Central-East European region the first VIM metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were published from Croatia, Poland and Hungary. The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of MBL-production to carbapenem-resistance among P. aeruginosa clinical isolates in the Military Medical Academy (MMA) in Belgrade, Serbia between August 2004 and September 2007. Only one P. aeruginosa isolate with strain number 722 proved MBL-positive that harboured a novel class 1 integron with a bla(VIM-2)-like cassette in the first position, followed by orfD, a putative gene with unknown function. Our data indicate that MBL-producing strains occur at a prevalence of less than 1% among imipenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa clinical isolates in this Belgrade hospital. The newly identified VIM MBL-producing P. aeruginosa strain 722 could be assigned to serotype O11, and it was panresistant to all antimicrobials tested. The isolate displayed sequence type ST235 by multilocus sequence typing which is the founder sequence type of the previously identified international clonal complex CC11 that already contains bla(VIM)-positive isolates from Italy, Greece, Sweden, Hungary and Poland. In conclusion, this is the first report of VIM MBL-producing P. aeruginosa from Serbia and also of the occurrence of such isolates belonging to the international clonal complex CC11 in this country.
