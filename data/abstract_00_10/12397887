Depression is a common occurrence in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected population. Complications in treating depressed HIV-infected individuals include the use of multiple medications, additive side effects, and potentially significant drug-drug interactions. Based on the pharmacologic characteristics of venlafaxine and indinavir, we hypothesized that significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions would not occur when these drugs where taken concurrently. Nine healthy adult subjects were given a single 800 mg oral dose of indinavir and serial blood samples were collected for measurement of plasma drug concentrations. Over the next 9 days, venlafaxine was administered at a dosage of 50 mg every 8 hours following a brief titration. A venlafaxine trough plasma concentration and serial concentrations following venlafaxine administration were obtained on day 10. On day 11, venlafaxine and indinavir were administered together and serial blood sampling was repeated. Indinavir had no effect on venlafaxine plasma concentrations but resulted in a 7% decrease in plasma concentrations of O-desmethyl-venlafaxine (ODV)(P = 0.028). This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Venlafaxine coadministration resulted in a 28% decrease in the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of plasma indinavir (P = 0.016) and a 36% decrease in its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax; P = 0.038). As the plasma concentration of protease inhibitors is a critical factor in maintaining efficacy and minimizing the potential for viral resistance, the decrease in both AUC and Cmax of indinavir from coadministration of venlafaxine is of concern. The clinical significance of these results obtained from a small number of healthy volunteers is unknown. Further studies are needed to substantiate or refute this apparent drug-drug interaction. Until such time, venlafaxine should be used cautiously in patients receiving indinavir.
