We report a case of abdominal zygomicosis in a Doberman bitch. Clinical signs consisted of urinary incontinence and hard abdominal masses detected by palpation. The masses were surgically removed by exploratory laparatomy and had a tumoral-like appearance. A granulomatous reaction containing coarse and non septate hyphae was the main histological finding. Direct microscopic examination revealed the presence of fungal structures. On Sabouraud honey agar the fungus developed fluffy, greyish white colonies that were identified as Absidia corymbifera on the basis of their macro and microscopic morphology.
