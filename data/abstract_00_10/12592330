Cladribine has been reported to have little activity in fludarabine- refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We sought to determine whether resistance to therapy with cladribine in fludarabine-refractory CLL patients represented primary drug resistance or the inability to tolerate the myelosuppression associated with this therapy. Patients with fludarabine refractory CLL patients without severe thrombocytopenia (platelets >/=50 x 10(9)/l) or granulocytopenia (neutrophils >1.5 x 10(9)/l) were enrolled. All patients received cladribine (0.14 mg/kg) as a 2-h intravenous infusion daily for 5 days, repeated every 4 weeks. Patients received up to six cycles of therapy. Twenty-eight patients enrolled; 13 had intermediate (Rai stage I or II) and 15 high (Rai stage III and IV) risk stages. No patient had a complete remission, but nine (32%; 95% confidence interval, 15-49%) attained a partial remission when assessed using the modified NCI criteria (1996). The median time to relapse for responders was 12 months, while median progression-free survival for the entire group was 9 months (95% confidence interval, 4-14 months). The median overall survival was 2.2 years (95% confidence interval, 0.8-3.1 years). Response was predicted by pre-treatment Rai status with seven of 13 (54%) intermediate risk vs two of 15 (13%) high-risk patients responding (P = 0.04). Toxicity was myelosuppression and infections (grade 3-5: neutropenia 75%, thrombocytopenia 68%, and infections 43%). Cladribine has modest clinical activity and considerable toxicity in a very selected group of patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL lacking pre-treatment neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
