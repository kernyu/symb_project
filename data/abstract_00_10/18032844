We analyzed the clinical and laboratory characteristics, therapeutic outcome and prognostic factors of 25 cases of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture-proven Pseudomonas aeruginosa adult bacterial meningitis (ABM). Twelve P. aeruginosa strains, isolated from clinical CSF specimens, were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. The 25 cases included 17 men and 8 women, aged 17 to 86 years (median=51). Of the 25 cases of P. aeruginosa ABM, 18 were the result of postneurosurgical infection and the other 7 were spontaneous infections. The latter 7 cases had serious underlying medical conditions. The antibiotic susceptibility rates of the 12 strains were as follows: ceftriaxone 16.7% (2/12), ceftazidime 91.7% (11/12), cefepime 83.3% (10/12), imipenem 83.3% (10/12), meropenem 83.3% (10/12) and ciprofloxacin 66.7% (8/12). The therapeutic results showed an overall mortality rate of 40% (10/25). The emergence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant P. aeruginosa strains cultured from clinical CSF specimens in recent years has resulted in a therapeutic challenge in the treatment of ABM.
