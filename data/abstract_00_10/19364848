Bacillus anthracis possesses an innate resistance to the antibiotic trimethoprim due to poor binding to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR); currently, there are no commercial antibacterials that target this enzyme in B. anthracis. We have previously reported a series of dihydrophthalazine-based trimethoprim derivatives that are inhibitors for this target. In the present work, we have synthesized one compound (RAB1) displaying favorable 50% inhibitory concentration (54 nM) and MIC (< or =12.8 microg/ml) values. RAB1 was cocrystallized with the B. anthracis DHFR in the space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), and X-ray diffraction data were collected to a 2.3-A resolution. Binding of RAB1 causes a conformational change of the side chain of Arg58 and Met37 to accommodate the dihydrophthalazine moiety. Unlike the natural substrate or trimethoprim, the dihydrophthalazine group provides a large hydrophobic anchor that embeds within the DHFR active site and accounts for its selective inhibitory activity against B. anthracis.
