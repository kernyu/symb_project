This guidance document on prudent use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs has been produced for NHSScotland by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC). It fulfils one of the requirements set out in the Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy and Scottish Action Plan (Scottish Executive Health Department 2002) and forms part of the Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Action Plan work programme overseen by the Ministerial HAI Task Force. The objective was the development of a set of Good Practice Recommendations for Antimicrobial Prescribing in Hospitals to be implemented at the national or local level. The publication of the recommendations of this document in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (JAC) aims to highlight the value of such a national framework to a broader national and international community, particularly aimed at those decision-makers involved in antimicrobial stewardship. While some of its content may only be applicable to a devolved Scottish Health Care system we feel that many of the principles and good practice points are of generic concern and would be of relevance and value to all acute hospitals. On behalf of the all the authors involved in producing this document it is our hope that this article will stimulate debate and action within our acute hospitals.
