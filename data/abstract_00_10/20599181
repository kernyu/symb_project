OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical and microbiologic features of isolates among patients with puerperal mastitis requiring hospitalization. STUDY DESIGN: Between January 2000 and December 2008, postpartum patients who were hospitalized for mastitis were enrolled. The clinical characteristics, microbiologic results, management, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven cases were enrolled. Seventy-six patients (59.9%) underwent incision and drainage for abscess drainage, all of whom discontinued breastfeeding. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates. Among 81 isolates of S aureus, 52 (64.2%) were resistant to oxacillin. Patients undergoing incision and drainage were more likely to discontinue breastfeeding, had a longer duration of symptoms, a longer hospitalization, a higher platelet count and higher rates of infection caused by S aureus and oxacillin-resistant S aureus. CONCLUSION: Oxacillin-resistant S aureus has emerged in patients with puerperal mastitis during the past decade, and often necessitates incision and drainage, which results in discontinuation of breastfeeding.
