The ErmB macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) resistance determinant from Clostridium difficile 630 contains two copies of an erm(B) gene, separated by a 1.34-kb direct repeat also found in an Erm(B) determinant from Clostridium perfringens. In addition, both erm(B) genes are flanked by variants of the direct repeat sequence. This genetic arrangement is novel for an ErmB MLS resistance determinant.
