We report the 1st case of Bordetella hinzii septicemia associated with Epstein-Barr virus viremia and lymphoma. B. hinzii identification necessitated cellular fatty acid analysis by gas-liquid chromatography and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Isolates were resistant to many antimicrobials. Resistance and diagnostic challenges complicated management and contributed to mortality.
