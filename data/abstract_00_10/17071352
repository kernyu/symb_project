Control strategies for nematode parasites rely on knowledge of the relationships between the parasites and their hosts. Specifically, these programs are based on identifying crucial points of interaction in the environment provided by the host, including genetics and the immune response, and critical periods in the physical environment in which the eggs and larval stages must develop. When these targets are identified and the interactions understood, cost-effective sustainable programs can be developed using currently available antiparasitic compounds. Resistance to the major classes of anthelmintic compounds requires consideration of new approaches, such as immunity or genetics of the host. Additionally, the efficacy of these compounds can be expanded with combined or concomitant use. Increased study of the use of novel approaches, including fungi, elements such as copper, and plant products, has also occurred. This article explores each of these areas to allow readers to appreciate how various approaches may be developed and incorporated into an effective parasite control program.
