The development of novel antiviral drugs against hepatitis C is a challenging and competitive area of research. Progress of this research has been hampered due to the quasispecies nature of the hepatitis C virus, the absence of cellular infection models and the lack of easily accessible and highly representative animal models. The current combination therapy consisting of interferon-alpha and ribavirin mainly acts by supporting host cell defence. These therapeutics are the prototypic representatives of indirect antiviral agents as they act on cellular targets. However, the therapy is not a cure, when considered from the long-term perspective, for almost half of the chronically infected patients. This draws attention to the urgent need for more efficient treatments. Novel anti-hepatitis C treatments under study are directed against a number of so-called direct antiviral targets such as polymerases and proteases, which are encoded by the virus. Although such direct antiviral approaches have proven to be successful in several viral indications, there is a risk of resistant viruses developing. In order to avoid resistance, the development of indirect antiviral compounds has to be intensified. These act on host cell targets either by boosting the immune response or by blocking the virus host cell interaction. A particularly interesting approach is the development of inhibitors that interfere with signal transduction, such as protein kinase inhibitors. The purpose of this review is to stress the importance of developing indirect antiviral agents that act on host cell targets. In doing so, a large source of potential targets and mechanisms can be exploited, thus increasing the likelihood of success. Ultimately, combination therapies consisting of drugs against direct and indirect viral targets will most probably provide the solution to fighting and eradicating hepatitis C virus in patients.
