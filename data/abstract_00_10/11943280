Pathogenic fungi have many complex mechanisms of resistance to antifungal drugs. Information about the clinical, cellular, and molecular factors contributing to antifungal-drug resistance continues to accumulate. We critically review the diagnosis, epidemiology, and mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance of pathogenic fungi. Better understanding of this resistance should assist in developing better detection strategies for preventing and treating refractory mycoses in the future.
