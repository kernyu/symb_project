A set of 2-benzylsulfanyl derivatives of benzoxazole was synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria and multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis. The activities were expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in mmol/L. The substances showed similar activity against all tested strains. The lead compounds in the set, dinitro derivatives exhibited significant activity against both sensitive and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis and also against non-tuberculous mycobacteria. To facilitate drug design of benzoxazole as potential antituberculosis agent, we have explored the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR). We demonstrated that lower lipophilicity has significant contribution to activity. Dinitrobenzylsulfanyl derivative of benzoxazole represents the promising small-molecule synthetic antimycobacterials.
