We describe a case of recurring Candida glabrata infection in a 68-year-old African-American female on caspofungin therapy. The initial isolate was susceptible, but isolates recovered during following relapses were not. All isolates were clonal, and high-MIC strains contained a mutation in the highly conserved hot spot 1 region of Fks1p.
