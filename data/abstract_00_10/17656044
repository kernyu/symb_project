The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC O157) and other Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) in feces of white veal calves in an operation in Ontario, to evaluate exposure of the calves to EHEC O157, and to investigate the milk replacer diet and antimicrobial resistance as factors that might influence the prevalence of EHEC O157. Feces from three cohorts of 20-21 calves were collected weekly for 20 weeks and processed for isolation of EHEC O157:H7 and detection of STEC by an ELISA. Exposure to EHEC O157 was also investigated by measuring IgG and IgM antibodies to the O157 lipopolysaccharide (O157 Ab) in sera by ELISA. The prevalences of EHEC O157 were 0.17% of 1151 fecal samples and 3.2% of 62 calves, and for STEC were 68% of 1005 fecal samples and 100% of 62 calves. Seroconversion to active IgG and IgM O157 Ab responses in some calves was not associated with isolation of EHEC O157. The milk replacer contained low levels of antibodies to EHEC antigens and without antimicrobial drugs, it did not inhibit the growth of EHEC O157 in vitro. Two E. coli O157:H7 that were isolated were totally drug sensitive whereas 60 commensal E. coli isolates that were examined were highly resistant. Antibodies in milk replacer that might be protective in vivo, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the milk replacer may contribute to the low prevalence of EHEC O157 in white veal calves.
