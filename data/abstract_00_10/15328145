We determined fluoroquinolone microbiological resistance breakpoints for Streptococcus pneumoniae by using genetic instead of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters. The proposed microbiological breakpoints define resistance as the MIC at which >50% of the isolates carry quinolone resistance-determining region mutations and/or, if data are available, when Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate a <90% chance of bacteriological eradication. The proposed microbiological resistant breakpoints are as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): gatifloxacin, >0.25; gemifloxacin, >0.03; levofloxacin, >1; and moxifloxacin, >0.12. Monte Carlo simulations of the once daily 400-mg doses of gatifloxacin and 750-mg doses levofloxacin demonstrated a high level of target attainment (free-drug area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h/MIC ratio of 30) by using these new genetically derived breakpoints.
