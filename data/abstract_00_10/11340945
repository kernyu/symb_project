Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukaemia characterised by the accumulation of monoclonal CD5 + B-lymphocytes. The pathogenesis and the biology of CLL is complex and many details are still unknown. Several molecular biological methods have been used in the investigation of CLL, among them the study of apoptosis appears to be one of the most important. Initial experiences obtained by the spontaneous and fludarabine induced apoptosis, multidrug resistance (MDR)-test and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are reported by the authors. Apoptosis of CLL cells could be induced by fludarabine, while more studies should be performed to determine the exact role of MDR-test and FISH.
