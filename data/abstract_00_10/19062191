Faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT) using ivermectin (IVM) and benzimidazole (BZ) were conducted to investigate the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance in gastro-intestinal nematodes on cattle farms in Germany, Belgium and Sweden in 2006 and 2007. Based on sufficient numbers of eggs prior to the study, between 3 and 10 farms per country were selected. 10-15 animals were randomly selected per farm and subcutaneously treated with 0.2 mg IVM/kg bodyweight (Ivomec, Merial). Faecal samples were collected individually from every animal on day 0 (treatment), day 7 (Belgium & Sweden) or 14 (Germany), and day 21 (Germany, Belgium and Sweden). Faecal egg counts (FEC) were performed at each sampling occasion to estimate the eggs per gram of faeces (EPG) and the reduction of eggs after treatment. The FECRT using IVM in 2006 revealed mean reduction of egg counts between 69-100% on day 7/14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 19-102) and 35-96% (95% CI 0-102) on day 21. Farms with a suggested problem of anthelmintic resistance have been re-visited in 2007 and except for one case all results obtained in 2006 were confirmed in 2007. Larvae obtained from faecal cultures were identified using microscopic identification keys or genus-specific real time PCR. Cooperia oncophora was the predominant species detected after treatment, but Ostertagia ostertagi was found in samples on 3 farms in Germany and 3 farms in Sweden post-treatment. In 2007 additionally a FECRT using benzimidazoles was conducted in Germany and Sweden. In Germany oral Valbazen (albendazole, 10%, Pfizer) was used at a concentration of 7.5 mg albendazole/kg bodyweight; in Sweden Valbazen Vet (albendazole, 10%, Orion Pharma) at a dose of 8 mg/kg was used. For benzimidazoles an efficacy of 100% was obtained on all tested farms in both countries. This is the first report of a multinational anthelmintic efficacy investigation in cattle in Europe. The results suggest that testing of anthelmintic efficacy should be performed more intensively due to possible insufficient efficacy of current drugs.
