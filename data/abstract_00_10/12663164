Enterococci are uncommon causes of CNS infection. We describe a case of ventriculitis and Ommaya reservoir infection due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium successfully treated with the combination of i.v. quinupristin/dalfopristin and i.v. linezolid. The patient deteriorated after receiving three dosages of intraventricular quinupristin/dalfopristin. He recovered after discontinuation of intraventricular quinupristin/dalfopristin.
