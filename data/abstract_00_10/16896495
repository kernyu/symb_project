The prevalence of different species of Enterococcus and the resistance to antimicrobial drugs was studied in strains isolated in 5 hospitals of Northern Chile. A total of 249 of Enterococcus spp strains were included in this study. Enterococci were mostly isolated from urine and wounds. Among five species identified, E. faecalis and E. faecium were most frequently isolated in the all hospitals. High susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, moderate resistance to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, and high resistance to chloramphenicol was observed. Vancomycin resistance was absent. Approximately 12% of Enterococcus spp strains presented high level of gentamicin resistance. Multiresistance to 3 or more antimicrobial agents was detected in 30% of total Enterococcus strains studied.
