To investigate the relationship between maternal-fetal histocompatibility and maternal microchimerism, we developed a sensitive quantitative PCR assay for the neomycin resistance gene (neoR), and, in a mouse model system, used neoR as a noninherited maternal allele marker of maternal cells to detect and quantitate maternal microchimerism in tissues of neoR(-/-) N2 backcross progeny of (neoR(+/-))F(1) females mated with neoR(-/-) males. Using this approach, we obtained evidence for the presence of chimeric maternal cells in the brain, spleen, and thymus of all weanling and adult mice so tested. The numbers of chimeric maternal cells present in the spleen did not differ significantly from those in the thymus regardless of age or maternal-fetal histocompatibility. At all ages, brain tissue had higher level of maternal microchimerism than lymphoid tissue in mice MHC identical with their mothers, but the levels were similar in mice MHC disparate with their mothers. The levels of chimeric maternal cells in both brain and lymphoid tissue of mice with homozygous syngenicity and maternal allogenicity were similar, and tended to be higher than tissue-specific levels in mice with either combined maternal-fetal allogenicity or heterozygous syngenicity. Thus, MHC homozygous progeny had higher levels of maternal microchimerism than MHC heterozygous progeny. We conclude that normal mice possess small numbers of maternal cells in spleen, thymus, brain, and probably most other tissues, and that maternal-fetal histocompatibility influences the levels of these cells by mechanisms related to MHC zygosity of the progeny.
