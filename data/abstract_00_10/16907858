After designing in vitro models of repeated exposure of Salmonella spp. to various beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones we studied the decrease in susceptibility to other antibiotic families of the mutants generated. There was a decrease in the susceptibility of all the mutants to tetracycline, cotrimoxazole and chloramphenicol. Mutants generated following exposure to fluoroquinolones showed reduced susceptibility to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin and cefuroxime, whereas mutants generated following beta-lactam exposure showed reduced susceptibility to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. We observed that the efflux pump systems are activated in the mutants generated and this may therefore be the cause of the decrease in susceptibility. In many cases the decrease is small and is not detected if the CLSI criteria are applied. Nevertheless, more detailed studies should be done to evaluate the importance of this phenomenon and rationalize the use of antibiotics in both humans and animals so as to control the increase in the number of multiresistant strains.
