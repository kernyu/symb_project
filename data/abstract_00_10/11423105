Chitosan derivatives with quaternary ammonium salt, such as N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan, N-N-propyl-N,N-dimethyl chitosan and N-furfuryl-N,N-dimethyl chitosan were prepared using different 96% deacetylated chitosan of M(v) 2.14x10(5), 1.9x10(4), 7.8x10(3). Amino groups on chitosan react with aldehydes to from a Schiff base intermediate. Quaternized chitosan were obtained by reaction of a Schiff base with methyl iodide. The yields, degree of quaternization and water-solubility of quaternized chitosan were influenced by the molecular weight of the chitosan sample. The antibacterial activities of quaternized chitosan against Escherichia coli were explored by calculation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) in water, 0.25 and 0.50% acetic acid medium. Results show the antibacterial activities of quaternized chitosan against E. coli is related to its molecular weight. Antibacterial activities of quaternized chitosan in acetic acid medium is stronger than that in water. Their antibacterial activities is increased as the concentration of acetic acid is increased. It was also found that the antibacterial activity of quaternized chitosan against E. coli is stronger than that of chitosan.
