Nasal sinusitis, tonsillitis, and pharyngolaryngitis typify upper respiratory tract infections, while bronchitis and pneumonia typify lower respiratory tract infections. Cases of paranasal sinusitis with severe suppuration are reportedly becoming less frequent, while those of chronic catarrhal paranasal sinusitis and edematous allergic paranasal sinusitis are becoming more so, The primary factor in paranasal sinusitis, a typical infectious disease encountered in otolaryngology, is bacterial infection. The main causative bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae, reported in 13.4% of cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 12.8% Moraxella catarrhalis in 5.5%, Staphylococcus aureus in 26.5%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5.2%, and anaerobes. The incidence of strains resistant to antimicrobial agents has grown for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis and decreased for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Acute exacerbation or severe suppuration in chronic paranasal sinusitis requires the administration of antimicrobial agents, with the same agent administered 2 weeks for maximal effect. First-line agents are AMPC/CVA, SBTPC, CDTR-PI, CFPN-PI, and GFLX for adults, with ASPC, SBPC, ACPC, CTRX, CMZ, FMOX, PAPM/BP, and MEPM injected in severe cases. Attention must be paid to strains that resist cephems and macrolides, such as PISP, PRSP, and BLNAR. In refractory chronic paranasal sinusitis, attention must also be paid to biofilms produced by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Suitable antimicrobial agents should be determined for treating of chronic paranasal sinusitis, in addition to the best procedure to ensure early recovery from inflammation, such as puncturing or irrigating the maxillary sinus, injecting a suitable agent, nebulization, and/or surgically widening the middle meatus.
