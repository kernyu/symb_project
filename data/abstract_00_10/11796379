The MtrC-MtrD-MtrE efflux pump possessed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is very similar to the MexA-MexB-OprM efflux pump of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because the antimicrobial resistance property afforded by the MexA-MexB-OprM efflux pump also requires the TonB protein, we asked whether a similar requirement exists for the gonococcal efflux pump. Unlike earlier studies with P. aeruginosa, we found that constitutive levels of gonococcal resistance to hydrophobic antimicrobial agents (i.e., Triton X-100 [TX-100]) did not require the TonB, ExbB, or ExbD protein. However, inducible levels of TX-100 resistance in gonococci had an absolute requirement for the TonB-ExbB-ExbD system, suggesting that such resistance in gonococci has an energy requirement above and beyond that required for constitutive pump activity.
