Tigecycline activity was evaluated against 11808 pathogens isolated from 30 US medical centers. Susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods. Tigecycline (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 microg/mL) was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, regardless of oxacillin resistance. This glycylcycline (MIC(50), 0.12 microg/mL) was 8- and 16-fold more potent than penicillin and linezolid against enterococci and was the most potent agent tested versus Streptococcus pneumoniae. Against Enterobacteriaceae, tigecycline (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL; 98.9% susceptible) was as active as imipenem. This study demonstrated the sustained potency of tigecycline against contemporary clinically relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens; tigecycline resistance was rare (0.3%).
