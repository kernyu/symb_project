A multicopper oxidase gene from Staphylococcus aureus was cloned and overexpressed. Purified recombinant multicopper oxidase oxidized the substrate 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine in the presence of copper. Disruption of mco showed copper sensitivity and H(2)O(2) resistance, suggesting roles for mco in copper homeostasis and oxidative stress response. Northern blot analysis showed copper-induced mco transcription.
