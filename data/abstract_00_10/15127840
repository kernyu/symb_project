Canine visceral leishmaniasis poses important concerns for public health and veterinary medicine in many areas of the world. Resistance to it seems to be associated with cellular specific immune responses of the so-called Th1 type. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is one of the most potent inducers of Th1 type of immune responses to co-administered antigens. Herein, the cloning of canine IL-12, as a single-chain fusion protein (sccaIL-12), and its expression in biologically active form in COS-7 cells is reported. Supernatants from these cells stimulated the expression of comparable amounts of interferon gamma mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from dogs with natural visceral leishmaniasis. In addition, after stimulation with sccaIL-12, there was no difference between interferon gamma mRNA expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of dogs with visceral leishmaniasis and from normal healthy control animals.
