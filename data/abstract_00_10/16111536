Two patients with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) refractory to anti-thymocyte globulin, prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone and cyclosporine, were treated with alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 antibody). Case 1, a 35-year-old man with idiopathic PRCA, remitted completely with 130 mg of alemtuzumab. Case 2, a 42-year-old man with PRCA due to T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukaemia, achieved complete remission of the PRCA with 490 mg of alemtuzumab, although the T-LGL leukaemia responded only transiently. There were no significant side effects, and normalization of erythropoiesis was durable. Alemtuzumab is active in PRCA that is idiopathic or secondary to T-cell lymphoproliferative diseases.
