This study was conducted to investigate the presence of methicillin and aminoglycoside resistance encoding genes by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by phenotypic methods in staphylococci isolated from inpatients' clinical specimens. The presence of aac(6')1aph(2"), aph(3')-IIIa and ant(4)-Ia genes encoding aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AME) and mecA gene encoding methicillin resistance were genotypically investigated. A total of 19 S. aureus and 30 coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) were tested. Thirty four (69.4%) of the isolates were found to be resistant to oxacillin with disk diffusion test, 33 (97%) of which were found to harbour mecA gene. The correspondance between oxacillin resistance and presence of mecA gene was found to be 100% in S. aureus isolates, while it was 95.7% in CNS. Twenty two (44.9%), 7 (14.3%) and 2 (4.1%) isolates were found to harbour aac(6')/aph(2"), aph(3')-IIIa and ant(4)-/a AME genes, respectively. At least one or more AME genes were detected in 72.7% of mecA positive isolates.
