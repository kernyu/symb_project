OBJECTIVE: Daptomycin exhibits bactericidal activity against clinically significant Gram-positive bacteria despite being highly bound to human proteins. Evaluations characterizing the effect of protein on daptomycin pharmacodynamics are warranted. METHODS: We utilized an in vitro pharmacodynamic model to simulate daptomycin regimens of 6 mg/kg/day under controlled conditions of pH, calcium and/or protein. Free concentrations were simulated in broth, whereas total concentrations were simulated in broth supplemented with human albumin. Bacterial density was profiled over 48 h for two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) clinical isolates. RESULTS: Daptomycin exhibited bactericidal activity against both MRSA isolates, with time to 99.9% killing occurring at 0.5 h and 8 h in broth and in albumin-supplemented broth, respectively. Initial kill was observed against both VREF isolates followed by regrowth. There was no statistical difference (P>0.05) in extent of bacterial kill at 24 or 48 h between the different media. CONCLUSIONS: Although delayed, the extent of kill for daptomycin was unaltered against all isolates in albumin-supplemented broth. Further antimicrobial studies that incorporate protein are warranted to assess the influence of protein in the pharmacodynamic evaluation of antimicrobials.
