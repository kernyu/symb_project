Using broth micro-dilution method, we studied the susceptibility of 180 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis to meropenem (MEPM) and reference agents. All strains were isolated from the blood of patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January 2006 and November 2006. The results were as follows: 1. MEPM showed greater potency against Gram-negative bacteria than the other carbapenems including doripenem in particular. A metallo-beta-lactamase producing multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa strain was detected. 2. A comparison of the antibacterial activity of MEPM with that in our previous studies 1997-1998, 1999, 2002-2003, and 2004 showed no marked increase in MEPM-resistant clinical isolates. These results suggest that MEPM retains its potency as the agent of choice in treating serious infections.
