During the 6-year observation period from 1998 to 2003 in Moscow there was recorded in 2000-2001 a decrease in the emergence of Streptococcos pneumoniae resistance to many antibacterials, while during the following years the respective index increased. The above dynamics in the resistance emergence was likely due to a decrease in the use of antibiotics in 1998-1999. In 2003 the rate of resistance to penicillin was 18.6%, 0.4 and 2.1% of the isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and cefotaxime respectively, the rate of resistance to erythromycin reached 19%, 65.4% of the resistant strains showed M phenotype. High rates of resistance were as well observed with respect to tetracycline (40.1%), co-trimoxazole (29.1%) and chloramphenicol (18.6%). Resistance to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was detected only in rare strains.
