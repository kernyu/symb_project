Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged over the last decade across the United States and the world, becoming a major pathogen in many types of community-acquired infections. Although most commonly associated with minor skin and soft tissue infections, such as furuncles, CA-MRSA also can cause necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, osteoarticular infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. This article discusses the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of these infections from the perspective of the emergency physician.
