We compared the efficacy of the combination of fusidic acid impregnated bone cement and systemic teicoplanin to systemic teicoplanin alone in implant-related osteomyelitis model in the rats. Foreign bodies were implanted into the medullary channels of 30 rat tibias after intramedullary inoculation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Following proof of induction of osteomyelitis in the rats on the 21st day, a bone cement rod including 1/40 ratio of fusidic acid was inserted into the medullary channel of the tibias in the study group. Teicoplanin was administered i.m. at 20 mg/kg/day for 14 days to both the study and control groups. At the end of the treatment, the tibias were examined macroscopically, microbiologically and histopathologically. The elimination rate with the teicoplanin+fusidic acid combination was 81.8%, while with teicoplanin alone was 55.6% (p=0.33). Although the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant, the combination treatment had a positive effect in eliminating the microorganism.
