Antimicrobial-resistant organisms have become a major issue for all healthcare staff. The Government, media and public are now calling for action to be taken to minimize the risk of acquiring such an infection when admitted to any healthcare setting. Although it is impossible to completely remove the risk of acquiring infection, there are methods already available to healthcare staff and the public that would help to reduce the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections that occur. The National Audit Office (2000) has estimated that if the guidelines already in place were adhered to, the rate of hospital-acquired infections could be reduced by between 15% and 30%. Their use would also help reduce the amount of antimicrobial drugs prescribed and may lower the risk of further development of antimicrobial-resistant microbes. This article examines microbial resistance, sources of infection and discusses the measures that can be taken to reduce the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant infection that occur within the healthcare setting.
