OBJECTIVES: To analyse the oxidative and nitrosative stress response in Candida albicans generated by fluconazole at subinhibitory concentrations, and the functional consequences of such a response for the interaction with phagocytic cells. METHODS: The C. albicans CAI-4 strain carrying transcriptional fusions of the TRR1p, YHB1p and GRE2p genes to the Renilla reniformis luciferase LUC gene was pre-treated with subinhibitory concentrations of fluconazole and incubated with oxidants (diamide and hydrogen peroxide) or with the myelomonocytic cell line HL-60. RESULTS: Fluconazole induced oxidative and nitrosative stress in a time- and dose-dependent manner as determined using oxidative- and nitrosative-specific gene reporters. At subinhibitory concentrations, fluconazole was able to induce protection in vitro to subsequent challenges with oxidants in both liquid and solid media, and also induced partial protection against the oxidative-mediated killing mechanisms of the myelocytic HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Subinhibitory concentrations of fluconazole protect against oxidants and killing mediated by phagocytes.
