We performed an antibiotic resistance study on Enterococcus faecalis isolated from intrahospitalary and extrahospitalary samples between january 2004 and january 2008. Three different samples were studied; urine, blood and wound swabs, considering a strain per patient. We included in the study a global amount of 3,641 Enterococcus faecalis isolations from clinical samples received at Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia microbiology service in Cordoba (Spain). We employed semiautomatic system WIDER I (Soria Melguizo) for identification and sensibility testing. We considered sensibility and resistance criteria recommended by MENSURA group. We found a sensitivity rate of 98.04% to betalactamics.The highest resistance rates were obtained with aminoglycosides, between 33.82% and 48.01%. Linezolid and Vancomycin sensitivity was 100%. It seems that vancomycin resistance is not a worrying issue today, but it should be controlled.
