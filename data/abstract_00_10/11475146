Patients with refractory acute leukemias after intensive induction and salvage attempts have a particularly poor prognosis and therapeutic options are limited. In the current study, the pharmacologically based FIS-HAM regimen was applied, which included fludarabine 15 mg/m2 q 12 h (days 1, 2, 8, and 9), cytosine arabinoside as a 45-min infusion every 3 h at 750 mg/m2 per single application (days 1, 2, 8, and 9), and mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 (days 3, 4, 10, 11). Twenty-six intensively pretreated patients [median age: 38 years; range: 22-65; 16 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 10 of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)] were included. Of 16 patients with AML, 5 achieved a complete remission (CR, 31%), 1 a partial remission (PR, 6%), 2 were nonresponders (13%), and 8 succumbed to early death (ED, 50%). Of 10 patients with ALL, 5 achieved a CR, 1 a PR, 1 was a nonresponder, and 3 died early. Overall, the CR rate was 38%. The median disease-free survival time was 50 days and median survival 90 days. Two patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and are alive after 27 and 28 months. Neutropenia amounted to a median of 46 days. Toxicity WHO III/IV included infection (61%), diarrhea (48%), nausea/vomiting (43%), impairment of heart function (30%), and mucositis (26%). The current data indicate a significant activity of FIS-HAM chemotherapy in advanced acute leukemias. However, due to its pronounced toxicity, this regimen should be restricted to third-line therapy for patients expecting a suitable donor for allogeneic transplantation, and supportive treatment should be optimized.
