In the United States, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia and invasive bacterial disease. As antimicrobial resistance increases, it will become critical to determine if strains circulating in a population are likely to cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). This is possible by comparison of an isolate's genotype to strains known to be invasive. In this work, we compared pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and multi-invasive-locus sequence typing (MILST) for their ability to distinguish between known IPD causing and carrier strains using phylogenetic analyses. In addition, we assess the ability of these techniques to determine true clones from highly related strains. The resulting trees suggest that despite similar overall topologies, the clearest picture of invasiveness and genetic relatedness can be viewed when typing methods are used collectively.
