Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious complication of immunosuppression, and has become more widespread as the immunocompromised population has increased as a result of new treatment strategies and diseases. This paper identifies and discusses seven issues for managing IA and combating drug resistance. Management of IA requires a multifactorial approach with the host as a major contributor to management strategies and outcome. However, significant progress has been made, and with careful use of the clinical tools available it is possible to make a successful impact on infection outcomes.
