Saccharomyces cerevisiae UCM Y-517, Candida utilis UCM Y-961 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe UCM Y-94T have been studied for their sensitivity to fungicide antibiotics under the effect of electromagnetic radiation (40.68 MHz, 15 and 30 W). Yeast sensitivity to nystatin, amphotericin B, klotrimazol, itrakonazol, flukonazol as well as the effects arising as a result of the effect of radiofrequency radiation are characterized by species specificity. Irradiation did not exert statistically reliable effect on S. cerevisiae and S. pombe sensitivity to fungicide antibiotics. The increase of resistance of C. utilis to antibiotics (growth delay zones were absent in 70-90% of experiments) in the case of preliminary irradiation of this strain was stated. Separate preliminary irradiation of antibiotics did not result in the change of their antifungal activity. The arising effects were noticed to depend on the radiation power. Possible reasons of species specificity in sensing electromagnetic radiation are considered.
