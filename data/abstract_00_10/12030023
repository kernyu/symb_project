We studied the susceptibility to penicillin G (PCG) and other antimicrobiotics in 235 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Samples were collected between April 1 and June 30, 2000 from nine medical institutions of the Kinki Region of Japan. We classified the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PCG according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) criteria. The overall rate of all types of S. pneumoniae resistance was 53.2% (penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP): 46.8%, penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP): 42.6%, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP): 10.6%). In other antimicrobiotics, the resistance (R)/intermediate susceptibility (I) rates (R/I%) were as follows: ceftriaxone, 28.9%; cefotaxime, 7.7%; imipenem, 8.9%; meropenem, 9.8%; clarithromycin, 82.6%; clindamycin, 42.1%; levofloxacin, 0.4%; vancomycin, 0%. We used the polymerase chain reaction to study the mutations of the penicillin-binding proteins pbp1 a, pbp2b, and pbp2x in 140 strains of S. pneumoniae in the MIC for PCG was < 0.5 microgram/ml. Among the 109 strains of PSSP, 32 (29.4%) had no mutation and 77 (70.6%) showed mutation of more than one of the pbp mutations. Among the 31 strains of PISP, only 1 strain (3.2%) was not mutated. Since 70.6% of the strains classified as PSSP had pbp mutations, S. pneumoniae clearly can acquire resistance to anti-microbiotics. In the future, a comprehensive surveillance of S. pneumoniae is necessary.
