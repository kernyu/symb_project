Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were transfected with recombinant prodrug herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) cDNA, and the selected clones underwent apoptosis in response to induction by antiviral ganciclovir (GCV). The efficiency of GCV-induced growth inhibition and the extent of the bystander effect were associated with the expression level of HSV-TK in stable transfectants. Development in the HSV-tk/GCV system toward cell death was initiated with cell-cycle accumulation at S and G(2)/M phases, immediately followed by the appearance of sub-G(0)/G(1) cells after drug exposure. To investigate the regulation of cell-cycle modulators during drug treatment, we analyzed release of the apoptosis initiator cytochrome c and activation of the downstream effectors caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 16 hr after GCV sensitization, followed by transient escalation of tumor-suppressor p53 and cell-cycle modulators cyclin A and B(1) before committing to programmed cell death. Furthermore, tumor regression was proportional to the degree of ectopic expression of the transferred HSV-tk gene. Our results demonstrate that the HSV-tk/GCV system effectively inhibits the proliferation of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo through potent induction of apoptosis, thus providing a rationale for further development.
