Alterations in phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3'-kinase) and Akt activation frequently occur in prostate cancer and may disrupt apoptotic induction by such cytokines as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). To examine the role of PI3' phosphorylation in the cellular response to cytokines, two prostate cancer cell lines with constitutively activated PI3'-kinase cascades (LNCaP and PC-3) were examined for direct sensitivity to cytokines. TNF or TRAIL alone failed to activate apoptosis in either LNCaP or PC-3 cells, and drug-mediated inhibition of the PI3k/Akt cascade caused only minimal activation of apoptosis in either cell line. Suppression of PI3'-kinase/Akt signaling markedly enhanced the apoptotic activity of both TNF and TRAIL in LNCaP cells but not in PC-3 cells. Adenovirus-mediated PTEN/MMAC1 expression in LNCaP cells reduced Akt activation, activated apoptosis, and sensitized cells to TNF but not to TRAIL. Together, these results suggest that PI3'-kinase signaling inhibits both TNF-mediated and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis but may represent one of several apoptotic resistance mechanisms that inhibit cytokine-mediated killing of prostate cancer cells.
