Expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) such as ceftriaxone, together with fluorinated quinolones, are the choice antibiotics in the treatment of invasive salmonella infections. Resistance to ESCs among non-typhoid salmonella has been recognised since the late 1980s. Currently, ESC-resistant salmonella strains are reported world-wide and in some areas their incidence is significant. Resistance is mainly due to acquisition of multi-resistant plasmids encoding a variety of extended-spectrum and AmpC-type beta-lactamases. The origins of ESC-resistant salmonellae are diverse. Exchange of resistance determinants between salmonellae and nosocomial enterobacteria seems to be frequent, at least in developing countries. Also, the use of newer beta-lactams in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine may have facilitated the spread of ESC-resistant salmonella strains in livestock.
