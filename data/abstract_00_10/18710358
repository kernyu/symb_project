BACKGROUND: Over the past two decades, the frequency and type of invasive fungal infections have increased greatly and thus have driven the need for new antifungal agents. Anidulafungin is the newest addition to the echinocandin armamentarium. OBJECTIVE: The intention of this review is to provide a drug evaluation of anidulafungin, including its spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, adverse event profile, and its role in the treatment of invasive candidiasis. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed to gather the most current and pertinent articles. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials have demonstrated anidulafungin's efficacy and tolerability in invasive candidiasis. Anidulafungin is not associated with any drug-drug interactions and does not require dosage adjustment in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment.
