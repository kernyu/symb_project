In this study, the resistance of biodegradable biomaterials, composed of blends of poly(-caprolactone) (PCL) and the polymeric antimicrobial complex, polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (PVP-I) to the adherence of a clinical isolate of Escherichia coli is described. Blends of PCL composed of a range of high (50,000 g mol(-1)) to low (5000 g mol(-1)) molecular weight ratios of polymer and either devoid of or containing PVP-I (1% w/w) were prepared by solvent evaporation. Following incubation (4 h), there was no relationship between m. wt. ratio of PCL in films devoid of PVP-I and adherence of E. coli. Conversely, microbial adherence to PCL containing PVP-I decreased as the ratio of high:low m. wt. polymer was decreased and was approximately 1000 fold lower than that to comparator films devoid of PVP-I. Following periods of immersion of PVP-I containing PCL films under sink conditions in phosphate buffered saline, subsequent adherence of E. coli was substantially reduced for 2 days (40:60 m. wt. ratio) and 6 days (100:0 m. wt. ratio). Concurrent exposure of PCL and E. coli to sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MIC) of PVP-I significantly reduced microbial adherence to the biomaterial; however, the molecular weight ratio of PCL did not affect this outcome. Pretreatment of PCL with similar sub-MIC of PVP-I prior to inclusion within the microbial adherence assay significantly decreased the subsequent adherence of E. coli. Greatest reduction in adherence was observed following treatment of PCL (40:60 m. wt. ratio) with 0.0156% w/w PVP-I. In conclusion, this study has illustrated the utility of PVP-I as a suitable therapeutic agent for incorporation within PCL as a novel biomaterial. Due to the combined antimicrobial and biodegradable properties, these biomaterials offer a promising strategy for the reduction in medical device related infection.
