OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antituberculosis drugs and the factors associated with it among patients with tuberculosis (TB) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of TB and AIDS cases diagnosed from 1992 to 1997 in a public service for AIDS care were reviewed. RESULTS: Resistance was diagnosed in 82 (19%) of 431 cases. The mean and median values between the diagnosis of AIDS and the diagnosis of TB were 214.8 days and 70.5 days, respectively. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) occurred in 11.3% of cases. Of the 186 patients with no previous treatment, 13 (6.9%) presented primary MDR TB. Of the 90 cases with previous treatment, six (6.7%) presented monoresistance to rifampin and 27 (30%) presented MDR TB. The distribution of cases with sensitive and resistant M. tuberculosis strains was homogeneous in terms of the following variables: gender, age, category of exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), alcoholism, and homelessness. Multivariate analysis showed an association between resistance and the two following variables: previous treatment and duration of AIDS prior to TB exceeding 71 days. The rates of primary multiresistance and of monoresistance to rifampin were higher than those detected in HIV-negative patients in Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient series, M. tuberculosis resistance was predominantly of the acquired type, and resistance was independently associated with previous treatment for TB and with duration of AIDS prior to TB exceeding 71 days.
