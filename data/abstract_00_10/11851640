AIMS: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication rate varies according to the treatment regimen used and other factors, e.g. antimicrobial resistance and patient compliance. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of patient counselling and follow-up on H. pylori eradication rates and to document the effectiveness of a 1 week eradication regimen consisting of lansoprazole (30 mg once daily), amoxicillin (1 g twice daily) and clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily). METHODS: Seventy-six dyspeptic patients, who at endoscopy were found to have gastritis, duodenitis or ulceration, and a positive H. pylori urease test, were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 38) or a control group (n = 38). Intervention patients received their medicines via the hospital pharmacy and were counselled (and followed up) by a hospital pharmacist. Control patients were given a standard advice sheet and referred to their GP who prescribed the same therapy. RESULTS: Intervention patients exhibited a statistically significant improvement in the H. pylori eradication rate (94.7% vs 73.7%; P = 0.02) and compliance (92.1% vs 23.7; P < 0.001). Of the 64 H. pylori eradicated patients, 62 were able to eliminate their antisecretory medication compared with only 12 of the H. pylori persistent patients (P < 0.001). A pharmacoeconomic evaluation indicated that counselling and follow-up reduced the direct costs of eradication by approximately 30 UK pounds per patient. CONCLUSIONS: Structured patient counselling and follow-up can have a significant effect on H. pylori eradication rates and should be a routine part of therapy.
