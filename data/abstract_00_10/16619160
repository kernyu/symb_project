A strategy to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella in ground beef is urgently needed. A national multi-disciplinary meeting reviewed the epidemiology of MDR Salmonella infection and contamination in humans, animals, and retail meat. In spite of a recent overall decrease in human MDR Salmonella isolates, certain types, such as Salmonella enterica serotype Newport multidrug-resistant-AmpC strain and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium definitive type (DT) 104, have persisted, and several recent large outbreaks of human infection have occurred. Key agencies that contribute to a safe ground beef supply were represented at the meeting and contributed to the discussion of possible control strategies from the farm to the table. Several of the control strategies suggested are unpopular to some, including restricting the use of antimicrobial agents in food animals, designation of multidrug-resistant Salmonella as an adulterant in ground beef, and improving the mechanisms for product trace-back investigations. Nevertheless, enhanced farm-based animal infection control, judicious veterinary and human antibiotic use, regulatory controls, and consumer practices will lead to important industry, veterinary, and public health outcomes.
