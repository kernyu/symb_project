Between 1960 and 1980, extraordinary success was achieved in anthelmintic development for animals. In these 20 years, drugs with diverse structure, novel activity and enviable safety were produced for a global livestock industry leading to the productivity gains needed to support a human population that grew by 1.5 billion during the same period. The following 20 years have been spent refining existing molecules with niche activity (parasite and host specificity), improving delivery systems and worrying about the inexorable spread of drug resistance. The challenge for the next 20 years will be to use the technologies available to design and produce new drugs and biological controls. Then, to use the lessons of the past to ensure that the new drugs enjoy a longer useful lifespan and contribute to an animal health industry (livestock and companion) which enriches the lives of a global population. Old and new veterinary anthelmintics comprise a very large field, which could not be comprehensively reviewed in a short article. The present mini-review focuses on major chemical discoveries, formulation developments, administration strategies and new products.
