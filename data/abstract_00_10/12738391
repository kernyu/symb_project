Metronidazole (Mtz) resistance in the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is closely associated with inactivation of the nitroreductase gene rdxA. In order to identify respective mutations for diagnostic purposes we analyzed the rdxA gene in a collection of high-level Mtz-resistant clinical H. pylori isolates. Size alterations in the rdxA gene region were found in only two out of 45 and one out of 40 isolates showing lower-level (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 32-192 microg ml(-1)) and high-level (MIC>/=256 microg ml(-1)) Mtz resistance, respectively. Point mutations that interrupt the rdxA reading frame were detected in two out of eight high-level resistant isolates (MICs>/=256 microg ml(-1)). Most remarkably, the rdxA gene sequence was found to be identical in four out of five high-level Mtz-resistant and -susceptible paired H. pylori isolates from the same patients each. Taken together, these results demonstrate that although some isolates carry classical resistance-associated rdxA mutations, as described earlier, the use of rdxA mutations as a marker for prediction of Mtz resistance is limited.
