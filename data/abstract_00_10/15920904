Uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections are among those most commonly found in clinical practice, resulting in significant morbidity and health care costs. Current management is usually empirical because of the narrow and predictable spectrum of etiologic agents that cause acute cystitis and their susceptibility patterns. However, since antimicrobial resistance is increasing, the use narrow-spectrum, inexpensive antimicrobial agents becomes less feasible. In our study we have evaluated the effectiveness of amoxicillin, a narrow-spectrum, inexpensive and non toxic drug, against non-complicated acute cystitis in 34 patients, and compared the results with the antibiotic therapy previously employed by the physicians of the Health Care Unit of Paola (CS), Italy. Amoxicillin was found to be effective for the treatment of community-acquired cystitis, thus suggesting that the development of bacterial resistance does not represent a limit to its use. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that besides providing an effective alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics, the use of amoxicillin significantly reduced health care costs.
