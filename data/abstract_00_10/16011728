Helicobacter pylori plays a key role in dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric neoplasia and eradication of the infection has become an important treatment goal in clinical practice. Seven-day proton-pump inhibitor-amoxicillin-clarithromycin triple therapy is the current first-line therapy for H. pylori but eradication rates are compromised by poor compliance and antibiotic resistance. Ten-day sequential treatment may emerge as an alternative first-line therapy. Bismuth-based quadruple therapy is the second-line regimen of choice. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing is not recommended in the routine management of H. pylori infection. Novel triple-therapy regimens containing rifabutin, levofloxacin, or furazolidone may be useful alternatives as second- or third-line therapy.
