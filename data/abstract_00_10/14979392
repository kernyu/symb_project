Prompt diagnosis and early institution of therapy is an important determinant of outcome in severe falciparum malaria. Thick smears are the gold standard for diagnosis; in situations where reliable microscopy is not available, tests based on HRP-2 antigen/parasite LDH are useful. As there is widespread resistance to chloroquine in P falciparum in India, the choice for specific antimalarial therapy is between quinine and artermisinin derivatives. Randomized controlled trials have not revealed any significant benefit of the artemisinin derivatives over quinine in quinine sensitive areas. Also, if quinine is administered in the recommended way, the side effects are no greater than artemisinins. However, as the artemisinin derivatives are easier to administer, their use in severe malaria in India is increasing. It is vital that we use these drugs in a rational and judicious manner to prevent development of drug resistance. Supportive care, early diagnosis and management of complications are as essential as antimalarial therapy. The role of exchange blood transfusion in the management of severe malaria is still controversial. It may be considered in the presence of high parasites counts (>10%) with multiorgan dysfunction if adequate quantities of safe blood are available.
