We determined MICs of antibiotics against Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and Ehrlichia canis by real-time quantitative PCR. The doubling times of the organisms were established: 19 h for E. chaffeensis, 26 h for A. phagocytophilum, and 28 h for E. canis. In comparison to the reference method for determining sensitivities, which uses Diff-Quick staining, our PCR assay was very sensitive and specific. We confirmed that doxycycline and rifampin are highly active against these bacteria and found variable susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones; A. phagocytophilum was susceptible, but E. canis and E. chaffeensis were only partly susceptible. Beta-lactam compounds, cotrimoxazole, macrolide compounds, and telithromycin showed no activity against any of the three organisms. Thiamphenicol was found to be more active than chloramphenicol. For the first time, we showed that these three species have numerous point mutations in their 23S RNA genes, with those at positions 754, 2057, 2058, 2059, and 2611 (Escherichia coli numbering) known to confer resistance to macrolide compounds in other bacteria. The role of each of these mutations in resistance to these drugs should be investigated in the future. Our study confirms previous reports that quantitative PCR is a reliable method for determining antibiotic susceptibility; therefore, it might be useful for screening new drugs.
