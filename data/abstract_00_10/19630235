A retrospective study was conducted to determine the occurrence of poult enteritis syndrome (PES) in Minnesota from January 2002 to December 2007. PES is an infectious intestinal disease of young turkeys between 1 day and 7 wk of age and is characterized by diarrhea, depression, and lethargy with pale intestines and/or excessively fluid cecal contents. During the study period, samples from 1736 turkey flocks were submitted to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for disease investigation. Of these, 151 flocks (8.7%) were PES positive. Cases of PES were seen throughout the year with higher prevalence in fall. The PES was statistically associated with age with higher occurrence in poults less than 3 wk of age. Rotavirus, small round virus (SRV), Salmonella, nonhemolytic Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Eimeria oocysts were detected alone or in different combinations. Reovirus and adenovirus were found in one flock each. The most commonly identified pathogens were Salmonella (85 flocks) and rotavirus (73 flocks). Of PES-affected flocks, 39 (25.8%), 66 (43.7%), and 37 (24.5%) had one, two, and three or more pathogens, respectively. Rotavirus, SRV, and reovirus occurred mostly in poults of less than 6 wk of age while Salmonella, E. coli, and Eimeria were seen in poults of all age groups. Minimum age for rotavirus detection was in 2-day-old poults. Histopathologically, moderate to severe mixed intestinal villus or lamina propria inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis of distal villus tips in intestinal specimens, and mild to severe lymphocellular depletion in thymus, bursa, and spleen were seen. Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from PES-affected flocks revealed maximum sensitivity to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ceftiofur and a varying degree of resistance to other antimicrobials.
