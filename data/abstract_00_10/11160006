The pathologic features of cerebral Listeria monocytogenes infection strongly suggest that besides hematogenous spread, bacteria might also spread via a neural route. We propose that after snout infection of recombination activating gene 1 (RAG-1)-deficient mice, L. monocytogenes spreads to the brain via a neural route. The neural route of invasion is suggested by (i) the immunostaining of L. monocytogenes in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and brain stem but not in other areas of the brain; (ii) the kinetics of bacterial loads in snout, TG, and brain; and (iii) the increased resistance of mice infected with a plcB bacterial mutant (unable to spread from cell to cell). Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) plays a protective role in neuroinvasion; inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) accounts only partially for the protection, as shown by a comparison of the susceptibilities of IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma R)-deficient, iNOS-deficient, and wild-type mice to snout infection with L. monocytogenes. The dramatically enhanced susceptibility of RAG-1-deficient, IFN-gamma R gene-deficient mice indicated the overall importance of innate immune cells in the release of protective levels of IFN-gamma. The source of IFN-gamma appeared to be NK cells, as shown by use of RAG-1-deficient, gamma-chain receptor gene-deficient mice; NK cells played a relevant protective role in neuroinvasion through a perforin-independent mechanism. In vitro evidence indicated that IFN-gamma can directly induce bacteriostatic mechanisms in neural tissue.
