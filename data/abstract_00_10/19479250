This paper reports the in vivo expression of the synthetic transposase gene tnp(a) from a hyperactive Tn5 tnp gene mutant in Streptomyces coelicolor. Using the synthetic tnp(a) gene adapted for Streptomyces codon usage, we showed random insertion of the transposon into the Streptomycetes genome. The insertion frequency for the hyperactive Tn5 derivative is 98% of transformed S. coelicolor cells. The random transposition has been confirmed by the recovery of ~1.1% of auxotrophs. The Tn5 insertions are stably inherited in the absence of apramycin selection. The transposon contains an apramycin resistance selection marker and an R6Kgamma origin of replication for transposon rescue. We identified the transposon insertion loci by random sequencing of 14 rescue plasmids. The majority of insertions (12 of 14) were mapped to putative open-reading frames on the S. coelicolor chromosome. These included two new regulatory genes affecting S. coelicolor growth and actinorhodin biosynthesis.
