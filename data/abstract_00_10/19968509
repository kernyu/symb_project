The meeting of the American Society of Microbiology was recently held in San Francisco, CA, USA - a gathering of experts in the fields of infectious diseases, microbiology and the pharmaceutical industry, among others. Owing to this large attendance and extensive coverage of many infectious disease topics, we focus on the optimization of anti-infective use in the clinical setting. We will cover antimicrobial stewardship, drugs with Gram-positive activity, and antifungal and antiretroviral agents.
