Seven bla(IMP-1)-harboring Acinetobacter sp. isolates and one Pseudomonas putida clinical isolate were recovered from hospitalized patients. All isolates possessed a class 1 integron, named In86, carrying the same cassette array [bla(IMP1), aac(6')-31, and aadA1], which was plasmid located in five of the isolates. This report describes the ability of nonfermentative nosocomial pathogens to acquire and disseminate antimicrobial resistance determinants.
