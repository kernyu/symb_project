The expression of the ubiquitin (Ub) gene in dermatophytes was examined for its relation to resistance against the antifungal drug fluconazole. The nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences of the Ub gene in Microsporum canis were proven to be 99% similar to those of the Ub gene in Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Expression of mRNA of Ub in M. canis and T. mentagrophytes was enhanced when the fungi were cultured with fluconazole. The antifungal activity of fluconazole against these dermatophytes was increased in the presence of Ub proteasome inhibitor.
