Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) tolerance of Rhodococcus sp. strain APG1, previously isolated from the aquatic fern Azolla pinnata, was examined in relation to nitric oxide (NO) production by cells cultured on a variety of C sources. Cells inoculated onto A. pinnata fronds established a surface-sterilant resistant density of 2-4x10(7) cells g(-1) without causing disease. Compared to cultures containing glucose, fructose, mannitol, or glycerol, those provided only with sucrose displayed, on a per C basis, substantially lower (<10%) growth yields and higher resistance to H2O2. NO, a positive regulator of catalase synthesis in bacteria, was produced in larger amounts in sucrose-grown cells as evidence by eightfold greater per cell accumulations in the medium of nitrite (NO2-), a stable oxidation product of NO. Addition to cells of L-arginine, the substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), stimulated production of NO, detected both by fluorometric reaction with diaminofluorescein-FM diacetate (DAF-FM DA) and by increased levels of NO2- in the culture medium. These results suggest that sucrose may enhance H2O2 tolerance of Rhodococcus APG1 by increasing cellular NO producing capacity. We propose a regulatory role for NOS in promoting tolerance of Rhodococcus APG1 to oxidative stress in the phyllosphere.
