The management outcome of gonorrhoea in the northern region of England was assessed and compared with the recently published national guidelines. An audit questionnaire was completed by all genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in the region. Information with regard to demographic data, microscopy, culture results, test of cure, antibiotic use and sensitivity and contact tracing were recorded. A total of 420 cases of gonorrhoea were diagnosed in 1998. The ratio of males to females with gonorrhoea was 2.1:1. Half were heterosexual males and one-third females. Direct microscopy was positive in 85% of heterosexual males but in less than one-third of females. Ciprofloxacin was the most commonly used antibiotic. One-third of the isolates were resistant or partially resistant to penicillin. Health advisors saw 85% of patients and 41-68% of 'potential' contacts were seen. The management of gonorrhoea in the northern region of England complies with the national guideline recommendations.
