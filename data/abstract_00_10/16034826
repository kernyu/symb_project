We have constructed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic library utilizing a novel centromere-containing vector bearing the TRP1 and KANMX4 G418-resistance selectable markers. Random Sau3AI genomic DNA fragments with an average size of 6.4 kb were introduced into a unique BamHI site in the vector's polylinker. Six independent library pools were generated and the characteristics of these pools were determined. This library can be used to introduce low-copy genomic DNA fragments into any strain that is not G418-resistant, making it useful for low-copy overexpression analysis or complementation of mutant phenotypes in strains that lack a suitable auxotrophy marker or only exhibit phenotypes on rich, undefined, growth media.
