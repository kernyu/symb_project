Disinfection and antisepsis are of primary importance in controlling outbreaks of Acinetobacter baumannii, a nosocomial pathogen that frequently shows multiple antibiotic resistance. In this study we assessed the susceptibility of nine A. baumannii strains isolated during a sustained intensive care unit outbreak, to several antiseptics and disinfectants based on European Standards. While the tested strains showed diverse antibiotic resistance patterns, they were equally sensitive to the biocides assessed in vitro. We observed neither evidence of development of resistance to biocides over time, nor a correlation between resistance to antibiotics and a decreased susceptibility to antiseptics or disinfectants.
