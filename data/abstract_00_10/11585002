The 2nd International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy was convened in Noordwijk, The Netherlands on April 2nd-4th, 2001. The purpose of this meeting was to present and discuss research related to antiretroviral drug interactions, drug distribution to sanctuary sites, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (i.e., the relationship between pharmacokinetics and efficacy, toxicity or drug resistance), inhibitory quotient (IQ) and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). There were 28 oral and 49 poster presentations accepted to this meeting. While most studies focused on protease inhibitors (PIs), insight into the pharmacology of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was also gleaned. Herein, we highlight some of the research that was presented.
