The European Antibiotic Awareness Day, which will have as its theme the need to stop unnecessary use of antibiotics, will take place on 18 November 2008. It is hoped that healthcare workers and other professionals, particularly those involved with child care, as well the general public and members of the media, will participate in the various activities and discussions that will take place across Europe as part of this initiative. The European Antibiotic Awareness Day will be an annually recurring event that will raise awareness about the risks associated with inappropriate use of antibiotics and how to use antibiotics responsibly.
