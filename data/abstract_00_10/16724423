We previously described the epidemic spread of a fusidic acid resistant clone of Staphylococcus aureus among children with bullous impetigo throughout Sweden 1. In this follow-up study we present data showing that Swedish clinicians in 2002 drastically reduced prescriptions of fusidic acid ointments, probably in response to the epidemic. Furthermore, we show that the fusidic acid resistant clone which dominated in 2001 is still the most prevalent fusidic acid resistant S. aureus in the population. The epidemic which reached its peak in 2002 is now clearly declining.
