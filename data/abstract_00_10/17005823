Therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication employ a combination of drugs targeted to two viral enzymes (reverse transcriptase and protease) and to the viral entry/fusion step. However, the high propensity of HIV-1 to develop resistance makes the development of novel compounds targeting different steps of the HIV-1 life cycle essential. Among these, integrase (IN) inhibitors have successfully passed the early phases of clinical development. By preventing integration, IN inhibitors preclude viral replication while allowing production of extrachromosomal forms of viral DNA (E-DNA). Here, we describe an improved and standardized assay aimed at evaluating IN inhibitors by taking advantage of the transcriptional activity of E-DNA produced by HIV-derived vectors in the absence of replication-competent virus. In this context, the use of the firefly luciferase gene as a reporter gene provides a rapid and quantitative measure of viral-vector infectivity, thus making it a safe and cost-effective assay for evaluating novel IN inhibitors.
