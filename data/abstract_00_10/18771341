Extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis display a wide spectrum of antiviral activity. It was of great interest to check the effect of baicalein and wogonin preparations on two important mechanisms of innate immunity: the secretion of cytokines and the natural resistance of human leukocytes to viral infection. To study the effect of S. baicalensis extracts on interferons (IFNs), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin (IL) production and virus replication, uninfected and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were used. Four pulverized preparations obtained from roots of Scutellaria and a Sigma-Aldrich preparation of purified baicalein were used in the study. RPMI extracts containing different amounts of baicalein and wogonin were used to study the effect on VSV replication in PBLs. PBLs express ex vivo individually differentiated cytokine-dependent resistance/innate immunity to viral infections. The degree of resistance was estimated on the basis of VSV replication in PBLs. The results obtained indicate that baicalein- and wogonin-containing extracts modulate cytokine production, that is inhibit IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma and stimulate TNF-alpha and IL (IL-12, IL-10) production. They also augment the resistance of PBLs to VSV. Extract from S. baicalensis containing baicalein and wogonin regulates the innate antiviral immunity by modulation of cytokine production and stimulation of human leukocyte resistance.
