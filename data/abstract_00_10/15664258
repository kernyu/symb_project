We describe the case of a patient with chronic hepatitis B who became resistant to lamivudine and was treated successfully with adefovir dipivoxil in addition to lamivudine. Lamivudine resistance was associated with the selection of a L180M+M204V polymerase mutant. After the addition of adefovir dipivoxil, serum HBV DNA levels dropped by more than 4log(10), which was followed by HBsAg clearance after 22 months of combination therapy. Moreover, anti-HBs antibody titers rose above 1000 mIU/mL after 32 months of the new treatment regimen. In parallel, HBV DNA declined below 100 copies/mL by a quantitative real time PCR assay. Analysis of intrahepatic viral DNA showed a significant decline of total HBV DNA and cccDNA which was accompanied by a decrease of the number of infected cells expressing viral antigens below the detection limit of immunostaining. In parallel, liver histology analysis showed an improvement in both the activity index and fibrosis score. This report suggests that in patients who previously failed lamivudine therapy, proactive antiviral treatment may lead to a beneficial virological and clinical effect.
