HIV is a devastating disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. Symptoms of illness can manifest in every organ system, including the skin. Although there is no definitive cure, the creation of antiretroviral drugs and aggressive treatment regimens have dramatically altered disease morbidity and mortality. However, the precise drug selection is often difficult and intimidating given the sheer abundance of drug therapies available. In this article, the HIV disease course is reviewed and different classes of antiretroviral medications are presented with emphasis on initial drug regimens, potential adverse effects, particularly those of dermatologic nature, possible drug interactions, patient compliance, and the emergence of drug resistance.
