Molecular mechanisms of the action of beta-lactam and glycopeptide antibiotics, as well as genetic background and phenotypical features of the resistance of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci to these antibiotics are reviewed. Furthermore, susceptibility patterns concerning beta-lactam and glycopeptide drugs of staphylococcal, streptococcal, as well as enterococcal strains isolated from clinical specimens at the Semmelweis University of Medicine, Budapest, Hungary between January 1997 and December 2000 are also presented.
