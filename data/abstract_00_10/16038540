The fruits of Garcinia scortechinii afforded 10 new compounds: four caged-tetraprenylated xanthones (scortechinones Q-T, 1-4), four rearranged xanthones (scortechinones U-X, 5-8), and two sesquiterpene derivatives (scortechterpenes A, B, 9, 10), together with 14 known compounds: one sesquiterpene, two biflavonoids, and 11 caged-polyprenylated xanthones. Their structures were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data and comparison of the NMR data with those reported previously. All xanthone derivatives were evaluated for antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
