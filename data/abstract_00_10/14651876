Four groups of nine Saanen goat does with a naturally acquired mixed trichostrongylid infection were grazed on four paddocks. Two groups received a daily dose of Duddingtonia flagrans at the rate of 5 x 10(7) chlamydospores per animal per day for the 26-day grazing period. After a 19-day pasture resting period, 20 worm free 12-week-old tracer kids were introduced to the paddocks for 14 days prior to removal for worm burden analysis. Four groups of five does and four kids were drenched then turned out onto the paddocks and faecal egg count (FEC) monitored. The FEC between groups was comparable throughout the initial grazing period. There were significant reductions in number of Teladorsagia circumcincta (54.8%, P=0.004) and Haemonchus contortus (85.0%, P=0.02) worms recovered from tracer animals. FEC of animals subsequently grazing pasture were significantly reduced (P=0.036) with reductions of 44% observed 4 weeks post-turnout. No significant difference was observed after 6 weeks grazing. This trial has demonstrated the potential of D. flagrans to reduce larval numbers on pasture grazed by goats under New Zealand conditions.
