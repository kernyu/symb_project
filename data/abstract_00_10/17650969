The aim of the present study was to evaluate differences in resistance patterns of Escherichia coli in different parts of the digestive tract of veal calves. Therefore, after slaughter, the lower intestinal tract of 19 calves was sampled at five locations (duodenum, jejunum, cecum, colon, and rectum), and up to three E. coli isolates per sample underwent susceptibility testing for seven antimicrobial agents (gentamicin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, tetracycline, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and enrofloxacin), using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Multiresistance (resistance to more than two compounds) was present in 93.5% of all isolates (n = 179). For gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and enrofloxacin, the percentage of resistant E. coli isolates was significantly lower in the duodenum and jejunum than in the cecum, colon, and rectum. For ampicillin, the percentage of resistance was significantly lower in the jejunum, compared to the other segments of the intestinal tract. For the other antimicrobials tested, no significant differences in the percentage of resistant isolates throughout the intestinal tract were detected. In conclusion, resistance among enteric E. coli from veal calves can reach high levels and prevalence depends on localization of sampling. These considerations should be taken into account when further fine-tuning sampling protocols for indicator bacteria.
