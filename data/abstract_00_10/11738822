The Drosophila Mos1 element can be mobilized in species ranging from prokaryotes to protozoans and vertebrates, and the purified transposase can be used for in vitro transposition assays. In this report we developed a 'mini-Mos1' element and describe a number of useful derivatives suitable for transposon mutagenesis in vivo or in vitro. Several of these allow the creation and/or selection of tripartite protein fusions to a green fluorescent protein-phleomycin resistance (GFP-PHLEO) reporter/selectable marker. Such X-GFP-PHLEO-X fusions have the advantage of retaining 5' and 3' regulatory information and N- and C-terminal protein targeting domains. A Mos1 derivative suitable for use in transposon-insertion mediated linker insertion (TIMLI) mutagenesis is described, and transposons bearing selectable markers suitable for use in the protozoan parasite Leishmania were made and tested. A novel 'negative selection' approach was developed which permits in vitro assays of transposons lacking bacterial selectable markers. Application of this assay to several Mos1 elements developed for use in insects suggests that the large mariner pM[cn] element used previously in vivo is poorly active in vitro, while the Mos1-Act-EGFP transposon is highly active.
