Production of the glycopeptide antibiotic A47934 by Streptomyces toyocaensis NRRL 15009 begins in the late exponential phase in liquid culture and peaks in the early stationary phase. The pattern of cellular phosphoprotein production changes upon onset of A48934 production with the appearance of several novel phosphoproteins only when an antibiotic is being produced. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that S. toyocaensis NRRL 15009 produces proteins phosphorylated on His, Ser, Thr and Tyr, with most being membrane-associated. Addition of the isoflavones genistein or quercetin abolishes A47934 production in liquid culture and sporulation on solid medium. Furthermore, genistein slows the onset of inducible glycopeptide antibiotic resistance in S. toyocaensis NRRL 15009. These results support the participation of protein kinase pathways in A47934 biosynthesis and resistance and cell differentiation in S. toyocaensis NRRL 15009.
