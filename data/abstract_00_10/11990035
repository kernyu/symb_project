Standard laboratory methods are needed to assess the efficacy of antimicrobial agents that are applied to biofilm bacteria. Existing standard suspension tests and dried surface tests show much greater efficacy than antimicrobial agents applied to biofilms. The greater resistance of biofilm bacteria to antimicrobial agents can be attributed to a number of interacting factors, including reaction and diffusion processes that limit an agent's accessibility to bacteria, phenotypic changes in biofilm bacteria caused by stress, and adaptation of the bacteria. Because biofilm systems are so diverse, a variety of new biofilm tests with features that differ in important ways from existing tests will ultimately be required. For example, the biofilm test apparatus may include a pump and a continuous-flow stirred tank reactor. This report provides an overview of biofilm testing and suggests a strategy for creating standard test methods.
