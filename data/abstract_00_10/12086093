The susceptibility patterns of 1027 nontyphoidal Salmonella strains of human origin, isolated in Greece between 1990 and 1997, were determined by broth microdilution.

From 1996 onwards, a decrease was observed, which was more evident for S. enteritidis. Regarding the other examined serotypes a substantial proportion of resistant isolates was found only for S. Virhow and S.
