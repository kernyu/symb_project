Single-strand DNA interruptions (SSIs) are produced during the process of base excision repair (BER). Through biochemical studies, two SSI repair subpathways have been identified: a pathway mediated by DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) and DNA ligase III (Lig III), and a pathway mediated by DNA polymerase delta/epsilon (Pol delta/epsilon) and DNA ligase I (Lig I). In addition, the existence of another pathway, mediated by Pol beta and DNA Lig I, has been suggested. Although each pathway may play a unique role in cellular DNA damage response, the functional implications of SSI repair by these three pathways are not clearly understood. To obtain a better understanding of the functional relevance of SSI repair by these pathways, we investigated the involvement of each pathway by monitoring the utilization of DNA ligases in cell-free extracts. Our results suggest that the majority of SSIs produced during the repair of alkylated DNA bases are repaired by the pathway mediated by Pol beta and either Lig I or Lig III, although some SSIs are repaired by Pol delta/epsilon and Lig I. At a cellular level, we found that Lig III over-expression increased the resistance of cells to DNA-damaging agents, while Lig I over-expression had little effect. Thus, repair pathways mediated by Lig III may have a role in the regulation of cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.
