To determine the variability of genotypic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 drug-resistance interpretation by available expert systems and its clinical implications, 261 subjects for whom a potent antiretroviral regimen was failing who were starting salvage therapy were evaluated. The association of the genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) of the salvage regimen, according to 11 interpretation systems, with HIV RNA outcomes for 6 months was examined. GSS was highly variable, as determined by the different interpretation systems, and showed independent correlation with changes from baseline HIV RNA levels at 6 months with 5 systems--Stanford hivdb, GuideLines 3.0, Retrogram 1.4, HIVresistanceWeb, and Sao Paulo University. Most GSSs predicted virologic response in regimens containing stavudine, lamivudine, efavirenz, or indinavir. Selected systems predicted response in regimens containing didanosine, abacavir, or nelfinavir, and no system predicted outcome of boosted protease inhibitors. GSSs predicted changes in HIV RNA levels better in adherent patients than in nonadherent individuals. Interpretation may be improved, and knowledge should be used uniformly throughout different expert systems.
