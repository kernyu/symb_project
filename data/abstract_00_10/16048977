A nationwide surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility in Escherichia coli strains isolated from food-producing animals in Japan was conducted from 1999 to 2002. Eighteen cefazolin-resistant E. coli strains were isolated from broilers. Six were CTX-M-type producing, and eight were CMY-2 producing, while eight had mutations at the ampC promoter region.
