OBJECTIVE: Analysis of the prevalence and species representation of pathogenic yeasts in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Determination of in vitro susceptibility of yeast isolates to clinically used antimycotic agents. DESIGN: A retrospective clinical study of patients with positive vaginal cultures for the presence of pathogenic yeast species. SETTING: I. gynekologicko-porodnicka klinika LF UK a FN, Zochova 7,811 03 Bratislava, Slovenska republika. METHODS: Identification of yeast pathogens on the chromogenic medium CHROMagar CANDIDA and with API-CANDIDA identification system. In vitro susceptibility assays of clinical yeast isolates to antifungal agents using the plate dilution method, NCCLS method and ATB-FUNGUS test system. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of vulvovaginal candidasis was found in women aged between 20-30 years. Candida albicans was the most commonly identified species of pathogenic yeasts (87.4%). Of the non-albicans species, C. glabrata (6.3%) was the most prevalent species. C. glabrata and C. krusei clinical isolates were found to be generally less susceptible to several antifungals in vitro as compared to C. albicans strains. A minimal number of resistant yeast isolates was observed for econazole, clotrimazole and nystatin. A relatively high number of resistant strains was observed for some other azole antifungals (miconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole). CONCLUSION: A successful treatment of vaginal mycotic infections requires the results of the microbiological analyses. They will bring evidence to a physician of the presence and fate of the pathogen, of its sensitivity to antifungals, both of which are essential for the rational and successful therapy of Candida vaginitis.
