Arabidopsis thaliana peptide deformylase PDF1B was expressed in tobacco chloroplasts using spectinomycin as the selective agent. The foreign protein accumulated in chloroplasts (6% of the total soluble protein) and was enzymatically active. Transplastomic plants were evaluated for resistance to the peptide deformylase inhibitor actinonin. In vitro seed germination in the presence of actinonin and in planta application of the inhibitor demonstrated the resistance of the transformed plants. In addition, transgenic leaf explants were able to develop shoots via organogenesis in the presence of actinonin. However, when the combination of the PDF1B gene and actinonin was used as the primary selective marker system for chloroplast transformation of tobacco, all developed shoots were escapes. Therefore, under the experimental conditions tested, the use of this system for plastid transformation would be limited to function as a secondary selective marker.
