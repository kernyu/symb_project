AIMS: A number of drugs are substrates or inhibitors of the efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; ABCG2), which can limit systemic exposure by reducing absorption and/or increasing biliary elimination. The identification of a BCRP-selective clinical probe drug would provide a useful tool to understand the effect of genetic polymorphisms and transporter-based drug interactions on drug pharmacokinetics. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of nitrofurantoin as a clinical probe substrate for BCRP activity by evaluating the impact of genetic variation on nitrofurantoin pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Nitrofurantoin pharmacokinetics were studied in an open-label, single-oral dose (100 mg) study in 36 male Chinese subjects who were pre-screened for ABCG2 421 CC, CA and AA genotypes (n = 12 each). Plasma and urine concentrations of nitrofurantoin were determined by LC/MS/MS and LC/UV respectively. anova was used to compare pharmacokinetic parameters among genotypes. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in nitrofurantoin pharmacokinetics among the genotypic cohorts. The geometric mean nitrofurantoin plasma AUC((0-infinity)) (95% confidence interval) values were 2.21 (2.00, 2.45), 2.42 (2.11, 2.78) and 2.32 (1.99, 2.70) microg h ml(-1) and half-life values were 0.79 (0.59, 1.0), 0.76 (0.64, 0.89) and 0.72 (0.62, 0.84) h for ABCG2 421 genotypes CC, CA and AA, respectively. The percentage of dose excreted unchanged in the urine was 43, 44 and 39%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ABCG2 C421A polymorphism had no effect on nitrofurantoin plasma and urine pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy Chinese subjects. These results indicate that nitrofurantoin is not a suitable clinical probe substrate for assessing BCRP activity.
