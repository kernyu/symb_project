OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether low ganciclovir serum levels in patients on maintenance oral ganciclovir therapy are associated with recurrence of CMV retinitis. METHODS: A prospective study of the plasma concentration of ganciclovir after initiation of maintenance oral ganciclovir therapy in 14 AIDS patients who had recovered from acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. RESULTS: Five of the 14 patients exhibited a mean time to recurrence of 37 days. The mean trough plasma concentration of ganciclovir in these patients after 1 month of oral ganciclovir therapy, was 0.40 +/- 0.30 mg/L. Nine patients had a mean time of progression of 263 days. The mean trough plasma concentration of ganciclovir in the latter patients was 0.80 +/- 0.60 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Patients exhibiting trough plasma levels of ganciclovir below 0.6 mg/L may be at higher risk of progression than patients who exhibited levels above 0.6 mg/L.
