With the number of people living with HIV infection increasing and the problems of drug resistance and long-term toxicity associated with current antiretroviral agents continuing, there is a growing need for new therapy options. Enfuvirtide is the first fusion inhibitor, a new class of drug, to be licensed for the treatment of HIV infection and is a welcome addition to the arsenal of antiretrovirals. This paper, which is the result of a multidisciplinary discussion meeting, reviews current practice in treating HIV infection, the clinical data available on enfuvirtide and discusses its introduction into clinical practice. Data available to date indicate that enfuvirtide is appropriate for use in patients who have previously taken nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), non-NRTI and protease inhibitor containing regimens and are either intolerant of them or have experienced virological failure. Enfuvirtide should ideally be used while the patient still has other active drug options available to them to combine with enfuvirtide in an effective therapy regimen.
