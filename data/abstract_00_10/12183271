The phenylpropenamide derivatives AT-61 and AT-130 are nonnucleoside analogue inhibitors of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. They inhibited the replication of wild-type HBV with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 21.2 +/- 9.5 and 2.40 +/- 0.92 micro M, respectively, compared to 0.064 +/- 0.020 micro M lamivudine. There were no significant differences in sensitivity between wild-type and nucleoside analogue-resistant (rtL180M, rtM204I, and rtL180M + rtM204V) HBV.
