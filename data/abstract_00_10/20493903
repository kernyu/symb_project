Staphylococcus simulans biovar staphylolyticus contains five plasmids designated pACK1-pACK5. The complete nucleotide sequences of pACK1 (55171bp) and pACK3 (28613bp) were determined and sequence comparison revealed that the entire pACK3 sequence is present on pACK1 (99.98% identical on the nucleotide level) with the sequence unique to pACK1 located between sin and blaZ, which are adjacent in pACK3. The common region contains the staphylococcal beta-lactamase transposon Tn552 and ORFs with similarity to genes encoding a serine-recombinase, enzymes involved in pantothenate biosynthesis, and components of the secA2 region involved in bacterial adherence to host tissues. The common region also contains a cluster of six ORFs that share no significant similarity to sequences previously described in GenBank. The region unique to pACK1, in addition to the genes for lysostaphin and lysostaphin resistance, contains ORFswith similarity to genes encoding a toxin-antitoxin addiction system and proteins involved in plasmid partitioning. The unique region also contains several ORFs that are similar to genes typically found on the chromosome such as those encoding catalase, ferrochelatase, and an enzyme involved in pantothenate biosynthesis. In pACK1, the ends of the unique region contain IS431 elements with direct repeats marking the points where the two plasmid sequences diverge. Several observations suggest that pACK1 was derived by insertion of the unique region into pACK3.
