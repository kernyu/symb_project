OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance and class 1 integrons found in Escherichia coli isolates from humans and animals in Korea were characterized. METHODS: E. coli isolates were examined for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Integrase genes were amplified. Gene cassette regions for classes 1 and 2 integrons were amplified and sequenced. Conjugal transfer and Southern hybridization were performed to determine the genetic localization of class 1 integrons. The clonal relationship of E. coli isolates carrying an identical cassette array was analysed by PFGE. RESULTS: Commensal E. coli isolates from animals were highly resistant to commonly used antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin and carbenicillin. Integrons were most prevalent in commensal E. coli isolates from poultry (44%), followed by clinical isolates from humans (33%), commensal isolates from swine (23%) and humans (13%). dfrA17-aadA5, dfrA12-orfF-aadA2 and aadA1 were found most frequently in E. coli isolates from humans, poultry and swine, respectively. Class 1 integrons were mostly located in conjugative plasmids. E. coli isolates carrying an identical cassette array were phylogenetically unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: The use of antibiotics is strongly associated with antimicrobial resistance. E. coli isolates from different sources may select a specific gene cassette by antibiotic selective pressure, which results in differences in class 1 integrons. The horizontal transfer of class 1 integrons through conjugative plasmids seems to be responsible for wide dissemination of a particular type of class 1 integron.
