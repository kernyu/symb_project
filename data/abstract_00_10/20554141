OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to assess physicians' perception of antibiotic prescribing practice and of bacterial resistance. DESIGN: We questioned 503 interns and senior physicians in the Nice University Hospital. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-two out of five hundred and three (64 %) physicians answered the questionnaire. Antibiotic resistance was perceived as a national problem by 98 % of physicians, but only 74 % rated the problem as important in their own daily practice. Fifty-nine percent of interns and 34 % of senior physicians respectively had received some training on antibiotic prescribing in the past 12 months. Only 33 % of physicians knew the exact prevalence of MRSA in their hospital. Senior physicians were more confident than interns when prescribing an antibiotic. The three issues they were the less confident with were: indications of antibiotic combinations, reassessment, and duration of antibiotic treatment. They were aware that antibiotic overuse, prescription of broad-spectrum molecules, or subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics were the three major causes of antibiotic resistance. They believed that the most useful measures to improve antibiotic prescription were: availability of guidelines, specific courses, readily accessible advice from an infectious diseases specialist, and audit plus feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The collected data provides useful information for the implementation of strategies to optimize adherence to good antimicrobial stewardship.
