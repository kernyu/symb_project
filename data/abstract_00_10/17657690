Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a rare entity caused by Herpes viruses. An immunocompromised background and the complications of ARN mostly lead to a poor visual outcome. Confirmation of the early diagnosis through polymerase chain reaction and antibody detection from aqueous or vitreous taps is recommended to improve the medical management and prevent disease progression with an increased risk of complications. Favourable outcomes are possible by means of combined antiviral systemic and intravitreal strategies with Acyclovir, Foscarnet and Ganciclovir. We report on the relevant literature recommendations and our own experience.
