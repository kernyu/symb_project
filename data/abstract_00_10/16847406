OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: To identify new drug-resistance-associated mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) protein, we screened the RT sequence database of our hospital for alternative amino acid substitutions at known RT drug-resistance positions. METHOD: The genotypic database used for this analysis contained 1322 RT sequences from 1015 patients. We analysed this RT database with a focus on alternative mutations at RT positions known to be involved in drug resistance. The patterns of drug resistance associated with these alternative mutations were investigated in a separate database containing genotype and drug-susceptibility results. RESULTS: We identified multiple alternative resistance-associated mutations at amino acid positions 44, 62, 67, 69, 70, 74, 75, 103, 181, 190, 210, and 219 in RT. Phenotypic analysis indicated that drug-resistance properties of the alternative Y181V and L74I mutants are similar, but not identical, to that of the well-known Y181C and L74V mutations. CONCLUSION: This initial survey indicates that many resistance-associated phenomena can be distilled from existing data. These findings endorse a more extensive analysis by computerized methods.
