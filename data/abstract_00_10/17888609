The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program is a global study that provides antimicrobial susceptibility data in centers prescribing meropenem. The activity of meropenem and 7 broad-spectrum antimicrobials have been examined against 5208 bacterial isolates from 9 Turkish centers between 2000 and 2003. Cumulative susceptibility rates against all species of Enterobacteriaceae combined were ranked as follows: meropenem (99.3%), imipenem (97.6%), cefepime (80.0%), piperacillin-tazobactam (73.6%), ceftazidime (70.3%), ciprofloxacin (70.1%), cefotaxime (66.9%), and tobramycin (67.2%). The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) was detected in 48.7% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and in 19.5% of Escherichia coli isolates. Of ESBL producing K. pneumoniae isolates, 75.7% were resistant to tobramycin, 40.3% to ciprofloxacin, and 48.3% to piperacillin-tazobactam. Only piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems were active against more than 50% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-susceptible breakpoint, and the carbapenems were the most active compounds against Acinetobacter spp. These data confirm the continued potency of meropenem against Enterobacteriaceae in units where it is actively being prescribed.
