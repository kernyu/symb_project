We report the first case of naturally occurring fluoroquinolone resistance in Ureaplasma spp. from the United States. Resistance in this case probably developed as a result of mutations in the gyrA and parC genes of the DNA gyrase/topoisomerase IV complex that occurred in the presence of antimicrobial selective pressure.
