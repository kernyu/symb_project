BACKGROUND AND AIM: Entecavir has demonstrated clinical efficacy for chronic hepatitis B. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of entecavir in nucleoside-naive Japanese chronic hepatitis B patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind study, 66 nucleoside-naive Japanese chronic hepatitis B patients were randomized to 0.1 mg entecavir (n = 32) or 0.5 mg entecavir (n = 34) daily for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients whose serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA decreased from baseline by > or =2 log(10) copies/mL or became undetectable (<400 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction assay) at week 48. RESULTS: One hundred percent of patients in both treatment groups achieved the primary efficacy endpoint, with 81% and 68% of patients achieving undetectable HBV DNA in the 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg treatment groups, respectively. Mean changes from baseline in HBV DNA were -4.49 log(10) and -4.84 log(10) copies/mL for the 0.1 mg and 0.5 mg groups, respectively. Significant improvements in necroinflammation were seen in both groups, as assessed by Knodell and New Inuyama classifications. Most adverse events were transient and classified as grade 1 or 2. There were no clinically significant differences in adverse events across the two treatment groups and no discontinuations due to adverse events in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese nucleoside-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B, 0.1 mg or 0.5 mg entecavir daily provided excellent efficacy and was well tolerated. The 0.5 mg dose was selected for the treatment of nucleoside-naive patients.
