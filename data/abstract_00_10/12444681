Five novel oligosaccharide antibiotics, Sch 58769 (1), Sch 58771 (2), Sch 58773 (3), Sch 58775 (4), and Sch 58777 (5), were isolated from the fermentation broth of Micromonospora carbonacea var africana. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods, including MS and (1)H and (13)C NMR experiments. A comparison of the obtained data with that for Ziracin (Sch 27899) revealed that these oligosaccharides belong to the same everninomicin family of compounds. Ziracin demonstrates potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria both in vitro and in vivo including multiply resistant strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci faecalis.
