Septic arthritis is an infection of the joint space that requires prompt recognition by physicians. In children, the diagnosis of septic arthritis can often be challenging and delayed diagnosis can produce long-term morbidity. Posttraumatic septic arthritis is rarely reported and can be an equally challenging diagnosis. We present a case of a fully immunized 20-month-old boy with Streptococcus pneumoniae posttraumatic septic arthritis without evidence of an open fracture.
