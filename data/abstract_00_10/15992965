A series of 28 novel 1,2-disubstituted-1H-benzimidazole-N-alkylated-5-carboxamidine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) by the tube dilution method. The results showed that compounds 45-46 and 55-57, having 3,4-dichloro substituted phenyl at the position C-2, of N-bulky alkyl substituted benzimidazolecarboxamidines exhibited the greatest activity with MIC values of 1.56-0.39 microg/ml.
