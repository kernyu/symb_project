Combinations of caspofungin and posaconazole were evaluated by fractional inhibitory concentration index against 119 Candida glabrata isolates. Synergy was seen in 18% of all isolates and in 4% of fluconazole-resistant isolates at 48 h without evidence of antagonism. This antifungal combination may have utility against this organism.
