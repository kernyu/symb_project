Over the last years there has been considerable progress in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Five drugs are now approved for the treatment of this virosis: interferon alpha, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine. Interferons (conventional or PEG) were the first medicine used in the treatment of hepatitis being able to lead the persistent response (loss of DNA-HBV and of AgHbe) to up to one third of treated cases. A large number of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are, at present, available to treat hepatitis B. The efficacy of lamivudine, the first nucleoside analogue used, is limited by the high rate of resistance. Adefovir has efficacy comparable to that of lamivudine, but with low resistance rate. Entecavir and tenofovir have also been particularly active in the control of hepatitis B virus replication and are associated with minimal resistance development, even during long treatment regimens. Other drugs, such as telbivudine, emtricitabine and clevudine, will become new treatment options in the near future. Individuals co-infected with HIV/HBV are particularly difficult to manage and are nowadays able to benefit from combinations of drugs of the HAART therapy, which should be effective towards both viruses. The development of more potent antiviral drugs as well as new drug combinations, together with a better understanding of hepatitis B virus resistance mechanisms are important milestones to improve treatment efficacy and to diminish, in the future, the global burden of hepatitis B virus.
