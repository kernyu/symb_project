An erythromycin analogue, 11,12-di-O-iso-butyryl-8,9-anhydroerythromycin A 6,9-hemiketal (1b), was found to be a potential anti-MRSA and anti-VRE agent. The use of copper catalyzed azide-acetylene cycloaddition, and click chemistry, readily provided 10 types of triazole analogues of 1b in good to nearly quantitative yield. Among the library, 5b exhibited activity against MRSA and VRE bacterial strains, representing more than twice the potency of 1b.
