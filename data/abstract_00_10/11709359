The in vitro activities of ABT-773 were evaluated against 324 strains of gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. ABT-773 had lower MIC ranges, MICs at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)s), and MIC(90)s than erythromycin or clindamycin for almost all isolates tested. The MICs of ABT-773 were also lower than those of quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp., while the MICs of Q-D were lower than those of ABT-773 for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant isolates.
