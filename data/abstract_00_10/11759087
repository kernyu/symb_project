We looked for the presence of gyrA mutations in seven fluoroquinolone-resistant French clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Three of the five isolates of C. jejuni and the two isolates of C. coli had high-level resistance to nalidixic acid (MICs 128-256 microg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 32 microg/ml). A gyrA mutation was found in all these isolates leading to the following substitutions: Thr86-Ile in four cases and Asp90-Tyr for one C. coli strain. One isolate had high-level resistance to nalidixic acid (MIC 64 microg/ml) but low-level resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC 2 microg/ml) and also carried a gyrA mutation leading to a Thr86-Ala substitution. The last isolate of C. jejuni studied displayed an atypical resistance phenotype: It was resistant to high levels of ciprofloxacin (MIC 64 microg/ml) but remained fully susceptible to nalidixic acid (MIC 2 microg/ml). This phenotype was not explained by the presence of peculiar mutations in gyrA or gyrB. It carried a gyrA mutation leading to a Thr86-Ile substitution and was devoid of gyrB mutation. Despite numerous attempts with various degenerate oligonucleotide primers deduced from conserved regions of known parC genes, we were unable to amplify a corresponding sequence in C. jejuni or C. coli. First-step and second-step in vitro mutants, derived from reference strain C. coli ATCC 33559 with ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin as selecting agents, were found to carry one and two mutations in gyrA, respectively. In contrast with the results obtained with clinical isolates, a variety of gyrA mutations were obtained in vitro.
