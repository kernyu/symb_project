The characteristics of an antibiotic that favor its ability to select for resistant bacteria are not completely understood. Otherwise, by the common use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins, resistant strains of several gram-negative species, especially Enterobacter cloacae, have been more frequently isolated. During our studies on beta-lactam resistance in E. cloacae, we observed that the addition of an inhibitor (clindamycin) to a potent inducer (cefoxitin) leads to an enhanced selection of resistant mutants. This could explain the emergence of beta-lactam resistant strains during antibiotic therapy.
