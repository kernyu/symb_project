The effects of androgens, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), of an environmental anti-androgen, 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (DDE), and of glucocorticoids, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone, on growth kinetics and antibiotic susceptibility of E. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeurginosa, and S. aureus were measured. For P. aeurginosa, the presence of either DHT or DDE caused at least a fourfold shift in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefepime and tobramycin. DHT and DDE also affected the response of E. faecalis to meropenem and norfloxacin, resulting in a shift from sensitive to intermediate resistance (four-fold increase in MIC). Hydrocortisone (2 microM) induced an increase in the sensitivity of S. aureus to erythromycin, as compared to hormone-free control (from 0.5 to 0.06 microg/mL). The susceptibility pattern of E. coli was unaffected by the hormones tested. These changes in susceptibility to antibiotics were unrelated to alterations in growth kinetics. For all organisms tested, the alterations in MICs occurred only in the presence of hormone, indicative of changes in the phenotype of these stable quality control strains.
