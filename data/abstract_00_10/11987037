BACKGROUND: Two independent epidemiological studies recently suggested the prophylactic relevance of an intraocular antibiosis against endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. The resulting intervention programme, however, has not only ethical drawbacks, but also has a health economical dimension, which will be focussed in this paper. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cost analysis is performed to compare the direct costs saved by prevention of endophthalmitis cases and the costs generated by the prophylaxis itself. Furthermore, the clinics' indirect costs due to treatment of unprevented endophthalmitis cases are estimated. RESULTS: The overall gain in direct costs turns out to be about 368 000 Euro p. a., the indirect costs from the clinics' view can be reduced by about 260 000 Euro p. a. due to prevention of endophthalmitis cases by the antibiotic intervention. CONCLUSIONS: From an economical point of view, antibiotic prophylaxis can be suggested; the risk of longitudinally reduced antibiotic effectiveness of the antibiotic agents, however, strongly calls for an overall health political decision rather than for an immediate implementation of the corresponding intervention programme.
