Reports of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) isolates carrying Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene that causes infective endocarditis in injection drug users (IDUs) with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are rare in the English language literature. We present a case of CA-MRSA infective endocarditis with bilateral septic lung emboli in a previously healthy 45-year-old IDU. This case suggests that PVL gene-positive CA-MRSA should be considered as a potential pathogen in IDUs with infective endocarditis.
