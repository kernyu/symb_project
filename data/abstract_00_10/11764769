Combinations of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors have become one of the most successful antibacterial strategies in our global battle against bacterial infections. The success of these agents is particularly emphasized by the continued efficacy of Augmenting (amoxicillin and clavulanate) after nearly 20 years of clinical use. The clinical situation now dictates that second-generation beta-lactamase inhibitors capable of encompassing both class A and class C beta-lactamases would combat emerging resistance and provide a vital addition to our armory of hospital antibiotics. This realization has generated a renewed interest in beta-lactamase inhibitors and improved the prospects for the delivery of such agents in the future.
