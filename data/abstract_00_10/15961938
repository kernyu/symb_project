OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the agar proportion method with the E-test method for susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 isolates were tested for isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin and ethambutol susceptibility using an indirect-proportion method as well as the E-test method. RESULTS: Categorical agreement between the methods was 100% for isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol. CONCLUSION: The E-test method appears to be an alternative method to agar proportion for testing the susceptibility of M. tuberculosis isolates to the first-line antituberculous agents.
