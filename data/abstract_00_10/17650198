AIMS: This study deals with a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for discriminating between the genetic variants of Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida, and characterizing of Japanese field isolates by PFGE together with plasmid profiles and antimicrobial resistances. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 74 field isolates from cultured Japanese amberjacks were used for PFGE. SmaI and NotI enabled to clearly differentiate strains and we obtained 24 of combined PFGE profiles which were distinct from those of classical Japanese and USA reference strains, and classified them into three groups (Ia-Ic). By plasmid size, we could classify these field isolates into three plasmid types, pA-pC. The predominant PFGE-type Ia was closely associated with plasmid-type pA, and Ib showed a moderate association with pB. Ic was closely associated with pC, and multiresistant isolates were not observed in this type. Whole-genomic variations were also observed between isolates having identical detection areas, fish species and detection-date by PFGE. CONCLUSION: Molecular diversity of P. damselae ssp. piscicida could be detected by PFGE, and some relations among the PFGE-type, plasmid-type and antimicrobial resistances were observed in Japanese field isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study indicated that some genetic transition might have occurred in P. damselae ssp. piscicida around the Japanese seas, and PFGE can be a valuable tool for the epidemiological study of this highly homogeneous subspecies.
