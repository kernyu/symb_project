A gene designated varR (for virginiae antibiotic resistance regulator) was identified in Streptomyces virginiae 89 bp downstream of a varS gene encoding a virginiamycin S (VS)-specific transporter. The deduced varR product showed high homology to repressors of the TetR family with a conserved helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. Purified recombinant VarR protein was present as a dimer in vitro and showed clear DNA binding activity toward the varS promoter region. This binding was abolished by the presence of VS, suggesting that VarR regulates transcription of varS in a VS-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis revealed that varR was cotranscribed with upstream varS as a 2.4-kb transcript and that VS acted as an inducer of bicistronic transcription. Deletion analysis of the varS promoter region clarified two adjacent VarR binding sites in the varS promoter.
