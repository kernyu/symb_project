Human infection with Plasmodium spp leading to clinical episodes of malaria probably began very early in the history of humankind and has persistently inflicted disease among human populations. Malaria is currently considered the world's most important parasitic infection. The global impact of malaria is incalculable and appears to be worsening over the past decades. Although most of this burden of disease is carried by developing tropical countries, cases of imported malaria acquired by international travel are increasingly reported. These numbers are growing because of increased travel to malaria-endemic areas and also due to increased risk of transmission in these areas. Indeed, travel has contributed to the global spread of malaria during the history of humankind. Travellers visiting malaria risk areas should use both personal protective measures and chemoprophylaxis. Non-adherence to chemoprophylactic regimens is frequently secondary to drug side-effects. Therefore, a careful risk-benefit analysis on the use of antimalarial prophylaxis should be carried out in every individual travelling to malaria risk areas. Standby malaria self-treatment represents an alternative in some travellers. However, carefully selected and geographically specific antimalarial drug regimens should be recommended to non-immune people travelling to high-risk areas.
