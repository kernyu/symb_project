The reaction of lead(IV) 4-indolyl triacetate with substituted methyl 2-oxo-1-cyclohexanecarboxylates has been investigated as a route to the natural product N-methylwelsitindolinone C isothiocyanate. Reaction of lead(IV) reagent 18 with beta-ketoester 20 affords the desired coupled material in excellent yield and diastereoselectivity. Reaction: see text.
