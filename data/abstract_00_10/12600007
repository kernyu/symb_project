The presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in our hospital prompted us to apply an appropriate method for assessing its rectal carriage. A screening method with bile-esculin azide agar plus different concentrations of vancomycin was used. The antimicrobial susceptibility study of enterococci isolated from clinical samples was also emphasized. The present study includes the surveillance and detection of VRE in our hospital during two years. A total of 260 samples corresponding to 138 patients were studied, 158 of them resulting positive. All EVR were Van A Enterococcus faecium, with MICs of vancomycin > or = 256 micrograms/ml. The analysis of susceptibility patterns shows variations with chloramphenicol, tetracycline and high level gentamicin concentrations. This method was easily applied because materials could be available in any clinical microbiology laboratory, and in our hands it has demonstrated to be useful for epidemiological surveillance for EVR.
