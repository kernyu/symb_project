We reviewed the literature concerning the role of antibiotic use as a risk factor for glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (VRE) infection/colonisation, to enable us to develop measures for preventing the acquisition and transmission of VRE. We found that the length of stay, the number of stays in hospital and the transfer of patients between hospitals and units were all risk factors for acquiring VRE infection. However, analysis of group and individual data showed that there was also a clear link between vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporin use and the prevalence of VRE colonisation/infection. Evidence for this link was provided by the consistent association and dose-effect relationship observed, and from the frequently consistent variations observed over time. However, it is difficult to give precise recommendations because very few studies have investigated both intrinsic bacterial factors making specific strains more epidemic and the precise characteristics of the conditions determining antibiotic selection pressure. In the absence of this information, and maintaining the prevention measures against cross-contamination which remain a priority, these results suggest that programs aimed at improving the prescription of antibiotics should be initiated in hospitals.
