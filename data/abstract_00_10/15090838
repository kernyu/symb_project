Genotypes in nine highly protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced patients were studied before and after lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment. Resistance to amprenavir was the rule both before and after LPV/r treatment. Treatment with LPV/r can select for the 50 V mutation. In this setting, significant differences in the inference of the amprenavir phenotype from genotype were observed when using different algorithms.
