Recent articles have described an increasing number of infections due to Panton-Valentine leukocidin PVL-positive community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) worldwide. We report a case of necrotizing pneumonia successfully treated with levofloxacin in Italy, sustained by a PVL-positive CA-MRSA, belonging to ST88 and carrying a staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec type V. Further molecular characterization of isolates revealed that they were PVL positive, belonged to the agr IV allele, possessed a capsular type 8, and had an almost complete pathotype composed of leukocidins and numerous adhesins. In addition, the strains were strong biofilm producers.
