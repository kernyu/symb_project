Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma improves the survival dramatically, but there is currents drug resistance in about 25% of patients, leading researchers to investigate alternative therapy forms. Suramin has in the last two decades been used as salvage therapy in some cancers. This study was undertaken to investigate suramin as a possible salvage therapy in osteosarcoma. The effect of suramin on three human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63, HOS and SaOS-2) and three primary osteosarcoma cell lines isolated from biopsies was investigated. Suramin significantly inhibited cell proliferation, determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation, of osteosarcoma cells at a dose ranging from 250 to 500 microg/ml. Suramin decreased the secretion of alkaline-phosphatase after stimulation by 1,25-dihydroxy-Vitamin D(3) up to 50% and decreased telomerase activity by up to 40%. The data demonstrate that suramin has marked in vitro effects on human osteosarcoma cells supporting further clinical investigation.
