OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine to what extent unique drug resistance patterns appear in minor and major HIV-1 quasispecies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as compared with blood. METHODS: Forty-four plasma and CSF samples from 13 multi-treatment-experienced patients, seven of whom provided longitudinal samples, were included in the study. The subjects had failed antiretroviral therapy including lamivudine. The reverse transcriptase (RT) gene was examined by selective real-time polymerase chain reaction (SPCR), which can detect M184I/V mutants down to 0.2% of the viral population. RESULTS: SPCR revealed differences at amino acid position 184 in the plasma/CSF populations in 12 paired samples from eight patients. One plasma sample was positive by SPCR where direct sequencing showed wild-type M184. The other 11 paired samples showed quantitative differences in the mixed populations of the mutant or wild-type M184 quasispecies. Differences in other resistance-associated mutations between plasma and CSF viruses were also found by direct sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: In multi-treatment-experienced patients with therapy failure, differences in drug resistance patterns were found frequently between plasma and CSF in both minor and major viral populations. To what extent this was a true biological phenomenon remains to be established, and the clinical relevance of these findings is yet to be determined.
