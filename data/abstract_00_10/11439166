Previous studies have shown that genetic factors control the susceptibility to mercury-induced immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody formation, IgE synthesis, renal IgG deposits and antinucleolar autoantibodies (ANolA) production in the susceptible mice. In this study, we examined the genetic control of resistance to these characteristics after HgCl2 injection in F1 hybrid crosses between the highly mercury resistant DBA/2 and mercury susceptible NZB (H-2d), SJL (H-2 s), A.CA (H-2f) and DBA/1 (H-2q) mice and also in backcross hybrids between (DBA/2 x SJL)F1 and SJL mice. We observed that mercury-induced immune/autoimmune manifestations were profoundly downregulated in most (if not all) of the F1 hybrids, indicating that the resistance to mercury was a dominant trait. Analysis of mercury-induced immune/autoimmune responses in the (DBA/2 x SJL) x SJL backcross hybrids suggested that only one gene or a cluster of genes determined the resistance to the ANolA production, whereas the resistance to other characteristics was controlled by two and/or three gene loci. By H-2 genotyping the backcross mice, it was found that H-2d haplotype per se could confer resistance to ANolA production. However, we did not find any significant association between the H-2d haplotype and the resistance to increase of IgG1 and IgE synthesis and the development of renal IgG1 deposits. Thus, while in DBA/2 mice, gene(s) in the H-2 loci strictly contribute to the inheritance of resistance to ANolA production; non-H-2 genes mainly govern the inheritance of unresponsiveness regarding other characteristics.
