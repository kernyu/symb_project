OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology and diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and examine factors that influence the choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy. BACKGROUND: CAP remains a common disease with substantial associated morbidity and mortality. Outpatient management of patients with CAP has become increasingly complex because of the availability of newer antimicrobial agents, evolving patterns of resistance, and the increasing recognition of atypical pathogens. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a commonly encountered pathogen, the development and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance has become an area of concern, especially in outpatients. The newer macrolide antimicrobial drugs-clarithromycin and azithromycin-are effective against commonly encountered pathogens, are well tolerated, and have an established tolerability profile, although the low serum levels achieved by azithromycin hinder its use in patients with suspected bacteremia. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed of English-language articles published from 1990 to 2000 on the treatment of CAP. This article reviews the treatment of CAP, with emphasis on the use of clarithromycin. CONCLUSION: Although laboratory surveillance studies have reported macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae, recent evidence defining the mechanism of this resistance, coupled with the pharmacokinetic properties of the macrolide agents, suggests that the actual rate of clinical macrolide resistance is low.
