The study was to demonstrate the effect of sewage sludge open-air drying on the quantitative and qualitative composition of keratinolytic/keratinophilic and actidione-resistant fungi. The sludge was being dried for up to thirty days (on average fourteen days) at 25-30'C. The composition of these fungi was determined with the hair baiting method along with the dilution method, using the Wiegand medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 mgiL) and actidione (500 mg/L). The open-air drying altered the composition of keratinolytic fungi and considerably increased the population of keratinophilic and actidione-resistant fungi in the sludge. This phenomenon can be explained with that the drying process was associated with slow sludge moisture decrease, sludge laceration due to crumbling and the subsequent improvement of sludge aeration and organic matter biodegradation conditions. A considerable increase of fungal populations can be expected in sludges being dried in drying beds at wastewater treatment plants and in sludge-amended soils. Two sludge opportunistic fungi, i.e. Microsporum gypseum and Pseudallescheria boydii, require special attention from the epidemiological point of view. Sludge land applications may increase the number of these fungi in the environment and the subsequent risk to public health posed by them.
