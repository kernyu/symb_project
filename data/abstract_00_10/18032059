In order to determine the role of laser in drought stress resistance of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), seed embryos were exposed to CO2 laser radiation for 0min, 1min, 3min and 5min, respectively, and when the seedlings were 12 days old they were treated with 10% (w/v) PEG6000 solution for 10 days. Changes in the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), glutathione (GSH), ascorbate (AsA), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), carotenoid, zeaxanthin, the production rate of superoxide radical (O2(-)), the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the growth parameters of seedlings (plant height, leaf area and dry weight) were measured to test the effects of laser pretreatment. The results showed that suitable laser pretreatment of embryos enhanced drought stress resistance in wheat seedlings by decreasing the concentration of MDA and H2O2, GSSG, the production rate of O2(-), leaf area and increasing the activities of APX, GST, GP and POD and AsA, carotenoid and zeaxanthin concentration. It is suggested that those changes in MDA, O2(-) H2O2, anti-oxidative enzymes and anti-oxidative compounds were responsible for the increase in drought stress resistance observed in the experiments. The results also showed that the laser had a long-term positive physiological effect on the growth of drought stress seedlings. This is the first investigation reporting the use of CO2 laser pretreatment to enhance drought stress resistance of spring wheat.
