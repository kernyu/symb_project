PURPOSE: To describe restenosis and clinical outcomes with drug-eluting stents (DESs) and compare them to those of bare metal stents (BMSs) in the treatment of symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) in the same patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was performed of all patients with RAS treated with a DES (Taxus Express 2 or Cypher). DESs were used for RASs with luminal vessel diameters of 4 mm or smaller and BMSs were used for those larger than 4 mm. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (eight women; mean age, 72 years +/- 8) underwent treatment of 27 RASs for worsening renal function (n = 10) and uncontrolled hypertension (n = 6). Eighteen RASs were treated with 23 DESs (Cypher, n = 12; Taxus, n = 11) and nine were treated with BMSs. The average follow-up was 22 months +/- 10. After the procedure, the mean systolic blood pressure decreased significantly (P < .05), with no change in the mean diastolic pressure, serum creatinine, or number of antihypertensive medications. By Kaplan-Meier estimates, the 1- and 2-year patency rates for DESs were 78% and 68%, respectively; and for BMSs, the respective rates were 58% and 47% (P = NS). The average diameters of RASs were 3.4 mm +/- 0.6 in the DES group and 5.3 mm +/- 0.6 in the BMS group (P < .05). There were two technical failures (7.7%) in the DES group. There was one minor complication and a non-flow-limiting dissection. CONCLUSIONS: DESs were used to treat RASs with good technical results and low restenosis rates compared with BMSs despite the smaller artery diameters in the DES group.
