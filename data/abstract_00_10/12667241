The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro sensitivity of triclosan against viridans streptococci and the impact of triclosan on the normal oral microflora. Nine subjects used a triclosan-containing toothpaste for 2 weeks. Saliva samples were collected on days 0 and 14 and were analyzed quantitatively. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of triclosan and of several antimicrobial agents were determined for the streptococci isolated on days 0 and 14. No major changes occurred in the normal oral microflora during the study period. There were no differences in susceptibility between streptococcal strains collected at days 0 and 14 against triclosan or antimicrobial agents. Short-term use of triclosan has no major impact on normal oral microflora or on streptococcal susceptibility of antimicrobial agents. The effects of long-term use should be evaluated.
