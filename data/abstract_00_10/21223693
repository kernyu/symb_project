OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of adenosine triphosphate-tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA) in individualized treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (REOC), and to evaluate the correlation between the in vitro chemosensitivity assay and clinical drug sensitivity. METHODS: Sixty-nine REOC specimens were tested by ATP-TCA assay retrospectively. The patients were divided into strong sensitive, moderate sensitively and resistant groups according to the ATP-TCA assay results. The clinical results were evaluated according to imaging and serum CA125 analysis. The correlation between in vitro ATP-TCA assay and clinical outcome was statistically analyzed by chi(2) test. The progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of each group were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The results of ATP-TCA assay had significant correlation with clinical outcome. The clinical chemotherapy outcome became better with increased drug sensitivity in vitro (chi(2) = 9.066, P = 0.004). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy rate for ATP-TCA method to predict the clinical chemotherapy sensitivity of REOC were 87.5%, 45.9%, 58.3%, 80.9% and 65.2%, respectively. The mean PFS of strong sensitive group, moderately sensitive group and resistant group were 187.1 days, 195.0 days and 60.3 days, respectively. The mean OS were 476.7, 335.7 and 237.5 days, respectively, following the start of TCA-directed therapy. The PFS and OS of the two sensitivity groups in vitro were significantly longer than that of the in vitro-resistant group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results of ATP-TCA assay are well correlated with clinical treatment responses. The assay may be an important and useful method for individualized chemotherapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.
