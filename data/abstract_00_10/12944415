We identify a new naturally occurring class of inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) isolated from vacuolar membranes of Neurospora crassa and from chromaffin granule membranes of Bos taurus. To date, the new class includes six chondropsins and poecillastrin A, large polyketide-derived macrolide lactams with 33-37 membered rings. In the National Cancer Institute's 60-cell screen the chondropsin class showed a tumor cell growth inhibitory fingerprint essentially indistinguishable from that of the bafilomycin/concanamycin and the salicylihalamide/lobatamide classes of well-established V-ATPase inhibitors. Half-maximal inhibition of V-ATPase activity in vitro occurred at 0.04-0.7 microM for the fungal vacuolar V-ATPase and at 0.4 to >10 microM for the chromaffin granule V-ATPase. Thus, the new inhibitors are somewhat less potent than the other two classes, which typically have Ki values of <10 nM for V-ATPases, and the new inhibitors differ from the other two classes in their specificity. The bafilomycin class inhibits all eucaryotic V-ATPases, the salicylihalamide class inhibits mammalian V-ATPases but not fungal V-ATPases, and the new chondropsin class inhibits the N. crassa V-ATPase better than the chromaffin granule V-ATPase. Two mutations in the N. crassa V-ATPase that affect the binding of bafilomycin had small but reproducible effects on the affinity of chondropsins for the V-ATPase, suggesting the possibility of a similar mechanism of inhibition.
