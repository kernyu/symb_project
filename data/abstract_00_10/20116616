Atazanavir is a drug that inhibits HIV protease. It has many of the characteristics of other protease inhibitors and also some advantages over these, such as the single dose of once per day, low capsule load, less gastrointestinal problems and a very friendly metabolic profile, including carbohydrate metabolism. Secondary high plasma bilirubin and jaundice are its main adverse effect which only on rare occasions requires stopping the drug. Other adverse effects, such as nephrolithiasis or ECG changes are extremely rare.
