AIM OF THE STUDY: In the Comoros Islands, the aerial parts of Flacourtia indica are used in traditional medicine to treat malaria. Because of the important use of this plant, the phytochemistry of the aerial parts was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three compounds were isolated from the decoction of this plant material, pyrocatechol, homaloside D and poliothrysoside. The in vitro antiplasmodial activity on the chloroquine-resistant strain (W2) of Plasmodium falciparum and the cytotoxicity on two complementary human cell lines (THP1, HepG2), of AcOEt extract obtained after liquid/liquid extraction of the decoction and pure compounds, were evaluated. RESULTS: The poliothrysoside isolated from the AcOEt extract presented a strong antiplasmodial activity (IC(50)=7.4 microM) and a good selectivity index (>28) similar to chloroquine. CONCLUSION: This study reports for the first time antiplasmodial activity for Flacourtia indica, for its AcOEt extract and the three major constituents and confirms its traditional use.
