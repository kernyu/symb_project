Ceftaroline fosamil is a new extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against drug-resistant Grampositive pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. At the same time, its Gramnegative spectrum of coverage includes common respiratory pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, as well as wild-type Enterobacteriaceae. In vivo efficacy for the treatment of experimental endocarditis, pneumonia, myositis and osteomyelitis has been demonstrated in animal models, while efficacy in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia has been demonstrated in phase II and III clinical trials in humans. The drug is well tolerated and has a low rate of reported adverse events. The dose of ceftaroline fosamil used is 600 mg i.v. every 12 h for patients with normal renal function or mild renal dysfunction. In patients with moderate renal dysfunction, it has been suggested that ceftaroline fosamil be dosed at 400 mg i.v. over 60 min every 12 h. Ceftaroline fosamil is still under review by the U.S. FDA, and when approved, will be one of the first commercially available beta-lactams with the ability to treat infections due to MRSA and other drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
