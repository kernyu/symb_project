The in vitro potency of stampidine (STAMP, DDE-113, HI-113, N-[p-(4-bromophenyl)-2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxy-5'-thymidylyl]-L-alanine methyl ester, CAS 217178-62-6) was examined against 8 clinical non-B subtype HIV-1 isolates with resistance to stavudine (STV, d4T), adefovir and tenofovir, 19 clinical zidovudine-resistant HIV-1 isolates, and 6 recombinant HIV-1 clones with multi-resistance against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Stampidine exhibited potent anti-HIV activity against each one of these 33 HIV-1 isolates with subnanomolar to nanomolar IC50 values.
