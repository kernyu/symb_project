The structure gene FLO1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303-1A encoding a flocculation protein and the G418 resistance gene kanMX from plasmid pUG6 were amplified by PCR method. The expression vector pYX212 harboring FLO1 gene and kanMX gene was transformed into Angel yeast. The transformant Angel yeast F6 was obtained and showed strong and stable flocculation ability during 20 batches inoculation. And the flocculation ability of the transformant Angel yeast F6 showed no difference in the medium with the initial pH ranging from 3.5 to 6.0. Noteworthily, the flocculation onset of the transformant strain was in the early stationary growth phase, not coincident with the glucose depletion in the cultural medium. And in the experiment the ethanol yield and other properties of the transformant Angel yeast F6 were similar to those of the wild-type strain, although its fermentation time was a little slower comparing with the wild-type strain. Those would be potential application for yeast cells to separate and recycle in the fuel ethanol industry.
