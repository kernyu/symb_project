Bone infections, which can be acute or chronic, often require aggressive antibiotic therapy, whether treated at home or in the community. Surveillance programmes are essential tools in the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and can act as a resource to maintain effective prescribing. The Surveillance Network (TSN), which collects organism and patient-specific data from a network of laboratories across the United States, was used to analyse susceptibility of common bacterial species isolated from bone infections during 2000-2002. Narrow-spectrum antimicrobials such as vancomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid demonstrated good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, and were active against 100% of isolates. However, Gram-negative species were also commonly isolated from these sites of infection. Later-generation cephalosporins, represented by ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and cefepime, exhibited a broad spectrum of activity including Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, but they were not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and showed variable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using ceftazidime as a marker for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) expression, less than 3% of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae expressed this phenotype. Based on current in vitro activity, the third-generation cephalosporins provide broad-spectrum coverage useful for the empirical therapy of suspected bone infections, especially for patients treated in the community or hospitalised with community-acquired infections.
