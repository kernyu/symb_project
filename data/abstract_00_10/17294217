Therapeutic failure limits prophylaxis of nematode diseases and has been mainly attributed to mutations in cellular targets of anthelmintics. Besides these specific mechanisms, alterations of drug transport also occur in parasites resistant to anthelmintics and depend on both the presence of membrane pumps such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and on the lipid composition of membranes. We recently showed in the nematode Haemonchus contortus, using eggs as a model, that the total cholesterol (TC) concentration alters the transport of lipophilic molecules due to membrane pumps such as P-glycoprotein and the resistance to anthelmintics. The effect of TC may depend on the presence of other lipids interacting with TC. Therefore, we analysed the lipid composition and its relationship with Pgp and resistance to anthelmintics. Better correlations were found between Pgp and free cholesterol (FC) than with TC. We also showed that the relationships between lipid composition and resistance to anthelmintics or Pgp depended on the equilibrium between FC and phospholipids (PLs), mainly PLs known to be present primarily in either the external leaflets of cell membranes or the internal leaflets. The PLs phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine played the most significant role, but phosphatidic acid also influenced drug resistance.
