UNLABELLED: We assessed clinical and microbiological characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) infections in hospitalized patients during a period of three years (October 2005 - October 2008) in the Clinic Hospital of Infectious Diseases Iasi. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 169 patients with SA infections (sepsis, meningitis, skin infections and urinary tract infections). MiniAPI system ID 32 STAPH was used for identification and antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by ATB STAPH method and by E-test for oxacillin and vancomycin. RESULTS: The rate of methicillin resistance (MR) was 48%, all strains being susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin. In our study MRSA was susceptible in approximately 94% of cases to clindamycin and cotrimoxazole. Infections were defined as nosocomial in 51% of patients with a rate of MR of 52% and community-acquired in 49% with a rate of MR of 23% (p = 0.001). Clinical profile was: localized infection in 41% of patients with MRSA and systemic infection (sepsis with at least one organ involvement or bacteremia) in 59% of patients with MRSA infections (p = 0.53). Initial treatment was inadequate in 46% of MRSA infections. One third of strains had MIC of vancomycin 2 mg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of methicillin resistance of S. aureus straints isolated from infections (48 %) justifies a particular approach of initial antistaphylococcal therapy.
