Susceptibility of 88 clinical Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 116 Haemophilus influenzae isolates and 80 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates to 6 fluoroquinolones--ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin and gemifloxacin--were determined. Isolates were from patients with invasive disease at 4 hospitals in Saudi Arabia between 1996 and 1998. S. pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin and gemifloxacin; susceptibility to ofloxacin and levofloxacin was 97.7% and 98.9% respectively. H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to all agents, except for trovafloxacin (99.1%). M. catarrhalis strains were fully sensitive to all agents except ofloxacin (97.5%). No isolates were resistant to gemifloxacin or grepafloxacin.
