The sensitivities of 61 Indian cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria to chloroquine (CQ) were investigated using in-vitro and in-vivo methods. Concentrations of CQ and desethylchloroquine (DCQ) in blood cells and plasma from CQ-sensitive and -resistant cases were determined 2 and 7 days after initiation of treatment, by HPLC. On day 2, the mean CQ concentrations in the samples collected from the sensitive cases were higher than those in the samples from the resistant patients, in plasma (0.47 v. 0.32 microgram/ml; P < 0.02) and particularly in the blood cells (1.51 v. 0.46 micrograms/ml; P < 0.001). By day 7, however, the CQ concentrations in the two groups were similar. Although, on day 2, the mean ratio of the CQ to DCQ concentrations was significantly higher in the blood cells from the sensitive group than in those from the resistant cases (P < 0.01), the CQ/DCQ ratios for the plasma were similar for the two groups. Similarly, the mean ratio between the blood-cell concentration of CQ on day 2 and the concurrent plasma concentration (BPr) was also relatively high in the sensitive group (P < 0.001).
