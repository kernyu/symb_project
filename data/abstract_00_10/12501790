In the Orenburg Region, HIV-infected individuals fall ill with tuberculosis tens time more frequently than uninfected ones. Thirty five HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis and 32 patients without immunodeficiency (a control group) were examined and treated. Of the clinical forms of tuberculosis, infiltrative tuberculosis was predominant, tissue destruction being seen in half the cases. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis was revealed in 11.4% of the patients. Multidrug resistance was ascertained in 20% of cases. The efficiency of treatment in patients with double HIV/tuberculosis infection was 10-15% lower than that in those without HIV infection.
