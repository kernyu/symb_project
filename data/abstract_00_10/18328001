Two hundred eleven Salmonella enterica strains representing 35 serotypes isolated from healthy poultry (n=103) and swine (n=108) were used in this study. The occurrence and characteristics of class 1 integrons were investigated. Salmonella genomic islands (SGIs) and the horizontal transfer of integrons were assessed. One hundred eighty-six isolates (88%) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial and 140 isolates (66%) were multidrug resistant. The intI1 gene was present in 54 isolates (25.6%), of which 33 (15.6%) carried gene cassettes with sizes ranging from 0.7 to 2.3 kb. Sequence analysis revealed 11 distinct integron profiles in which resistance genes bla(PSE-1), dfrA1, dfrA12, aadA2, aadA4a, and silB were present. The gene cassette array dfrA12-aadA2 was the most prevalent among the isolates whereas most integrons were located on conjugative plasmids. SGI1 variants (SGI1-A and -F) were present in nine isolates belonging to serovars Albany, Emek, Kedougou, and Kingston.
