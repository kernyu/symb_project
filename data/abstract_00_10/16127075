The in vitro activity of uperin 3.6, alone or combined with six antibiotics, against gram-positive cocci, including Rhodococcus equi, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, was investigated. All isolates were inhibited at concentrations of 1 to 16 mg/liter. Synergy was demonstrated when uperin 3.6 was combined with clarithromycin and doxycycline.
