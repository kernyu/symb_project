The fitness of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vivo depends on the interaction of a multitude of viral and host factors. The aim of this study was to analyze the biological phenotype and the intrinsic capacity of the HIV isolates with drug-resistance mutations to replicate efficiently in the absence of drugs. An open label multicenter cross-sectional study was undertaken on 28 HIV-infected patients failing antiretroviral treatment. The subjects were studied for CD4+ cell count, HIV viral load, syncytium-inducing phenotype, genotypic drug-resistance assay, and replication capacity of HIV isolates assessed by co-culture assay. All HIV isolates showed a decreased replication capacity compared with wild-type strains. The lowest replication capacity was detected in HIV strains with more than five drug-resistance mutations. The highest replication capacity was observed in strains carrying the K103N and Y181C primary mutations that emerged after treatment with non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors. Isolates with R5 biological phenotype had a higher number of resistant mutations than X4 isolates (P = 0.004). Particularly, the R5 phenotype was detected in all 6 isolates with more than 14 drug-resistance mutations. Patients with R5 strains had plasma viral load similar to patients with X4 strains, but marginally higher CD4+ cell counts, and their HIV isolates had significantly lower replication capacity of HIV isolates (P = 0.008). No patient carrying HIV with a maintained replication capacity had a viral load less than 30,000 copies/ml. In patients failing HAART, the detection of HIV isolates with the R5 biological phenotype correlates with CD4+ cell count, an impaired replication capacity, and a high number of drug-resistance mutations.
