Adipose tissue expression and circulating concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) correlate positively with adiposity. To ascertain the roles of MCP-1 overexpression in adipose, we generated transgenic mice by utilizing the adipocyte P2 (aP2) promoter (aP2-MCP-1 mice). These mice had higher plasma MCP-1 concentrations and increased macrophage accumulation in adipose tissues, as confirmed by immunochemical, flow cytometric, and gene expression analyses. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 mRNA levels in white adipose tissue and plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels were increased in transgenic mice. aP2-MCP-1 mice showed insulin resistance, suggesting that inflammatory changes in adipose tissues may be involved in the development of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in aP2-MCP-1 mice was confirmed by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies showing that transgenic mice had lower rates of glucose disappearance and higher endogenous glucose production than wild-type mice. Consistent with this, insulin-induced phosphorylations of Akt were significantly decreased in both skeletal muscles and livers of aP2-MCP-1 mice. MCP-1 pretreatment of isolated skeletal muscle blunted insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which was partially restored by treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126, suggesting that circulating MCP-1 may contribute to insulin resistance in aP2-MCP-1 mice. We concluded that both paracrine and endocrine effects of MCP-1 may contribute to the development of insulin resistance in aP2-MCP-1 mice.
