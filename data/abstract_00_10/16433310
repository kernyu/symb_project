The work has been undertaken in order to attain detailed information on the antibiotic sensitivity of the identified microorganisms from different clinical material derived from inpatients, outpatients and healthy people, on various regions of Poland in 1998. Approprite questionnaires (cards) were sent to each sanitary-epidemiological stations throughout Poland. Received 28619 cards, from 44 Public Health Service laboratories, allowed to create a computerized data base in Department of Bacteriology in National Institute of Hygiene in Warsaw. Staphylococci were the most frequent etiologic pathogen isolated from the clinical material--24,7%. Among them, there were: S. aureus--75,8%, S. epidermidis--9,7%, unidentified coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS)--9,2% and S. saprophyticus--5,1%. 71,6% of staphylococci strains derived from non-hospital material and 26,7% from hospital material. Staphylococci strains isolated from inpatients specimens were more resistant to antibiotics than those from outpatients specimens. The highest resistance, among both hospital and non-hospital strains, was exhibited to penicillin (70-100%) and tetracycline (approximately 50%); the lowest to: glycopeptides, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfametoxazole, nitrofurantoin and gentamicin. Staphylococci isolated from various clinical specimens differed in their antibiotic resistance. The percentages of coagulase-negative staphylococci strains resistant to the antibiotics used were higher than of S. aureus strains. On the average 34% of S. aureus strains were methicillin-resistant (MRSA); but depending on specimens were isolated from, it ranged from 24% of MRSA strains for ear and nose swabs to 70% of MRSA strains for feaces samples. Among MRSA strains the percentage of resistance to other antibiotics was a few time higher than among MSSA strains. The territorial distribution of staphylococci strains resistance to various antibiotics in Poland is not uniform.
