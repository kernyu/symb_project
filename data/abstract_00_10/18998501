OBJECTIVES: We report the plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels of 16 young children who were undergoing ambulatory surgery for placement of tympanostomy tubes. METHODS: We previously obtained blood samples from young children who were undergoing ambulatory surgery and reported that they had lower blood levels than adults of eicosapentaenoic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid), vitamin A, and selenium. Plasma frozen continuously at -80 degrees C was available from 16 subjects who were undergoing placement of tympanostomy tubes. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) age of the patients was 3.7 +/- 1.6 years (median, 2.9 years; range, 1.9 to 7.4 years). Sixty-two percent were male; half were white, and half were Hispanic. Sixty-two percent were private patients; the parents reported that half were taking vitamin supplements. None had a history of rickets. None had 25(OH)D levels less than 10 ng/mL; 50% had 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/mL (deficient in adults); another 31% had levels from 21 to 29 ng/mL (insufficient in adults). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D is essential for the production of endogenous antimicrobial peptides, and has been linked to seasonal, epidemic influenza A. However, the level of 25(OH)D needed to prevent infection with various human pathogens has not been defined. In view of increasing bacterial resistance and emerging new pathogens, further research on the relationship of infection to 25(OH)D and other nutritional factors is warranted.
