BACKGROUND: Nocardial infections typically affect patients receiving immunosuppressants, occurring early after surgery in 3% to 40% of heart transplant (HTx) recipients. The emergence of antibiotic resistance and occurrence of disease recurrences in AIDS population has engendered controversy about the treatment for immunodepressed HTx patients. METHODS: We present a retrospective study of the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of 560 HTx recipients between 1984 and 2002. RESULTS: Among the five cases of Nocardia infection (0.9%), three cases developed late after HTx (between 3.1 and 11 years follow-up). All patients had pulmonary disease and one in addition had subcutaneous nodules. Microbiological diagnosis required open lung biopsy in one case. All patients were treated primarily with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, but evidence of resistance to sulfonamides led us to change the antimicrobial combination in two cases. Four patients who received one year of antibiogram-guided therapy showed complete healing without recidivism. Three patients died, all due to non-related causes, at follow-ups between 1 and 5 years. In one case a cutaneous recurrence of disease was attributed to noncompliance. CONCLUSIONS: Nocardiosis in current HTx is less common than previously reported. Its incidence seems to be delayed in time with modern immunosuppressants. Given the high incidence of sulfamide resistance, treatment must be guided by antibiotic sensitivity. We believe that maintenance therapy for a whole year is the appropriate option in order to avoid recidivism in this population.
