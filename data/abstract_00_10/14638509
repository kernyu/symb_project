In search of treatment alternatives against vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), an in vitro pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations incorporating protein and a high inoculum was used to simulate daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and vancomycin against the Michigan VRSA strain. Daptomycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin exhibited the greatest bacterial reductions, and all tested agents except vancomycin exhibited bactericidal activity against the VRSA.
