Antibiotic-resistant anaerobic bacteria have become increasingly recognized as a confounding factor in the selection of therapeutic agents. The use of potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics as empirical therapy, along with appropriate adjunctive measures, has, in some ways, masked the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance problem that parallels that observed for nonanaerobic pathogens. The use of standardized testing methods that recognize resistance and an understanding of resistance mechanisms have become essential for the treatment of patients and the development of new agents.
