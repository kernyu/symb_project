Extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) continue to be a major problem in clinical setups world over, conferring resistance to the expanded spectrum cephalosporins. An attempt was made to study ESBL production among Enterobacteriaceae members from a tertiary care center in Chennai. A total of seventy randomly collected isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae from a tertiary care center was studied for their susceptibility patterns to various antibiotics and detection of ESBL producers by double disc synergy (DDS) test and three dimensional test (TDT). Eighty percent of the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR) and 20% were ESBL producers. TDT detected 85.7% whereas only 14.2% were detected by DDS. In the present study, a large number of isolates were found to be MDR and ESBL producers. TDTs were found to be better than DDS in the detection of ESBLs. Continued monitoring of drug resistance is necessary in clinical settings for proper disease management.
