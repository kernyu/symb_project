The purpose of this survey was to take stock of porcine Salmonella isolates derived from faecal and post-mortem samples over a 4-year period. Salmonella was isolated by direct inoculation on BGA(NO)-plates (faeces, intestinal content) or sheep blood agar (organs). Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the agar diffusion method. Salmonella was isolated in 4.2% of all porcine submissions received at the Animal Health Service. A total of 1305 salmonellae were isolated from a total of 1279 submissions from 1008 different herds. Salmonella Typhimurium was the most frequently isolated serotype (88%), and Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 was the most frequently isolated phagetype (17.2% of Salmonella Typhimurium). Resistance to antimicrobials occurred in 47.3% of all isolates, mainly those of the multiresistant phagetype DT104. Other pathogens were isolated in more than 50% of the submissions. In cases of clinical diarrhoea, multiple pathogens may be involved and therapy and preventive measures should be adjusted accordingly.
