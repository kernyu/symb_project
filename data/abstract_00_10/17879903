Antibiotic resistance in bacteria, particularly MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (S.) aureus) is a crucial problem in the field of human medicine. Due to limited therapeutic choices, infections with these bacteria are causing higher morbidity and mortality compared to infections caused by MSSA (methicillin-susceptible S. AUREUS). In addition, these infections are also contributing to the economic burden of the public health system. Therefore, the rising proportion of MRSA can be seen as an enormous challenge in medical practice. In otorhinolaryngology, MRSA can cause different kinds of infections likewise, soft tissue infections, postoperative infections, otitis media, otitis externa, sinusitis and mastoiditis. To deal with this challenge, it is important to perform proper diagnostic and to provide appropriate antibiotic treatment which will ultimately help to lower selective pressure on bacterial population.
