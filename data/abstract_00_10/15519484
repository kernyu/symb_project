Antibiotic prescribing by primary care doctors has received renewed interest due to the continuing emergence of antibiotic resistance and the attendant cost to healthcare. We examined the antibiotic prescribing rate in relation to selected socio-demographic characteristics of the prescribers at the Seremban Health Clinic, a large public primary care clinic, designated for teaching, in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Data were obtained from: (1) retrospective review of prescriptions for the month of June 2002 and (2) a questionnaire survey of prescribers. A total of 10667 prescriptions were reviewed. The overall antibiotic prescribing rate was 15%; the rate (16%) was higher for the general Outpatient Department (OPD) than the 3% for the Maternal & Child Health Clinic (MCH). The antibiotic prescription rates for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) were 26% and 16%, respectively, for the OPD and MCH. Half of all the antibiotic prescriptions were for URTI making prescribing for URTI an appropriate target for educational intervention. The URTI-specific antibiotic prescription rate did not correlate with the prescribers' intention to specialise, patient load, perceived patient's expectation for an antibiotic, or the score for knowledge of streptococcal tonsillitis. Prescribing behaviours and record-keeping practices requiring correction were identified.
