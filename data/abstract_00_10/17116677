Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs) are important components of current combination therapies for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, their low genetic barriers against resistance development, cross-resistance, and serious side effects can compromise the benefits of the two current drugs in this class (efavirenz and nevirapine). In this study, we report a novel and potent NNRTI, VRX-480773, that inhibits viruses from efavirenz-resistant molecular clones and most NNRTI-resistant clinical HIV-1 isolates tested. In vitro mutation selection experiments revealed that longer times were required for viruses to develop resistance to VRX-480773 than to efavirenz. RT mutations selected by VRX-480773 after 3 months of cell culture in the presence of 1 nM VRX-480773 carried the Y181C mutation, resulting in a less-than-twofold increase in resistance to the compound. A virus containing the double mutation V106I-Y181C emerged after 4 months, causing a sixfold increase in resistance. Viruses containing additional mutations of D123G, F227L, and T369I emerged when the cultures were incubated with increasing concentrations of VRX-480773. Most of the resistant viruses selected by VRX-480773 are susceptible to efavirenz. Oral administration of VRX-480773 to dogs resulted in plasma concentrations that were significantly higher than those required for the inhibition of wild-type and mutant viruses. These results warrant further clinical development of VRX-480773 for the treatment of HIV infection in both NNRTI-naive and -experienced patients.
