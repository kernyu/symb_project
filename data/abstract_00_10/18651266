Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an infectious pathogen that commonly occurs after stem cell transplantation. We report a case of meningoencephalitis with multiple abscess formation caused by MRSA, which occurred in a 62-y-old female soon after allogeneic cord blood transplantation, and which was successfully treated by the administration of intravenous linezolid.
