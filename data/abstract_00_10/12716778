The in vitro antifungal activity of albendazole, a benzimidazole widely used as an antihelmintic drug in humans, was investigated and assessed for its activity against Aspergillus spp. Forty-eight isolates, representing the most frequent species found in human pathology [Aspergillus fumigatus (n = 27), Aspergillus flavus (n = 10), Aspergillus terreus (n = 7), Aspergillus nidulans (n = 3) and Aspergillus niger (n = 1)], and one quality control strain (A. niger ATCC 9804 83435) were tested according to the NCCLS M38-P methodology for moulds. All the strains were susceptible to albendazole, with homogeneous MICs for each species; three strains were resistant to itraconazole.
