Maraviroc is a selective and slowly reversible antagonist of the CCR5 co-receptor which has shown to have powerful antiviral activity, in vitro, against a wide range of HIV clinical isolates, including strains multi-resistant to 4 classes of pre-existing antiretroviral drugs. Maraviroc is active against HIV populations that only use the CCR5 coreceptor to enter the cell and has not demonstrated significant activity in the treatment of viral populations that use the CXCR4 co-receptor. The mechanism of action of maraviroc, non-competitive with other antiretroviral drugs, and the absence of crossed resistance with the rest of their families, has led to Maraviroc being a drug available for use in rescue antiretroviral treatment. However, the excellent tolerance of maraviroc compared to the placebo in phase III clinical trials, its safety and its favourable pharmacological interactions profile with other drugs commonly used in HIV infected patients with comorbidity brings to light other scenarios in which Maraviroc could be useful.
