In this study, we present a case of renal failure in a patient who was on a tenofovir-containing regimen, resulting in extremely high tenofovir exposure and prolonged tenofovir monotherapy. We considered this case report important because exposure to tenofovir monotherapy might have consequences for future discontinuation strategies in cases of renal failure.
