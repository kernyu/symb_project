Discordant resistance mutations were seen in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolated from specimens of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from 3 of 6 patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of HIV-1 isolated from CSF harboring the K103N mutation, which confers resistance to the nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and this finding may indicate that virus in the CSF replicates independently from virus in the blood compartment.
