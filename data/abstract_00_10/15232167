BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Enterococci are important nosocomial agents and serious infections caused by them are often treated with a combination of cell wall inhibitor and aminoglycoside. However, the presence of high level aminoglycoside resistance in these isolates makes this treatment combination ineffective. The prevalence of such isolates in a tertiary care set up has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. The present study was carried out to find out the occurrence of high level aminoglycoside resistant isolates of enterococci in paediatric septicaemia cases in a tertiary care set up in north India. METHODS: Blood of paediatric cases with a clinical diagnosis of septicaemia was cultured to isolate and identify enterococci. Agar screen method was used to detect high level streptomycin and gentamicin resistance in these isolates. Vancomycin susceptibility of these isolates were determined as per the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommendations. RESULTS: Fifty one enterococcal strains were isolated from 21 neonates, nine infants and 21 children with a clinical diagnosis of septicaemia. Sixty eight per cent of these isolates had high level gentamicin resistance and forty three per cent had high level streptomycin resistance. All the isolates with high level streptomycin resistance also had high level gentamicin resistance. More than ninety five per cent of these isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The occurrence of high level gentamicin and high level streptomycin resistance in enterococcal isolates in our set up was high. This would require routine testing of the enterococcal isolates for high level aminoglycoside resistance. Alternative treatment regimes need to be sought, besides prudent use of antibiotics.
