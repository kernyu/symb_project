Visceral leishmaniasis ranks second after malaria in the top 10 fatal parasitic diseases worldwide. Treatment is effective, but most patients live in developing countries where even basic health care is unavailable. Economic factors hamper a targeted approach, which should include the following: preventing transmission by distributing bednets; developing diagnostic tools that can be used in the field without a laboratory; developing new and affordable drugs; and evaluating different drug combinations and treatment schedules that may prevent the development of resistance, as has been done in tuberculosis, HIV and malaria.
