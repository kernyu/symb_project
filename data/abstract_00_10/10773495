The individual activity of antibiotics such as ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin and gentamicin in combination with compounds known to modify bacterial resistance to given antibiotics was studied using the checkerboard method. The combination of promethazine with either ampicillin, tetracycline or erythromycin or the combination of methylene blue and erythromycin produced significant synergistic activity against Escherichia coli. Verapamil, however, in combination with ampicillin reduced the activity of ampicillin against E. coli. Combinations of clomipramine with either tetracycline or erythromycin, promethazine and erythromycin or verapamil and ampicillin were synergistic against Staphylococcus epidermidis that was resistant to these antibiotics. The only synergy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown by the combination of methylene blue and gentamicin.
