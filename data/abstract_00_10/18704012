Infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria are an increasing problem worldwide. Treatment of these microorganisms is a challenge because resistance limits dramatically therapeutic options. In this review, we discuss data of in vitro susceptibility and clinical studies of possible agents for the management of these infections. Currently, published data are limited, and there are no randomized clinical trials involving the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative rods. For imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp., most studied options are polymyxins and sulbactam. No newer antimicrobials active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa are available or under investigation. Tigecycline presents a broad spectrum of activity in vitro but has been studied mainly as treatment of community-acquired infections, as has ertapenem. They are potential options against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and tigecycline may be useful in treating Acinetobacter infections.
