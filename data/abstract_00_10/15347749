This research developed a community genome array (CGA) to assess the effects of Acacia angustissima on rumen microbiology. A. angustissima produces non-protein amino acids as well as tannins, which may be toxic to animals, and CGA was used to assess the effects of this plant on the ecology of the rumen. CGAs were developed using a 7.5 cmx2.5 cm nylon membrane format that included up to 96 bacterial genomes. It was possible to separately hybridize large numbers of membranes at once using this mini-membrane format. Pair-wise cross-hybridization experiments were conducted to determine the degree of cross-hybridization between strains; cross-hybridization occurred between strains of the same species, but little cross-reactivity was observed among different species. CGAs were successfully used to survey the microbial communities of animals consuming an A. angustissima containing diet but quantification was not precise. To properly quantify and validate the CGA, Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus populations were independently assessed using 16S rDNA probes to extracted rRNA. The CGA detected an increase in these populations as acacia increased in the diet, which was confirmed by rRNA analysis. There was a great deal of variation among strains of the same species in how they responded to A. angustissima. However, in general Selenomonas strains tended to be resistant to the tannins in the acacia while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was sensitive. On the other hand some species, like streptococci, varied. Streptococcus bovis-like strains were sensitive to an increase in acacia in the diet while Streptococcus gallolyticus-like strains were resistant. Strep. gallolyticus has independently been shown to be resistant to tannins. It is concluded that there is significant variation in tannin resistance between strains of the same species. This implies that there are specific molecular mechanisms at play that are independent of the phylogenetic position of the organism.
