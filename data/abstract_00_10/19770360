Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a serious complication of immunosuppression after either stem cell transplantation (SCT) or solid organ transplantation (SOT). Adoptive transfer of EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs) is an effective prophylaxis and treatment for PTLD after SCT, but not for PTLD after SOT when pharmacologic immunosuppression cannot be discontinued. We report the generation of calcineurin (CN) mutants that render EBV-CTL resistant to the immunosuppressants tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporin A (CsA): mutant CNa12 confers resistance to CsA but not FK506, and mutant CNa22 confers resistance to FK506 but not CsA, whereas mutant CNb30 renders CTLs resistant to both calcineurin inhibitors. Untransduced EBV-CTLs do not proliferate in the presence of FK506/CsA. However, EBV-CTLs transduced with a retroviral vector coding for these mutants retain the ability to both proliferate and secrete normal levels of interferon-gamma in the presence therapeutic levels of FK506 (CNa12), CsA (CNa22), or both (CNb30). The cytotoxicity and phenotype of EBV-CTL lines were unaffected by expression of these mutant CNs. This approach should allow effective immunotherapy with EBV-CTLs in the SOT setting without risking the graft by reduction in immunosuppression, and represents a generic approach to improving immunotherapy in the face of immunosuppression.
