OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of nucleot(s)ide analogues therapy in patients with HBeAg-negative cirrhosis in China. METHODS: 111 patiens with HBeAg-negative cirrhosis were divided into antiviral group (58 cases, 25 entecavir, 19 adefovir dipivoxil, 13 lamivudine, 1 telbivudine) and control group (53 cases, supportive and symptomatic treatment). These two groups were matched for demography, liver function and Child-Pugh score. RESULTS: At the 96th week, the rate of ALT normalization and HBV DNA drop (1g copies/ml) in antiviral group were higher than those in control group (P < 0.05). The rates of HBV DNA negative (< 500 copies/ml) were 88.7% (47/53) and 32. 5% (13/40), respectively (P < 0.05 ). There were no differences in the rates of developing HCC and undergoing variceal bleeding between antiviral group and control group (P > 0.5). 15.4% patients with lamivudine treatment emerged YMDD mutations. 10.5% patients with adefovir dipivoxil treatment emerged virologic breakthrough and hepatitis flare during the second year. 2 patients (3.5%) in treatment group and 6 patients (11.5%) in control group died of liver failure or variceal bleeding or HCC ( P > 0.05 ). CONCLUSIONS: Neucleot(s)ide analogues are effective in suppressing HBV replication in patients with HBeAg-negative cirrhosis, but the impact of which on the mortality and complications of cirrhosis should be prolongly observed. For continuing treatment, the neucleot(s)ide analogues with strong effective and low resistance are the first choices to prevent viral mutation and drug resistance.
