The promises of pharmacogenetics are to elucidate the inherited basis of differences between individual responses to drugs in order to identify the right drug and dose for each patient. The recent identification of genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters led to the hypothesis that genetic factors may be implicated in the interindividual variability of the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic characteristics of immunosuppressive drugs, major side effects, and efficacy. The purpose of this study was to provide a short overview of recent results obtained in the field of pharmacogenetics of tacrolimus and sirolimus, both substrates of the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes and of the efflux pump P-glycoprotein, the product of the Multidrug Resistance-1 (MDR1) genes. A number of retrospective studies that demonstrated a link between the polymorphisms governing the CYP3A5 protein expression, with more conflicting results with the MDR1 gene polymorphisms, related to the daily dose necessary to achieve adequate blood tacrolimus levels. The CYP3A5 polymorphisms have also been associated with sirolimus pharmacokinetics. One challenge is to investigate the combined effect of a number of different polymorphisms in various genes to define genetic backgrounds with different pharmacokinetic profiles using high throughput technologies. Another challenge is to move toward prospective randomized studies to explore whether a pharmacogenetic approach, taking into account a limited number of polymorphisms prior to drug treatment, could be used on an individual basis to guide initial dosing of a given drug. The last challenge is based on "target" pharmacogenetics to investigate the role of the polymorphisms of other genes implicated in the efficacy and/or safety of the drug.
