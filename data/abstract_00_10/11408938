Nephroblastomas (Wilms' tumors) are curable with survival rates above 80%. Some tumors, however, fail to respond to therapy and those patients have a poor prognosis. In a search for molecular markers of drug resistance, we investigated the expression of lung resistance protein (LRP) in tissue samples from 32 children with nephroblastoma by means of immunohistochemistry. LRP is a human major vault protein (MVP) and is associated with multidrug resistance of tumors. LRP/MVP expression was found in the blastemal and epithelial compartments but to a significantly lesser extent in the stromal compartment of Wilms' tumors. Expression was generally heterogeneous with respect to staining intensity and percentage of positive cells. We found significant relationships between LRP/MVP expression and chemotherapeutic pre-treatment of tumors and tumor stage. The immunohistochemical results were validated with a real-time RT-PCR technique and a significant association between protein and mRNA expression was observed.
