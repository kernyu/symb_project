This study investigated the processing tolerances of two mushroom proteins with immunomodulatory activities, including FVE from Enoki ( Flammulia velutipes ) and LZ8 from Reishi ( Ganoderma lucidum ) mushrooms, under food processing treatments such as heating, sterilization, frozen storage, extraction in acid/alkaline conditions, and dehydration. Results showed that the capability of these two proteins to induce IFN-gamma secretion by murine splenocytes remained after 100 degrees C heating for 30 min, 121 degrees C autoclaving for 15 min, and -80 degrees C freezing. The retained activities of both proteins on cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production did not decrease at 0.6 M hydrochloric acid (at pH 2) but strikingly dropped at 5 M sodium hydrate (at pH 13). After vacuum dehydration, FVE and LZ8 retained most of their activities on cell proliferation; nevertheless, the IFN-gamma secretion decreased to about half of the initial values. These findings suggest that these two mushroom proteins have a good thermal/freezing resistance, acid tolerance, and dehydration stability and are candidates for processing in food and nutraceutical utilization.
