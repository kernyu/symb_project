We examined the antimicrobial effects of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) on 17 species of oral streptococci to investigate the involvement of antimicrobial peptide activity in oral microflora development and the clinical use of the antimicrobial peptide for oral microflora control. Oral streptococci exhibit diverse levels of susceptibility to human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2). Two major cariogenic bacterial species, Streptococcus mutans ( S. mutans) and S. sobrinus, were found to be susceptible to the peptide, indicating that it is a potential therapeutic agent for preventing dental caries. S. mitis exhibited the lowest susceptibility to the peptide. S. mitis is a major indigenous bacterium in the oral microflora, and our results suggest that it might possess a certain resistance mechanism against hBD-2.
