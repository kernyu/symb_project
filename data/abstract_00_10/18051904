OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect on P170, LRP, TOPO II of S180 tumour MDR mice for matter by 70% ethanol with Huanglian Jiedu Tang, and then discuss the molecular biology base for clinic. METHOD: 18-22 gramme mice were divided into four groups for normal S180 tumour cell group, matter by 70% ethanol with Huanglian Jiede Tang 100 mg x kg(-1) and 50 mg x kg(-1) in random. Each mouse was given S180 cell 0.2 mL by celiac, and after 24 hours give cisplatin for Injective 3 mg x kg(-1), ip, once a week. And give cyclophosphamide and 5-FU 3 mg x kg(-1), ig, once every day. After 15 days, collect lively mice ascites and give it for onefold normal mice. And then repeat before process. At the same time, every group was given corresponding medicine for 0.2 mL x 10 g(-1). The normal group and the model group were given the same cubage water, all together fore weeks. At last observd the P170, LRP, TOPO II by flow cytometry. RESULT: Matter by 70% ethanol with Huanglian Jiedu Tang could obviously reduce the express of P170 and LRP, and the activiation of TOPO II. CONCLUSION: Matter by 70% ethanol with Huanglian Jiedu Tang can intervene the ocurrence of the multi-drug resistance of tumour cells by regulating the biology gene.
