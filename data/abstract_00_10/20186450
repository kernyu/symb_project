The in vitro activity of tigecycline was determined using a well-defined collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates (n = 202), including 33 livestock-associated strains. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Etest system. Among the 202 MRSA strains, three (1.5%) had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for tigecycline greater than 0.5 mg/l, which are considered to be resistant. When these strains were tested using Iso-Sensitest medium, the MICs were substantially lower and no resistance was found. This discrepancy warrants further investigations into the preferred test conditions for tigecycline. In conclusion, tigecycline showed good activity against MRSA strains in vitro.
