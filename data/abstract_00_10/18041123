Effect of combined use of doxorubicin and ceftriaxone on 5 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (standard S. aureus ATCC 29213 and 4 isolated strains) was studied. The method of passages in meat-pepton broth with constant and increasing concentrations of ceftriaxone in presence of 1/2 and 1/4 minimum inhibitory concentration of doxorubicin was used. It has been shown that doxorubicin in such concentrations does not influence on the development of resistance of tested strains to ceftriaxone. The combination of doxorubicin as anti-tumor drug with intercalary action and ceftriaxone does not increase the risk of development of resistance of staphylococci to antibiotics, which has a matter during their combined use.
