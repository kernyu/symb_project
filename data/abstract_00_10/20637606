Control of emerging multi-drug resistant bacteria is one of the major prerequisite in the management of opportunistic infections. Current research is focused towards the identification of effective control agents from biological origin without any alarming side effects. Lactococcus lactis, probiotic organisms was isolated and purified biosurfactant from the bacteria exhibited surface active and emulsification activities comparable to the standard biosurfactant producing bacteria Bacillus licheniformis MTCC 429. Co-culturing of the isolate with the standard organism increased the biosurfactant production and surfactant activity. Biosurfactant from the L. lactis was characterized as glycolipids which consist of Methyl-2-O-methyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside with octadecanoic acid with a cumulative molecular weight of approximately 476g/mol by GC-MS and NMR studies. Purified biosurfactants showed broad range of antibacterial activity and are safe to administrate orally and dermally. So it could be used as a therapeutic agent in pharmaceutical or as a preservative in food industries.
