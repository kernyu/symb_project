Antibiotic resistant Salmonella infections are rare in Australia. We investigated an increase in multidrug resistant Salmonella Paratyphi B biovar Java (S. Java) infections in Australia during 2003-04. Eighty-two per cent (18/22) of S. Java cases enrolled into the study reported that they had been in contact with aquariums housing fish during their incubation period. Seventy-two per cent (13/18) of cases were infected with strains that were resistant to ApSmTcCmSuSp (ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, spectinomycin). Case households commonly reported high risk behaviours, such as cleaning aquaria in sinks. Sixty-one per cent (11/18) of cases reported that fish in their aquarium had been sick or died in the week prior to their illness, and S. Java was isolated from the water or gravel of 5 cases. These antibiotic strains are being spread internationally and may become endemic in countries importing tropical fish or result in transfer of resistance to other more common Salmonella serotypes.
