Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in HIV patients can cause hyperlipidaemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). An audit carried out in Manchester found that CVD risk factors were common among HIV patients receiving ARVs; however, the management of risk factors was not satisfactory. Adopting a formal system to identify and manage CVD risk factors as well as appropriate referral for specialist management of complications of ARV therapy would improve patient care.
