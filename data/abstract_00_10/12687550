Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by loss of immunologic self-tolerance and the subsequent development of autoantibodies. These antibodies are thought to be important in relation to the clinical manifestations of the disease. One example is the development of multiple cytopenias secondary to cytolytic or cytotoxic antibodies directed toward red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. Other antibodies may mediate abnormal cellular mechanisms such as those seen with neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE. We report the occurrence of autoantibodies directed toward insulin receptors and the subsequent development of type B insulin resistance syndrome in a woman with SLE. This syndrome was treated successfully with cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil.
