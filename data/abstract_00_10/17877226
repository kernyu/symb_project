A total of 495 Campylobacterjejuni and 122 C. coli isolated from Thai children were screened for macrolide (erythromycin and azithromycin) resistance by disk diffusion assay. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for erythromycin, azithromycin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol were further determined for these macrolide-resistant Campylobacter isolates. Presence of known point mutations resulting in reduced susceptibility to macrolides was investigated by PCR and DNA sequencing. Seventeen percent (23/122) of C. coli and 2.4% (12/495) of C. jejuni isolates were resistant to macrolides. By sequencing domain V of the 23S ribosomal DNA from all 35 macrolide-resistant isolates, a known point mutation of 23S rRNA associated with reduced susceptibility to macrolides was detected in all isolates except one. Among the macrolide-resistant isolates, all were multiply resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, of which the latter is the preferred antimicrobial used for diarrheal treatment in Thailand. Furthermore, most macrolide-resistant isolates were also resistant to tetracycline and streptomycin. The spread of macrolide and quinolone resistant Campylobacter should be monitored closely in Thailand and elsewhere as these antimicrobials are preferred drugs for treatment of diarrhea.
