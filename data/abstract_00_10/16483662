A review of medical records of 45 of 53 hospitalised patients with positive cultures for CTX-M type ESBL-producing Escherichia coli between 01 January and 31 May 2004 was conducted. The mean age of the population studied was 73.1 (+/-14.6) years and the majority (55.6%) had been under the care of the internal medicine or elderly care service. In the majority (77.8%) of instances the isolate was attributed to a clinical infection rather than colonisation and the commonest clinical specimen to yield the organism was urine, which was positive in 57.8% of patients. Acquisition of the organism was categorised as nosocomial in 68.9% of patients; in this subgroup, the median duration of inpatient stay prior to recovery of the organism was 24 (range 3-240) days. Haemodialysis-dependence was the most common of the comorbidities evaluated. The mean number of antibiotics prescribed per patient in the 30 days prior to first isolation of the organism was 1.7 (range 0-4). Furthermore, the mean number of antibiotic-days exposure per patient during this period was 13.9 (range 0-48). The most frequently received class of antibiotic was beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Of 35 infections, 26 (74.2%) were successfully treated. Overall 12 patients with infection died (34.3%); attributable mortality was presumed in seven (20%).
