Resistance to CCR5 antagonists can be driven by mutations in gp120. Sequences from 323 anti-CCR5 naive patients were analyzed for the presence of previously described in-vivo or in-vitro resistance mutations to CCR5 antagonists located in the V3 loop of gp120. The V3 loop region was rather polymorphic, and 7.3% of patients showed viruses with combinations of mutations in V3 loop previously described to be involved in maraviroc resistance, a licensed CCR5 antagonist.
