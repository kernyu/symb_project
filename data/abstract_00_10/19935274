HIV-1 drug resistance patterns in 41 children failing antiretroviral therapy in South Africa were examined. Resistance mutation profiles were similar to adults published from the region, with the exception of high rates of lopinavir/r resistance (44%). Ninety-eight percent presented with known drug resistance mutations with M184V (82%) and K103N (44%), the dominant mutations.
