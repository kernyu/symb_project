Antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori varies according to geographical region. We studied the primary resistance rates among 652 H. pylori isolated from Korea in relation to collection date, disease presentation, age and gender. Resistance rates were 40.6% (metronidazole), 5.9% (clarithromycin), 5.3% (tetracycline), 0% (amoxycillin), 1.5% (furazolidone) and 1.5% (nitrofurantoin). Resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin increased from 1994 to 1999 (from 33.3 to 47.7% and 4.8 to 7.7%, respectively), but the differences only reached significance when rates of metronidazole resistance in women were compared with those in men (48.6 versus 36.9%).
