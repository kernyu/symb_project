The INNO-LiPA HBV DR v2 assay is designed to detect hepatitis B virus mutations conveying resistance to lamivudine and adefovir. Our study confirms that this assay can simultaneously detect the presence of lamivudine and adefovir resistance mutations in clinical samples, has a high degree of concordance with sequencing, and can detect mutants earlier.
