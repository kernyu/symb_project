In literature and clinical findings, the attention has been turned to the resistance to the antibiotics used in Helicobacter pylori eradication, especially metronidazole and clarithromycin. Drug-resistance was evaluated in 50 children. Primary drug-resistance to the antibiotics used in eradications was determined in this group, and additionally, in 18 children who were subjected twice to unsuccessful eradicative therapy. The highest secondary resistance to metronidazole up to 72.0% was found among conventionally used antibiotics. Primary resistance of H. pylori rods to clarithromycin was also high and equaled 25.0%. However, in our study secondary resistance to macrolides was about 66.0%. In our study combined primary resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole was about 7.2%. There was not H. pylori rods resistance to amoxicillin and tetracyclines.
