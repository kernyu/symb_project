In Pichia membranifaciens, cyanide-resistant respiration (CRR) sensitive to salicylhydroxamic acid emerged after forced aeration of starved cells for 4 h. Surveying a large number of species by this simple methodology, we found that CRR is very frequent among yeasts. Remarkably, considering our results together with previous data in the literature, CRR was present in 24 out of 28 non-fermentative or Crabtree-negative yeasts and absent in 10 out of 12 Crabtree-positive yeasts. We submit that, as alternatives to cytochromic respiration, yeasts developed two strategies: either aerobic fermentation in Crabtree-positive yeasts or CRR in non-fermentative or Crabtree-negative yeasts.
