Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is an increasingly difficult condition to treat because of the emergence of antibiotic resistance and highly pathogenic strains of bacteria. These newly identified strains affect patients in every facet of health care, from individuals in the community to those in intensive care units and all points in between. Appropriate management regarding diagnosis, infection control, pharmacotherapy, and prevention is the key to good outcomes in all patient populations. Geriatric patients are particularly at risk of acquiring CDAD as a result of their gradually declining immune systems and increased exposure to health care facilities. Therefore, they merit a higher level of attention when CDAD is suspected. In an effort to identify the best practices, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America in conjunction with the Infectious Diseases Society of America developed guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of Clostridium-associated disease. By utilizing these guidelines to educate other health care practitioners and by considering the recommendations in their own practice, pharmacists can have a positive impact on every facet of CDAD prevention and management.
