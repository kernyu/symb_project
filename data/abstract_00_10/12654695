The frequency of mutation to rifampin resistance of 200 clinical Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was examined. Two peaks were observed in the distribution, with mode frequencies of 2.5 x 10(-7) (20% of isolates) and 2.5 x 10(-8). The hexA and hexB gene entire sequences were analyzed in 13 isolates. Sequences from both hypermutable and "normomutable" strains were conserved relative to that of the R6 S. pneumoniae control strain. The phenotypic Hex system proficiency, in terms of transforming efficiency, was also maintained irrespective of the variations in mutation frequency values.
