The use of fluoroquinolones in children is limited because of the potential of these agents to induce arthropathy in juvenile animals and to potentiate development of bacterial resistance. No quinolone-induced cartilage toxicity as described in animal experiments has been documented unequivocally in patients, but the risk fro rapid emergence of bacterial resistance associated with widespread, uncontrolled fluoroquinolones use in children is a realistic threat. Overall, the fluoroquinolones have been safe and effective in the treatment of selected bacterial infections in pediatric patients. There are clearly defined indications for these compounds in children who are ill.
