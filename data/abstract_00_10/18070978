The in vitro activities of caspofungin and micafungin against 1,038 yeast isolates have been determined. The caspofungin and micafungin MICs were lower for Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis than for Candida parapsilosis, Candida guilliermondii, and Candida krusei. A clear correlation was seen between the MICs for the two drugs.
