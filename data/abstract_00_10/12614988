We report a case of infective endocarditis due to vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) that did not respond to high doses of vancomycin. Initial vancomycin MIC of the last isolate recovered from blood was 8 micro g/mL, but could be induced up to 32 micro g/mL by consecutive growing with vancomycin. Clinical response was only accomplished when linezolid was included in therapy.
