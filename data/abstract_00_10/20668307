Phenothiazines have their primary effects on the plasma membrane of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Among the components of the prokaryotic plasma membrane affected are efflux pumps, their energy sources, energy providing enzymes such as ATPases, and genes that regulate and code for permeability aspects of the bacterium. The responses of multi-drug (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the neuroleptic phenothiazine thioridazine are reviewed. The information collated suggests that this phenothiazine has the potential to cure XDR and MDR tuberculosis infections, a potential that has been recently demonstrated by its ability to cure 10 patients who presented with XDR TB infections. The mechanism by which this phenothiazine produces the desired effects within the infected macrophage is also discussed.
