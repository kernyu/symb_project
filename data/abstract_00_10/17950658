Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is a growing problem worldwide. Not only is issue compounded by the fact that there are fewer pharmaceutical companies conducting research to discover novel antimicrobials than in the past but development time lines have stretched so that a dozen years from discovery to the market is now the standard. Eleven antibacterial drugs in late stage clinical development are discussed. Whereas many of these may successfully deal with resistant strains of Gram-positive pathogens, there is very little in development to address the gorwing unmet medical need of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative infections.
