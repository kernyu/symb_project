Comparative evaluation of the incidence of the drug resistant pathogens at the patients with sepsis was performed. High ratio of the resistnt strain was shown and the most potent drugs were estimated. The investigation results demonstrates the necessity to improve diagnostic quality control. The data on drug susceptibility of the pathogens may be used for their taxonomic clarification.
