The German Federal Ministry of Health has funded National Reference Centres (NRC) for laboratory-based surveillance of selected infection pathogens and infections disease syndromes. This selection is based on the epidemiologic relevance of the pathogens, specific diagnostic requirements, antimicrobial resistance and need for public health measures. Currently there are 18 NRC, nominated for a duration of 3 years. Toward the end of a nomination period, each NRC is evaluated by an expert committee, based on the catalogue of core tasks. In order to expand the spectrum of competencies 47 consiliary laboratories on additional pathogens of special epidemiologic importance have been named. Their main function is to provide information and consultation on special diagnostic issues. In order to further improve the effectiveness and cooperation of the system Networks have been created. The aim of the Networks is to facilitate exchange of diagnostic methods and prevention concepts and to improve the geographic coverage of the services.
