In bacterial genomes 3-12% of open reading frames are predicted to encode membrane transport proteins. These proteins can be vital for antibiotic efflux, protein/ toxin secretion, cell nutrition, environmental sensing, ATP synthesis, and other functions. Some, such as the multidrug efflux proteins, are potential targets for the development of new antibacterials and also for applications in biotechnology. In general membrane transport proteins are poorly understood, because of the technical difficulties involved in isolating sufficient protein for elucidation of their structure-activity relationships. We describe a general strategy for the amplified expression, purification and characterisation of prokaryotic multidrug efflux proteins of the 'Major facilitator superfamily' of transport proteins, using the Bacillus subtilis multidrug resistance protein, 'Bmr', as example.
