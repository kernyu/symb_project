The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and linezolid was evaluated against 234 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated in the Southeast of Spain. All drugs tested showed good activity, with an MIC(90) of less than 1 mg/l, and were active against isociacide and rifampicin resistant strains. Three strains were resistant to isoniazid and to the fluoroquinolones, which suggested the existence of mechanisms of resistance not yet described. These new compounds may prove to be therapeutic alternatives for treatment of multi-resistant tuberculosis and further studies should be done to demonstrate their true usefulness.
