INTRODUCTION: Candida rugosa appears to be emerging as a distinctive cause of candidaemia in recent years. Candidaemia due to this species is important to recognise because of its decreased susceptibility to azoles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a cluster of C. rugosa candidaemia occurring in critically ill trauma patients from a level I trauma centre of India. During the period from July 2008 to September 2009, a total of 28 blood samples from 19 patients were found to be positive for C. rugosa. Genetic relatedness among 17 C. rugosa isolates were characterised by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay using M13 primers. These isolates were also characterised for their susceptibility to four antifungal agents, amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine and voriconazole. RESULTS: In our study, 21% of C. rugosa isolates were resistant to fluconazole, whereas 100% susceptibility to amphotericin B, flucytosine and voriconazole was noted. Thirteen out of the 19 patients (68.4%) with C. rugosa candidaemia died. Of these, six had received antifungal therapy after confirmation of fungaemia. DISCUSSION: Prior to this cluster, C. rugosa had never been identified as a cause of infection at our centre. Due to the retrospective nature of the evaluation of these cases, the source of this possible outbreak could not be traced. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cluster of cases of C. rugosa candidaemia reported from a single institution in the English literature.
