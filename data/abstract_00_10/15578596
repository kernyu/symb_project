Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the target of a major pesticide family, the organophosphates, which were extensively used as control agents of sea lice on farmed salmonids in the early 1990s. From the mid-1990s the organophosphates dichlorvos and azamethiphos were seriously compromised by the development of resistance. AChE insensitive to organophosphate chemotherapeutants has been identified as a major resistance mechanism in numerous arthropod species, and in this study, target-site resistance was confirmed in the crustacean Lepeophtheirus salmonis Kroyer isolated from several fish-farming areas in Norway and Canada. A bimolecular rate assay demonstrated the presence of two AChE enzymes with different sensitivities towards azamethiphos, one that was rapidly inactivated and one that was very slowly inactivated. To our knowledge this is the first report of target-site resistance towards organophosphates in a third class of arthropods, the Crustacea.
