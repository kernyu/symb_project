Gatifloxacin (Tequin) is an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone approved in the US for use in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), acute sinusitis, uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), pyelonephritis, gonorrhoea and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections. Gatifloxacin has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro and good clinical and bacteriological efficacy in patients with indicated infections following once-daily administration by the intravenous or oral routes. It is generally well tolerated; the most common adverse events are associated with the gastrointestinal tract and CNS. Recent approvals for the use of gatifloxacin in the treatment of CAP due to multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP) and in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections extend the role of this drug in the treatment of bacterial infections in the US.
