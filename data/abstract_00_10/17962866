OBJECTIVE: To revise the importance of insulin resistance in the development of chronic hepatitis C and its interference in the response to the antiviral treatment of these patients. DATA SOURCE: Bibliographic revision of published papers in the MEDLINE and the authors data. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the last years several published papers have demonstrated an important relationship between insulin resistance and chronic hepatitis C. Increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the development of hepatic steatosis (specially in non-3 genotype), a more rapid progression of hepatic disease and reduction in the sustained virological response to treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin have been associated with insulin resistance in patients infected with HCV. The mechanism implied in the insulin resistance is the enhanced production of tumor necrosis factor by the HCV core. Tumor necrosis factor affects insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation, resulting in decreased glucose uptake and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Increased liver iron accumulation and modification in the levels of adipocytokinemia can have an additional effect on insulin sensitivity in chronic C hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosing and treating insulin resistance in patients with chronic hepatitis C could not only avoid complications but also prevent disease progression and increased the sustained virological rate to treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavarin.
