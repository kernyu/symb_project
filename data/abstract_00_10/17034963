Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin (S. Dublin) is a cattle-adapted Salmonella serovar, so if antimicrobial resistance in S. Dublin arises as a result of antimicrobial use this most likely occurs within the cattle reservoir without impact from antimicrobial use in humans. We tested the antimicrobial resistance of bovine-origin S. Dublin isolates from 1986 through 2004 using a standard disk diffusion method. High proportions of isolates throughout the time period were resistant to one or more antimicrobials, and a marked increase in resistance to ceftazidime occurred between 2000 and 2004. Dairy-origin isolates were more likely to be resistant to several antibiotics than were isolates from beef operations where exposure to antimicrobials is likely to be less frequent. Plasmid analysis of a subset of isolates also supported the hypothesis that antimicrobial resistance traits in the cattle-adapted serovar Dublin were acquired within the bovine host environment.
