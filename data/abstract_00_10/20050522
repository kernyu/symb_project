Fluoroquinolones are one of the most promising and vigorously pursued areas of contemporary antiinfective chemotherapy depicting broad spectrum and potent activity. They have a relatively simple molecular nucleus, which is amenable to many structural modifications. These agents have several favorable properties such as excellent bioavailability, good tissue penetrability and a relatively low incidence of adverse and toxic effects. They have been found effective in treatment of various infectious diseases. This paper is an attempt to review the therapeutic prospects of fluoroquinolone antibacterials with an updated account on their development and usage.
