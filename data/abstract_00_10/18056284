We amplified, cloned, and sequenced the beta-tubulin gene of Vittaforma corneae, a microsporidium causing human infections. The beta-tubulin gene sequence has a substitution at Glu(198) (with glutamine), which is one of six amino acids reported to be associated with benzimidazole sensitivity. Benzimidazoles were assayed for antimicrosporidial activity and showed poor parasite inhibition.
