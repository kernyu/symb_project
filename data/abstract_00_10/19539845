Long-term prognosis for advanced stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma may be beneficially altered with the use of multimodality therapy.

We present 3 cases of refractory Sezary syndrome in which the combination of vorinostat and interferon gamma was well tolerated and produced significant clinical improvement. The potential immunologic basis for this is discussed.
