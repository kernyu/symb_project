Caspofungin, an echinocandin, is approved for use in invasive candidiasis. Few cases of break-through candidal infections during caspofungin therapy have been reported and none have involved Candida parapsilosis. Here, we report a patient who developed multiple post-operative complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy for a pancreatic mass, including fungemia due to C. parapsilosis, while on caspofungin for treatment of Candida glabrata peritonitis. The fungemia resolved after a central venous catheter was removed and therapy was switched from caspofungin to amphotericin B lipid complex. Studies of C. parapsilosis susceptibility and the pharmacodynamics and drug interactions of caspofungin that may contribute to breakthrough fungemia are discussed.
