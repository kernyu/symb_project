Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent nosocomial infection in intensive care units (ICU). Resistance patterns seen in ICUs suggest that prescribing recommendations should be reappraised to limit practices engendering resistance to large families of antibiotics. Despite concern surrounding the use of antibiotics in the management of VAP, there is limited evidence to assist the clinician in making decisions about the indications for such therapy, the selection of the correct antibiotic(s), the timing of initiation of therapy and its duration. The high amount of antibiotic use, in combination with the low grade colonisation of patients with multi-resistant pathogens at the time of admission, turns the ICU into an environment where antibiotic policy is likely to have an effect on the resistance problem. Opinions are changing as to the validity of invasive techniques in guiding prescribing decisions. Invasive and semi-invasive diagnostic testing increases physician confidence in the diagnosis and management of VAP and helps to limit or discontinue antibiotic treatment.
