This study describes antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates obtained from female sex workers in Cotonou, Benin. All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin, and susceptible to moderately susceptible to kanamycin; 9.8% of isolates were resistant to thiamphenicol; 9%, 87.5% and 3.5% were susceptible, moderately susceptible, resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively; 94.4% and 99.3% were resistant to penicillin and tetracycline, respectively. All isolates with a minimal inhibitory concentration of tetracycline of >8 mg/l carried the 'American type' tetM plasmid; 94% and 6% of penicillinase-producing isolates possessed a 3.2 MDa and a 4.4MDa beta-lactamase plasmid, respectively. Surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae isolates to currently used drugs in Africa should become part of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) control programmes.
