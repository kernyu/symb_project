In vitro sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine, amodiaquine, quinine and pyronaridine was assessed using the DELI microtest method in 2000. Isolates were collected on the La Nye'ete rubber plantations located in a forest zone 45 km southeast of Kribi, Cameroon. Comparison with results of the last survey in 1986 showed that chloroquine resistance has remained stable (61% versus 56%). Sensitivity to amodiaquine and pyronaridine was high (76.5% and 89.5% respectively) in all isolates including chloroquine-resistant isolates. Despite intensive use in the area, quinine remained highly effective (sensitivity, 80%). These results indicate that chloroquine sensitivity has remained relatively stable in this resistant zone and that little cross-resistance with amodiaquine and pyronaridine has developed. These findings hold the promise for an alternative treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in chloroquine-resistance areas.
