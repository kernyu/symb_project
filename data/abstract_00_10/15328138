We evaluated 44 novel cationic compounds for activity against metronidazole-sensitive and -resistant Trichomonas vaginalis isolates. Six compounds in three different structural classes demonstrated 50% inhibitory concentrations as low as 1 microM against both sensitive and resistant isolates, suggesting a mode of action independent of parasite biochemical pathways that confer resistance to 5-nitroimidazoles.
