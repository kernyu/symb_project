An effective adsorbent is developed from saw dust and its various adsorption characteristics are studied for removing a basic dye (crystal violet) from its aqueous solution. Equilibrium data are fitted to various adsorption isotherms. It is seen that about 341 mg of crystal violet can be removed using 1g of the adsorbent at 298 K. Kinetic study is also carried out to observe the effects of various process parameters viz. particle size of the adsorbent, initial concentration of the dye, temperature and adsorbent amount. A generalized two-resistance mass transfer model, which includes a film mass transfer coefficient (k(f)) and an internal effective diffusivity (Dp), is used to interpret the adsorption kinetic data. The model parameters (k(f) and Dp) are estimated by fitting the experimental data to the model. The evaluated parameters are used to predict the concentration profiles at various other operating conditions. The average deviation of the predicted values lies within 10% in all the cases. Sensitivity analysis is performed to observe the sensitivity of the model to the variations in the model parameters.
