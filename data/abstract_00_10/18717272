The protozoa E. histolytica is the etiologic agent of human amebiasis, the identification of its pathogenicity has been of great aid in the search of important antigens for immunodiagnostic and inmunoprofilaxis. In 1995 the isolation and axenization of the first two strains of Venezuelan E. histolytica were described from symptomatic patients, which were denominated: IULA 1092:1 and IULA: 0593:2 These strains have been evaluated through studies of electrophoretic profiles, demonstrating the presence of type II zymodemes, characteristic of pathogenic strains. Also, they have shown to be of high virulence, they present a complex pattern of reactivity and the presence of a marker antigen of pathogenicity. The isoenzymatic analysis has shown correlation with the genotypic analysis, showing a genotypic organization typical of a pathogenic strain. With this strain, it has been possible to evaluate all the amebiasis cases sent to the Institute of Clinical Immunology of Universidad de Los Andes, in Merida, Venezuela. These strains have been useful, here, as well as in other sites, when using their antigens to evaluate urban and even indigenous populations. They can be used, like native strains of reference, in diagnostic tests and prophylaxis for this parasitosis. The limitations of the microscopic analysis, specifically, the false amebiasis diagnosis and its inability to discriminate between infections caused by E. histolytica and E. dispar have led to the development of laboratory procedures that allow for the detection of components of the species present. The success of such procedures would result in a diminution of unnecessary treatments, which could be the cause of antiamoebic drug resistance.
