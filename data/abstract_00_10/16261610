Infliximab-daclizumab was used to treat acute and chronic liver and gut graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in two children after standard immunosuppressive therapy failed. Infliximab (10 mg/kg weekly, 4 doses) and daclizumab (1 mg/kg, days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 22) were given over 1 month. In case 1, grade 2 chronic GVHD of the liver developed 1 year after transplantation and failed to improve with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. In case 2, corticosteroid-unresponsive grade 3 acute liver and gut GVHD developed on day +37. In both patients, GVHD responded to the infliximab-daclizumab regimen without toxicity and immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued.
