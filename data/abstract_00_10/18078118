Multidrug resistant Gram-negative rods are increasingly isolated from clinical specimens, especially from hospitalized patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of imipenem resistant strains of Gram-negative rods isolated in dr. A. Jurasz University Hospital in Bydgoszcz between 1999 and 2005 and imipenem consumption in this period. Out of 109614 isolated microorganisms, Gram-negative rods were 28,5%, 637 (2,0%) of strains were resistant to imipenem. These strains were isolated mostly from patients hospitalized in intensive care and rehabilitation clinics. Among imipenem-resistant strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevailed (88,9%). P. aeruginosa strains were sensitive to colistin, 45,5% of them to aztreonam and 44,0% to ceftazidime. The imipenem consumption in the appropriate years included in this study was: 805,00; 1201,25; 940,00; 1390,00; 1660,00; 1341,25; 1841,25 DDD respectively, and was strictly connected with increasing imipenem-resistant Gram-negative rods isolation.
