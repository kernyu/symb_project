Thirty-eight sheep flocks, located in three municipalities in the Eastern Yucatan, Mexico, were surveyed for gastrointestinal nematodes resistant to benzimidazole (BZD) anthelmintics (AH). On each flock, 30 sheep were randomly distributed into two groups of 15 animals: albendazole group (5mg/kg BW) and untreated control group. Animals were refrained from any food (either browsing/grazing or supplement) for a period of 16 h prior to treatment. Faecal egg counts (FEC) and larval cultures were performed 10 days after anthelmintic treatment. Percentage reduction and 95% confidence intervals were determined. Anthelmintic resistance (AR) was declared when the percentage reduction in FEC was <95% and the 95% confidence interval was <90%. AR was suspected when only one of the two criteria was met. The survey indicated that AR occurred in 15.8% (n=6) (95% confidence interval=+/-11.6%) and was suspected in 23.7% of the farms (n=9) (95% confidence interval=+/-13.3%). Post-treatment larval cultures indicated that Haemonchus was the only resistant genus. The questionnaire survey showed that most farmers (92%) considered their sheep a secondary activity to cattle production. The majority of farmers (97.4%) treat their animals according to visual appreciation of weight. However, most farmers (79%) treat their flocks at very low frequencies (<3 times per year). Drug rotation was performed every 12 months or more by 84.2% of farmers. Anthelmintics used were: macrociclic lactones (47.4%), BZD (39.5%), levamisol (10.5%) and 1 farmer used closantel.
