The effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations (SICs) of netilmicin on bacterial hydrophobicity and adhesiveness to conjunctival cells was investigated. One strain each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis was investigated for its susceptibility to netilmicin, its adherence to conjunctival cells and to the effect of hydrocarbon hexadecane before and after treatment with SIC of netilmicin. All of the bacteria tested were susceptible to netilmicin except for Pseudomonas spp. which showed intermediate resistance. Netilmicin-treated Pseudomonas strains exhibited a lower level of hydrophobicity towards n-hexadecane compared with non-treated strains, while netilmicin-treated S. epidermidis and S. aureus showed a slight increase of hydrophobicity. Adherence of the two Pseudomonas strains to conjunctival cells was significantly reduced after growth in the presence of netilmicin, while the adherence of the two staphylococci was only slightly reduced.
