The microbicidal activity of four different biocides was studied in synthetic metalworking fluid (MWF) against Mycobacterium immunogenum, a suspected causative agent for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, a representative for the predominant gram-negative bacterial contaminants of MWF. The results indicated that M. immunogenum is more resistant than P. fluorescens to the tested formaldehyde-releasing biocides (Grotan and Bioban), isothiazolone (Kathon), and phenolic biocide (Preventol). Kathon was effective against mycobacteria at lower concentrations than the other three test biocides in MWF. In general, there was a marked increase in biocidal resistance of both the test organisms when present in MWF matrix compared to saline. Increased resistance of the two test organisms to biocides was observed when they were in a mixed suspension (1:1 ratio). The results indicate the protective effect of the MWF matrix against the action of commonly used biocides on the MWF-colonizing microbial species of occupational health significance, including mycobacteria.
