OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women attended in Family Medicine Units of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social and to determine the in vitro sensitivity rate of the microorganisms to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin and amikacin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out an observational, prospective and transversal study at Family Medicine Units 62 and 64 of the Mexico State Delegation, located in the urban area of Mexico City. Women with lesser than 32 weeks of pregnancy without urinary tract symptoms were included. Urine culture of a midstream urine specimen with > or = 10(5) colony forming units/mL urine of an only germen was used as the gold standard. The in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity was established according to the Bauer Kirby technique. RESULTS: 874 pregnant women were included and 73 had a positive urine culture, with a frequency of 8.4%, IC 95% = 6.6 - 10.2%, of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Escherichia coil was the most frequent isolated agent (77%). In vitro sensitivity to ampicillin of the microorganisms isolated was of 27%, IC 95% = 16 - 38%; to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole of 40%, IC95% = 29 - 51%; to amikacin of 68%, IC 95% = 57 - 79%, and to nitrofurantoin of 79%, IC 95% = 70 - 88%. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of asymptomatic bacteriuria in the studied population is similar to the reported by the literature. The in vitro sensitivity rates of E. coil to ampicillin and to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are very low. The best sensitivity corresponded to the nitrofurantoin. The treatment of the asymptomatic bacteriuria must be based on the local patterns of antimicrobial sensitivity and resistance.
