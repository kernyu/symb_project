Two novel putative Escherichia coli virulence genes, iha and iroN from E. coli (iroN(E. coli)), were detected in 55 and 39%, respectively, of 67 E. coli isolates from patients with urosepsis. iha and iroN(E. coli) exhibited divergent associations with other putative virulence genes, phylogenetic markers, host characteristics, and antimicrobial resistance.
