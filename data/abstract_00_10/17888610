This study evaluated the antimicrobial resistance profile of outpatient urinary Escherichia coli isolated from women obtained throughout Hong Kong during 2004-2005. Of 1067 single patient isolates analyzed, 60.1% were resistant to ampicillin, 34% were resistant to co-trimoxazole, and 22.1% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Thirty-four (6.6%) of 519 isolates in 2004 and 55 (10%) of 548 isolates in 2005 were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers with a CTX-M phenotype. Rates of non-beta-lactam resistance and ESBL production were strongly influenced by patient age. The age-stratified rates for dual co-trimoxazole and ciprofloxacin resistance and for ESBL production were 10.9% and 7.6% in women aged 18-35 years, 13% and 6.9% in women aged 36-50 years, 20.4% and 8.8% in women aged 51-64 years, and 23.7% and 11.8% in women aged > or =65 years, respectively. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin remain active against >90% of the isolates, irrespective of the resistance phenotypes for other drugs. Our results documented the emergence of problematic resistance phenotypes among community urinary E. coli and highlight the need to explore strategies for their containment.
