We investigated the dynamics of the activity of the polygalacturonidase inhibitor protein (PGIP) in apple fruits of six varieties differing in ripening time and correlated it with the degree of damage by the causative agent of fruit rot, Monilia fructigena. The apple varieties studied differed significantly in PGIP activity and degree of damage by Monilia fructigena. The rate of dissemination over fruit tissues was inversely related to PGIP activity. The resistance of apples to M. fructigena increased with ripening. The simultaneous increase in PGIP activity suggests its important role in the reduction of apple damage by fruit rot.
