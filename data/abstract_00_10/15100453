The susceptibility of 20 isolates of Plasmodium vivax on the Thailand-Myanmar border to seven antimalarial drugs was evaluated using the schizont maturation inhibition technique. The geometric mean 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) values were quinine = 308 ng/mL, amodiaquine =14 ng/mL, chloroquine =50 ng/mL, mefloquine = 127 ng/mL, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (80:1) = 800/10 ng/mL, pyrimethamine = 8 ng/mL, and artesunate = 0.5 ng/mL. Compared with P. falciparum in this area, P. vivax was more sensitive to chloroquine and artesunate, equally sensitive to quinine, and more resistant to mefloquine.
