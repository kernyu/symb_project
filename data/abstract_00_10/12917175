PURPOSE: To investigate clinical settings, treatment strategies, and visual acuity outcomes of endophthalmitis caused by Enterococcus faecalis and to determine antibiotic sensitivity and resistance patterns. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Records were reviewed of all patients with culture-positive endophthalmitis caused by E. faecalis evaluated at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2001. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associated prior surgical procedures, clinical features, treatments administered, antibiotic sensitivity and resistance patterns, and final visual outcomes. RESULTS: Endophthalmitis caused by E. faecalis was identified in 29 eyes of 29 patients. The mean follow-up was 17.8 months (range, 0.1-86.7 months). Endophthalmitis caused by E. faecalis was associated with, in order of decreasing frequency, cataract surgery in 12 of 29 eyes (41.4%), trabeculectomy in 8 of 29 eyes (27.6%), penetrating keratoplasty in 4 of 29 eyes (13.8%), combined cataract and trabeculectomy in 3 of 29 eyes (10.3%), seton implantation in 1 of 29 eyes (3.5%), and pupilloplasty in 1 of 29 eyes (3.5%). Resistance patterns among the isolates were the following: vancomycin in 0 of 23 eyes (0.0%), linezolid in 0 of 29 eyes (0.0%), ciprofloxacin in 1 of 14 eyes (7.1%), gentamicin (minimum inhibitory concentration >8 mg/l) in 8 of 16 eyes (50.0%), high-level gentamicin (minimum inhibitory concentration >500 mg/l) in 5 of 29 eyes (17.2%), cefazolin in 7 of 8 eyes (87.5%), and quinupristin and dalfopristin in 29 of 29 eyes (100.0%). Preinfection baseline visual acuities ranged from 20/30 to hand motions. Visual acuities on presentation with endophthalmitis ranged from 2/200 to no light perception. Final visual acuity was better than or equal to 20/50 in two cases (6.9%), 20/60 to 20/400 in three cases (10.3%), 5/200 to hand motions in 10 cases (34.5%), and light perception to no light perception in 14 cases (48.3%). CONCLUSIONS: E. faecalis often is resistant to gentamicin and cephalosporins but was sensitive to vancomycin in all isolates tested. Endophthalmitis caused by E. faecalis usually is associated with poor visual outcomes.
