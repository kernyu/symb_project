We previously documented the induction of Leishmania amastigote apoptosis by trivalent antimony (SbIII) and nitric oxide (NO). We demonstrate here that SbIII-resistant amastigotes were resistant to NO toxicity when delivered extracellularly by NO donors or intracellularly via macrophage activation. Shared biochemical targets for SbIII and NO resistance in Leishmania are discussed.
