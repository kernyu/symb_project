We show that genomic hybridization allows detection of a spontaneous secondary deletion of 126 genes that occurred during construction of an Escherichia coli ytfE mutant, LMS4209, explaining some of its unexpected growth defects. We confirm that YtfE is required to repair damage to iron-sulfur centres and for hydrogen peroxide resistance.
