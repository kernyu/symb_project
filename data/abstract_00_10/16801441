The CR1 element defined by an orf513 gene encoding a putative recombinase and a recombination crossover site has been identified upstream of several antibiotic resistance genes in Enterobacteriaceae. This CR1 element was shown to bring promoter sequences that play a role in the expression of unrelated antibiotic resistance genes.
