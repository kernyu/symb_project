These evidence-based guidelines have been produced after a literature review of the treatment and prophylaxis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The guidelines were further informed by antibiotic susceptibility data on MRSA from the UK. Recommendations are given for the treatment of common infections caused by MRSA, elimination of MRSA from carriage sites and prophylaxis of surgical site infection. There are several antibiotics currently available that are suitable for use in the management of this problem and potentially useful new agents are continuing to emerge.
