BACKGROUND: A 24-year-old female patient was diagnosed with classic Hodgkin's lymphoma in clinical stage II, and combination chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy was initiated. During the following 5 years, the disease progressed despite several standard therapeutic approaches, including autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: Lenalidomide (25 mg daily) treatment was then initiated in a continuous dosing schedule. Positron emission tomography scans were performed before and during lenalidomide treatment. Hematologic and laboratory values, as well as physical condition were also assessed before and during lenalidomide treatment. RESULTS: Four months after continuous lenalidomide treatment, tumor load was significantly reduced, B symptoms had resolved, and the patient's physical condition had improved, allowing her to resume normal daily-living activities. Evaluations after 15 months of lenalidomide treatment indicated limited disease progression. Nevertheless, the patient was feeling well and maintaining a normal active life. Treatment was well tolerated, allowing the patient to remain on continuous dosing, which has now been maintained for 18 months. CONCLUSION: Daily, long-term lenalidomide treatment provided clinical benefit and was well tolerated in a patient with relapsed, advanced classic Hodgkin's lymphoma.
