OBJECTIVES: To investigate phenotypically and genotypically the presence of MDR efflux pumps in 21 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus collected over a period of 10 years. METHODS: MICs of different antibiotics and biocides were determined by the broth dilution method in the presence/absence of carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an efflux pump inhibitor. PCR followed by sequencing was performed to detect the qac genes that encode for antiseptic resistance. Clonal relationships were determined by PFGE SmaI patterns using a standard protocol. RESULTS: All the isolates were resistant to gentamicin, 15 to erythromycin, 18 to ciprofloxacin, 7 to chloramphenicol and 1 to tetracycline. They showed higher susceptibility to antibiotics when they were exposed to CCCP. The MICs of ethidium bromide, SDS and benzalkonium chloride were also decreased, whereas the MIC of triclosan was decreased in only four isolates in the presence CCCP. Of the 21 isolates, qacA/B was detected in 5 isolates, smr in all of the isolates, qacG in 11 isolates, qacH in 10 isolates and qacJ in 4 isolates. PFGE analysis of the 21 isolates clustered them into 14 clones at 90% similarity corresponding to differences of between 7 and 16 bands among the clones. CONCLUSIONS: The efflux mechanism seems to be an important mechanism to confer resistance to antibiotics and biocides through MDR pumps. It was observed that several qac genes coexist in some of the isolates and seem to act simultaneously in the removal of different compounds out of the bacterial cell. The qac genes are horizontally spread among different clones.
