The objectives of this study were to determine the distribution of Klebsiella species and phylogenetic groups in animal clinical samples and to determine the levels of antimicrobial resistance of animal Klebsiella clinical isolates. One hundred Klebsiella veterinary clinical isolates were identified using gyrA PCR-RFLP and rpoB gene sequencing as a confirmatory method. Klebsiella pneumoniae phylogenetic group KpI was dominant (78 isolates), but KpII, KpIII (K. variicola), K. oxytoca, K. planticola and K. terrigena were also represented. The relative frequencies in animal infections of Klebsiella species and phylogenetic groups were similar to those observed in human nosocomial infections, suggesting that similar ecological and molecular factors cause Klebsiella infections in both situations. Resistance was common against ampicillin (99%) and cephalexin (43%) but not against ceftazidime, ceftiofur, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Thirteen isolates resistant to three or more antimicrobials or combinations thereof were found, but acquired antimicrobial resistance remains lower among animal isolates than among human nosocomial isolates.
