In a survey of 541 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from 44 hospitals in Taiwan, three distinct populations were identified by the disk diffusion method according to the disribution of zone diameters of ciprofloxacin. Isolates with resistant, reduced-susceptible, and susceptible to fluoroquinolone were defined as CIP zone diameters of < or = 15 mm, 16-26 mm, and > or = 27 mm, respectively. Thus, in addition to 38 (7%) resistant isolates, there were 30 (5.5%) reduced-susceptible isolates and 473 (87.5%) susceptible isolates. A total of 34 isolates consisting of nine resistant, 13 reduced-susceptible, and 12 susceptible isolates were assessed for point mutations in gyrA and parC and the outer membrane profiles. The susceptibility to fluoroquinolone of 13 reduced-susceptible isolates was not altered in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an efflux inhibitor, showing that efflux is not a major contributor to reduced susceptibility. In addition to single mutation in gyrA, OmpK35 porin loss can also be the first step for developing fluoroquinolone resistance. No strain possesses a parC mutation without the simultaneous presence of a gyrA mutation, suggesting that mutations in parC play a complementary role for higher-level of fluoroquinolone resistance and fluoroquinolone resistance is a multistep process.
