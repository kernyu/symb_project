In this study, we evaluated the current effectiveness of 11 beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections by determining the antimicrobial susceptibility of the major pathogens. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans streptococci (n = 47), Peptostreptococcus (n = 67), Porphyromonas (n = 18), Fusobacterium (n = 57), black-pigmented Prevotella (n = 59) and non-pigmented Prevotella (n = 47) isolated from pus specimens of 93 orofacial odontogenic infections to penicillin G, cefmetazole, flomoxef, cefoperazone, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, cefoselis, imipenem and faropenem were determined using the agar dilution method. Penicillin G, most cephalosporins, imipenem and faropenem worked well against viridans streptococci, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium. Penicillin G and most cephalosporins, including fourth-generation agents, were not effective against beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella, though they were effective against beta-lactamase-negative strains. Cefmetazole, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and faropenem expressed powerful antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella. In conclusion, penicillins have the potential to be first-line agents in the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections. Most of the other beta-lactam antibiotics, including fourth-generation cephalosporins, were not found to have greater effectiveness than penicillins. In contrast, cefmetazole, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and faropenem were found to have greater effectiveness than penicillins.
