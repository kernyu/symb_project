Combined effects of mild temperatures, acidification and nisin on the thermal resistance of Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 11437 spores were assessed. Inoculated carrot-alginate particles were used as a solid-food model for the validation of the spore inactivation during the flow of a solid-liquid food system through the holding tube of an aseptic processing unit. Inactivation kinetics was studied in a water bath with the spores inoculated into carrot-alginate particles and in Sorensen's phosphate buffer. For temperatures of 70-90 degrees C, D-values in the buffer were 24.9-5.7 min, much lower than those evaluated for the particles (115.1-22.2 min). Statistical analyses showed significant synergistic effects of temperature and pH on spore inactivation for both media. Acidification reduced the heat resistance of the spores by reducing the D-values. Nisin was not significantly effective at the lower concentrations (up to 750 IU/g). The combination of 90 degrees C, pH: 4.5 and 500IU/g nisin resulted in a ten-fold decrease of the D-value for spores inoculated in the particles (from 111.1 to 10.6 min). Microbial validation tests were conducted using a pilot-scale aseptic processing unit with a mixture of carrot cubes (10%) and carrier liquid of 2%-carboxymethylcellulose solution (90%). Spore-inoculated carrot-alginate particles (initial counts of 106 CFU/g, obtained after come-up-time pre-heat) with pH 3.5 and 2000 IU/g nisin were processed at 90 degrees C in the aseptic processing unit. Microbial analysis showed no spore survivors in the particles after passing through the holding tube (5.2-6.0 min of residence time). The proposed combination of these hurdles significantly enhanced the spore inactivation rate (D(90)=1.17 min) as compared to that for thermal treatment only (D(90)=19.6 min).
