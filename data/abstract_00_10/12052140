The emergence of antibiotic resistance and multi-drug resistance in bacterial pathogens underscores the need for the development of novel classes of antibiotics. The availability of complete genome sequence data from many important human pathogens provides a wealth of fundamental information. This allows us to define each gene and thus to better understand molecular pathogenesis. New techniques have enabled the identification and characterization of genes that are critical for bacterial growth and survival during infection. The combination of genome sequence data and new technologies make it possible to systematically explore the function of each open reading frame in a genome and identify any potential molecular targets for drug discovery. With particular emphasis on antibacterial therapy, this review discusses genome-based technologies and their important applications to anti-infective drug discovery.
