Fish resistance to microorganisms depends basically on the immune response. Although there are several studies on the diazinon mammalian immunotoxicity, in the case of fish there are only few. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of diazinon on immunological parameters (relative spleen weight, splenocytes count, lysozyme activity, respiratory burst and IgM concentration) in Nile tilapia. Diazinon at sublethal concentrations (0.39 and 0.78 mg/L) did not alter RSW, splenocytes count or lysozyme activity. However, at the highest concentration tested (1.96 mg/L) diazinon significantly increased respiratory burst and IgM concentration. In summary, diazinon (and perhaps other pesticides) could alter immunological response and induce oxidative stress.
