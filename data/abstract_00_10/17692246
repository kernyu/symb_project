Since the discovery of antibiotics, it has been generally believed that these antimicrobials are capable of curing almost all bacterial infections. More recently, the appearance of increasing resistance to antibiotics and the emergence of multiresistant microorganisms have given rise to growing concern among physicians, and that concern has now started to filter through to society in general. The problem is further aggravated by a situation that not many people are currently aware of, that is, the limited prospects for future development of new antibiotics in the short to medium term. Appropriate use of available antibiotics based on a thorough understanding of their in vivo activity and the emergence of new forms of administration, such as inhalers, may help to alleviate the problem.
