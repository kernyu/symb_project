Enterococci cause serious illness in immunocompromised patients and severely ill, hospitalized patients. Resistance to vancomycin has increased in frequency during the past few years. Limited therapeutic options are available for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections and the optimum therapy has not been established. We report a case of nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis in the setting of hyperinfection with Strongyloides stercoralis that was successfully treated with linezolid. We also review the previously reported cases of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium meningitis.
