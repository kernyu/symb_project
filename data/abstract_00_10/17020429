The treatment of community uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs) mandates that treatment should be based on careful consideration of infection attributes and patient characteristics, particularly in this era of community-acquired MRSA as an emerging pathogen. However, as most uSSSIs in the community continue to be caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or streptococci, effective treatment against these key pathogens should aim to achieve prompt eradication, along with minimal risk of antimicrobial resistance. Cephalosporins are an effective broad-spectrum empirical treatment for uSSSIs, with considerable activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. In addition, the use of antimicrobial agents in infective strains that may be resistant does not appear to be associated with adverse patient-reported outcomes, suggesting that cephalosporins may still be effective in treating community-acquired MRSA-associated SSSIs.
