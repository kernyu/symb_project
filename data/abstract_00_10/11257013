Although changing patterns in antimicrobial resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae have prompted several surveillance initiatives in recent years, the frequency with which these studies are needed has not been addressed. To approach this issue, the extent to which resistance patterns change over a 1-year period was examined. In this study we analyzed S. pneumoniae antimicrobial susceptibility results produced in our laboratory with isolates obtained over 2 consecutive years (1997-1998 and 1998-1999) from the same 96 institutions distributed throughout the United States. Comparison of results revealed increases in resistant percentages for all antimicrobial agents studied except vancomycin. For four of the agents tested (penicillin, cefuroxime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and levofloxacin), the increases were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Resistance to the fluoroquinolone remained low in both years (0.1 and 0.6%, respectively); in contrast, resistance to macrolides was consistently greater than 20%, and resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased from 13.3 to 27.3%. Multidrug resistance, concurrent resistance to three or more antimicrobials of different chemical classes, also increased significantly between years, from 5.9 to 11%. The most prevalent phenotype was resistance to penicillin, azithromycin (representative macrolide), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Multidrug-resistant phenotypes that included fluoroquinolone resistance were uncommon; however, two phenotypes that included fluoroquinolone resistance not found in 1997-1998 were encountered in 1998-1999. This longitudinal surveillance study of resistance in S. pneumoniae revealed that significant changes do occur in just a single year and supports the need for surveillance at least on an annual basis, if not continuously.
