Vaccination of guinea pigs with Mycobacterium bovis BCG confers partial resistance against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Induction of immunity is associated with a strong T cell response. The reactions of the cytotoxic and helper T lymphocyte subsets after BCG vaccination were analyzed by cytofluorometry and in functional tests. The relative number of CD8(+) T cells in the spleen increased substantially after injection of BCG. In vitro restimulation after immunization induced a strong proliferative response but no cytotoxic reactions of CD8(+) T cells against BCG-infected macrophages. A specific induction of IFN-gamma and RANTES mRNA was observed after vaccination particularly in CD8(+) but not in CD4(+) T cells of the lymph nodes.
