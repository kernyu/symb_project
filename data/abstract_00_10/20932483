In 2007, nearly 7000 new cases of HIV infection occurred each day. There is a constant increase in the proportion of women newly infected with HIV in the global population; this increase is particularly high in some areas of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa. Microbicides are products that are being developed to empower women against HIV. First- and second-generation microbicides are broad-spectrum products that include surface active agents, vaginal defense enhancers, and blocking agents. Third-generation microbicides are HIV-specific and include replication and entry inhibitors formulated as gels or as vaginal rings. However, there is a concern that antiretroviral-based microbicides could lead to drug resistance if they are used by HIV-positive women who are unaware of their HIV status. To reach the highest number of women possible, microbicides should be available over-the-counter, which might not be the case with antiretroviral-based formulations. In contrast, non-antiretroviral-based microbicides will have the advantage of being initiated and controlled by women themselves and they will not jeopardize the use of life-saving drugs.
