In order to investigate the origin of tetracycline resistance in Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, conjugative transpositions of Tn916 were tested. The frequency of transfer between strains of E. rhusiopathiae was about 10-fold higher than that between Enterococcus faecalis and E. rhusiopathiae. In addition, detection of a Tn916-like transposon was performed by PCR assay and DNA sequencing in E. rhusiopathiae field isolates. Of 49 tetracycline-resistant isolates, 38 (77.6 %) carried a Tn916-like transposon, while 11 (22.4 %) carried tet(M) only. These results suggested that Tn916-like transposon may be widely present in the E. rhsuiopathiae field isolates resistant to tetracycline.
