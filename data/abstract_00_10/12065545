Resistance to reactive oxygen intermediates and reactive nitrogen intermediates in vitro of a clinical isolate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (CDC1551) that caused a large outbreak of tuberculosis was compared to that of M. tuberculosis strains CB3.3, H37Rv, H37Ra, Erdman, RJ2E, C.C. 13, and C.C. 22 as well as M. bovis strains Ravenel and BCG. CDC1551 and CB3.3 were significantly more resistant to both hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and acidified sodium nitrite than were the other strains tested. This biological phenotype may serve as an in vitro marker for clinical strains of M. tuberculosis likely to cause a large outbreak of tuberculosis.
