Our aim was to use a conformational analysis technique developed for peptides to identify structural relationships between bacterial cell wall peptides and beta-lactam antibiotics that might help to explain their different actions as substrates and inhibitors of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). The conformational forms of the model cell wall peptide Ac-L-Lys(Ac)-D-Ala-D-Ala are described by just a few backbone torsion combinations: three C-terminal carboxylate regions, with Tor8 (psi(i+1)) ranges of D3 region (50 degrees to 70 degrees ), D6 region (140 degrees to 170 degrees ) and D9 region (-50 degrees to -70 degrees ) are combined with either of two Tor6 (phi(i))-Tor4 (psi(i)) combinations, C4 region (-50 degrees to -80 degrees ) with B8 region (-40 degrees to -70 degrees ) or C11 region (30 degrees to 50 degrees ) with B2 region (30 degrees to 70 degrees ). From these results, and comparisons with conformational analyses of various beta-lactams and Ac-L-Lys(Ac)-D-Ala-D-Lac, it is concluded that molecular recognition of cell wall peptide substrates by PBPs requires conformers with backbone torsion angles of D3C4B8. beta-Lactam antibiotics are constrained compounds with fewer conformational forms; these match well the backbone torsions of cell wall peptides at D3C4, allowing their recognition and acylation by PBPs, whereas their unique Tor4 produces differently orientated CO and N atoms that appear to prevent subsequent deacylation, leading to their action as suicide substrates. The results are also related to the selective pressures involved in evolution of beta-lactamases from PBPs. From analysis of conformers of Ac-L-Lys(Ac)-D-Ala-D-Ala and the vancomycin-resistant analogue Ac-L-Lys(Ac)-D-Ala-D-Lac, it is concluded that vancomycin may recognise D6C11B2 conformers, giving it complementary substrate specificity to PBPs. This approach could have applications in the rational design of antibiotics targeted against PBPs and their substrates.
