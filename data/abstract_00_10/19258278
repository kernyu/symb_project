The essential oil of Helichrysum italicum significantly reduces the multidrug resistance of Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Combinations of the two most active fractions of the essential oil with each other or with phenylalanine arginine beta-naphthylamide yield synergistic activity. Geraniol, a component of one fraction, significantly increased the efficacy of beta-lactams, quinolones, and chloramphenicol.
