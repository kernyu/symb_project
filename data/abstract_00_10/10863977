Lactacystin (LC) is a specific inhibitor of the proteasome, and has recently been shown to induce apoptosis in certain cell lines. In the present study, we established Fas-resistant adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cell subclones RSO4 and RST1 from their parental Fas-sensitive cell lines SO4 and ST1, and examined whether LC can overcome Fas resistance. LC completely inhibited proteasome function as determined by a peptidyl-MCA substrate (LLVY-MCA and LLE-MCA), and induced apoptosis in these cell lines irrespective of Fas sensitivity at low concentrations (approximately 10 microM). LC induced the activation of caspase 3 (CPP32/Yama) and caspase 6 proteases in an identical manner to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, LC induced the activation of caspase 8 (FLICE) protease, which is the initiator of the Fas-mediated apoptotic cascade. Synthesized proteasome inhibitory peptide MG-115 (ZLLnV-CHO) also induced apoptosis in these cell lines. These results indicated that proteasome inhibitors overcome Fas-resistance by bypassing the proximal part of the Fas signal. Inhibition of the proteasome function may be a new strategy for the treatment of ATL.
