Cefditoren is a third-generation oral cephalosporin with good activity against respiratory tract pathogens, including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing strains of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Its bacterial activity, measured by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), is similar or superior to that of many other commonly used antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones). Considering the target attainment of T > MIC of >or= 40% a more reliable predictor of clinical and microbiologic outcomes, cefditoren covers strains of S. pneumoniae with MIC values <or= 0.5 microg/mL and <or= 1 microg/mL in the case of doses of 200 mg and 400 mg, respectively, and all strains of H. influenzae. Cefditoren has been associated with high rates of bacteriologic response among the main causative pathogens in lower respiratory tract infection ( approximately 85% against H. influenzae and approximately 90% against S. pneumoniae, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant strains). It is a reliable option for switch therapy in case of treatment with third-generation intravenous cephalosporin. Cefditoren is currently approved in Spain for the treatment of adults and adolescents with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), two of the lower respiratory tract infections most commonly encountered in clinical practice.
