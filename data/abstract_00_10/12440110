The nosocomial infection surveillance is regarded as an important modality of nosocomial infection control. In United State the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance(NNIS) System was established in 1970 by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) to create a national nosocomial infections database. The database is used to describe the epidemiology of nosocomial infections, to describe antimicrobial resistance trends, and to produce nosocomial infection rates to use for comparison purposes. In Japan Japanese Nosocomial Infection Surveillance(JNIS) System was made in 1999 by the Japanese Society of Environmental Infections as a modified version of NNIS system. SSI surveillance is mainly performed using JNIS system. SSI surveillance is going to be performed under the guidance of the Ministry of Welfare and Labor.
