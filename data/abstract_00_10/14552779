Synthesis and evaluation of the activity of a new family of 1,4-bis(3-aminopropyl)piperazine derivatives against a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum, and as inhibitors of beta-hematin formation, are described. The highest antimalarial activities were obtained for compounds displaying the highest predicted vacuolar accumulation ratios and the best potencies as inhibitors of beta-hematin formation. The most potent compound displayed an activity 3-fold better than chloroquine for a comparable selectivity index upon MRC-5 cells. Therefore, in this series, the replacement of the 7-chloroquinoline group can constitute a strong rationale for further investigation.
