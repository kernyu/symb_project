In this study we designed two pairs of probes for the detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis with real-time PCR procedures. One pair of probes spans the region between codon 510 and 528 of the rpoB gene, and the other one screens for mutation at the regulatory region of the inhA gene. We have evaluated these probes in combination with two other pairs of probes previously described to detect mutations in 20 susceptible and 53 unique resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates. We were able to detect nine different mutations affecting five codons of the rpoB gene, two different mutations at codon 315 of the katG gene and a nucleotide substitution (C209T) in the regulatory region of the inhA gene within two hours turnaround.
