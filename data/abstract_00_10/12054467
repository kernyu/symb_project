Na(+)-translocating NADH-quinone reductase (NQR) from the marine Vibrio alginolyticus is strongly inhibited by a new antibiotic korormicin. Korormicin specifically inhibits the Na(+)-dependent reaction of the NQR complex and acts as a purely non-competitive inhibitor for Q-1 with the inhibitor constant of 82 pM. Korormicin-resistant mutants were isolated from V. alginolyticus and the NQR complex was purified from a mutant KR2. Similar to 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO), korormicin acted as a purely noncompetitive inhibitor to the NQR complex from the mutant KR2, but the inhibitor constant increased to 8 microM, which is 10(5)-fold higher than that of the wild-type NQR complex. The inhibitor constant of HQNO, however, was only slightly affected by the acquisition of korormicin resistance. The spontaneous mutation was caused by a single mutation of G-422 to T-422 in the nucleotide sequence of the nqrB gene, which resulted in the conversion of Gly-140 to Val-140. Thus, Gly-140 seems to play an important role for the binding of korormicin to the NqrB subunit. The fact that korormicin is a purely noncompetitive inhibitor for Q-1 strongly supports the presence of one of Q-1 binding sites in the NqrB subunit, which also has a covalently bound FMN at Thr-235.
