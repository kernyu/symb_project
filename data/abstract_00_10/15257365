CONTEXT: Helicobacter pylori eradication has become the standard treatment for peptic ulcer disease. Triple therapy with omeprazole plus two antibiotics has been used. Due to the lack of ideal treatment and the high rates of primary resistance to nitroimidazoles, the use of clarithromycin has been adopted. OBJECTIVE: To determine the Helicobacter pylori eradication rates using lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin for seven days, in patients with peptic ulcer disease in a well developed urban area in Brazil. METHODS: This was a retrospective, open-label study carried out at the School of Medicine of the Fundacao ABC. It included 130 patients with peptic ulcer disease (upper endoscopy) who had been tested positive for Helicobacter pylori infection (urease test, histology or breath test), without previous treatment. Patients were treated with lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1,000 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., for seven days. Eradication was verified after 90 days. RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 94 patients. Their mean age was 52.23 years; 51.54% were woman, 84.31% white, 37.69% smokers, 20.77% using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 8.46% alcoholics. Upper endoscopy revealed that 78.46% had duodenal ulcers and 21.53% had gastric ulcers (a 4:1 DU:GU ratio). The eradication rates were 85.11% per protocol and 61.54% by intention to treat; 97% had no adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Triple therapy using lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin is well tolerated with high eradication rates and forms a good alternative for developing countries.
