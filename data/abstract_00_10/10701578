The genetic differences between Schistosoma mansoni strains from different geographic areas that were reportedly resistant or sensitive to anti-schistosomal drugs were studied with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Of the 20 RAPD primers we chose, 19 showed the capacity to produce a medium to high level of amplification and 6 revealed difference PCR bands between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains. One particular primer, 5'-CAGCGACAAG-3', showed 2 major difference bands between praziquantel (PZQ)-resistant and PZQ-sensitive strains from the endemic area of Egypt. These results demonstrate that defined sequence primers could be applied as a useful tool for differentiating drug-resistant and -sensitive schistosome parasites in the field.
