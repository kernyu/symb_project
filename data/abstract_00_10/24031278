Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to public health worldwide and is associated with higher mortality and morbidity. Despite the extensive knowledge about this problem, drug resistance has continued to emerge, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequencies of epidemiologically relevant resistance phenotypes in pathogens isolated from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bloodstream infections (BSI) and urinary tract infections (UTI) in patients admitted in the adult intensive care unit (AICU) of the Clinical Hospital of Federal University of Uberlandia, during an one year period. Additionally, at the period of the study, the antibiotic consumption in AICU was verified. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus were the main agents of BSI (43.9%), with 60.0% of oxacilin-resistance for both microorganisms, Klebsiella-Enterobacter group predominated in UTI (23.4%), with resistance to third generation cephalosporins in 58.0% of the isolates; and, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in VAP (42.0%), with 72.0% of resistance to imipenem. Cephalosporins (49.6%), vancomycin (37.4%) and carbapenems (26.6%) were the most prescribed antibiotics in the unit. The comparison of the results with a publication of the NNIS program evidenced a worse situation in the studied hospital, mainly between Gram-negative, that had surpassed the percentile 90% elaborated by that system. Based on these results a reconsideration on the empirical use of antibiotics and on prevention and control of nosocomial infections practices is recommended.
