Competition assays with Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 and its GFP-labelled pSymA cured and deleted derivatives, SmA818 and SmA146, demonstrated that Sm1021 could still inhibit rice seedling growth even when outnumbered by a large excess of the noninhibitory cured or deleted strain. The wild-type strain Sm1021 also inhibited the growth of its noninhibitory pSymA-cured strain SmA818(gfp) and its pSymA-deleted strain SmA146(gfp) in a manner suggesting that Sm1021 produced a bacteriocin-like substance. The production of, and resistance to, this substance seemed to be pSymA-associated, but it was not the cause of killing in competition experiments on rice, suggesting that the killing of SmA818(gfp) and SmA146(gfp) was medium dependent. The addition of agar in liquid F10 medium at concentrations < or = 0.4% (m/v) abolished the rice growth inhibition of strain Sm1021 and Sm1021(gfp). The increased medium viscosity at higher agar concentrations decreased the diffusion of gases and small molecules through the media. Thus, the low agar concentrations may mimic waterlogged soil conditions leading to the production of inhibitory compounds by the bacterial strains under microaerobic conditions.
