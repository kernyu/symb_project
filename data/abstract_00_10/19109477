We report a case of disseminated isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient with evolution of rifampin (rifampicin) resistance in the central nervous system. This was cured with intraventricular and oral treatment but was followed by a late relapse of the original infection in a prosthetic hip joint. We provide drug levels in cerebrospinal fluid and serum.
