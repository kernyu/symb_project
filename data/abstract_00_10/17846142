We describe the structure of a transposon-like element named Tn6001, which contains a bla(VIM-3)-harboring integron In450, which was derived from a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate in Taiwan. The transposon backbone structure is most closely related to those of Tn1404* and Tn1403. Tn6001 was inserted into the chromosome of the clinical isolate.
