Much evidence suggests that apoptosis plays a crucial role in cell population homeostasis that depends on the expression of various genes implicated in the control of cell life and death. The sensitivity of human neuroblastoma cells SK-N-SH to undergo apoptosis induced by thapsigargin was examined. SK-N-SH were previously differentiated into neuronal cells by treatments with retinoic acid (RA), 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity, and staurosporine which decreases PKC activity. Neuronal differentiation was evaluated by gamma-enolase, microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) and synaptophysin immunocytochemistry. The sensitivity of the cells to thapsigargin-induced apoptosis was evaluated by cell viability and nuclear fragmentation (Hoechst 33258) and compared with pro-(Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L)) and anti-apoptotic (Bax, Bak) protein expression of the Bcl-2 family. Cells treated with RA and PMA were more resistant to apoptosis than controls. Conversely, the cells treated with staurosporine were more susceptible to apoptosis. In parallel with morphological modifications, the expression of inhibitors and activators of apoptosis was directly dependent upon the differentiating agent used. Bcl-2 expression was strongly increased by PMA and drastically decreased by staurosporine as was Bcl-x(L) expression. Bax and Bak expression were not significantly modified. These results demonstrate that drugs that modulate PKC activity may induce a modification of Bcl-2 expression as well as resistance to the apoptotic process. Furthermore, the expression of Bcl-2 was reduced by toxin B from Clostridium difficile and, to a lesser extent, by wortmannin suggesting a role of small G-protein RhoA and PtdIns3 kinase in the control of Bcl-2 expression. Our data demonstrate a relationship between the continuous activation of PKC, the expression of Bcl-2 protein family and the resistance of differentiated SK-N-SH to apoptosis.
