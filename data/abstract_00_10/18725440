Fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae mainly involves stepwise mutations predominantly in the parC and gyrA genes. We have developed a single-run real-time PCR assay for detection of the four most common mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of these genes. This assay provides a useful tool for both clinical and epidemiological use.
