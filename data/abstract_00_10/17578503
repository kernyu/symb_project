Cyclosporine A (CsA) use is associated with hypertension in most solid-organ transplant recipients. The mechanisms of CsA-induced hypertension have not been fully elucidated and are still controversial. We present a case of CsA-induced hypertension who was anuric and receiving hemodialysis, and in whom noninvasive cardiothoracic bioimpedence revealed elevated systemic vascular resistance without evidence of fluid-volume overload. We briefly discuss the possible mechanisms of CsA-induced hypertension in light of this information.
