A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the cytochrome b gene confers resistance to strobilurin fungicides for several fungal pathogens. Therefore, on the basis of a change at amino acid position 143 from glycine to alanine, a real-time PCR assay was established for the quantitative detection of the analogous SNP in the cytochrome b sequence of Pyrenophora teres Drechsler, which causes barley net blotch. Allelic discrimination was achieved by using allele specific primers with artificially mismatched nucleic acid bases and minor groove binding probes. Validation parameters for the lower limits of the working range, namely limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ), were statistically determined by the variance of calibration data, as well as by the variance of the 100% non-strobilurin-resistant allele DNA sample (blank values). It was found that the detection was limited by the variance of blank values (five in 801 458 copies; 0.0006%), whereas the quantification was limited by the variance of calibration data (37 in 801 458 copies; 0.0046%). The real-time PCR assay was finally used to monitor strobilurin-resistant cytochrome b alleles in barley net blotch field samples, which were already classified in in vivo biotests to be fully sensitive to strobilurins. All signals for strobilurin-resistant cytochrome b alleles were below the LOD, and therefore the results are in total agreement with the phenotypes revealed by biotests.
