We developed a new reporter cell line for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drug susceptibility testing. This cell line was obtained by incorporating the luciferase reporter gene under the control of an HCMV-specific promoter into the genome of astrocytoma cells (U373MG). We then used our reporter cell line to evaluate phenotypic changes conferred by the sequential emergence of HCMV UL54 and UL97 mutations following long-term drug exposure. The laboratory strain AD169 was passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of ganciclovir (one viral line) or foscarnet (two viral lines). Resistant viruses were plaque purified at five different concentrations of ganciclovir and at three different concentrations of foscarnet. In addition to the previously described M460I and L595S UL97 mutations and the L545S and V812L UL54 mutations, exposition to ganciclovir (up to 3,000 microM) resulted in the selection of two unreported UL54 mutations (P829S and D879G). Passages in the presence of foscarnet (up to 3,000 microM) resulted in the selection of seven not previously described UL54 mutations (K500N, T552N, S585A, N757K, L802V, L926V, and L957F) in addition to the N408D mutation that has been associated with ganciclovir and cidofovir resistance. Long-term exposure of HCMV to either ganciclovir or foscarnet ultimately resulted in the selection of multiple UL54 mutations that conferred high levels of resistance to all approved HCMV DNA polymerase inhibitors, i.e., ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet. Emergence of each viral mutation conferred stepwise increases in drug 50% inhibitory concentrations that could be objectively measured with the new reporter cell assay.
