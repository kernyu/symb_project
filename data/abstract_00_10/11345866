Falciparum malaria remains a major killer in developing countries, particularly for African children. Moreover, France is the leading European country in term of incidence of imported malaria. Parasitized erythrocytes, which can form rosettes or auto-agglutinate, are sequestrated in the deep microvasculature and stick to activated endothelium by the mean of various receptors. Activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages induces secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor, which contributes to severe disease. However, the pathophysiology of coma remains poorly understood. In nonimmune adults, besides cerebral malaria, pictures of severe sepsis with shock, acute renal failure and respiratory distress syndrome are common. Although chemotherapy of malaria is challenged by the continuing evolution of antimalarial resistance, quinine remains the first-line drug for severe imported disease. In addition, early symptomatic management in the intensive care unit setting is of paramount importance. Prevention of severe imported malaria lays on prophylactic measures during travel, as well as adequate management of uncomplicated disease after return. In developing countries, early and adequate treatment of uncomplicated disease using cheap alternatives to classical compounds should contribute to "roll back" malaria, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
