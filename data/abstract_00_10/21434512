M. leprae is a more prevalent cause of cutaneous infections as compared M. tuberculosis, though both belong to the same family of organisms; their co-existence is a rare entity in children. It has been suggested that cross-immunity exists between tuberculosis and leprosy with reports of BCG vaccine giving some protection against leprosy. In spite of epidemiological, clinical and microbiological evidences; the exact relationship between tuberculosis and leprosy still remains unclear. It is imperative to rule out coexistence of cutaneous tuberculosis and leprosy as therapy with rifampicin in treatment of leprosy can lead to drug resistance in management of tuberculosis and the use of steroid in leprosy can aggravate cutaneous tuberculosis.
