Using a promoter trap, we have identified 56 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genes preferentially expressed in the mouse lung. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that RNA levels of several genes were higher from bacteria growing in mouse lungs than from broth cultures. These results support the current hypothesis that Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilizes fatty acids as a carbon source in the mouse lung.
