Initiated in 2003 by the European Union, ARBAO-II aims to establish a monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among the veterinary laboratories in all European countries based on validated methodologies. This includes an external quality control system for the most important bacterial pathogens. In 2003 two trials were performed. The first on Salmonella and Escherichia coli involved 31 laboratories in 18 countries and the second on Staphylococcus and Streptococcus included 22 laboratories in 15 countries. For the E. coli strains, 92.8% of the results complied with the reference MICs, for Salmonella 93.7%, for Streptococcus 80.4% and for Staphylococcus 93.1%. Most problems were observed when testing florfenicol (79.2% correct), gentamicin (84.2%) and amoxicillin + cl (84.9%) in E. coli; streptomycin in Salmonella (62.5%); gentamicin (56.7%), lincomycin (71.4%), clindamycin (75.4%), TMP + sulfonamides (75.7%) and chloramphenicol (78.5%) in Streptococcus; erythromycin (81.5%) and oxacillin (78.2.5%) in Staphylococcus. A few laboratories caused most deviations. However, there was no correlation between good performance for one bacterial group and good performance for other groups. This study showed that most laboratories are capable of performing correct susceptibility testing for E. coli and Salmonella, even though performance of some laboratories can be improved, and that some problems exist for Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. This clearly shows the need for continuous harmonisation of methodologies within the EU.
