The glycopeptide antibacterial drugs vancomycin and teicoplanin are widely used in hospitals for therapy of severe or multiresistant Gram-positive infections, notably staphylococcal, enterococcal and rarely pneumococcal. Vancomycin has also been used in the management of Clostridium difficile enteropathy. The incidence and potential for resistance differ between agents. The in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics and clinical use of glycopeptide, as well as epidemiology of glycopeptide resistance are discussed. There are limited comparative studies indicating the need for further investigation. Therapeutic drug monitoring has been widely used for vancomycin and less commonly for teicoplanin, but remains controversial. Advances in our understanding of their pharmacodynamics and clinical studies are helping clarify the situation. This paper reviews the current literature and highlights limitations of glycopeptides in treating Gram-positive infection.
