PURPOSE: A considerable number of chronic hepatitis B (CH-B) patients remain under continuous lamivudine treatment, although switching treatment to entecavir could be beneficial. We investigated the antiviral efficacy of switching treatment to entecavir in CH-B patients without apparent evidence of lamivudine resistance during the preceding lamivudine treatment. METHODS: Forty-four CH-B patients, who underwent lamivudine treatment for more than 6 months and showed no evidence of lamivudine resistance, switched to entecavir. Serial changes in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were correlated with the patients' baseline HBV DNA at the commencement of entecavir administration. The entecavir-resistant substitution was examined by PCR-direct sequencing. The median follow-up period of entecavir treatment was 20 (10-23) months. RESULTS: All 31 patients with baseline HBV DNA <2.6 logcopies/ml maintained HBV DNA-negative status during entecavir treatment. Of seven patients having HBV DNA of 2.6-<4.0 logcopies/ml, all achieved undetectable HBV DNA at the end of follow-up. As for six patients having HBV DNA >or=4.0 logcopies/ml, three patients achieved undetectable HBV DNA, whereas virological breakthrough was observed in one patient at month 15. An entecavir-resistant virus having rtM204V, rtL180M and rtS202G substitutions was detected in this patient. CONCLUSIONS: The lamivudine-to-entecavir switching treatment may be generally recommendable in CH-B patients without evidence of lamivudine resistance during the preceding lamivudine treatment. However, great care should be taken with respect to the emergence of entecavir-resistance, especially in patients who do not respond well to the preceding lamivudine treatment.
