A prospective trial was undertaken to assess the effectiveness and safety of enteral vancomycin in controlling methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in an endemic setting. Over the 49 month period patients aged >14 years were enrolled, following admission to a medical/surgical intensive care unit (ICU) and expected to require ventilation for three days or more. A total of 799 patients were included in the trial. Period one, 1 July 1996-30 April 1997, (N=140), was observational. During period two, 1 May 1997-30 September 1998, (N=258), surveillance samples were obtained. MRSA carriers were isolated and received enteral vancomycin. During period three, 1 October 1998-31 July 2000, (N=400), all ventilated patients were given selective digestive decontamination (SDD) with polymyxin E, tobramycin, amphotericin B and vancomycin and four days of intravenous cefotaxime. The primary endpoints were: (1) incidence of patients with diagnostic samples positive for MRSA acquired on the ICU; (2) incidence of patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in surveillance or diagnostic samples; (3) incidence of patients with samples positive for S. aureus with intermediate sensitivity to glycopeptides (GISA). The incidence of patients with MRSA in diagnostic samples were 31%, 14%, and 2% in periods one, two and three, respectively (P<0.001). There was a VRE outbreak involving 13 patients during period three. VRE disappeared with no change in policy. GISA was not detected. These findings support the effectiveness and safety of enteral vancomycin in the control of MRSA.
