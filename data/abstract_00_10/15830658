Salmonella serotypes are important foodborne pathogens of humans that can be acquired through consumption of contaminated meat and dairy products. Salmonella infection also can be a significant animal health issue. As part of a national study of U.S. dairy operations conducted between March and September 2002, fecal samples were collected from representative cows in 97 dairy herds in 21 states and were cultured to determine the prevalence of Salmonella shedding. Salmonella was recovered from the feces of at least one cow in 30.9% of the herds. Overall, 7.3% of fecal samples were culture positive for Salmonella. The three most frequently recovered serotypes were Salmonella Meleagridis (24.1%), Salmonella Montevideo (11.9%), and Salmonella Typhimurium (9.9%). The susceptibilities of Salmonella isolates recovered were determined using a panel of 16 antimicrobial drugs. Salmonella isolates recovered from dairy cows had relatively little resistance to these antimicrobial agents; 83.0% of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested. This study provides updated information on the prevalence and susceptibility patterns of Salmonella in dairy herds and on cow and herd characteristics. These data contribute to our understanding of the ecology of Salmonella in the dairy farm environment.
