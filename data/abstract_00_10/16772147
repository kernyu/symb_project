Providencia spp. are Gram negative bacteria, belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and are responsible for gastrointestinal disorders both in humans and animals. We report on the isolation of multi-drug resistant Providencia spp. (n=4) from animal manure. The isolates were found to be resistant to clindamycin and to tetracycline, as well as to the macrolide and sulphonamide groups of antibiotics.
