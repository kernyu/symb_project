As we approach the completion of the first 25 years of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, there have been dramatic improvements in the care of patients with HIV infection.

The medications, including their pharmacokinetic properties, side effects, and dosing are reviewed. In addition, the current approach to the use of these medicines is discussed. We have included a section addressing common comorbid conditions including hepatitis B and C along with tuberculosis.
