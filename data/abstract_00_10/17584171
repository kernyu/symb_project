Benzimidazole resistance in thirty isolates of the biocontrol agents was studied with reference to specific mutations in the beta-tubulin genes. Our results suggest that apart from the correlation between specific mutations in the beta-tubulin gene and variation in resistance, the overall ratio of polar and non-polar amino-acids may also play a vital role in conferring benzimidazole resistance to these fungi.
