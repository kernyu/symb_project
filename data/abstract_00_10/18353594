Among orally administered cephalosporins, aminopenicillins (+/- clavulanate), and macrolides, cefditoren was the most potent agent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(50/90), < or =0.008/0.03 microg/mL; 316 isolates including 100 beta-lactamase-positive and 10 beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant [BLNAR]) and was 32-, 64-, and 512-fold more potent than cefdinir, cefuroxime, and cefprozil, respectively. Cefditoren (MIC(50), 0.03 microg/mL) was also > or =32-fold more active against BLNAR phenotypes, although newer macrolides provided complete coverage against these strains. All Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by cefditoren (0.5 microg/mL), including beta-lactamase producers (MIC(50), 0.12 vs < or =0.008 microg/mL). Cefditoren retains potent activity against respiratory tract isolates in the United States, including those with resistance phenotypes.
