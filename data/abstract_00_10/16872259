Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a common nosocomial infection, with significant morbidity and mortality, and represents a major therapeutic challenge to clinicians. The therapeutic approach must be patient-oriented and institution-specific. The specific risk factors of each patient, such as previous antibiotic exposure, underlying diseases, length of hospital stay and the local patterns of antimicrobial resistance, should guide physicians in their decision of the initial optimal empirical therapy. Delays in the initiation or inappropriate/inadequate initial therapy are related to increased mortality and worse outcomes. In responding patients, as soon as culture data are available, efforts should be made to change the initial broad spectrum antibiotic regimen to a more targeted one (de-escalation). The optimal duration of treatment is a matter of debate, but courses longer than 1 week are rarely justified.
