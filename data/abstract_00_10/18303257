Tigecycline is the first clinically available semisynthetic glycylcycline approved for clinical use. This study was done to establish a baseline for ongoing surveillance of tigecycline's activity as this agent's clinical use increases. Against 1,796 Staphylococcus aureus (559 multidrug resistant), tigecycline had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC(90); 0.12 microg/ml) among all agents tested and 99.8% of the isolates were susceptible. For Acinetobacter spp., tigecycline again demonstrated the lowest MIC(90) (2 microg/ml) and the highest percent susceptibility (96.9%). Among Enterobacteriaceae, the 2 most active agents were tigecycline (MIC(90) = 1 microg/ml; 99% susceptible) and imipenem (MIC(90) = 1 microg/ml; 99.5% susceptible). Tigecycline also demonstrated high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes,Haemophilus influenzae and Enterococcus spp. In summary, tigecycline currently exhibits potent activity against a broad array of bacteria species. Given the dynamics of resistance development, careful monitoring of tigecycline activity against these organisms should remain a significant aspect of ongoing surveillance.
