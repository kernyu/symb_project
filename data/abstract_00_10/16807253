OBJECTIVES: To study at the molecular level the heterogeneity of expression of the two chromosomal beta-lactamases, BlaA and BlaB, in Yersinia enterocolitica strains isolated from clinical samples. METHODS: MIC determination by the agar dilution method and beta-lactamase assays was performed to determine the resistance level conferred by these enzymes. DNA cloning, PCR and direct sequencing were used to detect the presence of mutations. RESULTS: The blaA allele from strain IP97 (blaA97) was found to carry a deletion of 51 bp which entirely abolished its beta-lactamase activity. Both the ampR gene and the promoter region of strain Y56 were shown to be functional by a gene swapping experiment. The blaB allele from strain Y56 was found to carry two point mutations, only one of them resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein. This single amino acid change created a practically inactive BlaB or AmpC cephalosporinase in Y. enterocolitica Y56. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of activity observed in the beta-lactamases of some Y. enterocolitica isolates was due to the presence of point mutations or small deletions in the corresponding genes.
