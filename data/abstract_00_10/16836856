OBJECTIVE: To investigate the situation of antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) and Hemophilus influenzae (Hi) clinical isolates from children in Guangzhou area. METHODS: The authors cultured, isolated and identified the Sp and Hi strains from nasopharyngeal secretion of patients who visited Guangzhou Children's Hospital for upper respiratory tract infection between 2003 and 2004. K-B disc diffusion and E-test for antibiotic susceptibility were performed for these clinical isolates. RESULTS: Totally 172 and 484 strains of Sp and Hi were respectively isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions in the hospital. For Sp strains, the rates of resistance to penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefaclor, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMZ/TMP), clindamycin and ofloxacin were 32.0%, 11.1%, 32.6%, 18.1%, 39.5%, 82.6%, 78.5%, 24.4%, 87.2%, 69.2% and 3.1%, respectively. The penicillin non-susceptible Sp (PNSSP) isolates showed higher rates of resistance to other antimicrobial agents such as other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, erythromycin, and SMZ/TMP than those of penicillin susceptible Sp (PSSP) isolates. More than 90% of PNSSP were multidrug resistant strains. The average rate of beta-lactamase production among 484 strains of Hi was 29.5% (143/484). For Hi isolates, the rates of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefaclor, SMZ/TMP, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, azithromycin, and ofloxacin were 40.1%, 3.4%, 4.1%, 1.9%, 5.6%, 56.2%, 52.1%, 17.4%, 2.1%, and 0.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobials resistant Sp and Hi isolated from children with respiratory tract infection in the area have become a severe problem. The rate of resistance to penicillin of Sp had been decreased compared with the last three years, but the rate of resistance to ceftriaxone of Sp increased, and the multidrug resistance rates of PNSSP was rather high. PNSSP was characterized by a multidrug-resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline and SMZ/TMP. beta-lactamase production and ampicillin resistance among the Hi isolates from children in the area had increased generally during the period 2003 - 2004. The Hi isolates were more susceptible to the second and the third generation cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and azithromycin.
