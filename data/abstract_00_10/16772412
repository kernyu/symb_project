The nitrate reductase assay (NRA) was used as an alternative method for detection of resistance to the first-line antituberculous drugs isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin. A total of 320 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were studied and the results compared with the proportion method (PM) on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. The mean time to obtain results was 10 days and the overall agreement between the NRA and PM was 98.8 %. The NRA was easy to perform and represents a useful tool for rapid and accurate determination of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains in low-resource countries.
