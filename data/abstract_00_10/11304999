Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen and is a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae(PRSP) first appeared in the 1970s, and its has been increasing recently worldwide. Penicillin resistance among streptococcal isolates has been rapidly emerged in Japan the last decade, too. Penicillin and beta-lactam resistance due to altered penicillin binding protein was recognized. Resistant strains to other non-beta-lactam drugs, such as the macrolides, clindamycin, minocycline began to increase. Despite the use of appropriate antimicrobial agents, therapeutic failure in-patients with pneumococcal infection were increasing. It will be more important to select antimicrobial agent for PRSP infection, especially in meningitis, where the minimum inhibitory concentration of drug in cerebrospinal fluid may be less than the MIC in the blood. In the future 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine should be used all persons 2 years of age and older who are at risk for serious pneumococcal disease and in all persons 65 years of age and older.
