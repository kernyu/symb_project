BACKGROUND: Contaminated gloves are a major source of transmission of bacteria in the hospital and food industry. We investigated the efficacy of gloves impregnated with a combination of antiseptics consisting of brilliant green dye and chlorhexidine (Gardine). METHODS: Gardine-coated and uncoated 1-cm(2) segments of latex examination and nitrile examination gloves (Spontex, Columbia, TN) were exposed to 1.5 x 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multidrug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, MDR-Acinetobacter baumannii, or Candida albicans as indicated by our brief exposure method. At least 3 glove segments were tested in each group, and growth was scored as mean CFU/cm(2). Segments were dried for various time periods (30 seconds, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour) and streaked face down on agar plates. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C, and growth was quantitated. RESULTS: Gardine-coated latex and nitrile gloves showed significant reduction, an average of 6 logs and 5 logs, respectively, within 30 seconds or 10 minutes when tested against MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, MDR-E coli, MDR-Acientobacter, and C albicans. Complete kill, 8-log reduction, was seen within 30 seconds for MRSA and E coli in both Gardine-coated latex and nitrile gloves. CONCLUSION: Gloves impregnated with Gardine antiseptic dye were highly efficacious in preventing contamination of nosocomial-resistant pathogens on the outer surface of glove and may be useful in the food industry or clinical setting.
