OBJECTIVE: To develop a new method, DNA chip, which can be used for rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to RFP. METHODS: Designing probe according to the sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis rpoB gene and fabricating DNA chip. The DNA fragment which contains hot mutation sites of rpoB gene was labelled with cy5 fluorescence and amplified by PCR technique. Then it was hybridized with DNA chip. DNA sequence was used as the control. RESULTS: 14 strains were detected out of 17 randomly selected Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to RFP using DNA chip. The efficiency was 83%. A little bit DNA in the sick sputa was sufficient for drug resistance detection without being incubated. CONCLUSION: It showed higher specialty and sensitivity using DNA chip to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to RFP. This method was rapid and accurate and could be used for clinical detection of RFP-resistant strains.
