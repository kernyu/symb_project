Anidulafungin is a new echinocandin that acts by inhibiting (1,3)-beta-D-glucan synthesis in the fungal cell wall. This agent is a semisynthetic lipopeptide synthesized from a fermentation product of Aspergillus nidulans. The spectrum of activity of anidulafungin includes Candida and Aspergillus, the two main etiological agents causing invasive fungal infections. This drug is also active against strains of these genera resistant to azoles or amphotericin B. However, anidulafungin is not active against Cryptococcus spp., Trichosporon spp., Fusarium spp. or Mucorales spp. Data on the activity of this drug against other species are limited and do not allow conclusions to be drawn or recommendations to be made. Echinocandin resistance is uncommon and has little clinical relevance.
