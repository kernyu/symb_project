Gemcitabine is a cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) analog with activity in many human tumor systems. We evaluated the drug's activity in resistant or relapsing multiple myeloma. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 was administered as a 30 minute infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. No dose escalations were permitted and dose reductions were scheduled for hematologic toxicity. Twenty-nine eligible patients were entered into Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)-9803. One patient received no treatment and 5 patients had inadequate response assessments. The major toxicity was hematologic with grade 3/4 neutropenia in 9 and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in 15 patients. No responses were seen. Stable disease was confirmed in sixteen patients (57%). Median survival was eight months. Gemcitabine as utilized in this trial has shown little activity and is not to be strongly considered for future multiple myeloma trials.
