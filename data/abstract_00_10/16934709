The implementation of a culture screening-based approach to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has been associated with substantial reduction in the incidence of early-onset group B streptococcal disease. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recognized as an interim strategy awaiting the licensure of a safe and effective conjugate vaccine for prevention of group B streptococcal infections in all susceptible populations. This article addresses concerns relating to antimicrobial resistance among group B streptococci that have arisen from use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and from increases in resistance in other gram-positive bacteria related genetically to group B streptococci.
