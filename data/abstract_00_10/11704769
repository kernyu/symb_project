Ganciclovir is the drug of choice for the treatment of acute cytomegalovirus infections. This antiviral agent is a nucleoside analog of guanine whose activity is dependent upon its intracellular phosphorylation to the triphosphate derivative. Foscarnet is used to treat immunosuppressed patients such as organ transplant recipients and AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus who do not tolerate or develop resistance to ganciclovir. Foscarnet is a pyrophosphate analog that directly inhibits viral DNA polymerase. Resistant isolates have been recovered from immunocompromised patients treated with both anticytomegalovirus compounds. The aims of this study were to prepare a plaque reduction assay to study the in vitro susceptibility of cytomegalovirus to ganciclovir and foscarnet, and to apply it to the knowledge of in vitro susceptibility values of cytomegalovirus isolated from clinical samples. Eighty isolates from patients who had never been treated with ganciclovir or foscarnet were tested for antiviral susceptibility. The plaque reduction assay took 6-8 weeks. The results are expressed as ID(50) (inhibitory dose 50), and the ID(50) values of ganciclovir were between 2.14 and 13.49 microM. The ID(50) for ganciclovir was higher that 12 microM in only two cases (2%). The molecular study of the DNA of these did not show any mutation in the UL97 gene. The ID(50) values of foscarnet were between 46.65 and 460.22 microM. In 78 cases (98%) foscarnet ID(50) was lower than 400 microM. These results were comparable with those obtained by other authors. To summarize, the frequency of cytomegalovirus strains resistant in vitro to ganciclovir and foscarnet in previously untreated patients was low and when it was present it did not involve therapeutic failure since the patients progressed favorably.
