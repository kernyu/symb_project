We have developed a modified migration assay system in 96-well plate format which is able to detect resistance to the macrocyclic lactone group of drugs in Haemonchus contortus. The assay involves exposure of infective stage larvae to drug for a 24 h period, then counting the numbers of larvae that are able to migrate through an agar and filter mesh system over a further 48 h. The agar barrier greatly increased the sensitivity of the assay for resistance detection compared to use of filter mesh alone. The assay was able to detect the presence of 10% resistant worms in an otherwise susceptible background. However, the assay was ineffective with Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Ostertagia circumcincta indicating that its usefulness for field monitoring will be restricted to situations where H. contortus is of most significance. A small-scale drug screening exercise showed that the assay identifies some anthelmintic activities distinct from those identified by larval development assays. The assay therefore also has a potential role in drug discovery programmes in screening for new anthelmintics.
