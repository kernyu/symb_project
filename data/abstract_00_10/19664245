BACKGROUND: There are limited choice of antimicrobial agents to treat infection with metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We evaluate the antimicrobial effects of aztreonam alone, colistin alone and the 3-drug combination of aztreonam, ceftazidime and amikacin on 23 strains of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa by time-killing tests. METHODS: Strains used were from different hospitals in Japan and had different pulse-field gel electrophoresis patterns by restriction with SpeI. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 11 antimicrobial agents (piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, aztreonam, ceftazidime, amikacin, tobramycin, arbekacin, ciprofloxacin and colistin) were determined using the agar dilution test. The effects of aztreonam, colistin and the combination of aztreonam, ceftazidime and amikacin were determined by time-killing studies. RESULTS: Bacteriostatic effects after 6 hours of drug exposure were observed in 12 strains (52.2%) of 23 strains of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa with 48 mg/l aztreonam, in 19 strains (82.6%) with the 3-drug combination of 16 mg/l aztreonam, 16 mg/l ceftazidime, and 4 mg/l amikacin, and in 23 strains (100%) with 2 mg/l colistin. Bactericidal effects after 6 h drug exposure were observed in 1 strain (4.3%) with 48 mg/l aztreonam, in 8 strains (30.4%) with the 3-drug combination and in all 23 strains (100%) with 2 mg/l colistin. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial effects on metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa revealed relatively good effects of the 3-drug combination of aztreonam, ceftazidime and amikacin and marked effects of colistin.
