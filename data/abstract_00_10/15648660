The inhibitive effect of static magnetic field on the activity of lysozyme was studied using acoustic wave impedance analysis technique. Equivalent circuit parameters of piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) were obtained and discussed. The results showed that the activity of lysozyme was inhibited due to the effect of static magnetic field and the inhibitive effect becomes greater with an increase in magnetization time or magnetic field intensity. According to the response characteristics of motional resistance change (deltaR1), which is related to the change in the bacterial number, a quantitative response model reflecting the activity of lysozyme was theoretically derived. By fitting deltaR1 versus time curves under a specific magnetic field intensity but different magnetic time to the model, the relationship between K1 reflecting the activity of lysozyme and magnetic time t(m) was established. Based on the relationship, a new impedance response model that indicates the inhibitive influence of the magnetization time on the activity of lysozyme was derived as follows: deltaR1 = R0((K4(exp[K0exp(-0.26t(m))]t - 1) + 1)1/2 - 1). Similarly, another response model that indicates the effect of magnetic field intensity was derived as follows: deltaR1 = R0((K4(exp(K0 exp(- 5.17B)t) - 1) + 1)1/2 - 1).
