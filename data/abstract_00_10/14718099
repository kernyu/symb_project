Fluoroquinolone resistance was detected in 12 of 370 Australian human Campylobacter isolates; 10 of these were travel-associated, and for 2 isolates travel status was unknown. No resistance was found in isolates known to be locally acquired. In Australia, fluoroquinolones have not been licensed for use in food production animals, a policy that may have relevance for countries with fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter.
