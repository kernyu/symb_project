The generation of a series of analogs of erythromycin A (EryA, 2) is described. In this study, we compared two peptide-based catalysts-one originally identified from a catalyst screen (5) and its enantiomer (ent-5)-for the selective functionalization of EryA. The semi-synthetic analogs were subjected to MIC evaluation with two bacterial strains and compared to unfunctionalized EryA.
