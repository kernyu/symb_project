Failure to adhere to complex antiretroviral regimens can lead to resistance and treatment failure among HIV-positive persons. In this study of the feasibility of an automated two-way messaging system to improve adherence, participants received multiple short daily messages designed to remind, educate, encourage adherence, and solicit responses concerning side effects and self-reported adherence. Twenty-five participants remained in the study for a median of 208 days, receiving 17,440 messages and replying to 14,677 (84%). Participants reported missing one or more doses on 36% of 743 queries and reported medication side effects on 26% of 729 queries. Participants expressed high satisfaction with the messaging system and reported that it helped with medication adherence. The study suggests that it is feasible to use an automated wireless two-way messaging system to communicate with HIV-positive patients over an extended period of time.
