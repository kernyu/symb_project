This study was conducted to evaluate risk factors for antimicrobial resistance and influence of resistance on mortality in Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia. Data on 190 patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia were analyzed retrospectively. Antimicrobial resistance to antipseudomonal antibiotics was evaluated. The main outcome measure was 30-day mortality. In P. aeruginosa bacteremia, resistance rates to piperacillin (PIP), ceftazidime (CAZ), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and imipenem (IPM) were 29 (56/190), 19 (36/190), 17 (32/190) and 15% (28/190), respectively. Prior uses of fluoroquinolones or carbapenems were independent risk factors for resistance to CIP and IPM, and prior use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins was a risk factor for PIP-R. An indwelling urinary catheter was a risk factor for PIP-R, CAZ-R, and CIP-R. An invasive procedure was a risk factor for CIP-R and IPM-R. The 30-day mortality rate was 44% (33/75) in patients infected by strains resistant to any of the antipseudomonal antibiotics, but 33.9% (39/115) in those by strains susceptible to all antipseudomonal antibiotics (p = 0.161). Among patients with bloodstream infection due to antimicrobial-resistant P. aeruginosa, those infected by IPM-R strains had the highest mortality (IPM-R, 53.6% vs. CAZ-R, 47.2% vs. CIP-R 46.9%, PIP-R, 39.3%). In this study regarding P. aeruginosa bacteremia, prior uses of fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, or extended-spectrum cephalosporins, a prior invasive procedure, and an indwelling urinary catheter were found to be associated with antimicrobial resistance. The patients with bloodstream infection caused by antimicrobial-resistant P. aeruginosa, especially to imipenem, had a tendency toward higher mortality than those infected by susceptible strains.
