Colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains is an increasing problem in the treatment of wounds. Only a very limited repertoire of effective treatment strategies is available, especially for outpatient care. We successfully treated a chronic leg ulcer colonized with MRSA on an ambulatory basis, using larvae of the common greenbottle fly Lucilia sericata. Whereas the proteases secreted by Lucilia sericata may lead to efficient selective necrolysis, the phenylacetate and phenylacetataldehyde may exert antimicrobial effects. Treatment with Lucilia sericata represents an effective and inexpensive treatment strategy of chronic wounds, especially when colonized with MRSA Due to the low acceptance by patients and medical stuff, it is not often employed.
