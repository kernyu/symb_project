In an effort to develop potent new antituberculosis agents that would be effective against both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we prepared a novel series of optically active 6-nitro-2,3-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b]oxazoles substituted at the 2-position with various phenoxymethyl groups and a methyl group and investigated the in vitro and in vivo activity of these compounds. Several of these derivatives showed potent in vitro and in vivo activity, and compound 19 (OPC-67683) in particular displayed excellent in vitro activity against both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (MIC = 0.006 microg/mL) and dose-dependent and significant in vivo efficacy at lower oral doses than rifampicin in mouse models infected with M. tuberculosis Kurono. The synthesis and structure-activity relationships of these new compounds are presented.
