Epidemiology and pathogenesis in urinary stones diagnosed in 184 patients were studied. Mean age was 38.3 years. Male to female ratio was 2.5:1. Stones were predominantly of mixed type: calcium oxalate was the commonest compound. Anatomical distribution of urinary stones was 67.4% renal, 12.5% ureteric and 14.6% bladder. Recurrence rate following previous surgical removal was 15.0%. Bacteria were isolated from 19 (24.4%) of 78 urinary stones: 14 were urea splitting and 5 non-urea splitting. Females had a greater chance of having infected stones. All bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin and nalidixic acid. All isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and erythromycin. Multiple resistance to 6 antimicrobial agents was common (58.8%).
