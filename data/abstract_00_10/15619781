The current primary goal of therapy for HIV-1 infection is suppression of viral replication to below detectable levels (less than 50 copies/mL). The most important challenge facing current HIV-1 research is designing agents that prevent the emergence of or overcome drug-resistant HIV-1 variants. Shortcomings of antiretroviral therapy have sparked interest in immunologic enhancement through vaccines and immunomodulators, specifically antigen stimulation, induction of HIV-1 specific memory and cytotoxic T-cell responses, and activation of resting CD4+ cells within latent HIV-1 reservoirs. New classes of antiretroviral agents include entry inhibitors and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This article discusses the status of successful HIV treatment strategies, including new treatment practices, antiretroviral agents, and immune-enhancing agents.
