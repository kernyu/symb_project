Benzothiadiazole (BTH) is a functional analog of the plant endogenous hormone-like compound, salicylic acid (SA), which is required for the induction of plant defense genes leading to systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Previous molecular and genetic studies have suggested that BTH itself might potentiate SAR resulting in the induction of several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. However, the changes in the metabolome, which occur as a result of BTH-treatment, remain unclear. In this study, metabolic alterations in BTH-treated Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy followed by multivariate data analyses such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Both PCA and PLS-DA show that increase of glucose, glutamine, inositol, malic acid, sucrose, and threonine as well as BTH and its degraded metabolites contribute to the clear discrimination of the metabolome of BTH-treated Arabidopsis from control plants. However, the levels of phenolic metabolites, which have generally been observed to be induced by other signaling molecules were significantly reduced in BTH-treated Arabidopsis. In addition to these changes due to BTH-treatment, it was also found that the EtOH used as a solvent in this treatment may per se act as an inducer of the accumulation of a flavonoid.
