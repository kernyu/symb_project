The rate of persistence of and susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori (HP) to antibacterial drugs (ABDs) and the results of eradication therapy were studied in patients with duodenal peptic ulcer complicated by pyloroduodenal stenosis (PDS). The patients with PDS exhibited a high (97.1%) rate of anthral mucosal infection with HP showing a high resistance to ABDs. The efficiency of eradication therapy performed with the susceptibility of HP to ABDs kept in mind was 92.5%. The use of eradication therapy in the complex preoperative preparation of patients with ulcerative PDS increases the latter.
