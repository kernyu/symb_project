Infective endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci is a well-described disease. Streptococcus viridans is also an important etiologic agent causing septicaemia in neutropenic patients with haematological diseases. In this study we retrospectively reviewed charts from 111 patients with 121 episodes of viridans streptococci septicaemia during the period 1992-97 for clinical data, presence of endocarditis, subtype and outcome. Forty-seven episodes of S. viridans septicaemia were documented in 45 non-neutropenic patients treated at the Department of Infectious Diseases (Group A). Thirty of these episodes were defined as definite and 9 as possible infective endocarditis, using Duke's critera. Seventy-four episodes of S. viridans septicaemia were identified in 66 patients treated at the Department of Haematology (Group B), only 1 of which fulfilled the criteria for possible infective endocarditis. S. sanguis was the most common subtype (18/47; 38%) in Group A and S. mitis was the major subtype (51/74; 69%) in Group B.
