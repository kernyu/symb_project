OBJECTIVES: i) To evaluate objective response, toxicity, and quality of life (QoL) of gemcitabine monotherapy as second-line treatment in patients with cisplatin-refractory, metastatic transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). ii) To assess prognostic parameters for response to treatment and for improvement of QoL parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 patients were prospectively enrolled in this open-label, nonrandomized multicenter phase II trial. Patients received up to 6 courses of gemcitabine monotherapy (1,250 mg/m(2) on day 1 and 8 of a 21-day course). 28 of 30 patients were available for response evaluation. RESULTS: Objective response (OR) was seen in 3/28 (11%) of patients (2 complete remissions, 1 partial remission). The mean time to progression (TTP) was 4.9 +/- 3.5 months and mean disease-specific survival time was 8.7 +/- 4.7 months. 13 of 28 patients did not progress (OR + 10 stable diseases), and TTP (8.0 +/- 2.7 months, p < 0.001) as well as survival time (10.2 +/- 3.8 months, p < 0.05) differed significantly from those who showed progressive disease within 18 weeks of treatment. Pain values significantly improved in the group of responders from 4.3 +/- 1.9 to 5.8 +/- 1.3 points (p < 0.05). Response to cisplatin pretreatment was the best prognosticator for the response to gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine monotherapy as second-line treatment is justified in patients with metastatic TCC who are refractory to cisplatin treatment. Patients with initially OR to cisplatin benefit most from second-line treatment. QoL remains stable during treatment, and pain improves especially in patients with bone metastases.
