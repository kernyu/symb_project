To determine the potential consequences of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) accumulation in tissue sites observed in several autoimmune diseases, we measured type 1 interferon production from circulating human pDCs as a function of pDC concentration. The effects of interferon-alpha and blockade of the type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR) on human pDC type 1 interferon and interferon-inducible transcription and protein production were measured. Human pDCs became far more efficient producers of interferon-alpha at concentrations beyond those normally present in blood, through an IFNAR-dependent mechanism. Extracellular interferon-alpha increased pDC production of type 1 interferons. The accumulation of pDCs in diseased tissue sites allows marked non-linear amplification of type 1 interferon production locally. The role of the IFNAR-dependent mechanism of interferon production by human pDCs is greater than previously suggested. IFNAR blockade has potential for diminishing type 1 interferon production by all human cells.
