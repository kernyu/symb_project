BACKGROUND: Incisional surgical site infections (ISSIs) are common bacterial infections in heart transplantation (HT). The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, etiology, timing, and risk factors for ISSIs. METHODS: A prospective study was performed, which included all heart transplants carried out in the participating hospitals (pertaining to the Spanish National Hospital Network RESITRA) between August 2003 and February 2005. A population of 292 consecutive patients was included (84.9% males). The definition of ISSI used in the study was based on the Centers for Disease Control criteria. RESULTS: Seventeen episodes of ISSIs were recorded in 14 patients (4.8%; confidence interval [CI] 95% 2.7-7.7%). The median time from transplant to ISSI was 14 days (range 3-75). Two patients (14%) died; fatality was related to ISSI (mediastinitis) in 1 patient (7%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (7 cases), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Proteus mirabilis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata, 1 case each, were the isolated pathogens. The duration of extracorporeal circulation was longer in patients with ISSI, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin alone (odds ratio, 15.8; 95% CI, 1.2-216.9) was independently associated with the development of ISSI. CONCLUSIONS: ISSIs in HT are frequently caused by resistant bacteria and Candida, but are associated with good prognosis.
