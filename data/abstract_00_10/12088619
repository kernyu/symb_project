A total of 1785 Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates were collected in our hospital during 1998 (526), 1999 (564) and 2000 (695). Among them, one hundred and thirty (39, 33 and 58, respectively) were phenotypically assigned as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); sixteen of these isolates (3, 2 and 11, respectively) were detected as highly mupirocin-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MMRSA). In this work, our goal was to characterize MRSA and MMRSA clinical isolates by co-application of phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to determine the MMRSA incidence in our hospital during the period 1998-2000. With this purpose we compared and integrated the results obtained using conventional microbiology methods with those obtained using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Our results showed a good complementation between these two approximations to determine the incidence of MMRSA clinical isolates and permitted to estimate that such incidence increased from 7.7% in 1998 to 19% in 2000.
