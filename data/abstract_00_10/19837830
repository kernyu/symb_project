Campylobacter jejuni, a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium, is a predominant cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. Although considered fragile and fastidious and lacking many classical stress response mechanisms, C. jejuni exhibits a remarkable capacity for survival and adaptation, successfully infecting humans and persisting in the environment. Consequently, understanding the physiological and genetic properties that allow C. jejuni to survive and adapt to various stress conditions is crucial for therapeutic interventions. Of importance is polyphosphate (poly-P) kinase 1 (PPK1), which is a key enzyme mediating the synthesis of poly-P, an essential molecule for survival, mediating stress responses, host colonization, and virulence in many bacteria. Therefore, we investigated the role of PPK1 in C. jejuni pathogenesis, stress survival, and adaptation. Our findings demonstrate that a C. jejuni Deltappk1 mutant was deficient in poly-P accumulation, which was associated with a decreased ability to form viable-but-nonculturable cells under acid stress. The Deltappk1 mutant also showed a decreased frequency of natural transformation and an increased susceptibility to various antimicrobials. Furthermore, the Deltappk1 mutant was characterized by a dose-dependent deficiency in chicken colonization. Complementation of the Deltappk1 mutant with the wild-type copy of ppk1 restored the deficient phenotypes to levels similar to those of the wild type. Our results suggest that poly-P plays an important role in stress survival and adaptation and might contribute to genome plasticity and the spread and development of antimicrobial resistance in C. jejuni. These findings highlight the potential of PPK1 as a novel target for therapeutic interventions.
