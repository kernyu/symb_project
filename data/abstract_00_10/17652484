Analysis of the gene encoding the beta-subunit of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase (rpoB) has demonstrated a small region that harbors the mutations most frequently associated with rifampin resistance. In this study, we determined the occurrence of rifampin resistance in 544 Tunisian clinical M. tuberculosis strains isolated in a university hospital between 2004 and 2006 by using the standard-proportion agar method, the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB assay, and DNA sequencing.
