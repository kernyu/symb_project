Cardiac failure is a major health problem with increasing incidence due to aging of the population. Studies in both experimental animals and humans have suggested that aldosterone excess may have deleterious effects on cardiac function. In order to generate a novel screening system for the identification of aldosterone antagonists, we expressed the human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR), respectively, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Reporter plasmids containing two hormone-responsive elements upstream of a fission yeast minimal promotor and either a lacZ gene (for quantification) or a neomycin gene (for survival screening) were constructed and cotransformed into fission yeast strains with expression plasmids for MR or GR. The functionality of the reporter systems was then tested using physiological ligands of both receptors as well as known inhibitors. Transactivating activity of MR could be stimulated by aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, cortisone, and spironolactone, but not by progesterone, while GR activity was stimulated by cortisol and cortisone, but also not by progesterone. Taken together, we have succeeded in establishing fission yeast-based screening systems that allow the identification of MR- or GR-interacting compounds. Moreover, our data show that after expression in fission yeast both receptors did not differentiate between steroids with different configurations at positions 11beta, 17 and 18. This finding suggests that only recognition of C-21 substituents may be accomplished by the receptor proteins alone, while the physiologically important selectivity towards other positions of the steroid ligand depends on other factors which are not conserved from fission yeast to man.
