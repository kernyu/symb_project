PURPOSE: To elucidate risk factors, microbial culture results, and visual outcomes for infectious keratitis after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective chart review, case report, and literature review. METHODS: The records of 12 patients with infectious keratitis after PRK were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Causative organism, response to medical treatment, and visual outcome. RESULTS: Infectious keratitis developed in 13 eyes of 12 patients after PRK. Organisms cultured were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), including a bilateral case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 4); Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3); and Streptococcus viridans (n = 1). Four patients manipulated their contact lenses, and 2 patients were exposed to nosocomial organisms while working in a hospital environment. Prophylactic antibiotics used were tobramycin (nine cases), polymyxin B-trimethoprim (three cases), and ciprofloxacin (one case). Final best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 20/100. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious corneal ulceration is a serious potential complication of PRK. Gram-positive organisms are the most common pathogens. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be broad spectrum and should include gram-positive coverage.
