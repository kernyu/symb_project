The provisional BSAC method for the detection of methicillin sensitivity in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) requires incubation of isolates for 48 h and raises the problem of timely reporting of susceptibility data. The forthcoming withdrawal of methicillin raises another difficulty. We evaluated 42 clinically significant CNS blood culture isolates by PCR, methicillin and oxacillin disc testing and by using methicillin Etests. Our results suggest that, although oxacillin disc susceptibility testing is a reasonable first line step, optimal and timely detection of resistance or susceptibility may require a combination of phenotypic and genotypic methods.
