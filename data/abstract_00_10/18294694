US service members are returning from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan with wound infections due to uncommon bacteria. Pseudomonas putida, a member of the fluorescent group of pseudomonads, primarily causes infection in immunosuppressed hosts and patients with invasive medical devices. P. putida has been implicated in outbreaks often traced to a contaminated fluid and is a rare cause of clinical infection. However, it should be considered a pathogen when isolated from pure culture. The objective of this article is to present a case report of a P. putida war wound infection, review previous P. putida infections, and provide a concise review of the epidemiology, risk factors, and management of infections due to this organism.
