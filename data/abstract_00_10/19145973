The system of transformation of heterologous genes under the method of agrobacterial transfer into Acremonium chrysogenum ATCC 11550 wild-type strains, natural producents of beta-lactam antibiotic cephalosporin C, and strains highly producing cephalosporin C 26/8 revealed by the multistage selection on its basis were developed. Vectors for agrobacterial transformation of A. chrysogenum containing expression cassettes of genes encoding resistance to geneticin (G418) and bleomicin (Zeocin) antibiotics under control of Ashbya gossypii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae TEF1 promoters were constructed. A comparable assessment of agrotransformation methods while co-cultivating fungi and agrobacterial cells on filters and in deep culture was conducted. Transformants, selected by resistance to geneticin and bleomicin, were characterized by PCR and Southern blot analyses.
