OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation of carbapenem restriction with the incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii in ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: Twenty-six patients admitted to the intensive care unit, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, from June to December in 2007, with confirmed VAP were randomized to two groups: conventional group (14 cases) and carbapenem restriction group (12 cases). All sputum samples were collected throughout the trial. The correlation between the incidence of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii and the consumption of carbapenem was analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (10.7%, 7/65) and consumption of carbapenem (61 g) in carbapenem restriction group were significantly lower than conventional group (17.8%, 13/73, 188 g, both P<0.05). The result implied that the decreased incidence of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii was attributable to the reduction of carbapenem consumption. CONCLUSION: Carbapenem constraint could reduce the incidence of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii in VAP.
