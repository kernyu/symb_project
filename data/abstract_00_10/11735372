The tetracycline resistance determinant Tet P, which is encoded by the conjugative plasmid pCW3 from Clostridium perfringens, is induced by subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline. In this study we have shown that the inducible phenotype is strain dependent. When pCW3 is present in derivatives of the wild-type strains CW234 and CW362 resistance is inducible. However, transfer to derivatives of strain 13 leads to a constitutive phenotype that is only observed in this strain background. Based on these results it is proposed that induction of the pCW3-encoded tet(P) genes in C. perfringens requires a host-encoded factor that is either absent or nonfunctional in strain 13 derivatives.
