After a treatment by peginterferon alpha and ribavirin, the percentages of non response and relapse are approximatively 33 and 18 % respectively. These treatment failures may be due either to viral resistance or to an insufficient treatment. The prevention of treatment failure is based on a good knowledge of the predictive factors of failure before and during the treatment. Among the patients who did not respond to interferon alpha and ribavirin, a new treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin makes it possible to obtain 45 % of sustained virological response (SVR) among the relapsers and 17 % of SVR among the non responders. Among the patients who did not respond to peginterferon alpha and ribavirin, a new treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin makes it possible to obtain 36 % of SVR among the relapsers and only 4 % of SVR among the non responders. New therapeutic strategies are necessary for the non responders. Until now no new therapeutic strategy allowed a significant benefit in term of SVR. Protease inhibitors are currently tested in non responders but there are some concerns about the risk of selection of multi-resistant strains.
