This report describes the vector-free engineering of Lactobacillus plantarum by chromosomal integration of an exogenous gene without inactivation of physiological traits. The integrative plasmid vector pP7B6 was derived from pGIP73 by replacing the cbh site, encoding the L. plantarum conjugated bile salt hydrolase, with the prophage fragment P7B6, from L. plantarum Lp80 (DSM 4229). Plasmid pP7B6NI was obtained by inserting the nisin immunity gene nisI of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DSM 20729, preceded by the constitutive promoter P32 from the same strain, in a unique XbaI site of fragment P7B6 and was used to electrotransform L. plantarum Lp80. A food grade recombinant L. plantarum Lp80NI, with 480-fold higher immunity to nisin than the wild type, was derived by integration of pP7B6NI followed by the excision of pP7B6. Polymerase chain reaction tests demonstrated that the integration of nisI in the prophage region had occurred and that the erythromycin resistance marker from pP7B6 was lost. Fifteen among 31 L. plantarum strains tested hybridized with P7B6, indicating that the integration of pP7B6-derived vectors might occur in some other L. plantarum strains. This was experimentally confirmed by constructing the recombinant strain L. plantarum LZNI from the dairy isolate L. plantarum LZ (LMG 24600).
