The discovery of newly recognised pathogens and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance have led to the development of new antimicrobial agents or to new indications for older agents. The indications have continued to increase because of new discoveries on the older agents' antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial activities. Macrolides and tetracyclines have received attention for their non-antimicrobial properties and potential use in chronic inflammatory disorders. Doxycycline, minocycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole regained interest for their activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, whereas colistin has regained interest for its activity against multiple drug-resistant, Gram-negative pathogens (i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Despite the recent development of new antimicrobial agents, older and less costly agents maintain an important role today in the treatment of infectious diseases.
