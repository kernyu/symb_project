Dynamic precautions in the early diagnosis and treatment of hospital acquired pneumonias are necessary because of their high mortality. In these patients, invasive diagnostic approaches may be needed since clinical and radiological findings and other non-invasive approaches frequently fail to establish the diagnosis. Thirty eight patients were prospectively included in the study. Average age of patients was 45.5 +/- 16.4 years; 31 were males (81.6%) and 7 (18.4%) were females. Pneumonia was detected in 9 (23.7%) cases during the first five days and in 29 (76.3%) cases after the fifth day of admission to the hospital. Bronchoscopic interventions diagnostic purpose were carried out in 25 (65.8%) patients. The culture results were negative in 7 (18.4%) cases. While more than one pathogen was determined on the cultures of 16 (42.1%) patients only one pathogen was isolated in the cultures of 15 (39.4%) cases. The frequently isolated pathogen on cultures was Staphylococci (45.4%). Other pathogens were Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Serratia and Streptococcus pneumoniae according to their frequency on cultures. High resistance rates to the third generation cephalosporins were determined. Eleven of 17 deaths in 38 pneumonia cases were attributable to pneumonia. As a conclusion, isolation of pathogen and antibiotic resistance should be determined in the cases with hospital acquired pneumonia. Invasive diagnostic interventions were not avoided when necessary. Although pro-BAL and PSB methods were expensive, their use in selected cases may prevent unnecessary antibiotic use and contribute to a decrease in mortality rate.
