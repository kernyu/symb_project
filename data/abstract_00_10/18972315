The fear of candidemia caused by a fluconazole-resistant species of Candida is causing many intensive care units (ICUs) to switch empiric therapy from this drug to broad-spectrum antifungal agents. We studied the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility of Candida isolates involved in cases of candidemia among adult and pediatric patients in ICUs from 1984 to 2006. We documented 307 episodes of candidemia in 307 patients, of which only eight episodes (2.6%) were caused by a fluconazole-resistant isolate. At least three of the eight patients from whom fluconazole-resistant strains were recovered had recently received fluconazole. Overall, only 1.6% of the episodes of candidemia caused by fluconazole-resistant strains (five patients) occurred in individuals with no evidence of previous fluconazole administration. In conclusion, the use of broad-spectrum antifungal agents is not justified in ICUs with a low proportion of candidemia episodes caused by fluconazole-resistant strains of Candida.
