The Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis murine model was used to evaluate the potential of liposome entrapped soluble blood stage antigens (sAg) based vaccine against malaria infection in BALB/c mice. Results from the present study revealed that immunization with E. coli lipid liposome (escheriosome) entrapped sAg provided strong protective immune responses that successfully suppressed drug resistant strain of Plasmodium yoelii, whereas other forms of sAg such as, egg PC/Chol liposomes entrapped, or its emulsion form with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) failed to impart significant level of protection. The immune responses, involved with escheriosome-sAg protection, were found to be associated with enhanced antigen specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell populations. Analysis of cytokine profiles in immunized animals revealed that the protective response was associated with the induction of a Th-1 (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) cells. Furthermore, vaccination with escheriosome entrapped sAg elicited high IgGl and IgG2a isotype response that played important role in imparting protection against blood stage infection of Plasmodium yoelii (MDR) in BALB/c mice.
