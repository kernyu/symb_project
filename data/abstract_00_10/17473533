We determined the in vitro antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Vibrio cholerae O139 recently isolated from cholera patients in India. Ciprofloxacin showed excellent antibacterial activity against the O139 strains, and ciprofloxacin-resistant O139 strains were not observed. The lack of incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance in O139 strains may be because O139 strains appeared comparatively recently and have not been extensively treated with antibacterial agents including fluoroquinolones.
