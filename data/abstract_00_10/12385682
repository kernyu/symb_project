The Italian Epidemiological Survey began a surveillance study with the aim of monitoring the antimicrobial resistance of respiratory pathogens. From 1997 to 1999, 2028 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 523 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were collected from 59 Clinical Microbiology Laboratories distributed throughout Italy. In 1998, the study was extended to include Moraxella catarrhalis and a total of 360 isolates were collected. There was a significant increase in the beta-lactamase production both for H. influenzae (from 5% in 1997 to 16% in 1999) and for H. parainfluenzae (from 5% in 1997 to 22% in 1999). Beta-lactamase production in M. catarrhalis was 84% in 1998 and 87% in 1999. Beta-lactamase production affected the susceptibility to unprotected penicillins (87% in H. influenzae, 85% in H. parainfluenzae and 34% in M. catarrhalis), and in part the susceptibility to cefaclor (about 98%). Amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefixime, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were active against all strains of H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and M. catarrhalis.
