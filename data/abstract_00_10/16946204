OBJECTIVE: To estimate the extent of Staphylococcus aureus vaginal-rectal colonization among pregnant women as severe S aureus infections have emerged in pregnant and postpartum women and infants. METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study for methicillin-sensitive S aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus on all routine de-identified vaginal-rectal prenatal group B streptococcus (GBS) screening cultures submitted to the microbiology laboratory of a tertiary-care facility from January to July 2005. Standard microbiologic techniques and molecular analyses were used to detect community-associated methicillin-resistant S aureus strains. As opposed to health care-associated methicillin-resistant S aureus isolates, community-associated methicillin-resistant S aureus isolates were defined as those possessing the type IV or type V staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec element and usually lacking a multidrug-resistant phenotype. RESULTS: A total of 2,963 GBS screening cultures were analyzed, from which 743 (25.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 23.5-26.7%) GBS isolates and 507 (17.1%, 95% CI 15.7-18.5%) S aureus isolates were identified. Group B streptococcus colonization was significantly associated with S aureus colonization (prevalence odds ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.5, P < .001). Of the S aureus isolates, 14 (2.8%, 95% CI 1.4-4.2%) were methicillin-resistant, and 13 of these were determined to be community-associated methicillin-resistant S aureus. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of S aureus colonization identified in GBS screening cultures from pregnant women was substantial and associated with GBS co-colonization. Although we do not advocate routine screening of pregnant women for methicillin-sensitive S aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus colonization, we recommend continued monitoring of both methicillin-sensitive S aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus infections in this population and their infants.
