The in vitro susceptibilities of 76 isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae collected from pigs with pleuropneumonia were tested with 12 commonly used antimicrobial drugs by an agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentration procedure according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines. Field isolates had low MICs for ceftiofur, danofloxacin and penicillin. No correlation of antimicrobial resistance was related to serotype.
