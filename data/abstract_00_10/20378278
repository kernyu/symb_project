AIM OF THE STUDY: Vitek-2 AIX versus Vitek-2 PC have different rules for phenotypic interpretation. The aim of this study is to ensure that the raw results determined by these two versions of Vitek-2 allow biologists to conclude to the same resistance phenotype, but also to evaluate their own phenotypic interpretation system (advanced expert system). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 251 strains of Enterobacteriaceae of different groups and phenotypes was tested. Each strain was studied simultaneously on both types of Vitek-2 from the same calibrated inoculum. We then compared their resistance phenotype to beta-lactams. RESULTS: For strains not producing ESBL or CHN, the biologist concluded in 99.3% of cases to the same resistance phenotype by interpreting the raw results of Vitek-2 AIX versus PC. The phenotypic interpretation of biologist is different from the Vitek-2 in respectively 40% versus 43% of cases for AIX and PC versions. For multi-resistant strains, the biologist concluded in 100% of cases to the same resistance phenotype by interpreting the raw results of Vitek-2 AIX versus PC. In 51.5% of cases the biologist use the disk diffusion method (DD). The results of this technique put forward 29% discrepancy with the two types of Vitek-2. Finally, when Vitek-2 claims the presence of an ESBL alone, this result is routinely confirmed by DD. CONCLUSION: The switch from Vitek-2 AIX to Vitek-2 PC does not alter the results of the phenotypic interpretation of biologist.
