This report describes the first occurrence of the DHA-1 ampCbeta-lactamase gene in Proteus mirabilis. The organism was isolated from the vaginal flora of a pregnant woman in a French hospital. The DHA-1 beta-lactamase gene was identified on the basis of phenotypic characteristics, PCR amplification and sequencing. Antagonism between cefoxitin and the other cephalosporins suggested inducible production of the DHA-1 enzyme.
