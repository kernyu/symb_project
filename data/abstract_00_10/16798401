PURPOSE: Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a common and uncomfortable condition, frequently caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. Antibacterial resistance among these and other common respiratory pathogens is now widespread and of concern. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was developed to be effective against the common respiratory pathogens, including many resistant strains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This open-label, noncomparative study assessed the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg in adult patients with ABRS. Requirements for study entry included a clinical diagnosis of ABRS supported by radiologic findings. In addition, sinus puncture for bacteriologic assessment was required at study entry. RESULTS: Overall, bacteriologic success (eradication or clinical evidence of eradication) at the follow-up visit (days 17-28) was achieved in 87.8% (722/822) of patients with 1 or more pathogen isolated at screening, in 93.2% (246/264) of patients with S pneumoniae, in 96.7% (29/30) of those with penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations >or=2 microg/mL), and in 88.7% (110/124) of patients with beta-lactamase-positive pathogens. Bacteriologic success was achieved against 6 of 7 S pneumoniae isolates with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4/2 microg/mL or higher. CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was generally well tolerated. This new amoxicillin/clavulanate formulation provides a suitable option for empiric therapy for ABRS in adults.
