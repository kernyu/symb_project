The growing number of fungal infections, coupled with emerging resistance to classical antifungal agents, has led to the development of new agents, among them voriconazole. Susceptibility to voriconazole was tested by using two microdilution techniques: the reference method described in National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards document M27-A2 and a colorimetric method, Sensititre YeastOne. A total of 272 Candida isolates (132 of Candida albicans, 62 of C. parapsilosis, 33 of Candida glabrata, 21 of C. krusei, 15 of C. tropicalis, and 9 of C. lusitaniae) and two control strains (C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and C. krusei ATCC 6258) were tested. There was a high rate of agreement between the two methods used (97 to 100%).
