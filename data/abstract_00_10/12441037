Clinical and basic mechanisms of interaction between Helicobacter pylori and its host have been the subject of numerous publications in the past year. Two additional proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), esomeprazole and rabeprazole, have shown effectiveness in H. pylori eradication when combined with amoxicillin and clarithromycin, and esomeprazole has demonstrated its effectiveness with only one daily dose. Other important recent developments worldwide include evidence-based treatment guidelines established at a European consensus meeting, improved accuracy in the urea breath test and the stool antigen test, new recommendations for second-line therapy, and a greater understanding of antimicrobial resistance in treatment failure. In addition, new studies have confirmed that H. pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin are the major causes of peptic ulcer disease and ulcer bleeding. This paper reviews the results of these studies and their implications for future research.
