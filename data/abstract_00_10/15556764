Additional structural modifications of the new chemical entity, 2,8-dicyclopentyl-4-methylquinoline (DCMQ; MIC=6.25 microg/mL, M. tuberculosis H37Rv) resulted in the synthesis of four new series of the ring-substituted quinolinecarbohydrazides (series 1-4) constituting 22 analogues. All new derivatives were evaluated for in vitro antimycobacterial activities against drug-sensitive M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain. Certain ring-substituted-2-quinolinecarbohydrazide analogues described herein showed good inhibitory activity. In particular, analogues 4-(1-adamantyl)-2-quinolinecarbohydrazide (2d), 4,5-dicyclopentyl-2-quinolinecarbohydrazide (2e), 4,8-dicyclopentyl-2-quinolinecarbohydrazide (2f), and 4,5-dicyclohexyl-2-quinolinecarbohydrazide (2g) have exhibited the MIC value of 6.25 microg/mL. Further investigation of the most suitable lead prototype, 4-(1-adamantyl)-2-quinolinecarbohydrazide (2d, series 1) led to the synthesis of N2-alkyl/N2,N2-dialkyl/N2-aryl-4-(1-adamantyl)-2-quinolinecarboxamides (series 5) consisting of 13 analogues. Some of the synthesized carboxamides 7a, 7h, and 7m reported herein have exhibited excellent antimycobacterial activities in the range of 6.25-3.125 microg/mL against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv strains.
