S6K1 has emerged as a critical signaling component in the development of insulin resistance through phosphorylation and inhibition of IRS-1 function. This effect can be triggered directly by nutrients such as amino acids or by insulin through a homeostatic negative-feedback loop. However, the role of S6K1 in mediating IRS-1 phosphorylation in a physiological setting of nutrient overload is unresolved. Here we show that S6K1 directly phosphorylates IRS-1 Ser-1101 in vitro in the C-terminal domain of the protein and that mutation of this site largely blocks the ability of amino acids to suppress IRS-1 tyrosine and Akt phosphorylation. Consistent with this finding, phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-1101 is increased in the liver of obese db/db and wild-type, but not S6K1(-/-), mice maintained on a high-fat diet and is blocked by siRNA knockdown of S6K1 protein. Finally, infusion of amino acids in humans leads to the concomitant activation of S6K1, phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-1101, a reduction in IRS-1 function, and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. These findings indicate that nutrient- and hormonal-dependent activation of S6K1 causes insulin resistance in mice and humans, in part, by mediating IRS-1 Ser-1101 phosphorylation.
