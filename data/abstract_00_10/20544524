The clinical activity of pyrimidine analogues (araC and gemcitabine) is impaired by different mechanisms of resistance and several efforts to overcome this problem have been undertaken. Elacytarabine (CP-4055, araC-5'elaidic acid ester) and CP-4126 (gemcitabine-5'elaidic acid ester) are lipophilic fatty acid derivatives of the nucleoside analogues araC and gemcitabine, respectively, that are currently investigated in clinical trials in solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Here, we present results on the activity of elacytarabine and CP-4126 in a panel of tumor cell lines that are resistant to araC and gemcitabine and we discuss the potential use of these agents in the treatment of patients with drug resistance phenotypes. We conclude that elacytarabine and CP-4126 are active in cells with deficient nucleoside membrane transport and altered mismatch repair. These results should be taking into consideration for future clinical development of elacyatrabine and CP-4126.
