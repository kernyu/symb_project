BACKGROUND: The number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. Placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. The 10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. Six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. METHODS: Oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. The distance implant bone (DIB) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. The levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using DNA probe technology. Additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. RESULTS: The peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, and Treponema denticola were not detected. Low levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Eikenella corrodens were found. Prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). The mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. The antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.
