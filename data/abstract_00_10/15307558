High-level gentamicin resistant (HLGR) enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) have become a substantial nosocomial problem in many countries. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of HLGR enterococci and their genetic relatedness in blood culture isolates from patients with bacteraemia admitted to the 3 hospitals in Ostergotland, a county in the south east of Sweden, during 1994-2001. 36 of 250 E. faecalis (14%,) and 4 of 106 E. faecium isolates (4%) were shown by PCR to carry the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2")-Ia aminoglycoside modifying gene and these isolates were also classified as HLGR enterococci by the gentamicin antibiotic disk diffusion method. A majority of HLGR E. faecalis isolates (83%) belonged to the same cluster of genetically related isolates, according to the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, whereas all 4 HLGR E. faecium isolates had unique PFGE patterns. In conclusion, our study showed that in contrast to studies from many other countries, the presence of HLGR enterococci was more common in E. faecalis than in E. faecium and appeared the first time in 1996 and 1999, respectively. Bacteraemia with HLGR enterococci in Ostergotland was mainly due to the spread of a cluster of related E. faecalis strains.
