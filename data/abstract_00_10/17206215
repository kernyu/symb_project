Further research was performed on the disinfectant efficacy of peracetic acid on viruses. Hepatitis A virus (HM-175 strain), Poliovirus 2 (attenuated strain) and Coxsackie virus B5 (isolated strain) were tested using peracetic acid concentrations between 160 mg/l and 1280 mg/l. Inactivation tests were carried out at +20 degrees C and at 3 different pH conditions, acid, neutral and basic. The results confirmed that HAV virus, which showed a decline with concentrations above 320 mg/l, has the highest resistance with respect to the other viruses. The other two Enteroviruses were found to be less resistant, especially in neutral and acid conditions.
