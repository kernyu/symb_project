In the prospective study the susceptibility of 41 Escherichia coli strains and 55 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to gentamicin, netilmicin and amikacin was tested at a 2-year interval (period I April 1998 to March 1999, and period II April to July 2001). Genotyping was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and a clone based on 80% or 90% similarity was determined for each of the study bacteria. In 24 (32.0%) clones, strains showed no variation over 2-year interval, supporting the hypothesis on a priori susceptible strains. Transformation from susceptibility in period I to resistance in period II was demonstrated in 5 (6.7%) clones, a pattern consistent with the concept of bacterial development of resistance under the influence of antibiotics. However, there were 10 (13.3%) clones whose strains exhibited an inverse pattern. Accordingly, two-way transformation of susceptibility took place during the study period. The utilization of the study aminoglycosides had no major impact on the variation of microbial susceptibility. Changes in microbial susceptibility were found to follow some regular patterns, which were not influenced by the study aminoglycosides. Two phenomena were observed: (i) there were stable clones that did not develop resistance in spite of selective antibiotic challenge; and (ii) changes of susceptibility in isolated bacteria from both inpatient and outpatient strains of the same clone were two-way and reversible.
