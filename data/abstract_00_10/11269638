The evolving patterns of drug resistance in malaria parasites and changes in recommendations for malaria prevention present a challenge to physicians who advise travellers on chemoprophylaxis. Because compliance with personal protection measures is usually low, children should receive appropriate chemoprophylaxis, including breast-fed infants who are not protected through maternal chemoprophylaxis. For travel to areas where chloroquine resistance has not yet been reported (i.e. parts of Central America, the Caribbean and parts of the Middle East), chloroquine alone is sufficient for antimalarial prophylaxis. Mefloquine is the drug of choice for chemoprophylaxis in areas with chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, and can be given to infants and young children. The combination of chloroquine and proguanil is well tolerated in children but is much less effective against drug-resistant malaria. Further research is needed to determine the best dosage regimen for antimalarial drugs used for chemoprophylaxis in children.
