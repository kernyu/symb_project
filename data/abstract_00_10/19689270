Currently, the long-term usage of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in HIVAIDS patients eventually leads to the development of drug resistance and severe side effect. Therefore, it is imperative to look for the novel NNRTIs with potent and broad spectrum anti-mutant activity that are also safe and have excellent pharmacokinetic profiles. In this article, newly emerging NNRTIs scaffolds in recent three years, together with the underlying strategies for developing new generation HIV-1 NNRTIs with improved resilience to current drug resistant mutants, are reviewed and analysed.
