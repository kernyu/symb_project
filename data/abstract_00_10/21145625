A number of quinolone derivatives have been reported to possess anti-mycobacterial activity. Generally. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates expressing resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin are susceptible to fluoroquinolones. Benzotriazole is a hetero-bicyclic aromatic ring endowed with interesting chemical and biological properties and pharmacological activities. In a preliminary study we have recently reported the activity of triazolo[4,5-h]quinolone-carboxylic acids, a new class of benzotriazole derivatives active against multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-Mtb). In this study we confirm that this novel class of quinolones is endowed with a selective anti-mycobacterial activity, coupled with absence of cytotoxicity. The SAR analysis of the new derivatives in comparison with the previous series shows that the methyl group is the most effective substituent in both N-3 and N-9 positions of the ring system.
