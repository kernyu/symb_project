Cephalosporins are widely used and trustworthy antibiotics in daily medical practice. Although antibacterial resistance has been reported in hospital wards, there are less data for community-acquired infections. In this study we investigated the cephalosporin susceptibility profiles of community-acquired Gram-negative bacteria isolates in Sivas Kizilay Medical Center (Turkey) between March 2002 and March 2003. In our study, 949 Escherichia coli, 165 Proteus spp., 97 Enterobacter spp., 24 Klebsiella spp and 84 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were evaluated. Cefepime seemed to be the most effective antibiotic against our community-acquired Gram-negative isolates. Resistance to this drug was 19.3% for P. aeruginosa and around 0-10.6% for enteric bacteria. Enteric pathogen resistance ranged between 44.3-100% for cefazolin, 25-51.9% for cefuroxime, 4.8-25.3% for ceftriaxone, 5.4-14.5% for ceftazidime. Resistance in enteric pathogens to gentamicin ranged between 5.8-15.4%, to amikacin between 3.8-6.25%, to ciprofloxacin between 6.7-20%. 8.1% of P. aeruginosa were resistant to ciprofloxacin. With these profiles the aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin resemble highly effective cephalosporins like cefepime. On the contrary, first- and second-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam are no longer used in probable Gram-negative bacterial infections in our region. Since treatment based on cephalosporins was less efficacious than expected in community-acquired infections, urgent measures are needed to limit antibacterial resistance outside of hospitals.
