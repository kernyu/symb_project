OBJECTIVE: Using molecular methods to study the relationship between genotypes and serum resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Wuhan area. METHODS: NG-mast and serum bactericidal assays at the molecular level were used to differentiate the 46 strains which were isolated from the outpatients of sexually transmitted disease clinics and the relationship between different genotypes while phenotypes was also studied. RESULTS: 80.43% of the 46 strains contained the island and we were able to define three different combinations of genes in the isolates. Results from serum bactericidal assays showed that all 9 sac-4+ strains did not provide any serum resistance. CONCLUSION: Different isolates carried different gonococcal genetic islands (pathogenicity island) and certain phenotypes. There were no sobious relationship between sac-4 gene and serum resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
