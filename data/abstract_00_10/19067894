BACKGROUND: There is growing concern regarding antimicrobial resistance worldwide, particularly of Escherichia coli, and the first choice of an antimicrobial agent for empiric treatment of pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) is not well established. METHODS: The medical records from January 1991 to December 2005 for all children under 18 years of age admitted to Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei for their first UTI were reviewed. Two study periods, early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005), were chosen during the 15 year period for evaluating the trend of antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: Of the 368 isolates, E. coli was the most common pathogen (81.0%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.0%), and Proteus mirabilis (3.5%). Of the 368 isolates, 77.4% were resistant to ampicillin, 44.6% to co-trimoxazole, 27.2% to cephalothin, 15.0% to gentamicin, and 8.4% to nitrofurantoin. In the early (1991-2000) and late (2001-2005) study periods, 199 isolates (54.1%) and 169 isolates (45.9%), respectively, were compared. The resistance to antimicrobial agents for overall pathogens in the early and late study periods, respectively, was as follows: 68.8% and 88.0% to ampicillin, 48.9% and 46.6% to co-trimoxazole, 26.8% and 28.9% to cephalothin, 16.2% and 19.8% to gentamicin, and 8.7% and 9.0% to nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSION: Among commonly used antimicrobial agents for the treatment of pediatric UTI, there is a trend towards increasing resistance to ampicillin and a persistently low resistance rate to gentamicin, cephalosporin, and nitrofurantoin. Parenteral first-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, and oral nitrofurantoin should be considered for first-line agents, given the resistance patterns of this study.
