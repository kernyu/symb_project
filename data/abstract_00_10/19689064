OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of alcohol and high-fat diet on the expression of PI-3K-P85alpha in rat adipose tissue, and in order to explore the effects on insulin sensitivity and the molecular mechanisms induced by combination of alcohol and high-fat diet. METHODS: The rats were treated by alcohol and high-fat. Then the contents of fasting plasma glucose and insulin, and HOMA-IR index of each group were calculated. Expression of PI-3K-P85alpha were detectedby RT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: In comparison with normal diet group, HOMA-IR index of high-fat groups increased, in comparison with high-fat control group, the contents of fasting plasma glucose increased in alcohol combined with high-fat groups, and HOMA-IR increased both in the low-dose and middle-dose alcohol combined with high-fat model groups. Expressions of PI-3K-P85alpha remarkably decreased in all the alcohol and high-fat model groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: High-fat diet could induce insulin resistance. Compared with high-fat diet alone, alcohol combined with high-fat could aggravate insulin resistance. The changes of PI-3K-P85alpha expression in adipose tissue may be one of the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance induced by alcohol combined high-fat diet.
