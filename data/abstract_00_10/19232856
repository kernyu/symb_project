This report documents the nosocomial spread for an 18-month period of a single clone of linezolid- and teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus associated primarily with catheter-related bacteremia in intensive care unit patients. All linezolid-resistant isolates had the same G2576T mutation in at least 1 copy of the 23S rRNA gene.
