OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristic of bacterial infections, and the relationship between antibiotics treatment and bacterial infections after liver transplantation, and to prevent antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. METHODS: 86 liver transplant recipients were retrospected. Different indexes including limited daily dose, the frequency of medication, drug use index were used to evaluate the rationality of the use of antibiotics, three-dimensional test was used to explore extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC enzyme of Gram-negative bacteria. RESULTS: The major pathogens of infection after liver transplantation were Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, fungi and E. coli. Pre-operative antibiotic utilization rate was 83.7%, it was mainly a single use of antibiotics; After- operative antibiotic usage was 100.0%, it was mainly joint use of two or three antibiotics; The top 3 antibiotics used were cephalosporins, the combined enzyme inhibitors and penicillin. Antibiotics with drug utilization index (DUI) more than 1.1 included ampicillin and Lalin proxy. 43.3% and 31.8% of Gram -Negative bacteria produced ESBLs and AmpC, respectively, while 21.3% Gram -Negative bacteria produced two enzymes. CONCLUSION: There is high incidence of bacterial infections after liver transplantation. The use of antibiotics is high dose, high-frequency and reasonable; High resistance of bacterial infections was prone to develop and the prevention of the high resistance of bacterial infections is very important.
