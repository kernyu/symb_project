Two new xanthone antibiotics, citreamicin delta (1) and epsilon (2), with potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens including multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA) were discovered. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited MIC values < 1 microg/mL versus a number of resistant strains. The compounds were obtained from EtOAc extracts of Streptomyces vinaceus and were purified by countercurrent chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC. Their structures were elucidated using primarily NMR and mass spectroscopy.
