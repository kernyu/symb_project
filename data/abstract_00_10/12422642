Levofloxacin effect on morphokinetic parameters of the murine lung tissue culture was investigated. This model allowed also to evaluate the levofloxacin activity against drug-resistant intracellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis: MBC was 0.5-1.0 mg/l. Bactericidal effect started on the 3d day of incubation and was maximal on 7th day. Tissue cells vitality was not changed. Combination of levofloxacin with antimycobacterial drugs of first choice was investigated: isoniazid demonstrated synergistic effect, pyrazinamide also demonstrated synergistic effect. Combination of levofloxacin with rifampicin was antagonistic.
