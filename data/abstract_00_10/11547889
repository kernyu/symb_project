We found that the marine yeast Debaryomyces hansenii strain C-11 (CIBNOR yeast collection, La Paz, Mexico) is highly tolerant to chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a powerful biocide agent. A direct application of this observation is the fermentation of the yeast in a nonsterile medium with an initial concentration of 0.3 mg/L of ClO2. The disinfectant helps to avoid the growth of unwanted microorganisms while allowing the development of the yeast. Because the concentration of ClO2 decreases during the fermentation, we ascribe to D. hansenii cells a "biocontrol" action that contributes to the collection of a contaminant-free yeast cell biomass.
