Infections with methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from colonized leg ulcers are rare. We describe a case of MRSA sepsis following mesh graft transplantation to treat a chronic leg ulcer. MRSA were isolated from blood and midstream urine and typed by their antimicrobial sensitivity, phage and SmaI-macrorestriction patterns. A strain found during sepsis was identical to an epidemic MRSA related to epidemic MRSA 15 from Great Britain. Control swabs to detect MRSA should be implemented in epidemic areas of MRSA before grafting chronic ulcers.
