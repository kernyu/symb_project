Simulated therapeutic vancomycin exposures were evaluated against agr wild-type and knockout Staphylococcus aureus groups I, II, III, and IV using an in vitro pharmacodynamic model. All agr groups developed intermediate resistance to vancomycin after subtherapeutic exposure. The free unbound fraction of the area under the concentration-time curve (fAUC/MIC) required to suppress resistance was fourfold higher (P < 0.001) in agr dysfunctional strains (112 to 169) than that in parent wild-type strains (28).
