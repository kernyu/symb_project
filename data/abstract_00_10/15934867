Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defence mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs, Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs, the bacterial spectrum is much broader, including Gram-negative, Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors also have to be treated. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; and ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The aim of this review is to highlight the existing, and to describe emerging, treatment options for UTIs.
