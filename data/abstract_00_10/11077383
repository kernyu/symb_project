OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain information for an effective antimicrobial therapy against orofacial odontogenic infections; such information was obtained from recent bacteriologic features and antimicrobial susceptibility data. STUDY DESIGN: The bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogens in 163 patients with orofacial odontogenic infections to 7 antibiotics was examined. RESULTS: Mixed infection of strict anaerobes with facultative anaerobes (especially viridans streptococci) was observed most often in dentoalveolar infections, periodontitis, and pericoronitis. Penicillin (penicillin G) was effective against almost all pathogens, although it did not work well against beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella. Cefmetazole was effective against all test pathogens. Erythromycin was ineffective against viridans streptococci and most Fusobacterium. Clindamycin exerted a strong antimicrobial activity on anaerobes. Minocycline was effective against almost all the test pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of levofloxacin against viridans streptococci was not strong. CONCLUSIONS: An antibiotic that carries out antimicrobial activity against both viridans streptococci and oral anaerobes should be suitable for treatment of dentoalveolar infection, periodontitis, and pericoronitis. Penicillin remains effective as an antimicrobial against most major pathogens in orofacial odontogenic infections. Cefmetazole, clindamycin, and minocycline may be effective against most pathogens, including penicillin-unsusceptible bacteria.
