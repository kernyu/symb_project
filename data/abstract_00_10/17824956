Of the four Plasmodium species that cause human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the most severe form of the disease and this parasite is developing resistance to the major antimalarial drugs. Therefore, in order to control malaria it is necessary to identify new drug targets. One feasible target might be helicases, which are important unwinding enzymes and required for almost all the nucleic acid metabolism in the malaria parasite.
