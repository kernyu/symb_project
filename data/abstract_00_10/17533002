Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are a global health concern. The present study regarded 160 S. aureus strains that had been isolated from 1634 foodstuff samples of animal origin in a previous survey conducted in Italy during 2003-2005. The strains were characterized by detecting the mecA gene, the production of type A to D staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs), and studying their resistance properties against several antibiotics; their ecological origin was determined by biotyping. Of the 160 analyzed S. aureus strains six (3.75%) were mecA positive and derived from six different samples; four isolates were from bovine milk and two from dairy products (pecorino cheese and mozzarella cheese). Two strains isolated from milk belonged to the non-host-specific biovar while the others to the ovine biovar. The strain isolated from mozzarella cheese belonged to the non-host-specific biovar and the strain isolated from pecorino cheese to the ovine biovar. All the MRSA strains isolated were enterotoxigenic; two strains synthesized SEA/SED two SED and one SEC. All the strains showed resistance to at least one of the antibiotics tested but none was resistant to glycopeptides.
