The major cause of chemotherapy failure in patients with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori is clarithromycin (CAM) resistance due to a mutation in the 23S rRNA gene. This study describes a non-invasive and accurate method for the detection of mixed CAM-resistant and -susceptible H. pylori by sequencing of the H. pylori 23S rRNA gene. Faeces were crushed with beads and the 23S rRNA gene was amplified using a nested PCR on the extracted DNA. Mutation analysis of this gene using this method showed that 20.4 % of patients carried mixed CAM-susceptible (wild type) and -resistant (A2142G or A2143G mutant) H. pylori. Furthermore, it was found that 66.6 % of patients who had been treated unsuccessfully carried one of these mutations in the 23S rRNA gene (including the mixed type), whilst standard culture detected CAM-resistant isolates in only 22.2 % of patients with unsuccessful treatment. These data suggest that, for successful therapy, the diagnosis method described here would more accurately detect CAM-resistant H. pylori, including mixed infections.
