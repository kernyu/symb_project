Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was performed on twenty-three pyrimethamine (pyr) derivatives active against quadruple mutant type (Asn51Ile, Cys59Arg, Ser108Asn, Ile164Leu) dihydrofolate reductase of Plasmodium falcipaarum (PfDHFR). The represented CoMFA models were evaluated based on the various three different probe atoms, C(sp3) (+1), O(sp3) (-1) and H (+1), resulting in the best model with combined three types of probe atoms. The statistical results were r(2)(cv) = 0.702, S(press) = 0.608, r(2)(nv) = 0.980, s = 0.156, and r(2)(test-set) = 0.698 which can explain steric contribution of about 50%. In addition, an understanding of particular interaction energy between inhibitor and surrounding residues in the binding pocket was performed by using MP2/6-31G(d,p) quantum chemical calculations. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that Asn108 is the cause of pyr resistance with the highest repulsive interaction energy. Therefore, CoMFA and particular interaction energy analyses can be useful for identifying the structural features of potent pyr derivatives active against quadruple mutant type PfDHFR.
