To evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of an ivermectin controlled-release capsule (IVM-CRC) on the productivity of growing sheep infested with Psoroptes ovis 24 male and 24 female Merino landrace lambs, 5-6 months old and weighing 21.2-35.0 kg, were used. Sixteen replicates of three animals were formed based on sex and Day 0 body weight. Within each replicate animals were randomly allocated to one of three groups: untreated control; IVM-CRC on Day 0; IVM-CRC on Day 84. For treatment an IVM-CRC for sheep weighing 20-45 kg was used which is designed to deliver ivermectin at a minimum dose of 20 microg/kg/day for 100 days. The lambs were infested with 50-60 P. ovis mites each on days 14 and 21. The animals were shorn on Day 126. After slaughter on Day 127 the quality of the leather produced from their skins was evaluated. The IVM-CRC treatment on Day 0 prevented the establishment of P. ovis. All untreated lambs became infested. The lambs treated with an IVM-CRC on Day 84 became mite-free from Day 112 onwards. The lambs which were treated on Day 0 had significantly (p<0.05) greater clean fleece weight (1.5 kg) and fleece yield (52.1%) than the untreated controls (0.9 kg and 34.1%, respectively) or than lambs treated on Day 84 (1.0 kg and 47.8%, respectively). Clean fleece weight and fleece yield were in the tendency (p=0.055) or significantly (p<0. 001) greater, respectively, for lambs treated on Day 84 than for the untreated controls. The chrome tanned dried crust leather of all untreated controls and six of the 16 lambs treated on Day 84 showed grain surface defects such as discolourations, indurations and coarse, pitted grain. The useful (defect-free) leather size was significantly (p<0.01) higher for the lambs treated on Day 0 (100%) than for the lambs treated on Day 84 (82.7%) and the untreated controls (7.8%). The physical testing revealed that the leather of sheep treated on Day 0 had significantly (p<0.05) higher thickness, elongation break and tear resistance than the leather of both untreated controls and sheep treated on Day 84. There were no significant differences in the physical characteristics of the leather of the untreated controls and the sheep treated on Day 84.
