The binding sites of wild-type avian influenza A H5N1 neuraminidase, as well as those of the Tamiflu (oseltamivir)-resistant H274Y variant, were explored computationally to design inhibitors that target simultaneously several adjacent binding sites of the open conformation of the virus protein. The compounds with the best computed free energies of binding, in agreement by two docking methods, consensus scoring, and ligand efficiency values, suggest that mimicking a polysaccharide, beta-lactam, and other structures, including known drugs, could be routes for multibinding site inhibitor design. This new virtual screening method based on consensus scoring and ligand efficiency indices is introduced, which allows the combination of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties into unique measures.
