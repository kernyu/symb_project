INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
