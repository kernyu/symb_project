OBJECTIVES: To characterize class 1 and class 2 integrons which were simultaneously detected in non-typhoid Salmonella enterica strains of non-prevalent serovars, and to investigate their possible association with transposons and/or plasmids. METHODS: Eight multidrug-resistant S. enterica strains belonging to serovars Virchow (4), Panama (2), Grumpensis (1) and Worthington (1), each containing a class 1 and a class 2 integron, were analysed. Nested PCR amplification was used to determine the gene-cassette configuration of the integrons. Overlapping PCR amplifications were applied in integron-transposon linkage experiments. Conjugation and hybridization experiments were used to localize integrons and transposons in the bacterial genome (plasmid and chromosome associated). RESULTS: One of two different class 1 integrons (with variable regions of 1000 bp/aadA1 and 2300 bp/sat-smr-aadA1) inserted into Tn21-like transposons, were found to coexist with the class 2 integron (2300 bp/dfrA1-sat1-aadA1) of Tn7 in the analysed strains. Class 1 integrons were always found in large conjugative plasmids whereas apparently intact or defective copies of the Tn7 integron could be located on the same plasmid and/or the bacterial chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes different associations between mobile genetic elements that play a crucial role in the capture and spread of antimicrobial drug resistance. As far as we are aware, this is the first description of class 2 integrons in serovars Panama, Grumpensis and Worthington.
