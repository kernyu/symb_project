Meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae represents an important factor of morbidity and mortality in humans. In a significant number of cases, this disease is associated with specific clones of the organism, the so-called invasive pneumococcal clones. The aim of the study was to analyze 156 S. pneumoniae isolates identified as etiological agents of meningitis in Poland in the years 1997 through 2002. The isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and the results were compared with those obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and with the MLST data on invasive pneumococci from other countries. Eighty-nine different sequence types were found in the group of isolates, 50 of which had been known before including 19 of the major invasive clones. However, a significant fraction of the isolates possessed novel combinations of known and new MLST alleles. The majority of penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates belonged to the group of international multiresistant clones (Spain(23F)-1, Spain(6B)-2, Spain(9V)-3, Poland(23F)-16, and Poland(6B)-20), which underlined the importance of these in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. The results of the MLST analysis correlated well with the PFGE data, thus again demonstrating good congruence between the two typing methods for S. pneumoniae. The majority of the isolates (95.5%) belonged to families 1 or 2 of the surface protein PspA, confirming its potential usefulness as the vaccine antigen candidate.
