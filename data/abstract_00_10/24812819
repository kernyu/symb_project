Emergence and broad spread of chloroquine resistance urge human beings to change drug policy in malaria control and to find more effective new drugs. Nevertheless, chloroquine is still used in the treatment of falciparum malaria in some poor endemic regions due to economic and development reasons. It should be of great significance to understand the mechanism of chloroquine resistance and find the way to reverse it in order to bring chloroquine with high efficacy and low cost back to the first line of the combat to malaria. Advent and development of resistance reversal agents provide a new clue for this purpose. When used together with chloroquine, it can partly restore the efficacy of chloroquine in resistant Plasmodium falciparum. The article summarizes the research progress on chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum and resistance reverses.
