Twenty-five clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori strains (selected by agar dilution) were studied to detect A2142G and A2143G mutations in the 23S rRNA gene by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method and an A2142C mutation by PCR using a 3'-mismatched specific primer. A 700-bp amplified fragment was obtained by the mismatched PCR only in strains without an A2142G or A2143G mutation, indicating that those strains had the A2142C mutation.
