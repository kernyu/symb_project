The in vitro susceptibility of 225 clinical isolates of yeasts to ciclopiroxolamine (CPO) was compared with that of clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, tioconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and nystatin using a standardized agar diffusion method (NeoSensitabs). Two hundred and eight strains of yeasts comprising 16 species of Candida and 22 strains belonging to other yeast genera were tested. One strain (0.4%) was resistant, four strains (1.8%) of intermediate susceptibility and 220 strains (97.3%) susceptible to CPO. More strains were susceptible to CPO than to the other antifungals studied. Susceptibility patterns of antifungal agents were not linked to species. The in vitro antifungal susceptibility profile of CPO was better than topical azole derivatives or fluconazole and itraconazole against a wide variety of clinically important yeasts.
