We investigated the safety and efficacy of a methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (M-VAC) combination regimen as second-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma who failed first-line gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy. Thirty patients who had progressed or relapsed after GC chemotherapy as first-line treatment were enrolled in this study. The major toxicities were neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia. A grade 3 or 4 neutropaenia occurred in 19 (63.3%) and a grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopaenia developed in nine patients (30.0%). There were no life-threatening complications during the study. The overall response was 30%. A complete response was achieved in two patients (6.7%) and a partial response in seven (23.3%). The overall disease control rate was 50%. Seven out of 16 patients who had responded previously to GC responded to M-VAC, while 2 out of 14 who had not responded to GC responded to M-VAC. The median response duration was 3.9 months and the median progression-free survival was 5.3 months. The median overall survival was 10.9 months. M-VAC showed encouraging efficacy and reversible toxicities in patients who had progressed after GC chemotherapy and, especially, M-VAC appears to be a reasonable option as a sequential treatment regimen in patients who responded previously to GC chemotherapy.
