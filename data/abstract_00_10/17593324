Necrotising fasciitis (NF) is an extremely rare skin and soft tissue infection with extensive necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and underlying fascia, which usually affects the limbs and trunk. It rarely affects the head and neck region because of the excellent blood supply in this region. We report a case of NF initially misdiagnosed as a traumatic pre-septal cellulitis following self-puncture of a hordeolum externum (stye) and its resistance to aggressive antibiotic therapy resulting in the loss of the lower eyelid.
