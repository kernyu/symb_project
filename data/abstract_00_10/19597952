The antimicrobial susceptibility of Clostridium perfringens strains isolated from Belgian broilers between May and September 2007 was investigated. All 39 tested isolates were sensitive to enrofloxacin, erythromycin, tylosin, florfenicol and bacitracin. Twenty-six (66%) and 24 (61%) out of the 39 tested isolates showed acquired resistance to tetracycline and lincomycin, respectively. The C. perfringens isolates were also screened by PCR for the presence of the resistance genes tet(K), tet(L), tet(M), tetB(P), tet(O), tet(W), lnu(A) and lnu (B). In 22/26 tetracycline resistant strains and 7/24 lincomycin resistant strains, resistance could be attributed to one or more of these genes. An extended frequency distribution range of MICs was seen for ampicillin. These data are consistent with data derived from studies carried out in 1980 and in 2004, indicating that no changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns have taken place during time in C. perfringens isolates from broilers in Belgium.
