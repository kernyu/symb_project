The management and outcome of all cases of gonorrhoea which presented to a south London genitourinary medicine clinic during 1999 were assessed and compared with published national guidelines. The incidence of penicillin resistance was calculated, as was the rate of co-infection with chlamydia and trichomonas. Information regarding demographic data, microscopy, culture results, test of cure, antibiotic use, sensitivity and health adviser contact was examined. A total of 257 cases of gonorrhoea were diagnosed in 238 patients. Heterosexual men constituted 52.9% of cases, 6.6% were in homosexual men and 40.5% in women. Direct microscopy was positive in 88.8% of men and in 40.5% of women. In women, the rate of gonorrhoea co-infection with chlamydia was 34.7% and with trichomonas was 11.5%. In men the rate of chlamydia co-infection was only 3.3%, however, we do not believe this to be an accurate figure as we are unable to routinely screen all men for chlamydia due to financial restrictions. Amoxicillin with probenecid were the most commonly used antibiotics in line with local guidelines. Penicillin resistance was demonstrated in 4.6% of infected cases. Health advisers saw 73.2% of patients.
