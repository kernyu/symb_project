Pulvinones were synthesized (>180) in arrays and evaluated as inhibitors of early stage cell wall biosynthesis enzymes MurA-MurD. Several pulvinones inhibited Mur enzymes with IC(50)'s in the 1-10 microg/mL range and demonstrated antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphyloccus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
