BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is recognized as an increasing problem in China. It is widely believed that because antibiotics are available without a prescription, changing physician prescribing behaviors will not decrease inappropriate usage. This study identified the sources of antibiotics and the important influence that physicians have on antibiotic use by children in one region of China. METHODS: Trained medical professionals surveyed parents of children attending several kindergartens in urban Beijing and rural Gu'An, Hebei County. Parents completed a questionnaire concerning the children's recent illnesses, care-seeking patterns and antibiotic use. The team also observed hospital- and non-hospital-based pharmacy purchases of antibiotics for children, assessed the proportion accompanied by a prescription and then interviewed parents about factors influencing those purchases. RESULTS: Of 241 urban and 143 rural kindergarten parents, 76 to 82% usually obtained children's antibiotics from a hospital pharmacy (with a prescription). For 84% the first source of care was usually a physician (primarily western medicine, sometimes traditional Chinese medicine). Only 5% of antibiotics were obtained from independent vendors without prior physician consultation. Among 229 observed antibiotic purchases 72% occurred at hospital-based facilities, even after longer observation times at nonhospital pharmacies. Prescriptions accompanied all hospital-based antibiotic purchases, contrasting with 18% of nonhospital transactions (P < 0.001). Together 86% of parents self-reported that the observed purchase stemmed from a doctor's recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors directly and indirectly controlled the majority of antibiotic usage for childhood illnesses in Beijing and Gu'An (Hebei County). Physician education and implementation of treatment guidelines might substantially reduce inappropriate antimicrobial usage and help prevent antimicrobial resistance in this region.
