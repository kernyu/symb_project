The susceptibilities of clinical vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), heterogeneous VISA, and laboratory-generated linezolid-resistant S. aureus strains to the new oxazolidinone AZD2563 were assessed by agar dilution MIC determination. All clinical strains were susceptible to linezolid, and the linezolid MICs for them were equal to or twofold higher than those of AZD2563. Cross-resistance with linezolid was seen in laboratory-generated mutants, and for these strains the MIC of AZD2563 was twofold higher than that of linezolid.
