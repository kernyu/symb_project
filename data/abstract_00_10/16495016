Thirty, 4-month-old entire Santa Ines lambs were grazed on an Andropogon gayanus pasture, during a 34-week period (rainy season weeks 0-20 and dry season weeks 21-34) and allocated in two treatment groups (n = 15) each with different protein supplementation: high protein (HP-19% CP) and low protein (LP-11% CP). These were subdivided into those receiving anthelmintic treatment (c) (n = 7) and without anthelmintic treatment (i) (n = 8). The objective was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with protein on resistance and resilience to natural helminth infection of hair breed lambs. Lamb weight, blood collection and faecal egg counts (FEC) were carried out monthly. The lambs were slaughtered after 34 weeks, when worm burdens, worm length and eosinophil cell counts were taken. The sheep on treatments HPc and HPi were heavier in live weight than those from LPi and LPc (P < 0.05) at the end of the rainy period. The HPc group finished heavier (P < 0.05) than the other groups in the dry season, which had no significant differences between them. The predominant species of nematode found was T. colubriformis followed by H. contortus, Trichuris globulosa and Moniezia expansa. Animals on HPi had lower FEC than LPi (P < 0.05). The number of worms was lower for both HP groups (P < 0.05) with worm length shorter in the HPc group (P < 0.05) compared with all other groups. The number of eosinophils was higher in animals in the LPi group, which also showed anaemia and lower plasma urea at the end of the dry season. Diet supplementation with high protein was able to improve resilience and resistance to natural infection by endoparasites during the rainy season. In the dry season there was a decrease in both of these traits, which were intimately linked to the quality of available forage under tropical conditions.
