Chronic viral hepatitis has emerged as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among HIV-positive patients. These individuals are at risk for aggressive chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and eventually, death. Currently available therapies for hepatitis B are limited and include interferon-alpha, lamivudine (3TC), and adefovir. Tenofovir (TDF), a recently approved drug for the treatment of HIV, is also active against hepatitis B. We report the case of a HIV-positive patient with liver cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) with evidence of resistance to 3TC. The patient was initially accepted as a liver transplant candidate. However, when TDF was added to his treatment, a remarkable virologic and histopathologic improvement was achieved. The patient was subsequently removed from the liver transplant program and has not suffered from any further hepatic complications.
