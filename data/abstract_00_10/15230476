Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) resistance to ganciclovir results from mutations in viral phosphotransferase (UL97) and/or DNA polymerase (UL54) genes. The HCMV isolates from the blood of immunocompromised patients with persisting presence of the pp65 antigen in the blood in spite of ganciclovir therapy were tested for ganciclovir susceptibility by an immediate-early antigen plaque reduction assay, and the UL54 and UL97 genes were sequenced. Nine isolates from eight patients (six patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), one liver transplant recipient and one renal transplant recipient) showed phenotypic resistance to ganciclovir. All these ganciclovir-resistant HCMV isolates harbored one or more of the following UL97 mutations: M460V, A594V, A594T, L595S, C603W, and M615V. Two isolates harbored the P522S mutation in the UL54 gene. The M615V mutation in the UL97 gene has not been reported earlier and its role in ganciclovir resistance remains to be elucidated. In ganciclovir-resistant HCMV isolates the UL54 gene was less frequently mutated than the UL97 gene. The P522S mutation was relatively frequent in UL54-mutated HCMV isolates.
