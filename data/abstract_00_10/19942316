INTRODUCTION: The prognosis for Fusarium keratitis is poor. Effective drugs to treat this infection are therefore needed. CASE REPORT: A patient presented Fusarium solani keratitis. The infection regressed with topical amphotericin B and intravenous voriconazole. Topical steroids were introduced. There was reactivation and extension of the infection, invading the anterior chamber. Steroids were discontinued and the antifungal treatment was restarted but there was continued deterioration. Recovery was achieved without surgery, with topical voriconazole, topical liposomal amphotericin B, topical natamycin, intravenous liposomal amphotericin B, and intravenous voriconazole. CONCLUSION: Combined orally and topically administered voriconazole is a promising therapy when the minimum inhibitory concentration is approximately 2 microg/ml. Liposomal amphotericin B seems to be the most effective drug for the different infection stages. Posaconazole is a useful alternative but further investigations must be pursued.
