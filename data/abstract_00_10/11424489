A questionnaire survey on the theory of postoperative infection prophylaxis was conducted to obtain the consensus on perioperative antimicrobial use among orthopedists in Japan in the period from April to September 2000. Fifty of the 91 orthopedists replied, and the following consensus was obtained. An antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) agent should be chosen based on their efficacy against the pathogens expected to be contaminants, such as Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp., Use an AMP agent that achieves a bactericidal concentration in both the serum and operating site. Use an AMP agent that has little unfavourable side effects. Use an AMP agent that affects minimally the normal bacterial flora. The most commonly used agents are the penicillins and first and second generation cephalosporins. The optimal strategy for most commonly used agents entails infusion of the first dose between approximately 30 minutes pre and post-skin incision and the therapeutic levels should be maintained throughout the operation. The AMP agents having no cross-resistance to the prophylactic agents should be used, if postoperative infection is suspected or developed. The most commonly used agent for both clean operations with or without foreign implants and dirty operations is cefazolin (CEZ), followed by cefotiam (CTM) and flomoxef (FMOX).
