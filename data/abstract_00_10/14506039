ABT-492 demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against most quinolone-susceptible pathogens. The rank order of potency was ABT-492 > trovafloxacin > levofloxacin > ciprofloxacin against quinolone-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. ABT-492 had activity comparable to those of trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against seven species of quinolone-susceptible members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, although it was less active than the comparators against Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. The activity of ABT-492 was greater than those of the comparators against fastidious gram-negative species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Helicobacter pylori. ABT-492 was as active as trovafloxacin against Chlamydia trachomatis, indicating good intracellular penetration and antibacterial activity. In particular, ABT-492 was more active than trovafloxacin and levofloxacin against multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin and macrolides, and H. influenzae, including beta-lactam-resistant strains. It retained greater in vitro activity than the comparators against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains resistant to other quinolones due to amino acid alterations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the target topoisomerases. ABT-492 was a potent inhibitor of bacterial topoisomerases, and unlike the comparators, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from either Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli were almost equally sensitive to ABT-492. The profile of ABT-492 suggested that it may be a useful agent for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, as well as infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream, and skin and skin structure and nosocomial lung infections.
