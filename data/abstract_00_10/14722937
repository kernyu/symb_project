Clinical and bacteriological efficacy of linezolid in the treatment of cardiosurgical patients with various localization nosocomial infections due to problem grampositive cocci was estimated. The group included 10 patients: children at the age 3 months to 12 years (n = 3) and adults at the age of 17 to 65 years (n = 7) with infectious complications such as infectious endocarditis (n = 4), pneumonia (n = 2), wound infection (n = 3) and sepsis (n = 1). All the patients isolated MR staphylococci. The use of glycopeptides was not possible in 6 patients because of vancomycin intolerance (n = 1), renal insufficiency (n = 1) and failure of the previous vancomycin therapy (n = 4). To all the patients linezolid was administered per os (tablets or suspension) or intravenously (infusion solution) in doses of 600 mg twice a day (1200 mg a day) for the adults and 10 mg/kg body weight every 12 hours (20 mg/kg body weight a day) for the children. Linezolid monotherapy was applied to 2 patients. 8 patients were treated with linezolid in combination with some other antibiotics. By the clinical findings the positive dynamics confirmed by thermometry and hemograms was observed in 8 patients beginning from the 4th day of the linezolid use. Eradication of MR staphylococci from the blood, sputum and wounds was stated in all 10 patients. No toxic or adverse reactions were noted. It was concluded that linezolid is an optimal alternative to vancomycin especially when the use of the latter is not possible. No nephrotoxic effects of linezolid provided its recommendation as a drug of choice in the treatment of patients with renal disturbances, including polyorganic insufficiency.
