BACKGROUND: The role played by odontogenic infection in dental, oral, and maxillofacial surgery is not to be underestimated even at the present time. An extensive, standardized, prospective study was performed with the intention of verifying the bacterial spectrum of odontogenic infections to evaluate antibiotic sensitivity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial spectra and resistograms of 65 patients with an odontogenic infection were analyzed in a prospective study under standardized conditions for specimen collection and transport. RESULTS: A total of 226 bacterial strains were analyzed. The ratio between anaerobes and aerobes was approximately 2:1. The most frequent aerobes were members of the genera Streptococcus (46 isolates), Staphylococcus (10 isolates), and Neisseria (9 isolates), respectively. The anaerobic gram-positive spectrum was dominated by members of the genera Eubacterium (19 isolates), Peptostreptococcus (16 isolates), and Actinomyces (12 isolates). The most frequently isolated gram-negative anaerobes were Prevotella (46 isolates), and Fusobacterium (21 isolates). The overall resistance to antibiotics was very low: only 7.3% of all bacteria were resistant to penicillin G/V, and 8.8% showed resistance to ampicillin. The resistance rates to other beta-lactam antibiotics were 4.4% to piperacillin and 0.6% to imipenem, respectively. Penicillin G presented the highest antimicrobial activity among aerobes: only 4.5% of anaerobic strains were resistant of penicillin G. The other resistance rates of anaerobic bacteria to antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin 24%, doxycycline 34%, erythromycin 18%, and clindamycin 9.3%. Penicillin G was also highly antimicrobially active to anaerobes. The resistance rates were: penicillin G 8.1%, ampicillin 2.6%, doxycycline 9.2%, erythromycin 10.2%, and clindamycin 1.4%, respectively.
