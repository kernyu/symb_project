Previous studies have suggested that Mycobacterium tuberculosis kasA G312S and G269S gene mutations may represent sequence polymorphisms of the M. tuberculosis East-African-Indian (EAI) and T families, respectively, rather than relating to isoniazid resistance. The present study examined polymorphisms of these two codons in 98 drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates (68 EAI and 30 T isolates). Twenty-eight isolates belonging to a sub-lineage of the EAI family had the kasA G312S mutation, but none of the 30 T isolates had the G269S mutation. The data suggest that the kasA G312S mutation is not related to isoniazid resistance, but represents a sequence polymorphism in a sub-lineage of the EAI family.
