Patients with diabetes mellitus and urinary tract infection were examined. The structure of the pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility were investigated. Escherichia coli was shown to be the main pathogen of urinary tract infections in the patients with diabetes mellitus. The highest activity against the E. coli isolates was revealed in amoxycillin/clavulanate (92% of the susceptible strains), the 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, amikacin (100%) and fluoroquinolones (96%). At the same time the isolates were resistant to aminopenicillins and co-trimoxazole (29.3 and 16% respectively).
