BACKGROUND: Central venous catheter (CVC)-related bloodstream infections (BSIs) are known to increase rates of morbidity and mortality in both inpatients and outpatients, including hematology-oncology patients and those undergoing hemodialysis or home infusion therapy. Biofilm-associated organisms on the lumens of these catheters have reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial chemotherapy. This study tested the efficacy of tetrasodium EDTA as a catheter lock solution on biofilms of several clinically relevant microorganisms. METHODS: Biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans were grown to levels of approximately 1 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/cm(-1) on CVC segments in a model system, then subjected to the tetrasodium EDTA lock treatment. RESULTS: Comparisons of biofilms before and after exposure to the 40-mg/mL(-1) tetrasodium EDTA lock for 21 hours showed that the biofilm viable cell counts of all organisms tested were significantly reduced (P < .05) after exposure to the treatment. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial lock treatment using 40 mg/mL(-1) of tetrasodium EDTA for at least 21 hours could significantly reduce or potentially eradicate CVC-associated biofilms of clinically relevant microorganisms.
