AstraZeneca is developing AZD-2563, an oxazolidinone with a novel mechanism of action, for the potential treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant strains [349551], [399542]. As of December 2001, AZD-2563 had completed an escalating-dose phase I trial in the UK and was being developed in the US [433897]; at this time, AstraZeneca did not expect launch until after 2004 [431673]. In October 2001, Morgan Stanley estimated launch in 2004 with sales of US $20 million in that year, rising to US $46 million in following years [429700].
