The authors analyzed the immediate results of surgical treatment in 110 patients with destructive pulmonary tuberculosis with extreme drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Out of the 110 patients, 118 were discharged from hospital and 2 continued treatment at the study. A complete clinical effect (abacillation and no decay cavities) was achieved in 96 (88.9%) patients; improvement (abacillation with the decay cavity being preserved in the contralateral lung) was seen in 5 (4.6%) patients. In the discharged patients, decay cavities and bacterial excretion were preserved in 7 (6.5%) cases after palliative unilateral surgery for bilateral destructive pulmonaty tuberculosis. However, they showed a certain resolution as bleeding arrest or reduced intoxication. All postoperative complications developing in 18 (16.4%) patients were eliminated. There were no fatal outcomes. The paper discusses surgical techniques used in drug-resistant tuberculosis. Key words: surgical treatment, destructive pulmonary tuberculosis.
