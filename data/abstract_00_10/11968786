Recently, resistance testing of HIV-1 become available to clinicians in Japan. Retrospective studies show that results of these tests predict the response to salvage therapy, and randomized, controlled clinical trials show short-term virologic benefits of resistance testing as a guide to selecting salvage regimens. But the ultimate role for resistance testing in HIV clinical practice is yet to be determined fully. Both phenotypic and genotypic tests have yet to be fully standardized. Interpretation of results is still an 'art', and access to testing is still limited by cost considerations. This review will describe some of the tools that are available for interpreting genotypic assays.
