We surveyed macrolide resistance in 1,086 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, collected between 1983 and 1998, from throat swabs of children with untreated pharyngotonsillitis living in Torino (northwest Italy). In 1983 and 1985, the frequency of erythromycin resistance was 10%, and from 1990 to 1992 it was 4%. However, it rose to 16.6% in 1994 and reached 51% in 1996 before decreasing to 38.5% in 1998. Characterization of the phenotype of resistant isolates revealed the prevalence of constitutive resistance (CR) in 1996, whereas the M phenotype, characterized by resistance to 14- and 15-membered macrolides with susceptibility to clindamycin and streptogramin B, prevailed in 1998. Moreover, in 1997 we observed an increase in the frequency of autoagglutinating bacteria and, in 1998, of OF-negative S. pyogenes. Meanwhile, penicillin tolerance, assessed in the isolates collected from 1990 to 1996, decreased and disappeared. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was used to obtain the genomic profile of 32 S. pyogenes strains. Four main DNA profiles were demonstrated, generally related to the macrolide-resistance phenotype and for the major part to the T serotype. These results indicate that RAPD is reliable as a first screening method in the epidemiological characterization of resistant S. pyogenes.
