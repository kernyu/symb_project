Forty-nine children aged 0.2-13 years with bullous and eroded lesions, from which Staphylococcus aureus was isolated, were diagnosed with impetigo and entered into a randomized, open-labeled trial of topical oxytetracycline hydrochloride (tetracycline) compared with a combination of topical tetracycline and oral antibiotics. After one week of topical tetracycline treatment, 22 of the 28 patients were clinically cured, and the remaining six patients had improved. In the other treatment group, 14 patients of 21 were clinically cured and 7 patients improved by the combination of topical tetracycline and oral antibiotics. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Therefore, the present study suggests that topical tetracycline treatment is effective for the treatment of impetigo.
