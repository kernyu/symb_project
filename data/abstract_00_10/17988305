We report a case of a 16-year-old female patient with sickle-cell disease with a liver abscess secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She had initially presented with jaundice and abdominal pain and subsequently underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy for removal of gallstones. However, post-cholecystectomy she presented with generalized abdominal pain and computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a liver abscess. A pigtail catheter was inserted into the abscess and culture of the aspirate yielded MRSA (susceptibility pattern of the organism was compatible with community-acquired MRSA). She was treated with intravenous clindamycin for 6 weeks with complete resolution of the abscess.
