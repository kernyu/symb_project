Bacteria not proficient in nitrogen fixing symbiosis were proven able to invade root nodules of three wild legumes of the genus Hedysarum in Algeria and to be multiplying in these in place of the natural rhizobium symbionts. The involved species featured taxa known as human pathogens including: Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter kobei, Escherichia vulneris, Pantoea agglomerans and Leclercia adecarboxylata. A direct screening of the phenotypic determinants of virulence using human cultured cells tested positive for the traits of cytotoxicity, vital stain exclusion and adhesion to epithelia. Antibiogram analyses revealed also a complex pattern of multiple antibiotic resistances. The data suggest that legume root nodules can be a site of survival and of active multiplication for populations of mammalian pathogens, which could thus alternate between the target animal and a number of neutral plant hosts. The worldwide distribution of as yet uninvestigated legumes raises the concern that these represent a general niche that could enhance the hazards posed by microorganisms of clinical nature.
