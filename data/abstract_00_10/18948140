The 21st International Conference on Antiviral Research provided novel insights and approaches to drug discovery across a wide array of virologic fields. Topics ranged from the chemical synthesis of new compounds against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to the long-term use of established drugs against influenza. A session on novel targets for HIV therapy focused on the importance of Apobec3G, LEDGF/p75 and other cellular factors as innovative ways to control infection. New targets for hepatitis B and C viruses were surveyed. There were also discussions as to how the development of new antiviral compounds might lead to novel mechanisms of drug resistance by HIV, herpesviruses and hepatitis viruses. These covered such issues as transmission dynamics, viral fitness, the acquisition of differential resistance patterns depending on viral subtype, and clinical outcomes. Drug efficacy, toxicity, patient adherence, treatment interruption and the importance of generic drugs in resource-poor settings were also extensively discussed. These topics will all play a pivotal role in drug development and the management of viral infections in the years to come.
