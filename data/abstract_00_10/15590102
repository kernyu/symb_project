Using high-density oligonucleotide array technology, 30 Staphylococcus aureus strains were studied for the presence of mutations in genes involved in fluoroquinolone resistance: grlA, gyrA, grlB and gyrB. For the two most important genes, gyrA and grlA, correlation with sequencing reached 95.1%. If all genes were considered, correlation was 88.8%.
