Comparative data are given on the in vitro activity of lysosubtilin against micro-organisms and its acid-resistant derivative, Fermosorb. The lytic activity Fermosorb against all micro-organisms tested was higher (in the range of 0.9-7.7 and 4.1-13.5% for bacteria and filamentous fungi/yeasts, respectively) than that achieved by the action of lytic enzymes present in lysosubtilin solution. All six lysosubtilin-resistant strains tested were Fermosorb-susceptible. Considering the increase in the incidence of antibiotic resistance antimicrobial enzymotherapy or enzymoprophylaxis by means of Fermosorb might be considered for the treatment of intestinal infections in animals.
