Tuberculosis is an important cause of death in the world. It can be controlled by applying the WHO 'directly observed therapy, short-course' (DOTS) strategy. This strategy aims at detecting at least 70% of new, smear-positive tuberculosis cases and curing at least 85% of these. At present, only 27% of tuberculosis cases are treated according to this strategy. Application of the WHO DOTS strategy can prevent multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. However, where MDR tuberculosis has become a large problem, as it has in some Eastern European countries, additional measures may be required for its control. Important problems remain with respect to the feasibility and costs of these measures and the prevention of additional resistance.
