The in vitro activities of 15 antimicrobial agents against 195 strains of Escherichia coli isolated from dairy calves affected by neonatal diarrhoea were determined. Of these strains 137 produced one or more potential virulence factors (F5, F41, F17, cytotoxic necrotizing factor, verotoxin and the eae gene), but the remaining 58 strains did not produce any of these factors. The overall percentage of resistant strains to streptomycin, tylosin and tetracycline was very high (above 65%). A high level of resistance (from 23 to 50%) to ampicillin, neomycin, kanamycin, spectinomycin, chloramphenicol, sulphadimethoxine and trimethoprim was also detected. The E. coli strains were very susceptible (89-95%) to apramycin and gentamicin and highly susceptible (99-100%) to polymyxin B, florfenicol and nitrofurazone. Some significant differences (P < 0.05) in the frequencies of resistance to some of the antimicrobials tested and in the rates of multi-drug resistance among the strains producing potential virulence factors and non-fimbriated, non-toxigenic, eae-negative strains were found. Most of the strains showed multi-resistance: 76.9% of the isolates were resistant to at least two antibiotics, 67.7% were resistant to at least four antibiotics and 50.3% were resistant to at least six antibiotics.
