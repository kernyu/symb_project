We investigated the susceptibilities against 7 antimicrobial agents in Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli isolates from food-producing animals in 2004. In comparison with the results of past surveillance, no significant difference was observed in resistance rates against all of the antimicrobials tested in Campylobacter isolates. However, slight increase of erythromycin (EM) resistance was found in C. coli isolates from pigs. We examined the mutation of the 23S rRNA gene and their susceptibilities against azithromycin, tylosin, and lincomycin in 44 EM-resistant isolates and 28 susceptible isolates of porcine origin. All the EM-resistant isolates contained A2075G in the 23S rRNA gene and showed cross-resistance to azithromycin, tylosin, and lyncomycin.
