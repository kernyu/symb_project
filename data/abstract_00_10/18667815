BACKGROUND: The problem of antimicrobial resistance requires common strategies at the European level. METHODS: We report on an EU initiative fostering antibiotic (AB) stewardship (ABS) in hospitals. RESULTS: The project 'ABS International: implementing antibiotic strategies for appropriate use of antibiotics in hospitals in member states of the EU' started in September 2006 in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia. A training program for national ABS trainers was prepared and standard templates for ABS tools (AB list, guidelines for AB treatment and surgical prophylaxis, and AB-related organization) and valid process measures as well as quality indicators for AB use were developed. Specific ABS tools are being implemented in up to five health care facilities per country. CONCLUSION: ABS International is the first EU-funded initiative focusing on the implementation of structural measures in hospitals to promote the prudent use of ABs.
