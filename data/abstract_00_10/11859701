INTRODUCTION: Treatment of cerebral tuberculomas demands the combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. The place of fluoroquinolones remains to be defined. EXEGESIS: A 36-year-old woman presented with a cerebral tuberculoma. Treatment with an antituberculous quadritherapy regimen was begun, but because of serious side effects, isoniazid and rifampicin weren't withdrawn during the fourth month. Sparfloxacin and ethambutol biotherapy was then started and continued for 12 months, which led to the disappearance of the cerebral lesion. CONCLUSION: Our observation proves that sparfloxacin is an alternative for cerebral tuberculoma treatment in case of intolerance or resistance to first-line antituberculosis drugs.
