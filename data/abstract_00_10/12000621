Biocides and other antimicrobial agents have been employed for centuries. Much later, iodine found use as a wound disinfectant, chlorine water in obstetrics, alcohol as a hand disinfectant and phenol as a wound dressing and in antiseptic surgery. In the early part of the twentieth century, other chlorine-releasing agents (CRAs), and acridine and other dyes were introduced, as were some quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs, although these were only used as biocides from the 1930s). Later still, various phenolics and alcohols, formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide were introduced and subsequently (although some had actually been produced at an earlier date) biguanides, iodophors, bisphenols, aldehydes, diamidines, isocyanurates, isothiazolones and peracetic acid. Antibiotics were introduced clinically in the 1940s, although sulphonamides had been synthesized and used previously. After penicillin came streptomycin and other aminoglycosides-aminocyclitols, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, macrolides, semi-synthetic beta-lactams, glycopeptides, lincosamides, 4-quinolones and diaminopyrimidines. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is causing great concern. Mechanisms of such resistance include cell impermeability, target site mutation, drug inactivation and drug efflux. Bacterial resistance to biocides was described in the 1950s and 1960s and is also apparently increasing. Of the biocides listed above, cationic agents (QACs, chlorhexidine, diamidines, acridines) and triclosan have been implicated as possible causes for the selection and persistence of bacterial strains with low-level antibiotic resistance. It has been claimed that the chronological emergence of qacA and qacB determinants in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus mirrors the introduction and usage of cationic biocides.
