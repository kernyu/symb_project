In this study, we analysised the safety of 137 strains of starters culture bacteria in fermented milk between 2000 and 2006 in China. The study was designed to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of 137 strains to mice, and 31 of 137 strains for Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 20 kinds of antibiotics by broth micro-dilution method. The result indicated that except a strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, other probiotics were non-pathogenic and safe for human consumption. 31 strains of probiotics were sensitive to Ampicillin, Penicillin, Imipenem, Gentamicine, Amoxicillin, Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, Gatifloxacin, Erythromycin, Clindamycin, and were resistant to Nalidixic acid, Vancomycine, Fosfomycin.
