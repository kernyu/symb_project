Single-agent gemcitabine has shown encouraging results in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This phase II study further explored the potential of a gemcitabine-based regimen in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL. Patients <70 years old received the PDG regimen: gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8), dexamethasone (40 mg/m(2), days 1-4), and cisplatin (100 mg/m(2), day 1). Patients >/=70 years of age received dexamethasone and gemcitabine only (DG regimen). Thirty patients (12 in the DG group, 18 in the PDG group) with a median age 66.5 years (range, 47-81) received a median of six cycles in both groups. The overall response rate was 36.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 15.2% to 64.6%] with the DG regimen and 44.4% (95% CI 24.6% to 66.3%) with the PDG regimen. The median progression-free survival was 3 months (95% CI 0.0-7.9) in the DG group and 8.5 months (95% CI 4.8-12.2) in the PDG group. With a median follow-up of 38.8 months, 13 patients (including 11 given PDG) are still alive. DG was well tolerated, and thrombocytopenia was the most prevalent toxicity in patients receiving PDG. Both regimens deserve to be further investigated as a backbone for combination chemotherapy in patients with MCL.
