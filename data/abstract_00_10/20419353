PURPOSE: To evaluate the clonal relatedness and drug susceptibility of Streptococcus epidermidis isolated from hematological patients. METHODS: All S. epidermidis isolated from hematological patients who developed bloodstream infections between June 2005 and December 2007 were included. The clonal relationship was tested by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) isolates were examined from patients' blood culture samples. Two subgroups that differed approximately by 40% in their PFGE banding were identified. In clinical practice, two cases were cured with cephalosporin only, thus demonstrating sensitivity of the strains to beta-lactam antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results represent two significant findings. One is the major capability of MRSE to colonize patients. The other is that some MRSE isolates proved to be sensitive to clindamycin, minocycline, and cephalosporin, so that using antibiotics to which MRSE is sensitive as first-line therapy can avoid the need for vancomycin in clinical settings.
