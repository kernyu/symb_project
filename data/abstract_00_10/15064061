The growing resistance to antimicrobial agents of all respiratory tract bacterial pathogens has made the management of sinusitis more difficult. The upper respiratory tract including the nasopharynx serves as the reservoir for pathogenic bacteria that can cause respiratory infections including sinusitis. During a viral respiratory infection, potential pathogens can relocate from the nasopharynx into the sinus cavity, causing sinusitis. Establishment of the correct microbiology of all forms of sinusitis is of primary importance, because it can serve as a guide for choosing the adequate antimicrobial therapy. This article summarizes the current information regarding the microbiology of all forms of sinusitis and approaches to antimicrobial therapy.
