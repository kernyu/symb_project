While the post-genomic era could lead into new targets for antimalarial drug development, herein few successful targets including medicinals involved in those processes are presented. Further, contribution of bioinorganic chemistry has also started to make its impact in the field of pharmaceuticals. Therefore, metal chelators, selected organometallics, and metalloantimalarials that would offer potential therapeutic drugs are also discussed. Finally, a brief summary on chloroquine-resistance mechanism(s) has been included.
