Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem world wide, although in some areas the increase in resistance is slow, as in the Nordic countries. Multiresistant staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are already causing increased morbidity, mortality and huge costs in health budgets. New effective antibiotics will not be available for the next 10-15 years, since the pharmaceutical industry has lost interest in antibiotics. The major determinant in this field, in order to save the activity of the known antibiotics, is the control of antibiotic use.
