The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibilities to macrolides of Group A streptococcal isolates from the European section of Turkey. In the case of resistant isolates, the patterns and genetic mechanisms of erythromycin resistance were studied. Seven (2.7%) of the 260 isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Four of them showed the M phenotype and harboured mefA genes whereas three isolates showed the inducible macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin B resistance phenotype and harboured ermTR genes. In the European section of Turkey, the current resistance rate of Group A streptococci to macrolides remains low.
