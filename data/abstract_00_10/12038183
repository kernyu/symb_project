Tuberculosis is a major cause of death in the Republic of Djibouti. Tuberculous lymphadenitis represents about 25% of the clinical forms of tuberculosis in this country. Between January 1999 and April 1999, 196 lymph node specimens were consecutively collected from 153 patients living in Djibouti. Testing of susceptibility to the major anti-tuberculosis drugs was performed by the proportion method. Growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains was obtained from specimens of 85 patients including 9 with prior treatment. Strains were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 78 cases, Mycobacterium canetti in 3, Mycobacterium africanum in 3, and Mycobacterium bovis in 1. Prevalence of HIV infection was 15%. Assessment of primary resistance demonstrated that the overall resistance rate, i.e., resistance to 1 or more drugs, was 18 (21.2%). Results showed resistance to isoniazid (H) in 6 cases (7.1%), rifampicin (R) in 3 (3.5%), ethambutol (E) in 1 (1.2%), streptomycin (S) in 13 (15.3%) and pyrazinamide (Z) in 1 (1.2%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was found in 2 cases (2.4%). Assessment of acquired resistance demonstrated resistance to H in 4 cases (44%), R in 2 (22%), S in 2 (22%), E in 0, Z in 0 and MDR in 1 (11%). These findings were not significantly different from data obtained from sputum samples analysed between 1997 and 2000 or from those described in a study conducted in 1985.
