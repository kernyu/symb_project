A series of ester and carbonate derivatives of the glycopeptide mannopeptimycin alpha (1) with potent activity against G+ bacteria, including the methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, was synthesized. The SAR data obtained from natural and semisynthetic compounds demonstrated the importance of a hydrophobic group in the terminal mannosyl moiety for antibacterial activity.
