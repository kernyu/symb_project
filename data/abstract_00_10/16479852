The purpose of this paper is to review the basic features of biofilms associated with human infections and summarize why such biofilms are resistant to antimicrobial agents. The formation of most biofilms involves adherence of bacteria to a conditioned surface, growth and division of the attached bacteria, synthesis of a polymeric slime matrix, formation of a structured microbial community, and incorporation of other micro-organisms into the microbial mass. The transition of bacteria from free-floating (planktonic) to biofilm environments involves extensive up-regulation of genes associated with adherence. Micro-organisms in established biofilms engage in complex integrated activities involving activation and deactivation of genes that promote the survival of bacteria within the biofilm community. Mechanisms of the increased resistance of biofilm bacteria to antimicrobial agents may involve: (1) neutralization or consumption of the drug, (2) failure of the drug to completely penetrate the biofilm, (3) inability of the drug to affect metabolically inactive bacteria, and (4) presence of drug-resistant bacteria within biofilms.
