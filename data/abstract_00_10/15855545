We have analyzed the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of 697 pneumococcal isolates collected in 1998-2002 in Poland from patients with respiratory tract diseases. Thirty-one ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible isolates (MICs, > or =4 microg/ml) were identified, of which two were resistant to levofloxacin (MIC, 8 microg/ml). Serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and the analysis of resistance determinants showed their great genetic diversity.
