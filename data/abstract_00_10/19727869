The antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) is a major strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance and to limit its expenditure. We have improved on our existing ASP to implement a sustainable and cost-effective two-stage immediate concurrent feedback (ICF) model, in which the antimicrobial prescription is audited by two part-time infection control nurses at the first stage, followed by "physician ICF" at the second stage. In January 2005, an ASP focused on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics was implemented. All in-patients, except from the intensive care, bone marrow transplantation, liver transplantation, pediatric, and private units, being treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were included. The compliance to ICF and "physician ICF", antibiotics usage density measured by expenditure and defined daily doses (DDD) were recorded and analyzed before and after the ASP. The overall conformance rate to antibiotic prescription guidelines was 79.4%, while the conformance to ICF was 83.8%. Antibiotics consumption reduced from 73.06 (baseline, year 2004) to 64.01 (year 2007) per 1,000 patient bed-day-occupancy. Our model can be easily applied even in the clinical setting of limited resources.
