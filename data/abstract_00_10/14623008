The oxazolidinones are promising agents for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains. In ongoing studies we have discovered that a strategically placed chiral center of appropriate absolute configuration improves the antibacterial activity of indolinyl oxazolidinone analogues (gram-positive MIC's<0.5 microg/mL for the most potent congeners). The design, synthesis, antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic profile of a selected series of alpha-methylated indoline derivatives and a related set of tetrahydroquinolyl and dihydrobenzoxazinyl analogues are discussed.
