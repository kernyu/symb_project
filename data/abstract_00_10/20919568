This review discusses methods of Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication, causes and consequences of its steadily growing resistance to therapy recommended by Maastricht Consensus (2005) and alternative treatment schemes including "reserved" antibacterial preparations. Different approaches to the solution of this problem are recommended, such as the use of phenomenon of microbial antagonism between endosymbiotic microorgnisms (bifido- and lactobacteria) and opportunistic and pathogenic microflora, e.g. cytotoxic HP strains. The data are presented on the mechanisms of antimicrobial action of bifido- and lactobacteria, pathogenic activity of different HP cytotoxic strains, normal and pathological microbiocenosis of the stomach. Prospects for the use of antibiotics containing bifido- and lactobacteria for the treatment of HP-related conditions are discussed.
