The seasonal patterns of strongyle infections in untreated, weaned lambs were determined on four governmental farms during a grazing season. In three farms, the infection level (predominantly Teladorsagia spp. and Trichostrongylus spp.) measured by egg counts or worm burdens remained low throughout the study; higher egg counts mainly caused by Haemonchus contortus were transiently recorded on the fourth farm. Significant body weight gains were observed in all groups, but they varied between farms irrespective of the level of strongyle infections, suggesting that the economic effectiveness of anthelmintic treatments of weaned lambs is doubtful under the extensive grazing conditions and the hot, dry climate in the region. In the second part of the study, faecal egg count reduction tests were performed for albendazole, thiabendazole, tetramisole and ivermectin on 12 sheep and goat farms to provide first information on anthelmintic resistance in trichostrongyles of small ruminants in Turkey. There was no hint of benzimidazole resistance, and unequivocal evidence of ivermectin resistance was missing. In contrast, tetramisole resistance was detected on one sheep farm.
