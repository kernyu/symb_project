To elucidate the bacterial etiology of childhood diarrhoea in Dhahira, 856 children < 12 years admitted for diarrhoea to Ibri Regional Referral Hospital from 2000 to 2002 were studied. The mean age was 2.4 (SD 2.3) years; the majority (92.9%) were < 5 years. Bacterial etiology was found in 15.2% of cases; 10.6% due to Shigella and 2.1% to Salmonella. Sh. sonnei was the commonest Shigella serogroup isolated. Salmonella infection was significantly associated with cramps, while Shigella infection was associated with fever, bloody stools and cramps. Antibiotics were prescribed in 36.2% of cases and the resistance to the common antibiotics tested was low.
