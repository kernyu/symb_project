The aim of this study was to determine a susceptibility of 223 clinical strains Klebsiella to 11 antimicrobial agents and occurrence ESBL-positive strains. These strains were isolated from clinical specimens during 2006 year. Susceptibility of these strains against antimicrobial agents was determined with disc diffusion method according to CLSI recommendation. None of the analysed strains was resistant to imipenem. The Klebsiella pneumonie strains were most frequently isolated from respiratory tract.
