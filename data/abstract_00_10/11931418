KRM-1648 resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were identified from a collection of rifampicin-resistant strains. Several strains had novel rpoB gene mutations in codons 512, 529 and 533 of the rpoB gene. The strains with mutations in codons 526 or 531, major mutation sites in rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis, were resistant to KRM-1648. Also, the strains with other mutations in the rpoB gene that were initially susceptible to KRM-1648 were prone to developing KRM-1648 resistance after further mutation. Thus, KRM-1648 is unlikely to be useful for the treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.
