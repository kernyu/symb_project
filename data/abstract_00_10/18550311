The supply of fosfomycin had to be carefully controlled over metropolitan France during 10 weeks because of a unique crisis in production. Three hundred and forty prescriptions were collected and re-examined by an expert committee. The main indications were osteoarthritis (27%), lung infections (21%), severe sepsis (12.5%), and urinary tract infections (11%). The main bacteria involved, often multidrug resistant, were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (40%) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus. A careful analysis of the antibiogram proved fosfomycin to be irreplaceable in 36% of the cases. This study confirms and specifies the interest of fosfomycin. To our knowledge, this study was a unique opportunity to collect such specific data from the whole of France over a two-month shortage period.
