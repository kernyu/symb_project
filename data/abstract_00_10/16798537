Antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat worldwide. S. aureus strains that combine resistance and virulence genes have become a major treatment problem in Europe and the U.S. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are an emerging problem in many settings. Resistance mechanisms have been found for every class of antibiotic agent. Development of new classes of antibiotics or more robust versions of old classes will be essential in the years to come. Judicious use of antimicrobial agents and improved infection control methods must become health care priorities.
