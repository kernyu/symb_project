Carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli is rare. We report four genetically unrelated carbapenem-resistant E. coli isolates cultured from four patients hospitalized in Tel Aviv Medical Center. PCR, sequencing, and Southern blot analysis identified KPC-2 as the imipenem-hydrolyzing enzyme in all four strains, carried on different plasmids with a possible common origin. This is the first discovery of KPC-2 in E. coli and the first report of this enzyme originating outside the United States.
