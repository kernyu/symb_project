The present research was conducted to study the susceptibility and resistance pattern of Staphylococcus aureus isolates against various brands of commonly used antibiotics. A total of 50 bacterial isolates were obtained from various clinical specimens submitted to the clinical laboratory of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences Islamabad (PIMS). Out of 50 isolates 30 (60%) were identified as coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus. These isolates were tested for susceptibility pattern 19 (63%), these isolates were resistant to penicillin, 17 (57%) to ampicillin, 19 (63%) to cloxacillin, 20 (67%) to streptomycin, 11 (37%) to clindamycin, 16 (53%) to lincomycin and 19 (63%) to neomycin. These isolates had MIC range of penicillin and lincomycin (<0.5 to > 512 microg/mL), ampicillin, cloxacillin and clindamycin (0.5 to 256 microg/mL), streptomycin (4 to >512 microg/mL) and neomycin (2 to 256 microg/mL). Clindamycin was found to be the most effective among these antibiotics tested in the study against these clinical isolates.
