The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of uropathogens isolated from outpatients living in South Croatia and the in vitro susceptibility of these organisms to antimicrobial agents. Of 5080 enrolled uropathogen isolates, 82.28% isolates were Gram-negative, the most frequent isolates being Escherichia coli (62.62%), enterococci (10.18%), Proteus mirabilis (5.31%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3.84%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.70%), Pseudomonas spp. (3.46%), Klebsiella spp. (2.38%). The E. coli resistance rate was 42.17% to amoxycillin, 20.59% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and 6.09% to norfloxacin. Almost all Klebsiella spp. isolates were resistant to amoxycillin and the resistance rate to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was over 20%, and 14.15% to the fluoroquinolones. A high methicillin-resistance rate was found among S. aureus (61.22%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (41.48).
