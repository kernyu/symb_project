Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cattle vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were obtained and expanded in vitro by incubation with purified protein derivative. The ability of these cells to modulate the replication of virulent Mycobacterium bovis in autologous-infected macrophages was compared to cells from non-vaccinated controls. Cells from non-vaccinated animals were shown to confer a significant degree of mycobacteriostatic activity to autologous-infected macrophages. This activity was not inhibited by including a neutralizing antibody versus interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and was dependent on direct contact between PBMCs and infected macrophages. Addition of autologous PBMCs from BCG-vaccinated cattle was shown to significantly enhance macrophage resistance to M. bovis, and this increased macrophage resistance was partly abrogated by including a neutralizing antibody to IFN-gamma. Addition of T cells from non-vaccinated animals to infected macrophages was associated with a modest increase in macrophage release of TNF-alpha and nitric oxide, whereas PBMCs from vaccinated animals increased very significantly the release of these factors. Neutralization of nitric oxide (NO), by inclusion of monomethyl-L-arginine, significantly diminished the ability of PBMCs from vaccinated animals to enhance macrophage resistance to M. bovis, but had no impact on the ability of T cells from naive animals to modulate macrophage function. The ability of naive cells to increase macrophage anti-M. bovis activity was largely mediated by CD4+ T cells, whereas both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells conferred macrophage resistance to M. bovis in vaccinated animals. These data highlight the role of IFN-gamma and NO in the immune resistance of cattle to M. bovis.
