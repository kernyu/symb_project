The adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to growth in the presence of the antimitotic fungicide benomyl involves the dramatic activation of FLR1 transcription, taking place during benomyl-induced latency following sudden exposure to the fungicide. FLR1 gene encodes a plasma membrane transporter of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) conferring resistance to multiple drugs, in particular to benomyl. FLR1 activation is completely abolished in a mutant devoided of YAP1 gene being exerted by Yap1p either directly or via Pdr3p. YAP1 gene was proved to be a determinant of benomyl resistance; the duration of the adaptation period preceding cell division under benomyl stress was longer for the Deltayap1 population, presumably due to the abolishment of FLR1 activation during latency. Although benomyl resistance mediated by Yap1p is reduced in a FLR1 deletion mutant, results also indicate that Yap1p may have other target genes that confer benomyl resistance in yeast.
