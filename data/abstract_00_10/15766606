The Alexander Project is a global surveillance study conducted from 1992 to 2001. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and percent resistance to a panel of antimicrobial agents were determined according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methodology. Resistance to penicillin (PEN-R) and erythromycin (ERY-R) have increased in the period 1992-2001 by 3.9 and 4.5 times to 20.7% and 27.9%, respectively. Joint PEN-ERY-R has increased 4.9 times, up to 15.3%. In 1992, 57.1% of all PEN-R isolates were also ERY-R, whereas in 2001, 75.8% were ERY-R. Resistance to only 1 antibiotic increased slightly, from 8% in 1992 to 12% in 2001, whereas resistance to more than 1 antibiotic increased 4.3 times, from 6.4% in 1992 to 27.8% of all strains in 2001. Multidrug-resistant pneumococci are an increasingly common finding in the United States. Three of four PEN-R isolates are also multiresistant. The rate of growth of multidrug resistance is higher than that of single antibiotic resistance.
