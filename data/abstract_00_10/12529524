We report on the molecular cloning of the Phytophthora megasperma H20 (PmH20) glycoprotein shown previously as an inducer of the hypersensitive response, of localized acquired resistance and of systemic acquired resistance in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and of the PmH20 alpha- and beta-megaspermin, two elicitins of class I-A and I-B, respectively. The structure of the glycoprotein shows a signal peptide of 20 amino acids followed by the typical elicitin 98-amino acid-long domain and a 77-amino acid-long C-terminal domain carrying an O-glycosylated moiety. The molecular mass deduced from the translated cDNA sequence is 14,920 and 18,676 D as determined by mass spectrometry. This structure together with multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the glycoprotein belongs to class III elicitins. It is the first class III elicitin protein characterized, which we named gamma-megaspermin. We compared the biological activity of the three PmH20 elicitins when applied to tobacco cv Samsun NN plants. Although alpha- and gamma-megaspermin were similarly active, beta-megaspermin was the most active in inducing the hypersensitive response and localized acquired resistance, which was assessed by measuring the levels of acidic and basic pathogenesis-related proteins and of the antioxidant phytoalexin scopoletin. The three elicitins induced similar levels of systemic acquired resistance measured as the expression of acidic PR proteins and is increased resistance to challenge tobacco mosaic virus infection.
