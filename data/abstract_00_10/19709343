AIMS: To characterize the antibacterial synergy of the antimicrobial peptide, ranalexin, used in combination with the anti-staphylococcal endopeptidase, lysostaphin, against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and to assess the combination's potential as a topical disinfectant or decolonizing agent for MRSA. MRSA causes potentially lethal infections, and pre-operative patients colonized with MRSA are often treated with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin cream to eradicate carriage. However, chlorhexidine is unsuitable for some patients, and mupirocin resistance is increasingly encountered, indicating new agents are required. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using an ex vivo assay, ranalexin and lysostaphin tested in combination reduced viable MRSA on human skin to a greater extent than either compound individually. The combination killed bacteria within 5 min and remained effective and synergistic even in high salt and low pH conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The combination is active against MRSA on human skin and under conditions that may be encountered in sweat. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although the exact mechanism of activity remains unresolved, considering its specific spectrum of activity, fast killing kinetics and low likelihood of resistance arising, the combination of ranalexin with lysostaphin warrants consideration as a new agent to eradicate nasal and skin carriage of Staph. aureus, including MRSA.
