Fifty-five patients with destructive pulmonary tuberculosis were examined. Of them 35 isolated drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Of the 35 patients, 12 were first diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis and 23 had its chronic forms. Due to the complex inpatient treatment involving pneumoperitoneum, in patients with first diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis, bacterial isolation ceased and decay cavities closed in 100 and 87.5% of cases, respectively. In patients with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, bacterial isolation ceased in 10 of the 23 cases and fresh decay cavities closed in 7 patients. The results of the complex treatment for destructive tuberculosis with mycobacterial drug resistance may recommend this treatment modality since the latter is most effective.
