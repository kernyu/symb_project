OBJECTIVE: To develop an in vitro method for the assessment of drug response in P. falciparum to pyronaridine/sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (PND/S/P). METHODS: The PND/S/P microtest plate was designed, Rieckmann in vitro microtest(WHO standard kit) was used to test the sensitivity of P falciparum in continuous culture (FCC1/HN strain), and the data obtained were analyzed using a computer programme. Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) was calculated to test the possible synergy between PND and S/P. RESULTS: The effect of the PND/S/P plates was fairly stable and the ED50 values of pyronaridine, sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine were 0.11, 215.12 and 2.9 pmol, respectively. The FIC obtained confirmed the synergism between PND and S/P. CONCLUSION: The in vitro method can be used to assess the sensitivity of P. falciparum to pyronaridine/sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.
