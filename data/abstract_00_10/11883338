An estimate of drug resistance is extremely important in the epidemiology and control of tuberculosis. Data on drug resistance among mycobacterial isolates from sputum samples analysed at Microbiology dept. of Choithram Hospital and Research Centre, Indore, M.P. is presented here. Drug sensitivity testing was carried out on 1426 Mycobacterial isolates by the method of proportion using critical concentration in Lowenstein Jensen medium. Resistance for Isoniazid, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide was found to be high (54.2%, 41.5% and 50% respectively) and was followed by resistance to rifampin (25%) and ethambutol (22%). Resistance for kanamycin, p-aminosalicylic acid, thiacetazone and ciprofloxacin was much lower (18%, 13%, 6.5% and 3.6% respectively). Only 12% of the isolates were sensitive to all the anti-TB drugs while resistance to two, three, and four or more drugs was in the range of 20-25%. Pattern wise, simultaneous resistance to INF and Rifampin with or without resistance to other drugs was observed in 8.1% while resistance for Isoniazid + pyrazinamide and Isoniazid + streptomycin was 11.9 and 11.5% respectively. Resistance for Isoniazid + ethambutol was the lowest (5.1%). Growing multiple drug resistance among tubercle bacilli warrant urgent attention in tuberculosis control programme.
