Mutants of Corynebacterium glutamicum that were unable to grow under mild alkaline pH conditions were isolated by mutagenesis. Strain AL-43 exhibiting the highest sensitivity to alkaline pH among the mutants was selected and used to clone a DNA fragment that could complement the phenotype. Sequencing and subcloning of the cloned 4.0-kb EcoRI DNA fragment showed that the Cgl1281 gene was responsible for the complementation. The deduced amino acid sequence of Cgl1281 was found to show significant sequence similarity with CzcD, a Me2+/H+(K+) antiporter, from Bacillus subtilis and also possess the features of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family: the presence of 6 putative transmembrane segments and a signature sequence, indicating that the gene product is a member of the CDF family. Chromosomal disruption of the Cgl1281 rendered C. glutamicum cells sensitive to alkaline pH as well as cobalt, while expression of the gene from a plasmid restored alkali-tolerance to the wild-type level and also led to increased cobalt resistance. These results demonstrated that the putative transporter of the CDF family mediates resistance to cobalt and also plays a physiological role in alkaline pH tolerance in C. glutamicum.
