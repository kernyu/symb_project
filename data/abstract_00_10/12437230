Candida was isolated in 205 of 1060 clinical specimens (19.33%) in our laboratary sent from the intensive care unit for mycological investigation between January 98-December 99. All isolated strains were identified to species level using the API Candida system (Bio-Meieux, France) as follows; Candida albicans (n:115, 56.09%), Candida tropicalis (n:23, 11.21%), Candida parapsilosis (n:21, 10.24%), Candida glabrata (n:12, 5.83%). Candida kefyr (n:9, 4.39%), Candida lusitaniae (n:7, 3.41%), Candida famata (n:6, 2.92%), Candida krusei (n:6, 2.92%), Candida guilliermondii (n:6, 2.92%). These stains were identified using congo-red-glucose-brain-heart-infusion agar and slime production was determined in Candida albicans 53.91% and 67.77% in other than Candida species. In the present study, E test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweeden) was used to test antifungal susceptibility. The resistance to amphotericin B was 19.51%, to fluconazole 27.31% and to flucytosine 20.00%.
