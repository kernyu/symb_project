In 2005-2007, primary drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) was studied in 1318 patients with new-onset destructive pulmonary tuberculosis. This was identified in 31.8, 28.5, and 29.1% in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. During these years, there was an increase in the primary rifampicin resistance of MBT from 28.8% in 2005 to 37.7% in 2007. Primary streptomycin resistance was 100% in 2007. The authors consider the primary resistance of MBT as a priority problem of phthisiology.
