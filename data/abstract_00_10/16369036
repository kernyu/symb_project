The HtrA serine protease has been shown to be essential for bacterial virulence and for survival after exposure to many types of environmental and cellular stresses. A Listeria monocytogenes 10403S htrA mutant was found to be sensitive to oxidative and puromycin-induced stress at high temperatures, showed a reduced ability to form biofilms, and was attenuated for virulence in mice.
