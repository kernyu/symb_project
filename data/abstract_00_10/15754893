PURPOSE: Candida albicans is a component of the normal oral microflora, but local and systemic factors can transform this commensal C albicans to a pathogen. The most frequent cause of Candida opportunistic infections (candidiasis) is dentures, especially if poorly fitting or poorly cleaned. Management of oral candidiasis depends on an accurate diagnosis, identification and elimination of predisposing factors, and, often, use of antifungal agents. The aim of this study was to examine fingernail varnish, currently used for onychomycosis therapy, to reduce the fungal colonization in prosthetic biofilms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A varnish containing 5% amorolfine was applied once or twice a week for 6 months in six patients affected by nystatin-resistant denture-related stomatitis. In all six patients, the prostheses had previously been removed at night, and daily antimycotic topical therapy with nystatin had failed to resolve the stomatitis; after 30 days, these patients all showed persistence of candidal stomatitis. RESULTS: After 1 month, five of the six patients were negative for Candida; this situation was unchanged in the following monthly controls. Only in the patient with suspected Sjogren syndrome was oral Candida found 15 days after the last varnish application. None of the patients had any complaints about the medication. CONCLUSION: This varnish containing 5% amorolfine, applied once or twice a week for 6 months, was able to suppress the nystatin-resistant denture-related stomatitis.
