OBJECTIVE: Analysis of adults patients (> 15 years of age) with Bacteremic Pneumococcal Pneumonia (BPP), in the Hospital Complex of Pontevedra. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 83 cases of BPP were studied in the last 6 years (1995-2000). RESULTS: There were 57 men and 26 women. The overall mean age was 56 year-old; in those smaller than 40 years, there was 60% infected by the HIV. The patients' two thirds, had > 1 predisposing condition, highlighted: the cigarette smoking, the alcoholism and the HIV infection. The typical clinical presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia, we find it in 73%. The calculation of the pneumonia severity index (PSI, Fine et al.), it framed half of the patients in the group of low risk of mortality. The resistance to the penicillin in the isolations, was of 31%. The initial antibiotic treatment was modified, in 11% of the cases. The fatal cases (10%) had: superior age to 65 years, presence of mental confusion, a bigger hypoxemia and hypercapnia, admission in the ICU, atypical presentation, existence of pleural effusion and a PSI bigger than 140. CONCLUSIONS: The patient with BPP in our area, presents some similar clinical characteristics to those described in other series; the half is included in the group of low risk of mortality. Apart from other factors already well-known, a superior PSI at 140, is related directly with the mortality.
