Independent, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled studies using sublingual/oral administration of D-camphor, an extract from fresh crataegus berries, and a combination of the two (CCC) yielded the following results: Both the D-camphor and the extract from fresh crataegus berries, the components of CCC, contribute to the pressoric effects of the combination. The underlying hemodynamic mechanisms can be attributed to an increase in total peripheral resistance induced by an increased tone of the arterioles with both components and the effect of crataegus is intensified by an additional direct positive action on cardiac performance. Conceivably, the D-camphor component is the main factor in inducing the rapid initial effect, whereas the extract from fresh crataegus berries adds a long-lasting effect. For CCC, a dose-dependent increase in supine blood pressure and prevention of orthostatic fall in blood pressure following tilt table-induced orthostasis in patients with orthostatic dysregulation was demonstrated as well. The effect revealed a very rapid onset of action within 1 min following administration, confirming the traditional use in emergency situations such as orthostatic (pre)syncope. Thus, these studies show that CCC, depending on the pressoric activity of its two mono-components, exerts a significant effect that counteracts an orthostatic fall in blood pressure and thereby provides a rationale for its application that reemphasizes the decades-long usefulness of this phyto-combination.
