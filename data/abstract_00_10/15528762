A case of quinine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria, followed by a postmalaria neurological syndrome and a recurrence episode, is described. Genetic characterization of the P. falciparum isolate obtained by analysis of msp1 and msp2 amplicons revealed the coexistence of two genotypes causing the first malaria episode and the presence of a unique isolate responsible for the recurrence.
