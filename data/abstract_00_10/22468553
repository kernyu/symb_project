Concurrent resistance to antimicrobials of different classes has arisen in a multitude of bacterial species and may complicate the therapeutic management of infections, including those of the urinary tract. To assess the resistance pattern among urinary isolates of E. coli, the most prevalent pathogen contributing these infections, a retrospective in vitro surveillance study was carried out in the Department of Microbiology, Uttarakhand Forest Hospital Trust Medical College from Jan. 2006 - Dec. 2006. A total of 175 E. coli isolates from urinary specimen had been tested against 12 antimicrobials. E. coli isolates tested, 94.29% showed resistance to ampicillin, 92% to amoxycillin- salbactam, 70.86% to gentamicin, 65.71% to amikacin, 89.71% to cefuroxime, 78.51% to cefotaxime,76% to cefriaxone, 90.28% to ciprofloxacin, 61.14% to chlormphenicol, 46.28% to nitrofurantoin, 28% to piperacillin-tazobactam and 8.5% to imipenum. Multidrug resistance was defined as resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics. Multidrug resistance was detected in 97% isolates. These findings call for wiser use of antimicrobial agents and their continuous in vitro monitoring.
