Cytokines play an important and complex role in the pathogenesis of systemic autoimmune diseases. In susceptible H-2s mice, inorganic mercury (Hg) induces lymphoproliferation, antinucleolar antibodies against the 34-kDa-protein fibrillarin, and systemic immune-complex (IC) deposits. Here, we report extensive analysis of cytokine mRNA levels in susceptible A.SW (H-2s) and resistant A.TL (H-2tl) mice under unstimulated conditions and during oral treatment with Hg and/or silver nitrate (Ag). Cytokine mRNA expression in lymphoid tissues was assessed using the ribonuclease protection assay and phosphorimaging. Baseline expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA was higher in A.SW than in A.TL mice. In A.SW mice, Hg treatment caused early up-regulation of IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels, followed by substantial expression of IL-4 mRNA, which was significant compared to control A.SW and Hg-treated A.TL mice. Hg-exposed A.TL mice exhibited unchanged IFN-gamma, reduced IL-2 and greatly increased IL-10 mRNA expression. Ag-treated A.SW mice, which develop antifibrillarin antibodies (AFA) but exhibit minimal immune activation and no IC deposits, showed an early increase in IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA, but only a small and delayed rise in IL-4 mRNA. In conclusion, H-2-linked resistance to Hg-induced AFA is characterized by low constitutive expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA, which is not increased by Hg, and a marked increase in IL-10 expression. Conversely, the key features of H-2-linked susceptibility to Hg- and Ag-induced AFA are up-regulation of IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-4 mRNA expression, and down-regulation of IL-10 expression.
