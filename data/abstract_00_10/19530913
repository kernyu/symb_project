The development of multidrug resistance (due to drug efflux by P-glycoproteins) is a major drawback with the use of paclitaxel (PTX) in the treatment of cancer. The rationale behind this study is to prepare PTX nanoparticles (NPs) for the reversal of multidrug resistance based on the fact that PTX loaded into NPs is not recognized by P-glycoproteins and hence is not effluxed out of the cell. Also, the intracellular penetration of the NPs could be enhanced by anchoring transferrin (Tf) on the PTX-PLGA-NPs. PTX-loaded PLGA NPs (PTX-PLGA-NPs), Pluronic((R))P85-coated PLGA NPs (P85-PTX-PLGA-NPs), and Tf-anchored PLGA NPs (Tf-PTX-PLGA-NPs) were prepared and evaluted for cytotoxicity and intracellular uptake using C6 rat glioma cell line. A significant increase in cytotoxicity was observed in the order of Tf-PTX-PLGA-NPs > P85-PTX-PLGA-NPs > PTX-PLGA-NPs in comparison to drug solution. In vivo biodistribution on male Sprague-Dawley rats bearing C6 glioma (subcutaneous) showed higher tumor PTX concentrations in animals administered with PTX-NPs compared to drug solution.
