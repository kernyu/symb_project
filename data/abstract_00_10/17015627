Glibenclamide reduced the rate of lesion growth in BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana, the effect was dose dependent, and the highest dose proved more effective than glucantime. Cross-resistance to glucantime was found in animals infected with a glibenclamide-resistant line, but combined therapy reduced lesion progression even in the glibenclamide-resistant strain.
