The purpose of this prospective study was to compare bacterial organisms and their susceptibility patterns from otic exudate and ear tissue from the vertical ear canal of six dogs with end-stage otitis undergoing a total ear canal ablation. Twenty-six organisms, 13 from the exudate and 13 from the tissue, were morphologically and biochemically similar, and their susceptibility patterns were compared. There were discrepancies for only 5 antibiotics for 4 organisms from 3 dogs. Culture of otic exudate from the vertical ear canal of dogs with chronic end-stage otitis externa provides an accurate reflection of the bacterial species present and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these infections.
