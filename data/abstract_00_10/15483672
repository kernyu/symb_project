B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent adult leukemia in the Western hemisphere, yet many biological and molecular features of the disease remain undefined. CLL cells generate increased levels of radical species such as superoxide and nitric oxide (NO), which is associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations. Considering that NO levels can affect mitochondrial biogenesis, we hypothesized that the inherent nitrosative stress in CLL cells may lead to hyperactive mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we report that primary CLL cells contained significantly more mitochondria than normal lymphocytes and that their mitochondrial mass was significantly related to endogenous NO levels. Expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis factors nuclear respiratory factor-1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A was elevated in most CLL specimens examined and appeared to be related to cellular NO levels. Treatment of B cells with exogenous NO caused a substantial increase in mitochondrial mass. In vitro sensitivity of CLL cells to fludarabine was highly related to mitochondrial mass in that cells with greater mitochondrial mass were less sensitive to the drug. Taken together, our results suggest that NO is a key mediator of mitochondrial biogenesis in CLL and that modulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by NO may alter cellular sensitivity to fludarabine.
