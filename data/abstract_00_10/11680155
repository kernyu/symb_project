In 1999 the County Medical Officer in Stockholm County established the third regional STRAMA-group (Swedish Strategic Programme for The Rational Use of Antimicrobial Agents and Surveillance of Resistance) to deal with skin and soft tissue infections. The group decided to publish guidelines for physicians in the county, and this third book was distributed among the 7,000 physicians in Stockholm County.
