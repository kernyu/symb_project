OBJECTIVES: Pediatric deep neck space abscesses are frequently treated by the otolaryngologist. We report four children with deep neck abscesses caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), including the first described case of descending mediastinitis caused by MRSA in a child. METHODS: Records from March 2001 to April 2002 were reviewed. RESULTS: Four patients presented with neck swelling, and three of these also had leukocytosis. All abscess cultures were positive for MRSA. Abscess drainage with antibiotic therapy successfully treated three cases without complication. The fourth case developed descending mediastinitis but survived after additional surgical treatment and prolonged antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA should be considered as a potential pathogen in deep neck space abscesses. A high index of suspicion is needed as well as aggressive treatment including incision and drainage along with culture-directed medical therapy. Surgical drainage may be the most important aspect of therapy.
