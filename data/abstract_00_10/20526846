The molecular mechanisms underlying fluconazole resistance in C. albicans involve mutations and the overexpression of the ERG11 gene and membrane transport proteins. We examined the relationship between the reduced fluconazole susceptibility of C. albicans and mutations of V404I and V509M in the ERG11 gene in 182 C. albicans clinical isolates using the Pyrosequencing method. DNAs from these clinical isolates with different levels of in-vitro fluconazole susceptibility--one resistant, five susceptible dose-dependent (SDD), four trailer, and 172 susceptible--were analyzed. None of the fluconazole-susceptible, SDD, trailer or resistant isolates had mutations of V404I or V509M. Our results showed that no correlation can be found between the V404I or V509M mutation and fluconazole susceptibility in C. albicans.
