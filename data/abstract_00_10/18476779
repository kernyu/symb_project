Mediterranean herring gulls (Larus cachinnans) were investigated as a possible reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria and of cassette-borne resistance genes located in class 1 integrons. Two hundred and fourteen isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae were collected from cloacal swabs of 92 chicks captured in a natural reserve in the North East of Italy. They showed high percentages of resistance to ampicillin and streptomycin. High percentages of resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were found in Proteus and Citrobacter and to chloramphenicol in Proteus. Twenty-two (10%) isolates carried the intI1 gene. Molecular characterization of the integron variable regions showed a great diversity, with the presence of 11 different cassette arrays and of one integron without integrated cassettes. The dfrA1-aadA1a and aadB-aadA2 cassette arrays were the most frequently detected. Also the estX cassette, alone or in combination with other cassettes, was detected in many isolates. From this study it is concluded that the enteric flora of Mediterranean herring gulls may act as a reservoir of resistant bacteria and of resistance genes. Due to their feeding habits and their ability to fly over long distances, these free-living birds may facilitate the circulation of resistant strains between waste-handling facilities, crops, waters, and urban areas.
