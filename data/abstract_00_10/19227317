Drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) to essential and reserve antituberculous drugs (ATD) was monitored in patients with tuberculosis of respiratory organs (ROT) and at extrapulmonary sites (EPT) in 2005-2007. The standard indirect absolute concentration technique was used to study the drug resistance of 578 MBT strains from pretreated patients with ROT and that of 159 MT strains from those with EPT. With all sites of tuberculosis, a poor trend continues to show an increase in the total frequency of MBT resistance (from 82.3 to 85.2% in ROT and from 43.7 to 59.3% in EPT) and its severer pattern due to MRD (from 69.5 to 78.0% in patients with ROT and from 20.8 to 35.5% in those with EPT). The rate of MTB resistance to 4 ATDs or more is 73.7 and 34.6% in patients with ROT and in those with ERT, respectively. The total resistance of MBT to 7-8 ATDs was revealed in every three patients with ROT (33.0%) and in 12.6% of those with EPT.
