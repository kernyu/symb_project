Between April 1998 and July 1999, we prospectively investigated 152 patients with gastric or duodenal ulcer and we observed concomitant H. pylori infection in 72.8% and 78.5% respectively. We proposed to the GPs of these patients the recommended triple therapy (omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1 g and clarithromycin 500 mg (OAC) twice daily for 7 or 10 days). H. pylori eradication was tested using the C13-urea breath test. Our results showed a modest overall eradication rate of about 70%. We have to persuade the patients and the GPs of the benefit of antibiotics and of the importance of the correct dosages. We have to continue to follow the resistance against antibiotics.
