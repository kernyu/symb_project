Despite the unprecedented pace of development of drugs for the treatment of a viral disease and the unquestionable efficacy of antiretroviral therapy, there is a need for less toxic and cheaper regimens that could simplify the treatment of HIV infection without sacrificing efficacy. The favorable pharmacokinetic profile and the high genetic barrier of boosted protease inhibitors make them ideal candidates for use as monotherapy. Given the encouraging results of available studies on lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy in patients with no prior failure with protease inhibitors, it may be warranted to conduct trials to investigate the cost-effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy as second-line therapy in resource-constrained settings where virologic monitoring is not feasible. In addition, larger trials with longer follow up, with particular attention to the potential consequences of viral replication in sites where the penetration of protease inhibitors may be poor, are needed before this strategy can be considered for routine use.
