Dalbavancin is a new lipoglycopeptide antibacterial possessing in vitro activity against a variety of gram-positive pathogens. Against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, it has demonstrated favorable minimum inhibitory concentration ranges compared with those of currently available agents. Dalbavancin is highly protein bound (> 90%), which may contribute to its prolonged half-life of 149-300 hours. Because of this long half-life, once-weekly dosing strategies have been used in clinical trials. Efficacy and tolerability have been demonstrated in a wide variety of animal infection models. Clinical success and safety have been shown in phase II and III trials for skin and soft-tissue infections and a phase II trial for catheter-related bloodstream infections. In these trials with vancomycin, linezolid, and various beta-lactams as comparators, comparable results have been reported. The results of further phase III trials are anxiously awaited and will more clearly define the clinical role of this novel agent.
