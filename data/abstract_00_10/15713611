Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) O164 strain RIMD05091045 was isolated from a travelling patient suffering from diarrhoea at the Osaka airport quarantine facility in Japan. The strain showed multidrug resistance against streptomycin, spectinomycin, co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and ampicillin, and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Molecular characterization of the multidrug-resistance phenotype revealed the presence of a class 1 integron containing three genes, a dihydrofolate reductase type XII gene, dfrXII, which confers resistance to trimethoprim, an aminoglycoside adenyltransferase gene, aadA2, which confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, and an ORF of unknown function. Southern blot hybridization and conjugation experiments showed that the class 1 integron was located on a transferable plasmid that was less than 90 kb in size. The resistance of EIEC O164 to ampicillin was found to be due to the presence of TEM-1 beta-lactamase. On the other hand, a single mutation that has not previously been described, P158-to-S, was detected downstream of the quinolone-resistance-determining region of parC of topoisomerase IV and may be responsible for the reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin in this strain.
