The presence of the persistence factors (anti-lysozyme and anti-complement activity) in the vegetative forms of C. difficile was experimentally proved. The effect of different medicines (vitamins B1, B6 and C, prebiotic inulin, probiotics Bifidumbacterin and Enterol) on the persistence factors of C. difficile and microbial resistance to vancomycin, thienam, lincomycin, clindamycin was evaluated. The anti-lysozyme and anti-complement activity of C. difficile was found to decrease under the influence of vitamins B1, B6, C, inulin, exometabolites of bifidobacteria. Under the impact of the preparations used in this study changes in the sensitivity of C. difficile to antibiotics of the lincoamide, carbapenem, glycopeptide groups were found to occur. The data obtained reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of the medicines under study on the intestinal microbiocenosis in patients with antibiotic-associated colitis.
