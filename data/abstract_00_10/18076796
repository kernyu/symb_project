BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Some cancer patients were not died of cancer, but died of infection after operation, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or interventional treatment. This study was to investigate the pathogen spectrum and drug resistance of spit samples from cancer patients. METHODS: The pathogen spectrum and drug resistance of 955 positive spit samples from cancer patients were analyzed with WHONET-5 statistical software. RESULTS: The detection rates were 43.3% for fungus (mainly included C.albicans), 31.2% for Gram-positive coccus (mainly included coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), and 25.5% for Gram-negative bacillus (mainly included P.aeruginosa and K.pneumonia). Drug sensitivity test showed that fungus was sensitive to amphotericin B, but resistant against categorical azoles; Gram-positive coccus was highly sensitive to vancomycin, but highly resistant against oxacillin, penicillin and erythromycin; Gram-negative bacillus was highly sensitive to impanel, but highly resistant against the first and second generations of cephalosporin such as ampicillin and piperacillin. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogen spectrum of cancer patients with nosocomial infection mainly includes fungus, Gram-positive coccus, and Gram-negative coccus. Treating cancer patients with antibiotics should be based on drug sensitivity test.
