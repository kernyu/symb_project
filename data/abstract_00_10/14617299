Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) is increasing in incidence in solid organ transplant recipients and has a high (up to 83%) associated mortality rate. Until recently, there have been no consistently effective antimicrobial therapies for VRE infection. Linezolid is a new antibiotic that belongs to the class of oxazolidinones approved by the FDA for the treatment of VRE infections, including those with bacteremia. Here, we report the experience with linezolid in an open-label, compassionate-use trial at 53 US centers for the treatment of documented VRE infections in patients with solid organ transplants. Eighty-five patients with solid organ transplants and documented VRE infections were studied. Blood cultures were positive for VRE in 43 patients, while 42 patients had other, non-rectal, sites of infection. Fifty-three patients responded well to treatment, with clinical resolution of the infection (62.4% survival rate). Of these, 47 had documented negative cultures post therapy. The mean duration of therapy for cured patients was 23.5 days. Thirty-two (37.6%) patients died, 28 due to sepsis and organ failure (32.9% failure rate), and 4 due to unrelated causes. Mortality rates for patients with bacteremia were comparable to mortality rates observed with patients who had positive cultures from other sites. Adverse reactions to linezolid included thrombocytopenia (4.7%), decreased leukocyte count (3.5%), and an increase in blood pressure (1.2%), none of which led to discontinuation of therapy. Linezolid appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for VRE, even in the presence of bacteremia, and may lead to decreased mortality in solid organ transplant recipients with VRE infection.
