Eighty-three swine isolates of Campylobacter coli were tested for mechanisms underlying resistance to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four isolates harbored class 1 integrons but none carried class 2 and 3 integrons. Most of the tetracycline-resistant isolates (97%) possessed tet(O). A Thr-86-Ile substitution in GyrA and an A-2230-G mutation in 23S rRNA were the main resistance mechanisms for quinolones and erythromycin, respectively.
