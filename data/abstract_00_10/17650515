OBJECTIVES: HIV drug resistance is a major concern as the emergence of resistant strains of virus results in failure of first-line therapies with an associated increase in the cost of subsequent regimens. Genotypic resistance is currently assessed by direct sequencing and cannot detect resistant species below 20%. Real-time PCR amplification was assessed for its ability to detect the signature mutation for nelfinavir, D30N. METHODS: A real-time PCR assay was optimized for detection of low levels of D30N and tested on in vitro-generated nelfinavir-resistant isolates as well as 10 clinical isolates (which were also characterized by sequencing). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the assay was 1% and quantification was possible as low as 4% of the total viral population. Furthermore, this methodology enabled quantification of the 30N mutation in two isolates shown to be negative by sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR is a promising tool for the detection of minority species of HIV but further studies are required to determine the specificity of the assay in a larger and thus more diverse set of clinical isolates.
