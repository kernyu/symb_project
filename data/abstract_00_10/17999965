Children who had acute otitis media and were treated with levofloxacin were assessed for the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nasopharynx cultures were obtained from patients at the entry to and during levofloxacin therapy. All nasopharynx isolates (n = 59) from 12 children were levofloxacin susceptible without parC/E or gyrA/B mutations. Pneumococcal nasopharynx persistence was not associated with levofloxacin resistance.
