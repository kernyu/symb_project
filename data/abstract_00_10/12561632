The authors carried out a comparative clinical and immunological study of different types of drug-resistance (mono-, poly-, MDR of primary and secondary genesis) and immunity in 54 patients with a specific process in the lung. The level of suppression, immunodeficiency, and the incidence of adverse effects were found to be on the increase in the group with the preserved sensitivity to the that with mono-, poly-, and MDR. Impaired immune homeostasis was more pronounced in patients with secondary MDR versus those with primary MDR.
