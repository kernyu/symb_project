Of the 331 Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated in Greece from 1996 to 1999, 39 (11.8%) exhibited decreased susceptibility to quinolones due to gyrA and parC mutations. Conventional typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that 34 of these isolates were clonally related. Epidemiological data indicated that the epidemic clone was sustained in a group of high-frequency transmitters.
