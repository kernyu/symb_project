The in vitro antifungal susceptibility profile of 589 oral yeast isolates from HIV/AIDS patients and healthy South Africans was determined against amphotericin B, nystatin, 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole. The broth microdilution method of the National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards was used and MIC(50) and MIC(90) determined. A 100% susceptibility to fluconazole was observed among the 466 isolates of Candida albicans. Among C. krusei, the second most common isolate, only 2.6% of isolates were susceptible to fluconazole and itraconazole. Despite the lack of previous exposure to antifungal agents, very little difference was observed in the antifungal profile between the South African isolates and isolates from the United States (U.S.), Canada and South America. South Africa has a particularly high incidence of HIV-infection and oral candidiasis is the most common oral complication in these patients. This study provides important baseline data as the isolates were collected prior to fluconazole being made freely available to HIV/AIDS patients attending government health clinics.
