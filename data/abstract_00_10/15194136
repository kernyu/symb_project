We previously reported that a trifluoromethyl ketone derivative, 1-(2-benzoxazolyl)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-propanone (TF18), exhibited the potent antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori, but had no urease activity. In order to clarify the mechanism of anti-H. pylori action of TF18, we evaluated the growth and motility of TF18 on clarithromycin-susceptible H. pylori (CSHP) and -resistant H. pylori (CRHP). An effective proton pump inhibitor (TF18) had remarkable dose-dependent antibacterial activity and was able to inhibit the flagellar motor of both CSHP and CRHP isolates. The antimotility effect of TF18 was more pronounced at subinhibitory concentration in CRHP than in CSHP. The swimming (the forward motion) was more sensitive to the inhibition than the tumbling. Based on the results, it is supposed that TF18 works as an uncoupler similar to the 'clutch' in a biological motor, in which counterclockwise rotation is more sensitive to the effect of TF18 than the clockwise rotation.
