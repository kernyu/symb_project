Chromosome profiles of 10 Trypanosoma (T.) congolense populations with different isometamidium sensitivities were compared using the pulsed field gel electrophoresis technique. The aim was to elucidate whether there was a karyotype pattern specific to eight isometamidium resistant phenotypes. Analysis of the profiles indicated that all populations displayed several discrete bands at the region of small, intermediate and large chromosomes. The highest similarity was observed between two isolates originating from Burkina Faso, indicating that they had the same genetic origin. Other eight strains exhibited different patterns in terms of chromosome size and numbers such that there was no characteristic karyotype pattern that was established specifically to identify resistant populations and discriminate them from the sensitive ones. This study has revealed that isometamidium resistance is not correlated to karyotype profile in T. congolense.
