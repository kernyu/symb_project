INTRODUCTION: European data on outcome and follow-up of long-term lamivudine treatment are sparse. Moreover, little is known about predictors for sustained virologic response and for development of drug resistance in patients with lamivudine monotherapy. Patients and methods : 39 patients (17 HBeAg+, 22 HBeAg-) were treated with lamivudine for a median duration of 2.5 years (range: 0.5-4). Outcome to therapy and predictors for response and drug resistance were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: None of the patients lost HBsAg. In 14 of 17 initially HBeAg positive patients the HBeAg status was available at the end of treatment. Loss of HBeAg was observed in 8 patients and 7 of these 8 patients seroconverted to anti-HBe. Five of 6 patients with HBeAg seroconversion and a post-treatment follow-up period showed sustained HBeAg seroconversion. In HBeAg negative patients virologic response (serum HBV DNA< or =1 x 10(5) copies/ml) was observed in 12 of 22 patients after a median treatment period of 2.5 years. Post-treatment follow-up data were available in only 2 patients, one of which remained below 1 x 10(5) HBV DNA copies/ml for one year. Resistance emerged in 15 of 36 patients with available serum HBV DNA data after a median treatment period of 2 years. CONCLUSION: The present retrospective study confirms international data for lamivudine treatment in a central European setting. Lamivudine therapy achieved disease control in more than 50 % of patients treated for chronic hepatitis B. Baseline predictors could neither be identified for sustained virologic response nor for the development of drug resistance.
