A new compound, 3beta,25-epoxy-3alpha-hydroxy-22beta-isobutanoyloxyolean-12-ene-28-oic acid (1), and two known triterpenoids lantanilic acid (2) and camaric acid (3) were isolated from the stem and leaves of Lantana cujabensis. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods. The ethanol extracts did not show significant in vitro antiplasmodial activity against chloroquine-sensitive or resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum.
