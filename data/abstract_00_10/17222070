Pulmonary infection due to Nocardia sp. is an infrequent disease that affects principally to immunodefficient patients although it can be also seen in patients with normal immunity. Diagnosis is based in isolation of micro-organism in respiratory samples while clinical presentation and radiology are non specific. Treatment is made with trimethropim-sulfametoxazole (TMP/SMX), though resistance has developed in some patients. The recommended length of treatment is 6 weeks to 12 months depending on the immunitaly status. We present the case of a male patient of 81 years old affected with COPD and treated with glucocorticoids in a chronic basis, who was admitted because relapsing fever episodes during 3 months before, weight loss and new hard pulmonary infiltrates with Nocardia sp. cultured sputum, and evolution to clinical, radiological and microbiologic resolution with TMP/SMX treatment.
