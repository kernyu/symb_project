BACKGROUND: Triple therapy is the treatment of choice for Helicobacter pylori-infected patients with an eradication rate ranging from 70 to 85%. Poor compliance and antibiotic resistance are the main causes of treatment failure. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of rifaximin, a poorly absorbed antibiotic, for H. pylori eradication. METHODS: We enrolled 48 consecutive H. pylori-positive patients affected. They were randomized to receive two 7-day rifaximin-based triple therapies: rifaximin tablets 400 mg t.i.d., esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. (CRE) or levofloxacin 500 mg o.d. (LRE). H. pylori eradication was assessed using a (13)C-urea breath test 4 weeks after the end of therapy. Treatment compliance and the incidence of side effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: No dropouts were observed. The eradication rate both on intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis did not show significant differences between groups: 58% (14/24 patients) in group 1 and 42% (10/24 patients) in group 2 (p = 0.24, OR 1.96, 95% CI 0.62-6.18). No significant differences in patients' compliance and incidence of side effects were found between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin-based therapy showed optimal compliance but a limited eradication rate compared to standard first-line treatment. Further investigations are needed to evaluate different dosages and combinations.
