The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of different physico-chemical parameters on Escherichia coli susceptibility to ceftriaxone (CRO), cefotaxime (CTX), imipenem (IMP), and nalidixic acid (as marker for resistance by impermeability). The influence of chemical composition of culture medium was evaluated by the comparative assessment of inhibition growth diameters on different solid media: Mueller Hinton Medium (MH), Plate Count Agar Medium (PCA), MacConkey Medium (MC) and Eosin Methylen Blue Medium (EMB). In order to evaluate the differences in antibiotic susceptibility between the biofilm embedded and planktonic cells, an original, simple experimental model was used, by including the bacterial cells in an agar layer, mimicking the biofilm matrix. Our results demonstrated that the inhibition diameter zone was much larger on PCA, EMB and MC than on MH, considered as general standard medium for the antibiosusceptibility testings (CLSI). When bacterial cells were included in the agar matrix, the growth inhibition diameters obtained for different beta-lactams proved to be different of planktonic cells, i.e.: for CTX, a narrow inhibition diameter was obtained, demonstrating the low efficiency of this antibiotic in the treatment of biofilm associated infections, whereas the CRO proved the same efficiency against planktonic as well as to agar embedded bacteria. The different susceptibility results obtained for the cells embedded in the agar matrix by an adapted disk diffusion method are pleading for the necessity to assess new adapted standard methods and specific parameters in the purpose to determine the antibiotic resistance of bacterial cells isolated from biofilm associated infections.
