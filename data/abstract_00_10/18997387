Rifampin-resistant mutants of the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae were isolated and characterized, including strains that contained multiple mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the rifampin binding site. The highest MIC of rifampin against a mutant strain exceeded 100 microg/ml, whereas the highest MIC of rifalazil was 0.125 microg/ml. Derivatives of rifalazil (new chemical entities; NCEs) showed from 2 approximately 4 fold lower MICs, as well as 2 approximately 8 fold lower bactericidal concentrations against both wild type and mutant strains when compared with rifalazil. These results suggest that rifalazil and NCEs are appropriate therapeutic agents for the treatment of C. pneumoniae infections from the point of view of potency and resistance development.
