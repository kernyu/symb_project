The aim of the study was to determine the in vitro activity of tigecycline and 6 other antimicrobial drugs used in clinical practice against 228 clinical isolates of nonfermenting Gram-negative rods (NFGNRs) including Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined according to the recommendations of the Clinical and laboratory Standards institute. for tigecycline, we used the criteria approved by the fDA. Almost 50% of the clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and ceftazidime. Strains of this microorganism were more susceptible to imipenem, and even more susceptible to colistin and tigecycline; no strains were resistant to tigecycline. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed even greater resistance to the drugs tested. Thus, all strains were resistant to imipenem and a large percentage (82.6%) were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam. Resistance to the other agents tested was also high, with the exception of tigecycline, with only 3 resistant strains (MIC >8 microg/ml). Tigecycline, on the other hand, was scarcely active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which bears efflux pump systems such as MexXy-OprM. Almost 90% of strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin; only 8% were resistant to gentamicin; over half were colistin-intermediate or -resistant, and finally, approximately half of the strains were susceptible to the 3 beta-lactams studied. In conclusion, NFGNRs present variable susceptibility patterns, although they are generally highly resistant to antimicrobial agents including those considered more specific. Tigecycline, which showed good activity against most of the strains examined, broadens the spectrum of drugs available for the treatment of infections caused by these complex microorganisms.
