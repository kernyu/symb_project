Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common skin coloniser and less commonly causes infection. MRSA colonisation should be contained by infection control measures and not treated. MRSA infections cause the same spectrum of infection as MSSA infections, i.e., skin/soft tissue infections, bone/joint infections, central IV line infections, and acute bacterial endocarditis (native valve/prosthetic valve). There is a discrepancy between in-vitro sensitivity and in-vivo effectiveness with MRSA. To treat MRSA infections, clinicians should select an MRSA drug with proven in-vivo effectiveness, i.e., daptomycin. Linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, or vancomycin, and not rely on in-vitro susceptibility data. For MRSA, doxycycline cannot be substituted for minocycline. Linezolid and minocycline are available for oral administration and both are also effective in treating MRSA CNS infections. Vancomycin is being used less due to side effects, (increasing MICs/resistance, VISA/VRSA), and increased VRE prevalence. The most potent anti-MRSA drug at the present time is daptomycin. Daptomycin is useful when rapid/effective therapy of MRSA bacteraemia/endocarditis is necessary. Daptomycin is also useful to treat persistent MRSA bacteraemias/MRSA treatment failures with other drugs, i.e., vancomycin. There is no difference in virulence between MSSA and MRSA infections if treatment is started early and with an agent that has in-vivo effectiveness.
