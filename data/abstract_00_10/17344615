OBJECTIVE: To investigate the function and gene expression of active efflux transporters in drug-resistant candida albicans. METHODS: The broth microdilution method was performed to determined the minimal inhibitory concentration of 4 antifungal drugs to 20 candida albicans. We compared the efflux of Rhodamine 6G between sensitive and some of fluconazole-resistant candida albicans, and screened out the resistant strains with significantly increased efflux of Rhodamine 6G. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure the mRNA levels of active efflux gene CDR1 and CDR2. RESULTS: The efflux of Rhodamine 6G was significantly increased in some fluconazole-resistant strains when glucose was added, and the gene expressions of CDR1 and CDR2 were also obviously increased, compared with those in the sensitive strains. CONCLUSION: The excessive expression of active efflux pump gene is related to the resistance to fluconazole in candida albicans. The measurement of Rhodamine 6G efflux is a useful method for the identification of drug-resistant strains induced by the excessive expression of active efflux pump.
