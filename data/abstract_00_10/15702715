Antimicrobial resistance is a zoonotic health threat. As in humans, the use of antimicrobial agents in animals results in the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. Resistant bacteria from animals may be passed to humans via the food chain or direct animal contact, and may result in resistant infections. Increasing prevalence of resistance to antimicrobial agents such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins, which are important for the treatment of infections caused by enteric pathogens, has significant public health implications. Controlling the spread of resistance requires the collaboration of several partners, including the farming, veterinary, medical, and public health communities.
