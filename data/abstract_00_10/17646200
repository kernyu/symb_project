Candida species are a common cause of bloodstream and invasive infection in critically ill and immunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, invasive Candida infection carries a poor prognosis and may initially be mistaken for bacterial infection. An article in this issue of the Journal investigates the relationship between adequacy of initial empirical therapy and outcome from invasive Candida infection. This study shows that adequate empirical therapy is received by only a quarter of patients, and that inappropriate therapy is associated with increased mortality. These findings highlight the importance of appropriate empirical therapy in invasive Candida infection.
