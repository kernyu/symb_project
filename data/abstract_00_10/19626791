INTRODUCTION: The sensibility of bacteria in a general way decreased a lot, staphylococci present a resistance to the penicillin in more than 80% of the cases. The aim of our work was to determine the level of sensibility of staphylococci, particularly that of resistant Staphylococcus aureus to Meticilline (SARM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: It is a retrospective study concerning the profile of sensibility of the isolated strains of staphylococci of diverse pathological products.The antibiogramme was realized according to the classic technique and for the test in the oxacilline, the Mueller Hinton + 5% of NaCl was used. RESULTS: during the period of study 1296 strains of staphylococcus were isolated, 153 from hospital Staphylococcus aureus were little sensitive to the penicillin G (10%); however the oxacilline, the gentamicine and the erythromycine were very active (more than 80% of sensibility.The meticillino-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were also sensitive to the gentamycine, erythromycine and ciprofloxacine; the character of meticillino resistant did not influence the activity of antibiotics as pristinamycin and the vancomycine (100%); however we note a resistance crossed with the erythromycine in more than 95% of the cases. CONCLUSION: the existence although weak of the strains meticillino resistant brings us to propose a regular surveillance of the SARM and to hold as active antibiotics of first line the pristinamycine, ciprofloxacine, gentamicine, with vancomycine as the alternative of last choice in a hospital environment.
