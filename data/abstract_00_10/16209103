Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (EPKP) strains are frequently implicated in outbreaks in neonatal units. From April 2002 to January 2003, 149 neonates were colonized/infected with EPKP in the Neonatal Clinic of the Teaching Hospital at the Medical University of Gdansk, Poland. A novel assay based on suppression of PCR, ADSRRS-fingerprinting, was successfully evaluated for typing EPKP isolates. The results showed that the genotypes of all outbreak-related strains were identical, which suggested that the outbreak originated from a single clone. This conclusion was confirmed by using different methods--RAPD and PFGE. The outbreak was stopped by adopting improved hygiene and instituting outbreak control measures.
