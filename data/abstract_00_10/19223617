We have evaluated the efficacies of micafungin, amphotericin B, and voriconazole, alone and in double and triple combinations, in a murine model of systemic infection by Scedosporium prolificans. Micafungin combined with voriconazole or amphotericin B was the most effective, these being the only treatments able to prolong survival and to reduce the fungal load in the kidneys and brain. Triple combinations of these drugs did not improve the results obtained with double combinations.
