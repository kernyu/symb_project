Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that produces a wide array of toxins, thus causing various type of disease symptoms. Staphyloceccal enterotoxins (SES), a family of 9 major serological types of heat-stable enterotoxins, are a main cause of gastroenteritis and skin infection. In this study to determine the extent of enterotoxin-producing S. aureus in skin infections of hospitalized patients, their samples were screened and the results showed that 42% of totally 200 patients studied in this research carried S. aureus and 45% of these S. aureus produced Staphylococcal enterotoxins. Twenty percent produced enterotoxin A, 25% produced enterotoxin B and 4.7% produced both enterotoxin A and B. The results demonstrated a high level of enterotoxigenic and multi drug resistance S. aureus in skin infections of hospitalized patients.
