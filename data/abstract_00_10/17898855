We characterized a population of Enterobacter spp. of the Enterobacter cloacae complex isolated from an oligotrophic lake; most isolates were identified as E. cloacae. Fingerprinting polymerase chain reaction (PCR), along with morphological, biochemical, physiological, and plasmid profiles analyses, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, were performed on 22 environmental isolates. Misidentification occurred when using the API 20E identification system. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequences confirmed the close relatedness between species of the E. cloacae complex. The tDNA PCR allowed the differentiation and identification of the E. cloacae isolates. Evaluation of genetic diversity by 16S rDNA sequence, tDNA, internal transcribed spacers, and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic concensus profiles revealed nearly identical isolates, although they exhibited different physiological and antimicrobial resistance profiles. Among the Enterobacter isolates, 96% were resistant to at least one antimicrobial; multiple resistance was also found at a high frequency (86%). The antimicrobials against which resistance was found most frequently were beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin. Plasmids were found in 21 of the 22 Enterobacter isolates. This confirms the conception that antibiotic resistance can occur in oligotrophic freshwater lake bacteria, which has important implications for public health.
