Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to obtain insights into the genetic relationships between 14 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) isolates from humans (hospitalized patients, 5 strains) and nonhuman sources (meat and poultry, 9 strains) in northern Italy over the period 1993-2001. The typing scheme (Homan et al., 2002, J. Clin. Microb., 40:1963-1971) based on seven housekeeping genes--adk (adenylate kinase), atpA (ATP synthase, alpha subunit), ddl (D-alanine-D-alanine ligase), gyd (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), gdh (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), purK (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase ATPase subunit), and pstS (phosphate ATP-binding cassette transporter)--was used. In the 14 VREF analyzed, the number of unique alleles ranged from 1 (gyd) to 8 (atpA). Isolates from hospitalized patients were defined by the unique allele purK 1. Nine sequence types (STs) were identified. All of the epidemic strains isolated over the period 2000-2001 showed identical or closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns and clustered in the same ST78. These strains shared six of the seven alleles with the strain CA20 representative of the 1993-1999 outbreaks, which PFGE indicated as being unrelated to those of the recent outbreaks. MLST confirmed the unrelatedness of human and nonhuman strains already detected by PFGE. All isolates clustered in three main genetic lineages: group A comprised two of the three isolates from meat; group C the human strains of all outbreaks and one poultry strain; and group B four of the five poultry strains and one meat strain. All human strains carried the esp gene and clustered in the C1 sublineage that has been described as having emerged recently worldwide.
