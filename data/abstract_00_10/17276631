Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) is an important equine pathogen that causes respiratory disease, abortion, neonatal death and paralysis. Although vaccines are available, they are not fully protective and outbreaks of disease may occur in vaccinated herds. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective antiviral treatment. For three abortigenic (94P247, 97P70 and 99P96) and three neuropathogenic isolates (97P82, 99P136 and 03P37), the effect of acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, adefovir, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine (PMEDAP) and foscarnet on plaque number was studied. Additionally, for isolate 97P70, the effect on plaque size was investigated. Ganciclovir was most potent in reducing plaque number, followed by PMEDAP and acyclovir. Adefovir and cidofovir were less effective and foscarnet was the least effective compound. There were no differences detected for acyclovir, ganciclovir, adefovir and PMEDAP between the abortigenic and neuropathogenic isolates. One abortigenic isolate (99P96) was more susceptible to cidofovir and two neuropathogenic isolates (99P136 and 03P37) were less susceptible to foscarnet. For isolate 97P70, all compounds resulted in a significant reduction of plaque size. The most remarkable effect was observed for cidofovir. It was 40-fold more effective in reducing plaque size than in reducing plaque number. In conclusion, ganciclovir was the most potent compound and therefore, may be a valuable candidate for the treatment of EHV-1 infections in horses. The antiviral effect of foscarnet on plaque number was highly dependent on the viral isolate tested. Therefore, it is no valuable antiviral for the treatment of herpesvirus-infections. Cidofovir, although less effective in reducing plaque number, had a strong effect on plaque size.
