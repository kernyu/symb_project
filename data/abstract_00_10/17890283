OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to test in vitro activities of the novel des-F(6)-quinolone DX-619 against methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) isolated in hospitals and communities and to compare its activity with other quinolones, sitafloxacin and levofloxacin, and antibiotics used for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, including vancomycin, teicoplanin, arbekacin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. METHODS: MICs were determined by the agar dilution method using healthcare-associated MRS (S. aureus including strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, 103; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 87) and community-associated MRS (S. aureus including non-multiresistant oxacillin-resistant strains, 37; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 92). The quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA, gyrB, grlA and grlB genes from six strains with reduced susceptibility to DX-619 were sequenced. RESULTS: DX-619 showed the lowest MIC(90) values for all categories of strains tested, irrespective of the degree of glycopeptide resistance. The six strains with MIC values of >128 mg/L of levofloxacin commonly carried two mutations in gyrA and two mutations in grlA. DX-619 showed potent activity against strains with MIC values of 2 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: DX-619 was potent against all MRS tested, suggesting that it would be a promising candidate for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection if sufficient in vivo concentrations were safely attained.
