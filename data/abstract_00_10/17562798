Key parasite polymorphisms were assessed in subjects treated for malaria with artesunate-amodiaquine in Tororo, Uganda. For pfcrt, all of the isolates tested had the CVIET haplotype. For pfmdr1, 86Y and 1246Y were common at baseline and their prevalences were significantly higher in new isolates after therapy, indicating that treatment selected for mutations associated with a decreased response to amodiaquine.
