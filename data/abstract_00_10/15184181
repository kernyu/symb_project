Cells growing on surfaces in biofilms exhibit properties distinct from those of planktonic cells, such as increased resistance to biocides and antimicrobial agents. In spite of increased interest in biofilms, very little is known about alterations in cell physiology that occur upon attachment of cells to a surface. In this study we have investigated the changes induced in the protein synthesis by contact of Streptococcus mutans with a surface. Log-phase planktonic cells of S. mutans were allowed to adhere to a glass slide for 2 h in the presence of a (14)C-amino acid mixture. Nonadhered cells were washed away, and the adhered cells were removed by sonication. The proteins were extracted from the nonadhered planktonic and the adhered biofilm cells and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography and image analysis. Image analysis revealed that the relative rate of synthesis of 25 proteins was enhanced and that of 8 proteins was diminished > or =1.3-fold in the biofilm cells. Proteins of interest were identified by mass spectrometry and computer-assisted protein sequence analysis. Of the 33 proteins associated with the adhesion response, all but 10 were identified by mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting. The most prominent change in adhered cells was the increase in relative synthesis of enzymes involved in carbohydrate catabolism indicating that a redirection in protein synthesis towards energy generation is an early response to contact with and adhesion to a surface.
