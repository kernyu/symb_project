In this study, the resistance to antifungal drugs was investigated among 51 strains of Candida tropicalis isolated from clinical samples in the State of Ceara, Brazil. Antifungal resistance was a rare finding in our study and was restricted to three (5.9%) of the strains of Candida tropicalis. These exhibited resistance to both fluconazole and itraconazole.
