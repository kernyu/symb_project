HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 42-year-old man with long-standing HIV-infection (CDC C3) and multiple treatment failures was seen for follow-up 6 months after starting a new HAART (zidovudine, efavirenz, indinavir, ritonavir). The medical history is remarkable for a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, past smoking (10 pack years) and a family history of coronary heart disease of the patient's mother. Physical examination revealed discrete signs of lipoatrophy of the face, arms and legs, but no lipoaccumulation (hip-waist ratio 0.94; body mass index 22 kg/m2). Blood pressure measured 156/92 mmHg. LABORATORY FINDINGS: A rise in CD4 cell count from 24/ microL to 60/ microL was noted. For the first time, the HIV viral load decreased to < 50 copies/mL. Concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol were found to be increased to 26 mmol/L (2275 mg/dL) and 15 mmol/L (580 mg/dL), respectively, compared previously normal readings. Other parameters were in the normal range. DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY: Continuation of HAART resulted in rising CD4 counts to > 200/ microL and HIV viral load suppression to < 50 copies/mL. Neither dietary measures nor treatment with pravastatin significantly changed the drug-induced mixed hyperlipidemia. Treatment with fenofibrate (200 mg qd), however, was followed by a significant reduction of triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations to 12 mmol/L (1050 mg/dL) and 10 mmol/L (387 mg/dL). Addition of pravastatin did not result in further improvement. Arterial hypertension was diagnosed by ambulatory 24-h blood pressure monitoring (systolic 157+/-11 mmHg; diastolic 97+/-10 mmHg). CONCLUSION: HAART-induced mixed hyperlipidaemia is likely to increase the cardiovascular risk. According to first estimates, the 3-year risk of myocardial infarction amounts to 1.29 - 2.09 % for our patient. The 3-year risk of HIV progression to AIDS or death is > 30 % if HAART is stopped or fails upon switching due to unknown archived drug resistance. Thus, despite unsatisfactory lipid profiles, a modification of HAART seems only acceptable, if new, equally potent, but less lipidaemic drug combinations are available.
