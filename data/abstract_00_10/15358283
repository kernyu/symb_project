Synthesis of a number of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine substituted oxazolidinones have been reported. They have been screened against a panel of Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. A SAR has been developed. Compound 15 showed comparable activity (MIC) to linezolid and superior to eperezolid.
