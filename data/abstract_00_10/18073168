Risk factors identify likelihood and severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and may allow prognostication. Prognostic factors can focus resources and efforts on those who may need special observation. Several risk assessment tools are used to estimate the severity of CAP and whether these tools can be used to predict outcomes, to determine disposition or even used to determine ICU level of care is hotly under debate. Treating CAP depends on age and comorbidities, as well as local epidemiology and disease severity. The current guidelines for managing CAP categorize patients with CAP into the healthy outpatient, the outpatient with modifying factors or comorbidities, the inpatient with CAP and patients requiring intensive care unit admission. These guidelines took into account regional bacteriology, antibiotic resistance data and available antibiotics to formulate recommendations. Preventive strategies for CAP include the administration of pneumococcal and influenza vaccine in selected populations at risk.
