Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of fungal meningitis. To survive within the host, this organism must be able to protect itself from oxidative stress. Cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1) is a mitochondrial antioxidant that catalyzes the degradation of hydrogen peroxide. In the present study, we characterized the contribution of the C. neoformans Ccp1 to antioxidant defense and for virulence. Consistent with studies of Ccp1 function in Sacchromyces cerevisiae, we found that Ccp1 contributes to resistance against exogenous oxidative stress in vitro. However, the oxidative stress phenotype does not diminish the virulence of ccp1 mutant strains in a murine model of C. neoformans disease. These results suggest that Ccp1 is involved in a complex system of protection against exogenous oxidative stress and that the elimination of this component of the antioxidant defense system does not diminish the virulence of C. neoformans.
