Assessing the ecological impact of preventive antibiotherapy in hospital practice is an important piece in the strategies aiming at circumventing the development of bacterial resistance. In the present review of the literature, two situations will be taken into account: surgical antibioprophylaxis and selective digestive decontamination. Only the consequences of these on bacterial flora will be considered. Despite some discrepancies, only partially attributable to methodological differences, data as a whole are consistent. For antibioprophylaxis, they confirm the importance of a strict observance of the right therapeutic regimen, especially the duration of treatment. Selective digestive decontamination unquestionably encounters hazards of selecting a resistant flora. Monitoring the intestinal flora under treatment is mandatory. The indications must remain strictly limited.
