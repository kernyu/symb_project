Lipopolysaccharide of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major constituent of the outer membrane, and it is composed of three distinct regions: lipid A, core oligosaccharide, and O antigen. Lipid A and core oligosaccharides (OS) are synthesized and assembled at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane and then translocated to the periplasmic side of the membrane where lipid A-core becomes the acceptor of the O antigens. Here we show that MsbA encoded by pA4997 of the P. aeruginosa genome is a member of the ABC transporter family, but this protein has distinctive features when compared with other MsbA proteins. msbA is an essential gene in this organism since mutation in this gene is lethal to the bacterium. Disruption of the chromosomal msbA was achieved only when a functional copy of the gene was provided in trans. msbA from Escherichiacoli (msbA(Ec)) could not cross complement the msbA merodiploid cells of P. aeruginosa. MsbA was expressed and purified, and the kinetic of its ATPase activity is vastly different than that of MsbA(Ec). The activity of MsbA could be selectively stimulated by different truncated versions of core OS of P. aeruginosa LPS. Specifically, phosphate substituents in the lipid A-core are important for stimulating ATPase activity of MsbA. Expression of MsbA(Ec) but not MsbA(Pa) conferred resistance to erythromycin in P. aeruginosa.
