In this study, we elucidated the efficacy of our prophylactic method for wound infection in pull-percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The total 29 patients received the pull-PEG. The first 8 patients received the oral sterilization with povidone iodine and antibiotics at the time of pull-PEG (Group-I). The frequency of wound infection in this group was 50.0% (4/8). It was revealed that all infections were induced by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 3 patients were MRSA positive in the throat. In Group-II, we eradicated MRSA in the throat before the pull-PEG by combination mupirocin calcium hydrate with the Group-I treatment. In contrast in Group-I, the frequency of wound infection was significantly reduced in Group-II (4.8%: 1/21). The results showed that our eradication method was very useful for prevention of the wound infection in pull-PEG treatment.
