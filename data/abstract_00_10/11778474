OBJECTIVES: To obtain the data on initial and acquired drug resistance, and to evaluate the efficacy of ongoing tuberculosis (TB) control strategies. METHODS: According to the Guidelines for Surveillance of Drug Resistance in Tuberculosis of WHO/IUATLD, randomly selected 30 counties with population proportionate cluster sampling method. Proportion method was used for drug sensitivity test, laboratory quality control was done by Korean super-country reference laboratory. RESULTS: 1,013 TB patients were enrolled in 30 counties, 954 were culture positive, and one with non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The culture positive rate was 94.6%, the contaminated rate was 3.2%. Drug susceptibility testing against streptomycin (SM), isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RFP) and ethambutol (EMB) were performed in 953 cases, the total drug resistant rate was 21.5%, the initial drug resistant rate was 14.8%, the initial multi-drug resistance was 4.4%, the acquired drug and multi-drug resistant rates were 59.0% and 34.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The initial drug resistant rates were decreasing in comparison to 1990 (24.0%), suggesting good effect of DOTS policy implemented in Zhejiang province. However, multi-drug resistant rate was higher in this province than some other countries, indicating more attention should be paid to this situation.
