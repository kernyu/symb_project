Escherichia coli CA0210 was identified in a stool culture of a 03-month-neonate in Tunisia. This strain was resistant to beta-lactams, including ureidopenicillins, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, but it remained susceptible to imipenem and cefoxitin. The beta-lactam-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene of E. coli CA0210 and the upstream and downstream regions were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in E. coli DH5alpha. These resistances were carried by a 1080-bp chromosomal gene that encoded a beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.3. Cloning and sequencing experiments showed that the corresponding blaTEM-15 gene was part of a chromosomally located Tn801 transposon.
