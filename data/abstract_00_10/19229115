AIMS: The long-term efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil in combination with lamivudine to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still unclear. METHODS: Virological response and hepatocarcinogenesis during lamivudine + adefovir were investigated in 183 lamivudine-resistant Japanese patients with chronic genotype C-dominant HBV infection. As the predictors of virological response, an assessment of clinical parameters and a nucleotide (nt) sequence analysis of the negative regulatory element to core gene (nt 1611-2450) were performed at the start of adefovir. RESULTS: The cumulative HBV-DNA non-detectable and ALT normalization rates were 93.6 and 97.6% at the end of 3 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified total bilirubin, AST, and nt substitutions (nt 1762, 1768, 1846, 1896, 2134, 2288, 2441) as determinants of early non-detectable HBV-DNA. The yearly incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during the first 3 years was 2.7%. At the diagnosis of HCC, ALT normalization, HBV-DNA non-detectable, and HBeAg-seronegative conversion rates were 75.0, 83.3, and 57.1%, respectively. Furthermore, the cumulative HBV-DNA non-detectable and ALT normalization rates were not significantly different according to the development of HCC or not. CONCLUSIONS: Lamivudine-resistant patients treated with lamivudine + adefovir could achieve the excellent virological response and biochemical response, but the low hepatitis activity was not enough to suppress hepatocarcinogenesis.
