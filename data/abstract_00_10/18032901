Two HIV-positive male patients with a rarely documented form of genital herpes are described. In both cases the atypical clinical presentation suggested neoplastic rather than infectious lesions. This tumorous genital herpes may occur in HIV-infected patients while on antiretroviral therapy. Since therapeutic failure to nucleoside analogues is common in these cases even in the absence of phenotypical resistance, other treatment options are discussed.
