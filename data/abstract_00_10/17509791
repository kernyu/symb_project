Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize the genetic profiles of 52 Candida tropicalis isolates collected from 10 hospitals in Taiwan. A total of 33 diploid sequence types (DSTs) were differentiated among the 52 isolates and all were novel to the Internet C. tropicalis DST database (http://pubmlst.org/ctropicalis/). Eleven (33.3%) of the 33 DSTs could be assigned to 3 major clonal clusters (1-3) based on eBURST calculation. Only clonal cluster 1 co-clustered isolates from UK and the United States. Clonal cluster 2 was enriched with isolates with resistance or trailing growth of fluconazole (14/20, 70%). Furthermore, there are a number of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis subtypes associated with the isolates in this cluster, demonstrating that possibly more than one clone with resistant or trailing property have emerged and spread in Taiwan in 1999.
