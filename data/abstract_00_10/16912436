PURPOSE: AmpC producing K. pneumoniae have been increasingly reported from India but epidemiological studies are lacking. In the present study, molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum AmpC beta-lactamases (ESACs) producing clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae prevalent in our hospital was studied. METHODS: Fifty-one non-repeat, consecutive, clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae producing AmpC enzymes, were subjected to whole cell protein profile analysis (SDS-PAGE) and ribotyping. The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using standard disk diffusion technique. The isolates showing decreased susceptibility to cefoxitin (< 18 mm) or cefotetan (< 16 mm) were subjected to modified three- dimensional test for detection of AmpC enzyme. RESULTS: Six different types of protein profiles were observed. Ribotyping could further discriminate between the strains that were clustered by protein fingerprinting. Twelve different ribo-patterns were identified. Ribotyping was found to have a better Discriminatory Index (0.98) than that of SDS-PAGE (0.78). Of the 26 isolates that showed decreased susceptibility to cefoxitin and/or cefotetan 13 isolates were found to harbour AmpC enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the usefulness of SDS-PAGE whole cell protein profile analysis and ribotyping to identify the clonality of the ESACs isolates, the latter having a higher discriminatory power. The presence of ESACs isolates in the community as well as in hospital settings emphasizes the need for regular monitoring of antimicrobial resistance.
