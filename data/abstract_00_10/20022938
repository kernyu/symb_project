The in vitro selection of antimicrobial resistance in important pathogens can provide critical information on the genetic basis of drug resistance, and such information can be used to predict, anticipate and even contain the spread of resistance in clinical practice. For instance, the discovery of the role of pfmdr1 in mefloquine resistance in malaria parasites resulted from in vitro studies. However, the in vitro selection of resistance is difficult, challenging and time consuming. In this review, we discuss the key parameters that impact on the efficiency of the in vitro selection of resistance, and propose strategies to improve and streamline this process.
