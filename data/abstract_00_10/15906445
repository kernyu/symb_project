Despite the wide armamentarium available against the human immunodeficiency virus, the efficacy of therapeutic molecules is reduced by the selection of resistant viral strains. Several data argue in favour of an early control of viral replication ever since the first treatment: the intensity of the initial viral replication, as well as results of studies on antiretroviral drugs given as first line treatment and on the early inhibitory response of viral replication. Although an early control is essential for long-term antiviral success, the optimal time limit for the virologic response still needs to be established early knowledge of the virologic response could prove useful in the evaluation of new and more successful therapeutic combinations. Nevertheless, the impact of an earlier control of viral replication on long-term treatment efficacy and on the prevention of resistance emergence deserves further investigation.
