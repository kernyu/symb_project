The aim of the study was to evaluate, under routine circumstances, the immunological and virological efficacy of antiretroviral regimens containing enfuvirtide in multi-class experienced HIV-1 infected patients. This retrospective monocentric study analyzed the clinical, immunological, and virological data of 18 HIV-1 infected patients who started enfuvirtide and completed at least 3 months of therapy. Following 3 months of enfuvirtide therapy, 11 (61%) patients had HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml, among whom 8 (44%) patients below 50 copies/ml. In the ten patients still receiving enfuvirtide after 12 months, the median increase in CD4 cell count was 159 cells/microl (range, -25 to +301) and the mean decrease in HIV-1 RNA was 2.5 +/- 1.4 log(10) copies/ml; in six of these patients, viral load remained below 50 copies/ml. Five patients discontinued enfuvirtide for virological failure but none as a consequence of adverse event. Mutations located within the 36-45 amino acid domain of HR1 region of gp41 and associated to enfuvirtide resistance were found in all seven patients with persistent viral replication. In addition, a new mutation, A50V, emerged in one patient with late viral rebound. Its disappearance after treatment discontinuation suggests that it could play a role in resistance to enfuvirtide. In conclusion, enfuvirtide may be a good therapeutic option as rescue therapy in treatment-experienced patients. However, the mutations conferring resistance to enfuvirtide develop rapidly when viral load is not controlled confirming that enfuvirtide should be prescribed in association with an active background regimen.
