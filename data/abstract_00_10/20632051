Worldwide increasing rates of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) with severe courses and outbreaks have been reported. This change in CDI epidemiology has on one hand been related to the spread of specific PCR ribotypes (e.g. 027) and on the other hand to increased prevalence of resistant C. difficile strains. This single-centre retrospective analysis characterized resistance against erythromycin and moxifloxacin, presence of binary toxin gene and ribotypes in 73 C. difficile isolates from 2008 in comparison with 23 isolates from 1990. In 1990, five different PCR ribotypes including 027 were identified. Resistance against erythromycin was detected in 3 of 23 (13%), while 20 of 23 (87%) from all isolates were susceptible to both erythromycin and moxifloxacin. In contrast, in 2008 a significantly increased prevalence of resistant C. difficile strains was observed, with 40 of 73 (54.8%) isolates being resistant against both antibiotics. Resistant C. difficile strains were mainly assigned to PCR ribotype 001. No isolates belonging to PCR ribotype 027 were identified. Our data provide evidence that the increase of resistant C. difficile strains belonging to PCR ribotype 001 rather than the spread of C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 contribute to the changing epidemiology of CDI.
