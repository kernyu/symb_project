A nosocomial pyogenic liver abscess caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate presented in a man with adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The K. pneumoniae strain isolated from blood and liver aspirate cultures after antibiotic therapy for recurrent bacteremia was resistant to all extended-spectrum beta-lactams except imipenem and differed from K. pneumoniae strains causing community-acquired liver abscesses.
