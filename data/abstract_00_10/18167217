BACKGROUND: Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which in turn promotes cardiomyocytes apoptosis, is associated with the pathogenesis and progression of various cardiac diseases such as ischemia and heart failure. Recent studies have shown that over expression of heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) confers resistance to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, not much is known about the regulation of myocyte survival by Hsp27. METHODS: The rat cardiac cell line H9c2, with a stable overexpression of Hsp27, was established, with empty vector transfected H9c2 cells as controls. Following the cells challenged by Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, apoptosis, intracellular ROS, cell morphology, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the activation of serine/threonine kinase Akt were determined. RESULTS: Along with marked suppression of H2O2-induced injury by Hsp27 overexpression in H9c2 cells, ROS generation and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were also significantly depressed. Furthermore, augmented Akt activation was observed in Hsp27 overexpressed H9c2 cells following H2O2 exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Hsp27 inhibits oxidative stress-induced H9c2 damage and inhibition of ROS generation and the augmentation of Akt activation may be involved in the protective signaling.
