Ciprofloxacin resistance was identified in 18% and 6% of consecutively collected, clinically significant urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli from inpatients and outpatients, respectively. In comparison to ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolates, there were fewer resistant isolates that expressed beta-hemolysis (outpatient, 9% versus 87%, P < 0.0001; inpatient, 4% versus 76%, P < 0.0001) and that had a papEF genotype, genes encoding P fimbriae (outpatient, 30% versus 70%, P = 0.0004; inpatient, 26% versus 70%, P < 0.0001).
