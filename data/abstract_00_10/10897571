A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of MRSA septicemia caused by a contaminated permanent pacemaker lead. A pacemaker system was successfully removed under cardiopulmonary bypass support. Postoperative antibiotics was administered for 7 weeks. Total removal of a pacemaker system under cardiopulmonary bypass support is the treatment of choice in a case with pacemaker infection associated with MRSA septicemia.
