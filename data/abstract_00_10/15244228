AIM: To delineate the clinical features of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia in infants hospitalized at the neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS: Episodes of MRSA bacteraemia in Chang Gung Children's Hospital neonatal intensive care unit from 1997 to 1999 were reviewed for incidence, predisposing factors, clinical presentations, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Ninety episodes of MRSA bacteraemia were identified. The overall rate of MRSA bacteraemia was 1.05 per 1000 patient days during the 3-y period. Most of the patients were premature infants (76%), with prior operation or invasive procedures (39%), had an indwelling intravascular catheter (79%) and exposure to antibiotic therapy (96%). A localized cutaneous infection was found in 53.3% of the episodes. The most common clinical diagnoses were catheter-related infections (54.4%), skin and soft tissue infections (21.1%), bacteraemia without a focus (20%) and pneumonia (16.7%). Metastatic infection occurred in 18% of these infants. Among the patients treated with vancomycin for < or = 14 d, 88.7% did not develop any complications, and 11.3% developed a recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA is an established pathogen in our NICU. MRSA bacteraemia in the neonates predominantly presented as catheter-related infections, and metastatic infections were not infrequently seen. In uncomplicated MRSA bacteraemia, treatment with vancomycin for < or = 14 d seems to be adequate.
