AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine two VanA-type vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) strains that had been isolated from patients resident in mainland China. This is the first molecular analysis of clinical VRE strains being isolated in mainland China. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two VanA-type VRE isolates were isolated from in-patients at hospitals located in the Chinese cities Beijing and Dalian and were designated C264 and I125. The plasmids pC264V (40 kbp) and pI125V (370 kbp) that were isolated from C264 and I125, respectively, carried a Tn1546-like element encoding VanA resistance. The vancomycin-resistant plasmids pC264V and pI125V were transferred by filter mating at frequencies of 10(-7) and 10(-4) respectively. Sequence analysis of pC264V revealed that two IS1216V sequences and an IS1542 sequence were present within the Tn1546-like element. pI125V had two IS1216V insertions in the Tn1546-like element. CONCLUSIONS: The two VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) strains C264 and I125 were isolated from in-patients in Chinese hospitals. The vancomycin-resistant conjugative plasmids pC264V and pI125V plasmids isolated from these strains carried the Tn1546-like element. The Tn1546-like element was found to contain the insertion sequences IS1216V and IS1542. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first molecular analysis of VanA-type VRE strains from patients resident in mainland China.
