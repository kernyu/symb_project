The genetic compositions of 71 isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from Poland were determined by spoligotyping. Nearly 80% of the isolates belonged to either the T or the Haarlem family. The genotypic diversity was largely due to variation within those families. The scarcity of imported genotypes suggested that the M. tuberculosis population studied has an endemic nature.
