A 9-year-old female developed facial papules and pustules since four years. Clinically, perioral dermatitis was suspected. Different topical therapy regimens and systemic anibiotics had been unsuccessful and a skin biopsy showed granulomatous (lupoid) rosacea. Only systemic antibiotic treatment with minocyclin led to healing of the skin lesions. While granulomatous rosacea-like dermatitis is more frequently diagnosed in adults, it is only rarely encountered in children where, in most of the cases, it represents a therapeutic challenge.
