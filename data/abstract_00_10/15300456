The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of the new echinocandins caspofungin (MK-0991) and anidulafungin (LY303366) on human phagocytes. Phagocytosis, oxidative burst and intracellular killing of Candida albicans were analyzed by flow cytometry. Neither caspofungin nor anidulafungin significantly influenced phagocytosis. Only caspofungin significantly influenced oxidative burst after 15 min of incubation ( P<0.05). Both caspofungin and anidulafungin improved intracellular killing rates of C. albicans after 2 h of incubation (42.4% and 43.2%, respectively, compared to 37.9% in controls; P<0.05). In conclusion, caspofungin significantly improves oxidative burst and intracellular killing, which may be advantageous for clinical therapy.
