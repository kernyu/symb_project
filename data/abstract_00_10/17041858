BACKGROUND: The role of structured treatment interruption (STI) before optimized antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is uncertain. METHODS: AIDS Clinical Trial Group protocol A5086 was a prospective trial of 41 patients with multiple drug class-resistant HIV who were randomized to undergo a 16-week STI followed by optimized ART (STI) or immediate optimized ART (no STI). The primary end point was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA loads <400 copies/mL 48 weeks after randomization. RESULTS: Of 39 evaluable patients, 4 (19%) in the STI arm and 6 (33%) in the no STI arm had HIV-1 RNA loads <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks (P=.44). Median changes from baseline in CD4+ cell counts and HIV-1 RNA loads were similar for both arms. Standard genotypes at the end of STI showed nearly complete reversion to wild-type virus in a minority of patients (n=5; 28%). Virus with 3-drug class resistance reemerged even when ART included only 1 or 2 drug classes. Single-genome sequencing showed that each genome encoded resistance mutations for 3 drug classes. CONCLUSIONS: A 16-week STI before optimized ART did not improve virologic response. Genetic analyses strongly suggest that virologic failure resulted from the reemergence of virus present before STI that encoded 3-drug class resistance on the same genome.
