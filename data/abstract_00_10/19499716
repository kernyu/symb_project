Clinico-roentgenologic and bacteriologic efficacy and safety of rifapex (rifapentin) were investigated in the complex therapy of 90 patients with newly recorded drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Pifapex was shown to be effective in the treatment of the patients during the acute phase of the disease, during the treatment completeness and during the short preoperative period.
