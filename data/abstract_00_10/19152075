Insect cell expression systems are widely used to produce active recombinant proteins. Here, we have developed a high-level expression vector containing a selectable marker for continuous production of recombinant proteins in insect cells. The plasmid, pXIHAbla, developed in this study, established a polyclonal cell line 8 days shorter than pXINSECT-DEST38 and pBmAneo. In addition, pXIHAbla exhibited an approximately fivefold higher average enhanced GFP expression level and approximately a twofold higher bionanocapsule secretion level than pXINSECT-DEST38. Using this plasmid, insect cells that highly express active proteins have been easily established.
