The 5-year time course of changes in a tuberculous process was studied in 111 patients with drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. 42% of the patients died from tuberculosis. The activity of tuberculosis was preserved in 23% of the patients. Cure occurred in 30%. Cure was achieved in 72% of the patients in case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis monoresistance and in 13.5% in case of multiple resistance to, on the average, 5 drugs, including isoniazid and rifampicin.
