Two chromogenic media (Chromagar VRE and chromID VRE [C-ID]) performed equally well in the direct detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in stool specimens after an overnight enrichment step and a 48-h incubation period, with a sensitivity of 98.2% (56/57) for both and specificities of 96.5% (195/202) and 97.5% (197/202), respectively. However, assigning discriminatory colony color was sometimes difficult, especially on C-ID. In order to facilitate simple species identification, biochemical key reactions were implemented.
