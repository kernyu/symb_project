Resistance to antimicrobial agents is the most important feature of biofilm infections. As a result, infections caused by bacterial biofilms are persistent and very difficult to eradicate. Although several mechanisms have been postulated to explain reduced susceptibility to antimicrobials in bacterial biofilms, it is becoming evident that biofilm resistance is multifactorial. The contribution of each of the different mechanisms involved in biofilm resistance is now beginning to emerge.
