OBJECTIVE: To assess metabolic changes after initiation of protease inhibitor (PI)-sparing regimens in antiretroviral-naive patients. METHODS: Metabolic changes were analyzed within the triple-nucleoside (zidovudine [ZDV]/lamivudine [3TC]/abacavir [ABC])-containing, 3-drug efavirenz (EFV) [ZDV/3TC + EFV]-containing, and 4-drug EFV [ZDV/3TC/ABC + EFV]-containing arms of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group multicenter trial A5095. Metabolic values were compared with published US general population norms. RESULTS: From week 0 to week 24, all arms exhibited similar mild median increases in glucose and decreases in insulin sensitivity, whereas changes in lipids were greater in the ZDV/3TC + EFV and ZDV/3TC/ABC + EFV arms than in the ZDV/3TC/ABC arm: triglyceride (TG; 7, 18, and -1 mg/dL, respectively), total cholesterol (TC; 23, 28, and 5 mg/dL, respectively), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; 9, 14, and 1 mg/dL, respectively), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; 10, 10, and 5 mg/dL, respectively). Adjusted mean study lipid values of all study participants at week 0 and week 96 compared with those of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 through 2002 values were: TG (148, 187, and 123 mg/dL, respectively), TC (164, 195, and 203 mg/dL, respectively), HDL-C (35, 47, and 51 mg/dL, respectively), and LDL-C (101, 117, and 123 mg/dL, respectively) (P < or = 0.005 for each value vs. NHANES values). CONCLUSIONS: Similar mild increases in glucose and decreases in insulin sensitivity were observed in all regimens, whereas lipids were modestly higher in the EFV-containing arms. Compared with general population norms, the metabolic dysfunctions of concern after these PI-sparing therapies were increasingly abnormal TC and lower (but improved relative to baseline) HDL-C levels.
