To evaluate the potential impact of antipneumococcal vaccination in Italy, Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from invasive disease were collected from 65 laboratories in the years 1997-2000. Of the 503 isolates examined, 15% were from children <5 years and 34% from adults > or = 65 years. The most frequent serogroups were, in ranking order, 14, 19, 6, and 23. Overall, 93.8% of the isolates belonged to serogroups enclosed in the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine. Among children isolates, serotypes 14, 6B, and 23F comprised 60% of the isolates; overall, 72% of the isolates belonged to serotypes included in the heptavalent conjugate vaccine. Penicillin nonsusceptible isolates (10%) belonged to a limited number of serogroups, being more common in serogroups 19 and 9 and in the nonvaccine serogroups 24 and 35. Erythromycin-resistant isolates (29%) belonged to several serogroups, more frequently to serogroups 14, 6, and 19. Both vaccines are potentially able to prevent the majority of resistant infections in the respective age groups in Italy.
