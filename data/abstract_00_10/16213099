Two genes recently associated with glycopeptide intermediate resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) are mprF and tcaA, with inactivation causing shifts in vancomycin resistance. This study reveals that expression levels of both genes are similar in groups of clinical GISA, heteroGISA and glycopeptide susceptible strains, suggesting no association with clinical isolates.
