This study determined the influence of curing lights and modes on composite resistance to chemical degradation by various food-simulating liquids. Two different types of curing light (Halogen [H]-Elipar Trilight, 3M-ESPE; LED [L]-Freelight, 3M-ESPE) and two curing modes (standard [S]; exponential [E) were evaluated in the study. Forty-five composite (Z100 [3M-ESPE]) specimens were made for each light-curing mode combination (HS, HE, LS and LE). The specimens were randomly divided into five groups of nine and exposed to the following food-simulating liquids (FSL) for one week at 37 degrees C: distilled water, 50% aqueous ethanol solution, heptane and citric acid. Specimens stored in air were used as control. After the one week conditioning period, hardness testing was conducted with a digital microhardness tester (load = 500 gf; dwell time = 15 seconds). Mean hardness (HK)/hardness deterioration (deltaHK) were subsequently computed and data was subjected to analysis using ANOVA/Scheffe's test (p < 0.05). The resistance of composite to chemical degradation by FSL was light/curing mode dependent. Significant differences in HK and deltaHK were observed among the four curing techniques after conditioning in some FSL and air. After conditioning in water and citric acid, specimens polymerized with HE underwent significantly more softening compared to specimens polymerized with HS, LS and LE.
