516 bacterial isolates were obtained from 502 pus samples, collected from post operative wound infections. Staphylococcus aureus (n=166) was the most frequently isolated bacteria followed by Escherichia coli (n=114), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=65), Acinetobacter (n=43), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=29) and others. Majority of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ampicillin-clavulanic acid, cephelexin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, fluoroquinolones and cotrimoxazole. Alarming antimicrobial resistance made it imperative that measures for control be taken with special emphasis on formulation and implementation of antibiotic policy.
