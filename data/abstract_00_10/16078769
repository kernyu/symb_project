In the treatment of confirmed influenza, neuraminidase inhibitors yield only a limited reduction in the duration of disease and are neither efficacious nor cost-effective. Neuraminidase inhibitors would be cost-effective if a deadly influenza virus that is highly sensitive to oseltamivir causes a pandemic soon. If not, then the money invested in establishing a store of oseltamivir is wasted and lost to the health-care sector.
