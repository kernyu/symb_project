Two commercially available DNA line probe assays, Genotype MTBDR and INNO-LiPA Rif. TB, were evaluated for their abilities to detect resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) in 52 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. The test results were compared to those obtained by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and sequencing. Compared to the results of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing, the Genotype MTBDR test results were concordant for INH for 47 of the 52 (90.4%) isolates, and both the Genotype MTBDR and the INNO-LiPA Rif. TB test results were concordant for RIF for 51 of the 52 (98.1%) isolates. The Genotype MTBDR test results correlated with the sequencing results for 48 of the 52 (92.3%) isolates and the INNO-LiPA Rif. TB results for 50 of the 52 (96.2%) isolates. Both assays are useful for the rapid screening of M. tuberculosis isolates obtained from patients suspected of having multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but the GenoType MTBDR assay has the advantage of being able to detect resistance to both INH and RIF simultaneously.
