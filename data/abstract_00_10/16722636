Molecular modeling studies and an updated highly predictive 3-D QSAR model led to the discovery of exceptionally potent indolyl aryl sulfones (IASs) characterized by the presence of either a pyrrolidyn-2-one nucleus at the indole-2-carboxamide or some substituents at the indole-2-carbohydrazide. Compounds 7 and 9 were found active in the sub-nanomolar range of concentration in both MT-4 and C8166 cell-based anti-HIV assays. These compounds, and in particular compound 9, also showed excellent inhibitory activity against both HIV-112 and HIV-AB1 primary isolates in lymphocytes and against HIV WT in macrophages.
