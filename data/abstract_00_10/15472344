A new cefoxitin-agar medium (CAM)-based assay was compared to the previously published modified three-dimensional (M3D) assay for the detection of AmpC production in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Clinical isolates of cefoxitin-resistant E. coli (n = 5) and K. pneumoniae (n = 7) and multiple control strains with and without AmpC enzymes were tested by both methods. The CAM method with 4 microg of cefoxitin/ml was equivalent to the M3D method for detecting AmpC production in E. coli and K. pneumoniae. This new method is easier to perform and interpret and allows for testing of multiple isolates on a single plate.
