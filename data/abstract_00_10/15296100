This study presents the efficiency of the experimental antifungal agents 6-amino-2-n-pentylthiobenzothiazole (APB) and the echinocandin micafungin, and amphotericin B against fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis (MIC95 for fluconazole > 64 mg/l). The benzothiazole APB was less active against C. albicans and C. dubliniensis (MIC80 = 8 - 32 mg/l, MIC95 = 16 - 64 mg/l) than amphotericin B, which was efficient in a concentration range from 0.125 to 2 mg/l. However, the efficiency of micafungin was very high with MIC80, and MIC100 < or = 0.031 mg/l.
