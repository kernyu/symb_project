The current 6-month tuberculosis (TB) therapy is suboptimal with significant side effects and a poor patient compliance problem that frequently selects drug-resistant organisms. The increasing drug-resistant TB problem highlights the need to develop new and more effective drugs. Significant progress has been made recently with several new drug candidates currently in clinical trials. Improved understanding of persister biology and development of persister drugs are likely to be important for developing a more effective therapy.
