BACKGROUND: Calcineurin inhibitor drugs (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) given to renal transplant recipients to prevent rejection are associated with an increased incidence of hypertension. Reduced arterial compliance, which is a consequence of hypertension, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and can be measured noninvasively using pulse wave analysis technology. The purpose of the study was to determine whether calcineurin inhibitor drugs have any effect on arterial compliance. METHODS: A total of 36 stable renal transplant recipients were evaluated using pulse wave analysis to determine large and small vessel compliance. Of the patients, 18 were receiving cyclosporine and 18 tacrolimus. Patients were matched for age and sex. RESULTS: No significant differences in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, or small vessel compliance were observed. There was a significant decrease in large vessel compliance in patients receiving tacrolimus versus those receiving cyclosporine, respectively (13.5 +/- 4.0 mL/mm Hg x 10 v 9.9 +/- 3.3 mL/mm Hg x 10; P =.005). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in large vessel compliance in renal transplant subjects may depend on the choice of calcineurin inhibitor. Specifically, decreased large vessel compliance in tacrolimus-treated subjects may be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. This may be due to a difference in vascular collagen accumulation or to elastin loss in large elastic arteries.
