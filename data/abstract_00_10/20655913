The main aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of SNPs-haplotypes of dhfr and dhps genes associated to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in Plasmodium vivax clinical isolates circulating in a malaria endemic area, Pakistan. All 164 collected isolates were analyzed for SNPs-haplotypes at positions 13, 33, 57, 58, 61, 117 and 173 of pvdhfr and 383 and 553 of pvdhps genes using PCR-RFLP methods. All examined isolates were found to carry wild-type amino acids at positions 13, 33, 57, 61 and 173, while 58R and 117N mutations were detected among 15.2% and 53.6% of isolates, respectively. Based on the size polymorphism of pvdhfr genes at repeat region, type B (79.3%) was the most prevalent variant. The combination of pvdhfr and pvdhps haplotypes demonstrated nine distinct haplotypes. The three most prevalent haplotypes were I(13)P(33)F(57)S(58)T(61)S(117)I(173)/A(383)A(553) (43.9%), I(13)P(33)F(57)S(58)T(61)N(117)I(173)/A(383)A(553) (33.6%) and I(13)P(33)F(57)R(58)T(61)N(117)I(173)/A(383)A(553) (12.2%). The presence of mutant haplotypes is worrying and indicates the emergence of drug tolerant/resistant P. vivax isolates in Pakistan in near future.
