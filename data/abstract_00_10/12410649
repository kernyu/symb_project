Between January 1999 and December 2001, 33 HIV-negative haemophiliacs with interferon-nonresponsive chronic hepatitis C were treated with interferon (IFN) alpha2b (5 MU three times weekly) and ribavirin (1-1.2 g daily) for 12 months. Four patients (12.1%) dropped out of the study due to adverse effects. At the end of therapy, normalization of ALT occurred in 14/33 treated patients (42.4%) and HCV-RNA was cleared in 12 (36.4%). Eleven patients (33.3%) became sustained responders. Genotype 1 was the only factor associated with a poor response to therapy (P < 0.001). Our study shows that IFN and ribavirin combination therapy is effective in HIV-negative chronically HCV-infected haemophiliacs who do not respond to a previous IFN treatment.
