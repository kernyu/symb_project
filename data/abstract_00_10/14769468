Frequently bacteria are exposed to membrane-damaging cationic antimicrobial molecules (CAMs) produced by the host's immune system (defensins, cathelicidins) or by competing microorganisms (bacteriocins). Staphylococcus aureus achieves CAM resistance by modifying anionic phosphatidylglycerol with positively charged L-lysine, resulting in repulsion of the peptides. Inactivation of the novel S. aureus gene, mprF, which is found in many bacterial pathogens, has resulted in the loss of lysylphosphatidylglycerol (L-PG), increased inactivation by CAM-containing neutrophils, and attenuated virulence. We demonstrate here that expression of mprF is sufficient to confer L-PG production in Escherichia coli, which indicates that MprF represents the L-PG synthase. L-PG biosynthesis was studied in vitro and found to be dependent on phosphatidylglycerol and lysyl-tRNA, two putative substrate molecules. Further addition of cadaverin, a competitive inhibitor of the lysyl-tRNA synthetases, or of RNase A abolished L-PG biosynthesis, thereby confirming the involvement of lysyl-tRNA. This study forms the basis for further detailed analyses of L-PG biosynthesis and its role in bacterial infections.
