Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk-factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high-risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimise initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.
