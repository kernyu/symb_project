Intravenous micafungin (Mycamine; Funguard) is an echinocandin indicated in Japan and the EU for the treatment of pediatric patients (including neonates) with invasive candidiasis and as prophylaxis against Candida infection in pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the EU, micafungin is also indicated in pediatric patients who are expected to have neutropenia for >/=10 days. In Japan, children may also receive micafungin for the treatment of, or as prophylaxis against, invasive Aspergillus infection. Micafungin is not currently approved for use in pediatric patients in the US. Micafungin has very good antifungal activity against a wide range of Candida spp. in vitro. It has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile allowing for once-daily administration, has few drug-drug interactions, and reports of resistance are rare. The results of pediatric substudies indicate that intravenous micafungin is effective in a majority of patients for the treatment of candidemia and other types of invasive candidiasis, and provides effective prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT. The tolerability profile of micafungin in pediatric patients was generally acceptable. In the EU, micafungin is indicated for use when other antifungal medications are not appropriate. Therefore, micafungin provides an alternative to other antifungal agents used in the management of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in pediatric patients, or as prophylaxis against fungal infections in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT.
