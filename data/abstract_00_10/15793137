The mechanisms by which rRNA mutations confer clindamycin resistance were examined in Mycobacterium smegmatis strains containing homogeneous populations of ribosomes with base substitutions at nucleotides A2058 and A2059. Computer graphic predictions based on structural studies correlate with the resistance phenotypes for six of seven strains with unique rRNA mutations.
