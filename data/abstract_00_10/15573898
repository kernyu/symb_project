The study of the mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance in gramnegative pathogens of nosocomial infections in 14 hospitals of Russia showed that the basic mechanism was production of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, mainly adenylyl transferase ANT(2"), acetyl transferases AAC(3)-V and ACC(6)-I, and phosphotransferases APH(3')-I and APH(3')-VI. In all the hospitals enzymes modifying gentamicin and tobramycin were wide spread while the resistance phenotypes to aminoglycosides were different in separate hospitals. Isepamycin proved to be the most active aminoglycoside. Recommendations for the use of antibiotics in hospital formulas and empiric therapy should be developed on the basis of the local specific features of the resistance in nosocomial pathogens to aminoglycosides.
