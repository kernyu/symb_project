The mechanism of the postantibiotic effect (PAE) was examined in Escherichia coli. Drugs exhibited longer-lasting PAEs in an acrAB mutant, suggesting that intracellular drug concentrations influence the duration of the PAE. With specific assays for tetracycline and erythromycin, a direct link between intracellular persistence of antibiotics and maintenance of the PAE was established.
