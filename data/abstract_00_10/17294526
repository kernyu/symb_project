Current trends in the epidemiology, outcome and variables influencing mortality in bacteremic lung transplant recipients have not been fully described. We prospectively studied bacteremias in lung transplant recipients in a multicenter study between 2000-2004. Bacteremia was documented in 56 lung transplant recipients, an average of 172 days after transplantation. Multiple antibiotic resistance was documented in 48% of the isolates; these included 57% of the Gram-negative and 38% of the Gram-positive bacteria. Pulmonary infection was the most common source of resistant gram-negative bacteremias. Mortality rate at 28 days after the onset of bacteremia was 25% (14/56). Mechanical ventilation and abnormal mental status correlated independently with higher mortality (p < 0.05 for both variables). Bacteremia remains a significant complication in lung transplant recipients and is associated with considerable mortality. Recognition of variables portending a high risk for antibiotic resistance and for poor outcome has implications relevant for optimizing antibiotic prescription and for improving outcomes in lung transplant recipients.
