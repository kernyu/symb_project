The following study analyses the potentialities of the experimental huts built in M'be Valley (Cote d'Ivoire) where the evaluations of the insecticide products have been carried out for many years in line with the WHOPES protocol on the methodology of stage 2 assays. Starting a testing station first requires a good knowledge of the sensitivity of Anopheles gambiae to the main insecticide families. Then thanks to the experimental huts the efficacy of the various means of treatment can be compared with the one in untreated huts; this study focuses on house spraying using 100 mg a.i./m2 and bednets impregnated with lambda-cyhalothrin at a dose of 15 mg a.i./m2. The fipronil used in house spraying doesn't show any repellent effect, however it does have an irritating effect that increases the natural exophily of An. gambiae females entering the testing huts. The blood-feeding rate recorded in the treated huts was reduced to 24% and to 38% mortality rate consisting mainly of a 24 hours delayed mortality. The bednets treated with lambda-cyhalothrin have greatly reduced the contact between man and vector since the entry rate of An. gambiae females was cut down by 68% compared to the control. The exophily of this anopheles was twofold greater with the impregnated bednets and the blood-feeding rate reduced to 47%. Finally the global mortality rate, two thirds of immediate mortality, one third of delayed mortality, reached 35%. The experimental huts in the M'be Valley therefore provide essential information regarding the selection of the most efficacious insecticides against An. gambiae. This experimental method must be extended to other sites in order to finalize ever more selective and appropriate means of control against nuisance and disease-vector mosquitoes.
