Increased isolation of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) with decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin prompted this epidemiological survey in the authors intensive care unit. Of 224 medical and surgical patients with hepatobiliary disease, in hospital between December 1998 and July 1999, 14 (6.3%) had at least one isolate of CoNS with decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin. A total of 27 isolates with decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin were recovered from these 14 patients. Pulsed field electrophoresis (PFGE) with Sma I endonuclease demonstrated that CoNS isolates obtained from different patients were unrelated. In addition, different isolates obtain from the same patient were also unrelated, with the exception of two patients. Eighteen out of 27 isolates (66.7%) with decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin were recovered after an earlier treatment with teicoplanin or vancomycin (median 13.1 g, range 2.4-32.7 g per patient). Only four CoNS strains with decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin induced serious infection, all of which responded well to vancomycin therapy. Emergence of CoNS strains with decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin remained limited in hospitalized patients, and was not related to a clonal spread of a particular resistant strain.
