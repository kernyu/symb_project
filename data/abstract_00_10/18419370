We investigated a cluster of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in college football players. Risk factors included a history of recurrent skin infections and contact with the skin lesions of persons outside college. The infections were controlled through treatment of carriers with topical mupirocin, chlorhexidine body washes, and enhancement of personal hygiene practices. Varsity and professional teams need to consider similar preventive measures.
