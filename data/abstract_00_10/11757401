A total of 510 Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica strains representing 56 serotypes, isolated from human stool specimens during 1998-2000 in sanitary-epidemiological units in Poland were tested for their susceptibility by a standard disk diffusion method for: ampicillin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, furazolidone, cotrimoxazole, sulfonamides and trimethoprim. For 201 of the investigated strains, belonging to 5 most common isolated serotypes (S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Hadar, S. Infantis and S. Virchow) the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for the aforementioned antibiotics, as well as for amoxicillin with clavulanian were determined. Selected strains were screened for production extended spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs). It was observed that 42.9% of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica strains were resistant to 2 or more antibiotics, with the highest prevalence of MDR strains among serotypes Typhimurium, Hadar and Virchow. Resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, furazolidone and sulphonamides was observed most frequently. Over 93% of S. Virchow strains were resistant to furazolidone. No strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were detected according to the NCCLS guidelines, but 31.3% of isolates exhibiting reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility (MICs ranging between 0.125 and 0.5 mg/l). Two strains S. Mbandaka and Salmonella group D (variant motility--) were resistant to cefotaxime and probably produced ESBL.
