BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: As a marked increase in the number of patients with candidaemia was reported in the first half (1991-1995) of the last decade at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India, the present study was aimed at determining further change if any, in the incidence and distribution of Candida species and their antifungal resistance pattern during the second half (1996-2000) of the same decade. METHODS: The patients with candidaemia were studied to determine the frequency of candidaemia and Candida species isolated during 1996-2000. One hundred Candida strains other than Pichia anomala (C. pelliculosa) were randomly selected from those isolates to evaluate antifungal susceptibility pattern against amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole. The results were compared with our previous study. RESULTS: An increase in the number of patients with candidaemia was observed during 1996 (538) and 1997 (421) compared to 1998-2000 due to P. anomala outbreak. With the control of the outbreak, a substantial decrease in the incidence of candidaemia was observed from 1998 (251 in 1998, 122 in 1999 and 165 in 2000). A higher isolation of non-C. albicans Candida species (89.8%) was observed, with C. tropicalis being the most common (541, 36.1%) agent. No major change in the isolation rate of other non-C. albicans Candida species (C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis) was observed. An emergence of resistance to amphotericin B in 15.4 per cent C. albicans, 8.1 per cent C. tropicalis and 33.3 per cent C. krusei strains was observed. An increase in resistance to ketoconazole (from 0% to 13%) and 5-fluorocytosine (from 1% to 8%) and a decrease to fluconazole (from 13% to 6%) were observed. Resistance to itraconazole was observed in 17 per cent of Candida strains by broth macro-dilution method. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: A change in the isolation of Candida species was observed i.e. in the incidence and isolation of non-C. albicans Candida species. Emergence of resistance to amphotericin B and increase of resistance to most other antifungals are cause for concern.
