Our objective was to correlate antibiotic resistance in gut E. coli flora of children, aged 6-72 months, with use of antibiotics, socioeconomic status (SES) and household characteristics in the urban communities of Yurimaguas and Moyobamba in the Amazonian area of Peru. Caregivers of 1598 children were interviewed using a structured questionnaire in a cross-sectional survey. Faecal samples were collected from the children and the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli was analysed by a rapid resistance screening method. Significantly higher odds for resistance were seen for children who had used antibiotics, both during the last 2 weeks and the last 6 months. Children from wealthier families had significantly higher odds for resistance to a number of antibiotics than children from the least wealthy families (Yurimaguas: nalidixic acid, OR = 2.13; ciprofloxacin, OR = 2.09; chloramphenicol, OR = 1.98. Moyobamba: nalidixic acid, OR = 1.59; ciprofloxacin, OR = 1.69). Thus, the children of wealthier families had a significantly increased odds ratio for resistance, also when controlling for the family's antibiotic use. Unknown factors related to socioeconomic status seem to contribute to the results seen in the study area.
