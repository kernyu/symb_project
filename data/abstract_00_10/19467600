(1H-Pyridin-4-ylidene)amines containing lipophilic side chains at the imine nitrogen atom were prepared as potential clopidol isosteres in the development of antimalarials. Their antiplasmodial activity was evaluated in vitro against the Plasmodium falciparum W2 (chloroquine-resistant) and FCR3 (atovaquone-resistant) strains. The most active of these derivatives, 4m, had an IC(50) of 1microM against W2 and 3microM against FCR3. Molecular modeling studies suggest that (1H-pyridin-4-ylidene)amines may bind to the ubiquinol oxidation Q(o) site of cytochrome bc(1).
