To assess the current distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of uropathogens isolated from community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Dakar, a retrospective study was carried out at the biomedical laboratory of Institut Pasteur de Dakar between January 1999 and December 2000. The most important finding, among Enterobacteriaceae, was the emergence of multidrug resistant strains (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and both chromosomally derepressed and plasmid mediated cephalosporinase producing strains) affecting 2.9% of all Enterobacteriaceae. Of Gram-positive cocci, 15% of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant. Our data show the original distribution of uropathogens from UTIs in ambulant patients and the emergence of multidrug resistant strains in Dakar.
