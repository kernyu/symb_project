Ubiquinone Q(10) (coenzyme Q) is an important component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and an antioxidant. The purpose of this work was to find out whether an increase in the level of coenzyme Q in the heart changes its maximal working capacity and resistance to oxidative stress. Male Wistar rats were treated with coenzyme Q (10 mg/kg body weight per day) for six weeks, and this increased its content in the myocardium by 63%. The myocardial content of malonic dialdehyde and activities of key antioxidant enzymes were unchanged, except nearly 2.5-fold decrease in the activity of superoxide dismutase. The maximal working capacity of the isolated isovolumic heart did not change, but under conditions of oxidative stress induced by 45-min infusion of hydrogen peroxide (70 micro M) into coronary vessels the contractile function of these hearts decreased significantly more slowly. This was associated with less pronounced lesions in the ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes and lesser disorders in the oxidative metabolism of mitochondria that suggested increased antioxidant protection of the myocardium.
