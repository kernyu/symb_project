INTRODUCTION: The activity and capacity for penetration of linezolid and vancomycin were comparatively evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms. METHODS: The activity of linezolid versus vancomycin was assessed against 24-hour S. epidermidis biofilms developed on silicon catheters. Penetration of the two antimicrobial agents was measured in biofilms developed on polycarbonate membrane filters. Penetration and activity were comparatively tested using S. epidermidis, slime-producing and non-slime-producing strains. RESULTS: The activity of linezolid against S. epidermidis biofilms was significantly greater than that of vancomycin for both strains. Neither antimicrobial completely eradicated bacterial survival in 24-hour biofilms. Linezolid penetration in biofilms was greater than that of vancomycin for both S. epidermidis strains. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid showed higher in vitro activity than vancomycin against S. epidermidis biofilms on silicone catheters. This effect may be due to the capability of linezolid to cross the bacterial biofilm.
