The effect of oxidants (hydrogen peroxide and juglone) on the growth, respiration, and naphthoquinone synthesis in the fungus Fusarium decemcellulare was studied. The addition of the oxidants to the exponential-phase fungus inhibited cell respiration (either partially or completely, depending on the oxidant concentration), culture growth, and naphthoquinone synthesis. The treatment of fungal cells with nonlethal concentrations of H2O2 (below 0.25 mM) and juglone (below 0.1 mM) induced the resistance of cell respiration to cyanide. The residual respiration in the presence of cyanide could be inhibited by benzohydroxamic acid, indicating the occurrence of alternative oxidase. Increased concentrations of oxidants (0.25 mM juglone and 0.5 mM H2O2) rapidly and irreversibly inhibited cell respiration. These observations suggest that the mitochondrial respiratory chain of fungal cells exposed to oxidative stress is subject to the action of active oxygen species. The treatment of fungal cells with nonlethal concentrations of H2O2 and juglone activated cellular glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which are protective enzymes against oxidative stress.
