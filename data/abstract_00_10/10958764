The heterozygous 32 base pair deletion of the chemokine receptor 5 (Delta32CCR5) has been associated with a more benign course of HIV-1-infection. To study the influence of Delta32CCR5 on the response to antiviral therapy we analyzed the presence of Delta32CCR5 by PCR in PBMC from 107 randomly selected HIV-1-infected patients treated with HAART for at least three months. 24 of 107 patients were heterozygous for Delta32CCR5 (22.4%). Before initiation of HAART Delta32CCR5 heterozygous patients (d/w) did not differ from homozygous CCR5 wild-type patients (w/w) regarding viral load and CD4 counts. After a median treatment time on HAART of 17.5 months (d/w, range 6-31 months, p = n.s.) or 19 months (w/w, range 3-33 months) all 24 patients (100%) with the Delta32CCR5 mutation, but only 58/83 patients (69.9%) with wild-type CCR5 showed a suppression of HIV-1-viremia below 500 copies/ml (p = 0.0020). Furthermore, 20/24 (83.3%) of the Delta32CCR5 heterozygous patients achieved CD4 counts above 200/microliter, but only 57/83 (68.7%) of the patients homozygous for CCR5 wild-type (p = 0.011). Our data indicate that the presence of heterozygous Delta32CCR5 is associated with a better response to HAART suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting CCR5 could be of value for a sustained suppression of HIV-1 by HAART.
