BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are few studies analyzing the epidemiological characteristics of Escherichia coli bacteremia including the susceptibility to antibiotics and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHOD: E. coli bacteremia episodes were recorded from January 1989 to December 1998. Clinical variables, setting acquisition, source of bacteremia, outcome and susceptibility to antibiotics were included. The study was prospective and comparative. Descriptive and univariate analysis were performed. RESULTS: 330 episodes of E. coli bacteremia were recorded: 117 in women. The most frequent source was the urinary tract (68%), followed by an abdominal and biliary focus. E. coli bacteremia appeared mostly in groups II and III of McCabe & Jackson. In 46 cases (14%), E. coli bacteremia was nosocomial. Crude and related mortality was 6.6 and 4.2%, respectively. A significant increase in the resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological characteristics of E. coli bacteremia have not changed, yet the mortality was lower in our series. Preventive measures in the hospital and a rational use of antibiotics, principally quinolones, are necessary.
