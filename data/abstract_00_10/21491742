This study aimed to evaluate the economic implications of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) on malaria management through the rational use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). The study was carried out in 2006 from November 10th to December 10th; it focused on patients who were seen and treated with ACT for suspicion of uncomplicated malaria in the health district of Ziguinchor, Senegal. The variables studied included age, sex, RDT results, and costs of care and RDT. The cost of care for malaria, estimated in CFA Francs, was evaluated both with and without the use of RDT. Among the 379 patients, 25,1% were aged 0-4 years, 12,7% of 5-14 years and 62,2% of at least 15 years; 51% were women. The result of the RDT was negative in 60% of cases. Without the use of diagnostic testing, the cost of care for all 379 cases was estimated at 299 957 CFA: patient contributions would cover 184 500 CFA and the State would cover the rest (115 457 CFA). With the use of RDTs, the overall cost of the RDT screening for 379 patients and the cost of treatment for the 150 positive cases amounted to 254 786 CFA, with patients bearing the cost of 205 550 CFA and the State subsidizing up to 49 236 CFA. RDT can help identify the positive cases of malaria, and avoid up to 60% of unnecessary treatments, corresponding to an estimated 27 297 cases at the district level and 584 630 cases nationally. The RDT also allow a more rational use of ACTs and a lower risk of emergence of Plasmodium resistance. The use of RDTs could result in savings of 45 171 CFA at the level of the district health centre and 111 240 136 CFA nationally.
