The regulatory function of a DNA fragment responsible for actinomycin resistance in the typed strain Streptomyces werraensis ATCC 1365, which produces a macrotetrolide antibiotic, was studied. Metabolic changes made this strain capable of producing an antibiotic complex, which comprises four biologically active compounds absent from the parent culture.
