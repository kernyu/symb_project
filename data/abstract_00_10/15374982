The candidate tumor suppressor KILLER/DR5 is a DNA damage-inducible p53-regulated death receptor for the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a promising agent for cancer therapy. The majority of studies on KILLER/DR5 have been focused on its role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, its contribution to the inhibition of tumor growth and its role as a determinant of chemosensitivity are poorly understood. In the present study, we have generated stable human colon cancer cell lines, in which the function of KILLER/DR5 was ablated using inducible RNA interference. Inducible silencing of KILLER/DR5 in vivo by exposure of mice to doxycycline led to accelerated growth of bioluminescent tumor xenografts and conferred resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil. Our results suggest that KILLER/DR5 may be a critical determinant for tumorigenicity and chemosensitivity.
