Two alternative methods for identification of rifampicin-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on biological microchips are developed. The methods are based on detection of point mutations and other rearrangements in the rpoB gene region determining rifampicin resistance. Hybridization on TB-microchip detects 30 mutant variants of DNA in rifampicin-resistant strains (about 95% of all resistant forms). Allele-specific microchip PCR shortens the duration of analysis to 1.5 h. These methods can be used in clinical diagnostic laboratories for evaluating drug resistance/sensitivity of tuberculosis agent and for monitoring of the efficiency of antibiotic therapy.
