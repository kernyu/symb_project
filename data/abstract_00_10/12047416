We have evaluated the in vitro activities of seven fluoroquinolones against 69 strains of Brucella melitensis. According to their minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% growth (MIC(90)) values, the most active agent was found to be sparfloxacin (MIC(90) 0.12 mg/L) followed by levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin (MIC(90) 0.50 mg/L) and grepafloxacin (MIC(90) 1 mg/L), gemifloxacin (MIC(90) 2 mg/L) and gatifloxacin (MIC(90) 4 mg/L).
