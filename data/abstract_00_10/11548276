Data on comparative investigation of the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and tolerability of monofluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin are given. The results confirm good clinical efficacy of all three monofluoroquinolones and high antistaphylococcal activity of pefloxacin. Efficacy of monofluoroquinolones against P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was moderate--only isolation of bacteria from spetrum became lower. Tolerability of monofluoroquinolones was good. Only at 5 patients the drugs use was stopped (4 in the ciprofloxacin group and 1--in the pefloxacin group). At 2 patients it was caused by arthropathy which was drug- and age-dependent. Quinolone-arthropathy was more often in the pefloxacin group and was registered only at the children elder than 10 years old with arthrological anamnesis. This arthropathy differed from experimental one by positive outcome and full recovery in the period from 7 days to 3 months. Results of morphological investigation confirmed clinical data--no invalidizing cartilage damage was revealed.
