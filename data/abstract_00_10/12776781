OBJECTIVE: To identify and to describe the genotyping and the phenotyping testing practices of U.S. laboratories performing patient HIV-1 antiretroviral resistance testing. DESIGN: A self-report 44-item mailed questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Laboratories potentially performing HIV-1 antiretroviral resistance testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Descriptive study. RESULTS: Of 236 laboratories surveyed, 165 (69.9%) returned completed surveys, but only 23 performed HIV-1 antiretroviral resistance testing. Most were university hospitals (47.8%) or independent laboratories (26.1%). All 23 laboratories used genotypic methods, while nine (39.1%) used both genotyping and phenotyping. Most testing was used for clinical trials or laboratory research. The amount of patient information collected by laboratories varied, as did their type of quality assurance measures. Variation was found with regard to: testing volume, testing experience, testing reasons, testing methods availability, testing controls, specimen treatment, and storage stability. CONCLUSIONS: Due to variation in practices in this area of patient testing, it may be advantageous for laboratory professionals to reach a consensus on what is the most acceptable.
