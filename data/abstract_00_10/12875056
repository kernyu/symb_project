About 350 million people worldwide have chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Up to 40% of persons infected with the virus may go on to have complications related to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Antiviral therapy can suppress viral replication and halt the progression of liver disease in persons with chronic infection. In this article, the authors explore the modes of HBV transmission, describe the characteristics of chronic infection, and review the drugs available to treat it.
