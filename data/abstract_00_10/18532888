Maraviroc is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug from a new class of antiretroviral agents that targets a host protein, the chemokine receptor CCR5, rather than a viral target. Binding of maraviroc to this cell-surface protein results in blocking human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) attachment to the coreceptor and prevents the virus from entering CD4+ cells. In this review, we include the details of the discoveries that led to the development of this drug. The drug's pharmacology, including pharmacokinetics and drug interactions, is discussed, as are the clinical efficacy studies that led to licensure. HIV-1 mechanisms of resistance to maraviroc, assays to determine viral coreceptor use (tropism), drug safety, and clinical use of maraviroc are discussed at length.
