OBJECTIVE: We studied root nodule proliferation, nodule microstructure, genetic cluster and stress resistance of the rhizobium of Trigonella arcuata. METHODS: We characterized root nodule and rhizobium with various soil matrixes cultivation, paraffin section, resin semi-ultrathin section techniques, and 16S rRNA gene cluster analysis. RESULTS: (1) Plants grew in mixed soil (nutritious garden soil: poplar zone soil: desert sands = l:1:1), had the most nodule proliferation and bore the most pods. The shapes of nodule were palm- or ginger-like; (2) Microstructure of the nodule revealed five different parts differentiated within the nodule: epidermis (E), cortex (C), vascular bundle (VB), infected cells (IC) and uninfected cells (UIC); (3) Genetic cluster analysis of the full length 16S rRNA gene sequence (1377 bp) indicated that the rhizobium isolated shared the highest identities with Sinorhizobium meliloti; (4) The rhizobium could grow between 4 and 60 degrees C (20 min), pH 6.0-12.0 and 0-2% NaCl. For the antibiotic sensitivity, the rhizobium could not grow normally in medium with 25 microg/mL Kanamycin, Streptomycin or Cephalothin, except for 100 microg/mL Ampicillin. CONCLUSION: Good conditions of soil matrixes were important for nodulation of T. arcuata; A large quantity of cells in fascicular nodules were infected by rhizobia; 16S rRNA gene sequence of T. arcuata shared the highest identities with that of Sinorhizobium meliloti, and this strain was able to tolerate relatively higher temperature and alkalin.
