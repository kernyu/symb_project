The antibacterial and synergistic activity of the ethanol extract from Hyptis martiusii Benth. was assayed by microdillution. The growth of two isolates of Escherichia coli tested was inhibited by the extract. The minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) values ranged from 512 and >1024 microg/ml for the E. coli 27 and 1024 and > 1024 microg/ml for the E. coli ATCC8539, respectively. A synergism between this extract and all aminoglycosides assayed was demonstrated. In the same form synergism between chlorpromazine and kanamycin, amikacin and tobramycin was observed, indicating the involvement of an efflux system. Extracts from H. martiusii could be used as a source of plant derived natural products with modifying antibiotic activity and these products may interact and affect multidrug resistance systems (MDR) as efflux pumps.
