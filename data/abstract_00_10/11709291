Tuberculosis remains a serious public health problem, worsened by an increased frequency of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We report here a retrospective study of resistance to antituberculosis drugs of 170 strains of M. tuberculosis isolated from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The frequency of resistance to at least one drug was 34%, while 22% were resistant to more than one drug. Among the strains isolated from patients without a history of previous treatment for tuberculosis, patients with positive serology for HIV and patients with previous treatment for tuberculosis, the resistance to at least one drug was 14, 27 and 73%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, defined as resistant to at least rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH), was found in the groups of patients without previous treatment, HIV co-infected and with previous treatment for tuberculosis at 10, 17 and 44%, respectively. With the purpose of evaluating whether the sensitivity test to INH and RMP would be a good marker to indicate resistance to other antituberculosis drugs, sensitivity tests were performed with four more drugs in 32 strains, initially classified as resistant to INH, RMP or both. Of 18 strains resistant to INH and RMP simultaneously, 89% showed resistance to four more drugs.
