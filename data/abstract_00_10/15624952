Nitrocefin is a key reagent for high and low throughput assays of the activities of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and beta-lactamases, the former used for discovery of antibiotics and the latter for inhibitors of resistance determinants for beta-lactam antibiotics. This compound is commercially available but is prohibitively expensive because of the circuitous routes to its synthesis. We describe herein a three-step synthesis of nitrocefin that gives an overall yield of 44%. This is a practical route to the synthesis of this key reagent for drug discovery.
