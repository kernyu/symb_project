OBJECTIVE: To determine the importance of resistance and drug levels in the response to a dual-protease inhibitor (PI) combination. METHODS: Prospective study of 62 HIV-positive patients who switched to a salvage regimen including nelfinavir plus saquinavir. Virological response was defined as a decrease in viraemia > 0.5 log10 after 24 weeks. Optimal PI levels were defined as those above the protein binding-corrected 95% inhibitory concentration (IC95), as estimated in the presence of 50% human serum. RESULTS: Baseline median HIV load was 4.78 log10 copies/ml. The median number of mutations in the protease gene was nine (range, 2-25), predominantly at residues 82 (52%), and 90 (40%). After 24 weeks, 45% of patients had responded and 19% were < 50 copies/ml. A higher number of mutations in the protease gene (12 versus 8;P = 0.001), and the L90M mutation (36% versus 67%; P = 0.001) were associated with treatment failure. Trough levels of nelfinavir and saquinavir were two- and fivefold, respectively, greater than those reached when used as the only PI (2480 and 260 ng/ml, respectively), and they were above the estimated protein-corrected IC95 in 96% and 32% of cases. Thus, the Cmin : IC95 ratio ranged from 0.1 to 10 for nelfinavir and from 0.12 to 3.24 for saquinavir. Suboptimal PI levels were associated with a poorer response, but there was no correlation between optimal drug levels and a better response. CONCLUSION: Genotypic resistance predicts the virological response to a nelfinavir-saquinavir salvage regimen. Our data suggest that higher than optimal drug levels could be necessary to control the replication of many PI-resistant viruses.
