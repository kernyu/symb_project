Probenazole (PBZ) induces non-race specific resistance in rice plants against rice blast fungus and PBZ1 was identified as a PBZ-inducible gene from rice. The induction of PBZ1 expression in suspension-cultured rice cells was investigated. Northern blot analysis indicated that PBZ1 was induced by PBZ in a dose-dependent manner. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed a dose and time-dependent accumulation of PBZ1 protein. Both mRNA and protein analysis showed that PBZ1 was not induced by salicylic acid or an active metabolite, 1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide.
