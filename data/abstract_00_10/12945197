Lactic acids being the components of ferments of Christian Hansen company (10(7)-10(11) CFU/g of the lactic-acid product) have been studied as affected by antibiotics. All seven species of concentrates have manifested resistance to 14 tested antibiotics, including, oxycillin, canamycin and cyprobay which are most frequently used in treatment for bacterioses of the digestive tract. Antagonistic activity of the polystrain cultures has been established with respect to the broad range of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms on the MRS medium with glucose and without it; this is obviously connected not only with formation of lactic acid, but also with synthesis of other biologically active substances.
