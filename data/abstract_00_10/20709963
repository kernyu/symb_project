In July 1971, the polyether ionophorous antibiotic monensin was introduced in the United States for the control of coccidiosis in poultry. At that time, prospects for new anticoccidial agents were not good. Amprolium had enjoyed several years of use, but many other compounds had been abandoned as resistance to them developed. After the introduction of monensin, most commercial broilers were medicated with the drug and it is still widely used for this purpose today. Apart from in poultry, monensin is also used to control coccidiosis in game birds, sheep, and cattle. Indeed, more animals have been medicated with ionophores, such as monensin, for control of disease than any other medicinal agents in the history of veterinary medicine. In this review, we discuss the discovery, mode of action, and efficacy of monensin, together with matters of importance to the poultry industry such as commercial use, drug resistance, toxicity, pharmacology and residues, host immunity to coccidiosis, and effects in other avian species.
