OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the long-term safety of the subcutaneous self-administration of enfuvirtide. Secondary objectives included the determination of enfuvirtide pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity and the immunological response to the enfuvirtide-containing regimen. METHODS: A multicenter 48-week uncontrolled open-label rollover study was conducted on 71 HIV-infected adults recruited from previous enfuvirtide clinical trials. Patients with extensive previous use of protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors received a twice-daily dose of 50 mg enfuvirtide subcutaneously (45 mg deliverable) combined with two or more antiretroviral drugs selected for each individual, guided by resistance testing and previous treatment history. RESULTS: The mean baseline plasma HIV-RNA level was 4.81 log(10) copies/ml and the mean CD4 cell count was 134.8 cells/microl. The majority (86.9%) of treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 2 or less in severity. Injection site reactions were common, but no patients discontinued treatment. A mean HIV-RNA change of -1.33 log(10) was achieved within 14 days of treatment initiation. At week 48, approximately one-third of all patients in the intent-to-treat population maintained significant suppression of plasma HIV RNA, with either less than 400 copies/ml or more than a 1.0 log(10) decline from baseline. The mean gain in absolute CD4 cell counts at 48 weeks was 84.9 cells/microl. Trough plasma concentrations of enfuvirtide were consistently higher than target concentrations. CONCLUSION: Self-administration of enfuvirtide is not associated with unexpected toxicities for up to one year, and combined with oral antiretroviral drugs was associated with a significant decrease in HIV RNA and an increase in CD4 cell counts.
