Visceral Leishmania infantum leishmaniasis is endemic in the south of France. For many years the mainstay for treatment of infected children was pentavalent antimony: meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) or sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam). However these drugs are poorly tolerated and resistance similar to that observed in the treatment of Indian visceral Leishmania donovani leishmaniasis has been reported. Currently liposomal amphotericin B is being used instead of antimony for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in children in France. In addition to being well tolerated, liposomal amphotericin B is almost 100% effective. It can be administered in six intravenous injections of 3-4 mg/kg each (days 1 to 5 then day 10). A two-day protocol (10 mg/kg/d) that would reduce overall cost by shortening the duration of hospitalization is now being studied. Another oral drug, i.e., miltefosine, has been successfully used for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in India. However it has not been evaluated for treatment of Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis.
