Malaria is the most severe infectious complication occurring in travelers to tropical areas. The efforts should be focused to malaria prevention. This prevention combines mechanical precaution to limit mosquito bites and chemoprophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis is directed against Plasmodium falciparum which is the species associated with severe forms of malaria and which has developed resistance against antimalarial drugs. Different prophylaxis could be proposed and the choice of prophylaxis will be determined by several factors including the country of destination, contra-indications to the drugs, practical way of administration, side effect and price.
