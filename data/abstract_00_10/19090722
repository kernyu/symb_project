Rapid and accurate identification of the drug susceptibility profile of clinical strains is very important for controlling bacterial infections and determining the antibiotic therapy. The objective of this study was to investigate the spectrum of the correlation between phenotypic and genetic characters of the drug-resistant clinical isolates. A total of 133 clinical isolates, including 76 Acinetobacter baumannii and 57 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined for their antibiotic susceptibility by the method of disc diffusion. Among them, most of the isolates were multiresistant, and 80% of the strains showed phenotypic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Using PCR analysis, among the several types of beta-lactamases, TEM was the most prevalent, and OXA was the second most prevalent. The integron harbored was identified by conserved segment PCR, and 50% of the test isolates carried integrons with various gene cassette sizes inserted. The results obtained from this study reveal that the majority of these isolates displayed multiple drug resistance phenotypes that were associated with their mutational gene profiles.
