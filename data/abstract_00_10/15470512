In recent years, bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter have gradually been gaining epidemiological importance. This is due to the fact that they have been emerging as opportunistic pathogens causing a great number of nosocomial infections, and due to their multiresistance to antimicrobial agents, which limits treatment options. This study aimed to determine the epidemiological importance of isolates of the genus Acinetobacter at the Clinical University Hospital of Salamanca, Spain. The identification and susceptibility of Acinetobacter was determined using the Pasco automated system for Gram-negative bacteria MIC/ID 6J. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained from the clinical history. During the study period it was found that A. anitratus was the most frequently isolated species (56%). The origin of the bacteria was mainly nosocomial (70%), and it was most prevalent in the ICU.
