Recent studies suggest that differences in antifungal activity among echinocandins may exist. In this study, the activities of three echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin) against Candida parapsilosis isolates from burn unit patients, healthcare workers and the hospital environment were determined. Additionally, the effect of these echinocandins on the cell morphology of caspofungin-susceptible and caspofungin-non-susceptible isolates was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The C. parapsilosis isolates obtained from patients were susceptible to anidulafungin, but were less so to caspofungin and micafungin. Isolates obtained from healthcare workers or environmental sources were susceptible to all antifungals. SEM data demonstrated that although anidulafungin and caspofungin were equally active against a caspofungin-susceptible C. parapsilosis strain, they differed in their ability to damage a caspofungin-non-susceptible strain, for which lower concentrations of anidulafungin (1 mg/L) than of caspofungin (16 mg/L) were needed to induce cellular damage and distortion of the cellular morphology. To determine whether the difference in the antifungal susceptibility of C. parapsilosis isolates to anidulafungin as compared to the other two echinocandins could be due to different mutations in the FKS1 gene, the sequences of the 493-bp region of this gene associated with echinocandin resistance were compared. No differences in the corresponding amino acid sequences were observed, indicating that differences in activity between anidulafungin and the other echinocandins are not related to mutations in this region. The results of this study provide evidence that differences exist between the activities of anidulafungin and the other echinocandins.
