Influence of chloramphenicol on electrophysiologic charateristics of Escherichia coli strains susceptible (K-12 strain) and resistant (pBR-325 strain) to it has been studied. It has been shown that incubation of susceptible bacteria with chloramphenicol leads to significant change of magnitute of electrooptic (EO) signal. Significant changes in orientantional spectra of suspensions of susceptible to chloramphenicol cells incubated with different concentrations of antibiotic were observed only on first five frequencies of orienting electric field (10 - 1000 kHz). Maximal change of EO signal occurred at chloramphenicol concentration 35 mg/ml and it didn't depend on the time of antibiotic exposure. Incubation of resistant strain pBR-325 with chloramphenicol did not lead to change of EO parameters of cell suspension. Potential for use of electrophysical analytic methods for assessment of antibacterial activity of chloramphenicol to control effect of antibiotics on microorganisms has been proposed.
