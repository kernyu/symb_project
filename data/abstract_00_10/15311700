Presented in the report are results of treatment of 217 patients with progressive forms of pulmonary tuberculosis. Results of treatment were found out to be dependent on the duration of progression of tuberculosis and degree of immunodepression, the ratio of exudative to caseous changes in the lungs. With more than 4-month duration of progression intensive chemotherapy is of no effect. Cure is only possible in those patients with freshly detected processes, with the duration of progression not exceeding 4 months, immunodepression not too profound.
