The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in tremendous improvements in morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. However, the use of these drugs has coincided with an increasing number of reports of gastrointestinal, hepatic or metabolic side effects. Soon after beginning antiretroviral treatment drug rashes, hypersensitivity reactions, immune reconstitution syndrome or injection site reaction are frequently seen. Under HAART dyslipidemia, impaired glucose metabolism and elevated liver function are observed. In the later treatment phase, lipodystrophy, a combination of peripheral lipoatrophy and central fat accumulation, occurs.
