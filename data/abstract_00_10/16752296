BACKGROUND: Increasing resistance rates towards conventional antibiotics necessitate investigations of the efficacy of newly developed antibiotics. Thus, in a rat study, we compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin and vancomycin in the treatment of a local Staphylococcus aureus bone infection. METHOD: The femoral medullary cavities of 36 Wistar rats were contaminated with 100 muL of an oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain (ATCC 29213) at 10(8) cfu/mL. On the seventh day, antibiotic treatment with moxifloxacin (10 mg/kg twice daily i.p.) or vancomycin (15 mg/kg twice daily i.p.) was commenced in 12 animals each. 12 control animals were left untreated. After 21 days, the infected femurs were explanted and the bacterial counts (cfu/g) were determined. RESULTS: In the control group, a median of 3.42 x 10(6) cfu/g (LQ/UQ 1.09 x 10(6)/ 1.55 x 10(7)) was cultured, with a median of 2.53 x 10(6) cfu/g (LQ/UQ 1.95 x 10(6)/ 4.25 x 10(6)) in the vancomycin group and a median of 2.49 x 10(5) cfu/g (LQ/UQ 2.84 x 10(4)/ 3.75 x 10(5)) in the moxifloxacin group. The bacterial count was reduced by treatment with moxifloxacin both in comparison with the control group (p < 0.001), and in comparison with treatment with vancomycin (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the vancomycin group and the control group (p = 0.53). INTERPRETATION: In contrast to vancomycin, moxifloxacin proved to be an effective antibiotic for the treatment of bone infections due to Staphylococcus aureus in our animal model.
