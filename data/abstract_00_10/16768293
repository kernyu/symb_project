Hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan, HA) has many medical applications as a biomaterial. To enhance its biostability, a novel hydrogel of cross-linked hyaluronic acid was prepared using a double cross-linking process, which involves building cross-linkages between hydroxyl group pairs and carboxyl group pairs. The present study explored a number of cross-linking processes in order to obtain different degrees of cross-linking, which were evaluated by the measurement of water absorption capacity as an index of the gel network density. To gain a better understanding of the stability of the gel, the chemical structure and particularly the rheological behaviour of the cross-linked HA, which included the influences of factors, such as degree of cross-linking, HA concentration and gel particle size, were investigated. The in vitro biostability against hyaluronidase and free radical degradation was tested to show that the cross-linked hydrogel had improved resistance to in vitro hyaluronidase and free radical degradation.
