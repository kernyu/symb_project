Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are ubiquitous plant cell wall proteins that are directed against fungal polygalacturonases (PGs), which are important pathogenicity factors. The inhibiting activity of PGIPs directly reduces the aggressive potential of PGs. In addition, it causes PGs to form more long-chain oligogalacturonides that are able to induce defense responses, thereby indirectly contributing to the plant defense. Recent evidence demonstrates that PGIPs are efficient defense proteins and limit fungal invasion. PGIPs and the products of many plant resistance genes share a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) structure, which provides specific recognition of pathogen-derived molecules. The high level of polymorphism of both PGIPs and polygalacturonases is an invaluable tool for deciphering the structure, function and evolution of plant LRR proteins and their ligands. Furthermore, information about PGIP structure and evolution paves the way to the development of efficient strategies for crop protection.
