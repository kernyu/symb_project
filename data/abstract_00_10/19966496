Agriculturally important grasses contain numerous diazotrophic bacteria, the interactions of which are speculated to have some other benefits to the host plants. In this study, we analyzed the effects of a bacterial endophyte, Azospirillum sp. B510, on disease resistance in host rice plants. Rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) were inoculated with B510 exhibited enhanced resistance against diseases caused by the virulent rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and by the virulent bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae. In the rice plants, neither salicylic acid (SA) accumulation nor expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes was induced by interaction with this bacterium, except for slight induction of PBZ1. These results indicate the possibility that strain B510 is able to induce disease resistance in rice by activating a novel type of resistance mechanism independent of SA-mediated defense signaling.
