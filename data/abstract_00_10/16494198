The aim of this study was to determine resistance to co-trimoxazole among 476 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococus aureus (MRSA) and 2137 strains of methicillin resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS) isolation during three years (2001-2003). Their susceptibility testing were performed by the disc-diffusion techniques according to recomendation of NCCLS (National Committe for Clinical Laboratory Standards). Co-trimoxazole resistance was demonstrated more frequently among MRCNS (52,8%, 51,4%, 63,9% in 2001, 2002, 2003), than among MRSA (23,4%, 19,5%, 16,8% adequately).
