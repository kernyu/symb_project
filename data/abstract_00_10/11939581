The antibacterial properties of five kinds of antimicrobial-finished textile products (AFTPs) were examined against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, under wet and dry conditions. Textile products containing Ag. Zn. ammonium Zeolite and chitosan were found to be effective against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) for up to 6 hr of incubation under wet and dry conditions, and effective against MRSA for up to 24 hr of incubation only under wet conditions. Under dry conditions, however, all AFTPs were ineffective against one MRSA strain. When organic matter was added to the incubation mixture, textile products containing Ag. Zn. ammonium Zeolite and chitosan still showed antibacterial activities, but not as strongly. The results of this study suggested the following: (1) There are differences in antibacterial properties among commercially available AFTPs; (2) Determining effectiveness requires several hours of incubation; (3) Water content as an environmental factor can affect effectiveness; and (4) Some bacterial species and strains are not affected by AFTPs. The antibacterial properties of AFTPs in the clinical setting may be of limited value.
