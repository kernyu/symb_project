A population-based laboratory surveillance was conducted during a six-year period to define the incidence, demographic risk factors for acquisition, and anti-microbial susceptibilities of Serratia species isolates. A total of 715 incident Serratia species isolates were identified for an annual incidence of 10.8 per 100,000 residents; bacteremic disease occurred in 0.9 per 100,000 residents annually. The incidence increased with advancing age and males were at the highest risk. Ninety-two percent of the isolates were Serratia marcescens, and the majority (65%) of incident Serratia species isolates were of community onset. Ninety-five percent of isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, 98% to gentamicin, 98% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and >99% to imipenem. No yearly increase in resistance was observed. Serratia species isolation is most commonly of community onset and older patients and males are at increased risk. Despite reports of increasing resistance among Serratia species, the incidence in our region remains at a low stable rate.
