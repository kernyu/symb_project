BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with several drugs simultaneously may result in modulation of the naturally expressed P-glycoprotein (Pgp) at different tissues. With this possibility in mind, we have assessed the ability of different classes of drugs to modulate Pgp function in vitro. Modulation of the Pgp function was studied at in vitro drug concentrations comparable to therapeutic blood levels of the drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human blood brain barrier endothelial cells and human colon adenocarcinoma cells were transduced or transfected with the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) to express Pgp. The uptake of fluorescent substrates of Pgp, Rhodamine 123 and daunorubicin, into these cells and NIH3T3/MDR1 and MDCK/MDR1 cells was measured by flow cytometry and in monolayers in the presence and absence of the different drugs. RESULTS: From the tested six H1-receptor blockers, seven beta-adrenergic antagonists, four analgesics, ten diuretics and five quinolons, five drugs inhibited Pgp at therapeutic blood levels and two at somewhat higher concentrations. Significant synergism for blocking Pgp could be demonstrated for several drugs. CONCLUSION: We conclude that administration of several drugs which modulate the function of Pgp to patients may adversely affect the natural function of this efflux pump and may cause drug-drug interactions induced side effects.
