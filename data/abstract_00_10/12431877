The sensitivity of 52 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii was determined to 13 antimicrobial drugs. All strains tested were multiresistant. Compared with MICs of amikacin and ampicillin/sulbactam alone, there was a significant decrease in MICs for both drugs when the combination was used. The results of the in vitro study of this combination showed a synergistic or partial synergistic effect in 98% of the strains.
