Among 57 metallo-beta-lactamase (MbetaL)-producing Pseudomonas spp. detected in India during 2006, five bla(VIM) genes were found, including a newly characterized bla(VIM) gene. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were clustered in 33 ribotypes with clones found in multiple hospitals. Several types of bla(VIM-2)-carrying integrons were detected. The newly characterized variant VIM-18 showed a 4-amino-acid deletion compared to other VIM variants. In this study, we show that VIM-producing Pseudomonas spp. were highly prevalent in India with a great diversity of bla(VIM) types and MbetaL-carrying integrons.
