AIMS: The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of mechanical periodontal treatment with local application of minocycline (APT) on serum adiponectin as a marker of insulin resistance improvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and to investigate if effect of APT on serum adiponectin level was sustained by periodontal maintenance (PM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven T2DM patients were randomly assigned into test or control groups. Test received scaling with ultrasonic devices at baseline and APT biweekly for 2 months while control received scaling at baseline and mechanical tooth cleaning (MPT) at the same interval. At 6 months, all patients received mechanical tooth cleaning as PM. Periodontal examination and blood measurements were performed at baseline, 4 and 9 months. RESULTS: Adiponectin concentrations in test had significantly increased by 31.4% after APT (p=0.024) and by 30.4% after PM (p=0.002) compared with baseline. The percentage of >or=4 mm probing depths (PD) had shown 8.3% and 9.3% reduction after APT and PM (p=0.046, 0.02) in test while 5.0% reduction after MPT in control group (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that APT and PM not only improve periodontal disease but also increase serum adiponectin in T2DM patients.
