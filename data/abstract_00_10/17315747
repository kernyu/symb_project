Moxifloxacin(MFLX) and garenoxacin(GRNX), new synthetic antibacterial agents, were assessed for in vitro anti-M. leprae activities. The anti-bacterial activities of these two drugs were compared to those of sparfloxacin (SPFX), gatifloxacin(GFLX), levofloxacin(LVFX) and rifampicin (RFP). The anti-M leprae activity obtained by Buddemeyer system was stronger in order of RFP, MFLX, SPFX, GFLX and GRNX and LVFX. The anti-M. leprae activity of MFLX or GRNX was also examined by the nude mouse footpad method. MFLX completely inhibited the growth of M. leprae inoculated into nude mouse footpads, when given orally at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg , while GRNX completely inhibited at a daily dose of 60 mg/kg. Both in vitro and in vivo tests indicated that MFLX was equal or superior to SPFX, but GRNX was equipotent to LVFX, in terms of anti-M. leprae activities.
