Many different treatment options are available for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which are important causes of morbidity and mortality. Although guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP have been published by various American and European societies, these guidelines may not be applicable in all respects to the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP in Asian countries. In addition, clinical practice may vary among Asian countries, due to such factors as availability of specific antibiotics and formulations and their relative cost. In addition, and in particular, different epidemiologic, etiologic, and resistance patterns in Asian countries may affect treatment choices compared with those in Western countries. To address these issues, the Asian-Pacific Research Foundation for Infectious Diseases, together with the Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens, organized the Asian HAP Working Group to discuss current clinical practices and develop consensus treatment recommendations for HAP in Asian countries. The consensus treatment recommendations, summarized herein, represent the findings of an expert panel comprising 30 representatives from 10 Asian countries.
