Calocedrus formosana Florin (Cupressaceae) is an endemic tree species in Taiwan; its timber is recognized for natural decay resistance. To examine the antitermitic and antifungal activities of leaf essential oil and its main constituents, C. formosana leaves were extracted and the essential oils analyzed by GC-MS. Bioactivity tests against the termite Coptotermes formosanus demonstrate that the LC50 value of leaf essential oil is 27.6 mg/g. Furthermore, exposure to T-muurolol caused 100% mortality at a dosage of 5 mg/g after 14 d. Leaf oil constituents displayed activity against four fungi, Lenzites betulina, Pycnoporus coccineus, Trametes versicolor, and Laetiporus sulphureus. Two compounds, alpha-cadinol and T-muurolol, exhibited the strongest antifungal activity. The LC50 values of alpha-cadinol against L. sulphureus, L. betulina, and T. versicolor are 9.9, 28.6, and 30.4 microg/ml, respectively.
