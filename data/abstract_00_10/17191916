Ten xanthones with one or two isoprenoid groups and a prenylated benzophenone isolated from roots of Cudrania cochinchinensis (Moraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against Bacillus subtilis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Among these compounds, gerontoxanthone H exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against B. subtilis (MIC = 1.56 microg/ml). Four xanthones, gerontoxanthone I, toxyloxanthone C, cudraxanthone S, and 1,3,7-trihydroxy-2-prenylxanthone, showed weak antibacterial activity against the bacterium (MICs = 3.13-6.25 microg/ml). These compounds also exhibited similar MIC values against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, MRSAs, and Micrococcus luteus.
