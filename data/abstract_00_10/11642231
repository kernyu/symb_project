BACKGROUND: The combination of the streptogramins quinupristin and dalfopristin was approved in the United States in late 1999 for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. Since 1974, another streptogramin, virginiamycin, has been used at subtherapeutic concentrations to promote the growth of farm animals, including chickens. METHODS: To determine the frequency of quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant E. faecium, we used selective medium to culture samples from chickens purchased in supermarkets in Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, and Oregon and stool samples from outpatients. RESULTS: Between July 1998 and June 1999, samples from 407 chickens from 26 stores in four states were cultured, as were 334 stool samples from outpatients. Quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant E. faecium was isolated from 237 chicken carcasses and 3 stool specimens. The resistant isolates from stool had low-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC], 4 microg per milliliter; resistance was defined as a MIC of at least 4 microg per milliliter). The resistant isolates from chickens in general had higher levels of resistance (MICs ranging from 4 to 32 microg per milliliter; MIC required to inhibit 50 percent of isolates, 8 microg per milliliter). CONCLUSIONS: Quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant E. faecium contaminates a large proportion of chickens sold in U.S. supermarkets. However, the low prevalence and low level of resistance of these strains in human stool specimens suggest that the use of virginiamycin in animals has not yet had a substantial influence. Foodborne dissemination of resistance may increase, however, as the clinical use of quinupristin-dalfopristin increases.
