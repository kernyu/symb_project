Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is recognized in 5% to 10% of persons with HIV. Co-infected individuals show an accelerated course of HBV-associated liver disease with faster progression to cirrhosis. The number of anti-HBV drugs has increased in the past few years, and some agents (eg, lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir) also exert activity against HIV-1. Emergence of drug resistance challenges the long-term benefit of anti-HBV monotherapy. Data derived from studies using new more potent anti-HBV drugs are very promising, and strategies to use these antiretrovirals sequentially or in combination are being developed. Appropriate diagnosis and monitoring of chronic hepatitis B, including the use of noninvasive tools for assessing liver fibrosis, measurement of serum HBV-DNA, and drug-resistance testing, along with wise use of antivirals may convert HBV/HIV co-infection in to a manageable disease. Hopefully, this success will translate into a halt of liver-related complications and death in the co-infected population.
