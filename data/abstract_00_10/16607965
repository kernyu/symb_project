The resistance effect on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Infectious Bursal Disease Virus(IBDV) in vitro of a new antimicrobial substance (AS), which produced by a Bacillus subtilis strain named B. subtilis fmbJ. Results showed that the TD50 and TD0 value of this AS on Chicken Embryo Fibroblasts cell (CEF) were 128.95mg/L and 25.79mg/L, respectively. This AS could strongly inhibit the cytopathic effects of cell induced by NDV as well as IBDV, and increase the survival rate of cell remarkably. This AS could inhibit the function of NDV and IBDV, and it could defend against the infection and inhibit multiplication of NDV and IBDV, and the effect was the same as the antiviral medicine Ribavirin. It had lower toxicity to CEF cell, therefore we would study it further that it was as antiviral medicine.
