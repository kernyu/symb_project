Many antiseptic agents are used in hygienic handwashes in the prevention of nosocomial infections by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The plasmid-borne genes qacA/B and smr confer resistance to cationic antiseptic agents in S. aureus. In this study, the susceptibilities for dyes and antiseptic agents (e.g. acriflavine, acrinol, benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, chlorhexidine digluconate and alkyldiaminoethylglycine hydrochloride) of 894 isolates of MRSA collected from 11 Asian countries (South Korea, China, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia and Japan) between 1998 and 1999 were examined. In addition, the distributions of the antiseptic-resistance genes qacA/B and smr were studied by PCR. Among the Asian MRSA isolates 57.7% (516/894) were acriflavine-resistant. The smr gene was detected in 31.6% (12/38) of MRSA isolates from India but only in 1.9% (16/856) of all the isolates from other Asian countries. MRSA with qacA/B comprised 41.6% (372/894) of the isolates across Asia. In addition, PFGE was performed to type the MRSA and grouped the tested 30 MRSA isolates with qacA/B into 21 PFGE types. The results indicated that qacA/B is functionally the most important gene mediating antiseptic resistance in the MRSA strains of Asia and that a specific MRSA with qacA/B was not prevalent in Asia but qacA/B were widely spread among MRSA of Asia, while the geographical distribution of smr is more limited.
