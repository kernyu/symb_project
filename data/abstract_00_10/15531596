BACKGROUND: The association between macrolide resistance mechanisms and ketolide bacteriological eradication of Streptococcus pneumoniae remains poorly studied. The present study, using an in vitro model, assessed telithromycin pharmacodynamic activity against macrolide-susceptible and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae simulating clinically achievable free serum and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two macrolide-susceptible [PCR-negative for both mef(A) and erm(B)] and six macrolide-resistant [five mef(A)-positive/erm(B)-negative displaying various degrees of macrolide resistance and one mef(A)-negative/erm(B)-positive] S. pneumoniae were tested. Telithromycin was modelled simulating a dosage of 800 mg by mouth once daily [free serum: maximum concentration (C(max)) 0.7 mg/L, t(1/2) 10 h; and free ELF: C(max) 6.0 mg/L, t(1/2) 10 h]. Starting inocula were 1 x 10(6) cfu/mL in Mueller-Hinton broth with 2% lysed horse blood. Sampling at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h assessed the extent of bacterial killing (decrease in log(10) cfu/mL versus initial inoculum). RESULTS: Telithromycin free serum concentrations achieved in the model were: C(max) 0.9+/-0.08 mg/L, AUC(0-24) 6.4+/-1.5 mg.h/L and t(1/2) of 10.6+/-1.6 h. Telithromycin free ELF concentrations achieved in the model were: C(max) 6.6+/-0.8 mg/L, AUC(0-24) 45.5+/-5.5 mg.h/L and t(1/2) of 10.5+/-1.7 h. At 2 h, free serum telithromycin concentrations achieved a 1.0-1.9 log(10) reduction in inoculum compared with a 3.0-3.3 log(10) reduction with free ELF versus macrolide-susceptible and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. Free telithromycin serum and ELF concentrations simulating C(max)/MIC > or =14.1 and area under the curve to MIC (AUC(0-24)/MIC) > or =100 [time above the MIC (t > MIC) of 100%], were bactericidal (> or =3 log(10) killing) at 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h versus macrolide-susceptible and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Telithromycin serum and ELF concentrations rapidly eradicated macrolide-susceptible and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae regardless of resistance phenotype. Achieving C(max)/MIC > or =14.1 and AUC(0-24)/MIC > or =100 resulted in bactericidal activity at 4 h with no regrowth over 48 h.
