The treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer with the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy has recently been shown to be an active regimen. But the majority of positive responses have been observed in patients considered either platinum-sensitive or who have had extended platinum-free intervals. The purpose of our study was to review our experience with this regimen in women with platinum-resistant ovarian and peritoneal carcinoma with more recent exposure to platinum. We studied twenty-two patients who had relapsed within six months of their most recent platinum-based regimen and were treated with gemcitabine (450-600 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The overall response rate was 64% (95% C.I. 42-85%) with seven (32%) complete and seven (32%) partial responses. The median progression-free interval was 6.7 months for responding patients and 3.9 months for the entire study group. Median survival for responders was 15.8 months compared to 8.8 months for non-responders. Overall survival was 11.4 months. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was encountered in 59% of treatments. We conclude from this limited review that the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy is an active regimen in platinum-resistant ovarian and peritoneal carcinoma and warrants consideration in the management of patients with recurrent disease.
