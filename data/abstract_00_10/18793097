This 5-year study of 25,378 hospitalizations measured the utility of infection control documentation of prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization or infection for the optimization of empirical antibiotic therapy. Documented prior MRSA colonization or infection was predictive of subsequent MRSA infections (odds ratio, 4.05). Physicians appear to use this documentation when prescribing empirical therapy for suspected bacteremia.
