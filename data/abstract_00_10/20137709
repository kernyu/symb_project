OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance of community respiratory pathogens isolated in China. METHODS: The strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, S. pyogenes were isolated from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections at 14 Chinese hospitals from 2005 to 2007. Etest and disk diffusion methods were used to survey the susceptibility of 14 antibiotics against these strains. These antibiotics included penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefprozil, ceftriaxone, cefepime, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT). RESULTS: A total of 1870 strains were collected including S. pneumoniae (n = 997), S. pyogenes (n = 176), H. influenzae (n = 499) and M. catarrhalis (n = 198). The 2005 - 2007 prevalence of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) were 92.6%, 73.9%, 74.1% and penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) 4.5%, 9.5%, 14.3% and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) 2.9%, 16.6%, 11.6% respectively. 36.9% of S. pneumoniae strains isolated from <or= 6 years old children were penicillin-non-susceptive isolates (PNSSP) and < 22.0% of PNSSP isolated from other age groups. The susceptible rates of beta-lactamase antibiotics to PRSP and PISP isolates were less than 25.0% and 49.2% respectively. From 48.5% to 98.6% PSSP isolates were susceptible to beta-lactamase antibiotics. The susceptible rates of PNSSP and PSSP to erythromycin, tetracycline and SXT were below 7.1% and 32.1% respectively. About 95% S. pneumoniae were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin. All of S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to beta-lactamase antibiotics, and 16.7%, 27.1% and 15.6% Of S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to erythromycin. 8.5%, 19.9%, 15.3% of H. influenzae and 57.4%, 78.8%, 95.5% of M. catarrhalis produced beta-lactamase during the 3-year period. The susceptible rates of cefepime, ceftriaxone, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were >or= 92.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae is rising. The prevalence of PNSSP isolated from children < or = 6 years old is higher than other age groups. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefepime, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin remain highly active against common community respiratory pathogens.
