A sentinel isolate of clindamycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes from a case of mixed aerobic-anaerobic necrotizing fasciitis prompted our clinical laboratory to change its protocol and subsequently perform routine susceptibility testing on all S. pyogenes isolated from blood and soft tissue specimens. Emerging clindamycin resistance may have serious implications in the treatment of severe S. pyogenes infections.
