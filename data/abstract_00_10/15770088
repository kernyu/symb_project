In a survey of genetic diversity within penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococcal isolates in Kenya, we examined 162 upper respiratory isolates from 104 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults and 46 children in a cotrimoxazole prophylaxis study. Antibiotic resistance levels were high; 152 (94.4%) were cotrimoxazole nonsusceptible (134 fully resistant) and 124 (77%) were intermediately penicillin resistant. Isolates nonsusceptible to penicillin and cotrimoxazole (PNCNP) were found among 24 of the 29 serotypes encountered, 15 of which have rarely or never had documented nonsusceptibility to penicillin. These included serotypes 3, 4, 7C, 7F, 10A, 11A, 13, 15A, 15B, 16F, 17F, 19B, 21, 35A, and 35B. Segments of pbp2b genes from 9 PNCNP (serotypes 3, 13, 15A, 16F, 20, and 35A) were typical of resistance-conferring alleles in that they were highly divergent and contained two substitutions thought to be critical for resistance. Similarly, the dhfr genes from 3 PNCNP were divergent and contained a substitution required for cotrimoxazole resistance. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 48 PNCNP revealed 33 sequence types (STs), none of which were previously recorded at http://www.mlst.net. Comparisons with all known STs revealed that 23 of these STs were unrelated to other known STs, whereas 10 STs were highly related to STs from internationally disseminated strains, including 2 of the 26 antibiotic-resistant clones recognized by the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network. Based upon differing serotypes expressed by strains of identical or closely similar genotypes, there has been an extensive history of capsular switching within seven genetic clusters represented by these 10 STs and related STs described at http://www.mlst.net.
