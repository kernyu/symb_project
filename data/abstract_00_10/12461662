Ganciclovir (GCV) prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy significantly reduce the rate of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease and viremia, but increase the potential for emergence of ganciclovir-resistant CMV strains. The inhibitor concentration at 50% (IC(50)) of GCV from 156 CMV isolates from 59 renal or heart transplant recipients was calculated by means of a rapid phenotypic susceptibility assay. Twenty-seven strains were from 14 patients undergoing GCV therapy. The IC(50) was higher in patients under the prophylaxis regimen. One CMV strain, from a heart transplant recipient, became GCV-resistant after 1 month of therapy (IC(50)=13.7 micromol/l). These data, together with clinical and virological markers, suggested that a switch to foscarnet was necessary, and good evolution was observed. Thus, assay of CMV susceptibility to GCV could be helpful in clinical management.
