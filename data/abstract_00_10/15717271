We used a mouse model to test the hypothesis that anaerobic microbiota in the colon inhibit the establishment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization by depleting nutrients within cecal contents and limiting the association of VRE with the mucus layer. Anaerobic growth of VRE was assessed in cecal contents and cecal mucus of mice that had received treatment with subcutaneous clindamycin or saline. VRE grew to high concentrations in cecal contents of clindamycin-treated mice and in cecal mucus of both groups but not in cecal contents of saline-treated mice, unless the cecal contents were autoclaved or converted into sterile filtrates. After orogastric inoculation of VRE, clindamycin-treated mice acquired high concentrations of VRE within the mucus layer, whereas saline-treated mice did not. These results suggest that colonic microbiota inhibit VRE by producing inhibitory substances or conditions rather than by depleting nutrients. The colonic mucus layer provides a potential niche for growth of VRE.
