This study evaluated the role of linezolid in the treatment of patients suffering from pneumococcal meningitis. Treatment included ceftriaxone (4000 mg every 24 h), linezolid (600 mg every 12 h) and dexamethasone (8 mg every 6 h). Linezolid was withdrawn if a penicillin-susceptible isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified. Of 16 patients studied, seven were infected with penicillin-non-susceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, two died, and three reported sequelae. No toxicity was reported. It was concluded that linezolid can be used for the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis, as an alternative to vancomycin or rifampicin, in regimens including a third-generation cephalosporin.
