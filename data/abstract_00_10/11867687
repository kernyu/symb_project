B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by the accumulation of malignant B lymphocytes as a result of abnormal survival signals operating in vivo. Previously, we showed that adhesion of B-CLL cells to the fibronectin fragment H89, a ligand for alpha4beta1 integrin, prevents their spontaneous apoptosis in vitro. We have now studied whether alpha4beta1/H89 interaction affected the response of B-CLL cells to the therapeutic drug fludarabine. B-CLL cells cultured on H89 during treatment with fludarabine showed significantly higher mean viability (P<0.05) than cells cultured on the control polylysine for all doses of drug tested. Similar results were obtained with the EHEB cell line. Analysis of the expression of Bcl-2-family proteins after 48 h of fludarabine treatment revealed that Bcl-xL levels were significantly higher (P<0.05) for cells cultured on H89 than on polylysine and correlated (r=0.56, P<0.05) with the increased cell viability observed on H89 cultures. These results indicate that Bcl-xL is involved in the survival signals induced by alpha4beta1 ligation and may contribute to the progressive drug resistance observed in B-CLL.
