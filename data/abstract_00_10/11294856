Oxidative stress compromises the tight junction, but the mechanisms underlying its recovery remain unclear. We developed a model in which oxidative stress reversibly disrupts the tight junction. Exposure of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells to hydrogen peroxide markedly reduced transepithelial resistance and disrupted the staining patterns of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin. These changes were reversed by catalase. The short-term reassembly of tight junctions was not dependent on new protein synthesis, suggesting that recovery occurs through re-utilization of existing proteins. Although ATP levels were reduced, the reduction was insufficient to explain the observed changes, since a comparable reduction of ATP levels (with 2-deoxy-D-glucose) did not induce these changes. The intracellular hydrogen peroxide scavenger pyruvate protected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from loss of transepithelial resistance as did the heavy metal scavenger N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. Of a wide variety of agents examined, only tyrosine kinase inhibitors and protein kinase C inhibitors markedly inhibited tight junction reassembly. During reassembly, tyrosine phosphorylation in or near the lateral membrane, was detected by immunofluorescence. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and PP-2 inhibited the recovery of transepithelial resistance and perturbed the relocalization of ZO-1 and occludin to the tight junction, indicating that tyrosine kinases, possibly members of the Src family, are critical for reassembly after oxidative stress.
