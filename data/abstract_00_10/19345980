The adsorption and removal of amaranth (AM) from an aqueous solution by iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) coated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as adsorbent was reported. The novel magnetic separation was quite efficient for the adsorption and desorption of AM. In an aqueous solution of AM at 25 degrees C, the adsorption data could be fitted by the Langmuir equation with a maximum adsorption amount of 1.05 mg mg(-1) and a Langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant of 0.90 Lmg(-1). The effect of temperature, pH of aqueous medium, electrolyte concentration, composition of desorbent solvent and interfering ions on the recovery process were also investigated. Methanol was used for desorption of adsorbed AM. Due to the absence of internal diffusion resistance both adsorption and desorption of AM were fast and could be completed within 5 min. The results indicated that the CTAB-coated IONPs could be employed in the removal of the anionic dye from wastewater. The AM was removed successfully in spiked samples of Karoon River water.
