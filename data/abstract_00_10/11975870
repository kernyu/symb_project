AIM: To study the effect of aristolochic acid (AA) and the effect of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) on barrier function and electrogenic chloride secretion in intestinal epithelium. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electrophysiological studies were performed in the T84 cell line and rat distal colon. Ionic secretion and transepithelial resistance were determined. RESULTS: Exogenous AA increased calcium-stimulated secretion in the T84 cell line. Incubation of rat distal colon in the presence of AA, a PLA2 inhibitor, reduced basal ionic secretion without affecting transepithelial resistance and inhibited ionic secretion stimulated by a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMPc) agonist, forskolin. In T84 cells, AA inhibited both carbachol- and forskolin-stimulated secretion. CONCLUSION: PLA2 modulates electrogenic chloride secretion but has no effect on barrier function in the T84 cell line or in rat distal colon.
