Because fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents may be released into the environment, the potential for environmental bacteria to biotransform these drugs was investigated. Eight Mycobacterium sp. cultures in a sorbitol-yeast extract medium were dosed with 100 microg ml(-1) of norfloxacin and incubated for 7 days. The MICs of norfloxacin for these strains, tested by an agar dilution method, were 1.6 to 25 microg ml(-1). Cultures were extracted with ethyl acetate, and potential metabolites in the extracts were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. The metabolites were identified using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. N-Acetylnorfloxacin (5 to 50% of the total absorbance at 280 nm) was produced by the eight Mycobacterium strains. N-Nitrosonorfloxacin (5 to 30% of the total absorbance) was also produced by Mycobacterium sp. strain PYR100 and Mycobacterium gilvum PYR-GCK. The MICs of N-nitrosonorfloxacin and N-acetylnorfloxacin were 2- to 38- and 4- to 1,000-fold higher, respectively, than those of norfloxacin for several different bacteria, including the two strains that produced both metabolites. Although N-nitrosonorfloxacin had less antibacterial activity, nitrosamines are potentially carcinogenic. The biotransformation of fluoroquinolones by mycobacteria may serve as a resistance mechanism.
