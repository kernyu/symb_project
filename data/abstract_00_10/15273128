The activity of omiganan pentahydrochloride (formerly MBI 226; a synthetic cationic peptide) was assessed against 1,437 recent clinical bacterial isolates and 214 recent clinical yeast isolates. The omiganan was highly active, and minimal bactericidal concentrations or minimal fungicidal concentrations were either equal to or two- to fourfold higher than MICs. Kill curve experiments showed a clear pattern of bactericidal activity.
