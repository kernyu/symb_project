Drug resistance is an increasing problem in the treatment of HIV infection. Tenofovir has been shown to inhibit HIV replication even with thymidine-associated resistance mutations (TAMs) if they are limited to two or less. Double-dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (600 mg QD) was used to determine weather the drug could be virologically effective in patients harbouring HIV-strains resistant to nucleoside analogues (NRTI). A pilot, open, non-comparative add-on study, where patients failing a current antiretroviral regimen, with at least two TAMs, and naive for tenofovir, were given tenofovir 600 mg once-daily for 4 weeks, in addition to their current failing antiretroviral regimen. The primary end-point was the percentage of patients with plasma viral load (VL) reduction of at least 0.8 log(10) between baseline and week 4 (W4). Ten patients were enrolled. At baseline, the median viral load was 3.66 log(10) copies/ml (range 3.13-4.03) and the median CD4 cell count was 407/mm(3) (range 136-1102). The percentage of patients with reduction the viral load > or =0.8 log(10) was 40% at W4. After 4 weeks of treatment with tenofovir 600 mg, the median decrease in the viral load was -0.61 log(10) (range -0.05; -0.88) and the median gain of CD4 was +109/mm(3). Despite a twofold increase tenofovir plasma concentrations, no serious drug-related adverse event were recorded except for one patient experiencing an de Fanconi syndrome at week 2. This add-on pilot study supports the concept of double dose tenofovir to virologically overcome the decreased sensitivity of NRTI-resistant viruses. However, the safety of this regimen needs to be considered carefully.
