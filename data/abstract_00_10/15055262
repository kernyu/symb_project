Gram-negative pathogens harboring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) are becoming an increasing therapeutic problem in many wards. The aim of our work was to study ESBL production by Enterobacteriaceae strains from Eastern Romania and their antimicrobial resistance. We selected 54 clinical isolates among 1068 enterobacteria according to their susceptibility spectrum (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, 1999). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using the Rapid ATB E gallery of mini API system (BioMerieux) and by a macrodilution method in Mueller-Hinton agar following standard procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). ESBL production was established by using both double disk synergy test (DDT) and Expert computer program of mini API. The isoelectric point (pI) was determined by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel and revealed by nitrocefin. As references we used beta-lactamases with known pI. The Expert computer program of mini API confirms the positive DDT test for all selected strains. Almost all strains displayed resistance to ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam or third generation cephalosporins and aztreonam. By IEF we identified 51 strains which have a unique enzyme. IEF pattern showed presence of two enzymes in three Escherichia coli strains. According to our results, the ESBL TEM-type are the most common for the studied isolates. The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and the presence of the multiresistant of antimicrobial agents reflect, probably, the over use of third generation cephalosporins in Eastern Romania.
