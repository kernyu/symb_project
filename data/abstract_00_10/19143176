In the period of 2002-2006, total 5152 isolates were obtained from 1330 patients in the Intensive Care Unite (ICU) of the Lodz Medical University Hospital No.1. A detailed analysis of the epidemiological situation concerned, first of all, MRSA, Ps. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and Enterobacteriacae. As a result of extended action aimed at reducing the infections caused by these pathogens, a permanent improvement of the epidemiological situation in the ICU was observed in 2005-2006. However, in spite of a decrease in the total number of the infections, the concentration of ESBL(+) and carbapene-resistant strains increased. These results are indicative of the need for cooperation between clinicians and microbiology laboratory towards a strictly controlled antibiotic policy in the hospital.
