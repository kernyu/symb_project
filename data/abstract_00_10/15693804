The level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression is related to polymorphisms -1082 (G/A), -819 (T/C) and -592 (A/C) in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene, which constitute three haplotypes, GCC, ATA, and ACC. The ATA (a non-GCC) haplotype, which is associated with low IL-10 expression, has been shown to improve interferon (IFN) treatment response in hepatitis C. We analysed the distribution of IL-10 promoter haplotype combinations to determine whether they could influence initial IFN treatment response in 63 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The patients were grouped into non-GCC or GCC haplotypes, and the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity was compared in the two groups. During the first 6 months of treatment, MS patients with non-GCC haplotypes experienced fewer new MRI T1-contrast enhancing lesions [0.77+/-0.36 (SEM)] than patients with the GCC haplotype (2.45+/-0.57) (P=0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). No differences were detected on clinical disease activity. The results suggest an influence of IL-10 promoter polymorphisms on IFN treatment response in MS.
