A prospective observational study was carried out to examine antimicrobial resistance patterns of fecal Escherichia coli isolates of calves on arrival at the feedlot, and then evaluate the associations between the total volume of antimicrobial used for disease treatment and changes in antimicrobial resistance, during the feeding period. No macrolides or tetracyclines were administered in the feed during this study. On arrival, at the animal level, all 3 isolates obtained from 36.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 29.0 to 44.8] of all cattle sampled (n = 153), were susceptible to all antimicrobials, while 5.9% (95% CI: 2.7 to 10.9) of cattle had at least 1 isolate that was resistant to--3 antimicrobials out of the 7 antimicrobials tested. The most frequent antimicrobials for which resistance was observed were sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, and tetracycline where, of all cattle, 44.4% (95% CI: 36.4 to 52.7), 20.3% (95% CI: 14.2 to 27.5), and 17.7% (95% CI: 12.0 to 24.6), respectively had at least 1 resistant isolate. All cattle received antimicrobial metaphylaxis on arrival at the feedlot. Antimicrobial use was described for a cohort of 95 cattle. Antimicrobials were given to 42 of the 95 cattle during the feeding period, to treat disease. Amongst the 42 treated cattle, there were a total of 133 animal daily doses (ADD(Feedlot)), where 1 ADD(Feedlot) represented 1 day of antimicrobial treatment received by a feedlot animal at the approved dose. Only 1 ADD(Feedlot) was given in the 100 days immediately prior to slaughter. There were no associations found between antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in this study.
