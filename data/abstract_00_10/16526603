In vitro selection of HIV-1(EVK) variants resistant to highly effective nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), i.e. azidothymidine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI) was performed. In case of AZT resistant mutants, subcloning by limiting dilutions was used. The isolated AZT resistant mutants and subclones had a broad spectrum of phenotypic resistance (8, 25, 53, 80, 114, 160-fold). The ddI resistant mutant possessed 10-fold resistance. The AZT resistant mutants and subclones had a high level of cross-resistance to H-phosphonate of AZT (H-phAZT) and a moderate level of cross-resistance to d4T. Still, they were effectively inhibited by a new compound, i.e. phosphonate of d4T.
