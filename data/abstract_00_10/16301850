BACKGROUND/AIMS: Quadruple therapy can be considered as a first-line therapy in areas where the resistance rate to clarithromycin is high. Comparison study of triple therapy and quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication is still lacking in Korea despite the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of triple and quadruple therapy as a first-line treatment in H. pylori infected patients with peptic ulcer. METHODS: Consecutive 149 cases of peptic ulcer disease associated with H. pylori infection were randomized either to proton pump inhibitor (PPI, bid), amoxicillin (1,000 mg, bid), and clarithromycin (500 mg, bid) (PAC group) or to PPI (bid), bismuth subcitrate (300 mg, qid), metronidazole (500 mg, tid), and tetracycline (500 mg, qid) (PBMT group) eradication treatments for 7 days. Outcome of eradication therapy was assessed by 13C-urea breath test performed 4-6 weeks after eradication. RESULTS: Eradication rates in PAC and PBMT group were 78.7% (59/75) and 71.6% (53/74) by intention to treat analysis, respectively (p=0.424). By per protocol analysis, eradication rates of PAC and PBMT group were 85.5% (59/69) and 85.5% (53/62), respectively (p=1.012). Adverse reactions occurred in 5 (6.6%) and 7 (9.5%) patients in PAC and PBMT group, respectively (p=0.346). CONCLUSIONS: One week-quadruple therapy as a first-line treatment for H. pylori infection does not offer any advantage over PPI-based triple therapy in Korean patients.
