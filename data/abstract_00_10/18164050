Pseudomonas fluorescens SM1 isolate was found to be resistant to some major water pollutants namely Cd2+, Cr6+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, BHC, 2,4-D, mancozeb and phenols up to a concentration four times to the normal levels occurring in the highly pollulated regions. Curing experiment brought about the loss of one or more resistance markers indicating the plasmid born resistance. Plasmid profile of SM1 strain showed the presence of one DNA band of 43.6 kb. This Plasmid was isolated from SM1 strain and introduced into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha with a transformation frequency of 6.7 x 10(-4)transformants/recipient cell. The test SM1 strain was also capable of biotransforming Cr(VI) to Cr(III) which is less toxic compounds. Present studies further indicated that the test SM1 strain was not only resistant to 2,4-D, phenols and catechol but also capable of bioremediating these toxicants quite efficiently. Moreover, studies with inhibitors like sodium azide, 2,4-DNP and chloramphenicol suggested that the major mechanism for the bioremediation of the heavy metals other than Cr6+ would be the biosorption process.
