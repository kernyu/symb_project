The laboratory tests currently available to the clinician for day-to-day management of HIV infection are generally limited to the measurement of the viral load and of the CD4 cell count. More recently, analysis of drug resistance and of plasma drug levels have been added to the monitoring armamentarium. There are, however, numerous other techniques currently available to researchers that may in the future be incorporated into clinical routine. These include the analysis of human and viral genetic determinants of disease evolution, detailed analyses of immune recovery and reserve, pharmacogenetic determinants of treatment response, and toxicity. These approaches may in the future provide highly individualized disease management.
