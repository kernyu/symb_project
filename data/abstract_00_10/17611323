OBJECTIVE: To examine the infection and bacteria resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) to clarithromycin and furazolidone,to determine whether the antibiotic resistance is primary or secondary, and to decide if a new H.pylori infection plays a role in eradication failures. METHODS: Twenty one H.pylori had been isolated from human biopsy specimens, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed. DNA fingerprints were generated using random amplification polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to determine the identity of H.pylori before and after the eradication therapy. RESULTS: Eight bacteria resisted against clarithromycin, and one against furazolidone, with the resistant rates 38.1% and 4.8% respectively. The number of primary antibiotic resistance, secondary resistance and new infection was 1 for each. CONCLUSION: Resistance to clarithromycin is more common compared with that to furazolidone. Development of primary and secondary resistance to clarithromycin occurs as a rule in eradication failures. New H.pylori infection plays a role in eradication failures.
