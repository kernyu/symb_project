Thirty-one strains of Neisseria meningitidis strains coming from CSF, collected at the National Reference Center for Meningococci between January 2007-March 2008 were serogrouped and analysed for the susceptibility to 7 antibiotics: penicillin (Pc), erythromycin (Em), ceftriaxone (Cro), cefotaxime (Ctx), ciprofloxacin (Cip), rifampin (Rif), sulfonamides (Sm). Results revealed that serogroup B accounted to the highest number of strains (51.7%), followed by serogroup C (35.5%), serogroup W 135 (6.4%) and serogroup X (6.4%). The data analysed according to EMGM revealed the following aspects: 100% susceptibility to Cro and Ctx., 96.7% susceptibility to Rif (MIC 50 and MIC 90 =0.03 mg/l) and 96.7% susceptibility to Cip (MIC 50 and MIC 90=0.0015 mg/l). Concerning Pc, it was revealed 58% susceptible strains, 38.7% intermediate and 3.3% resistant strains with MIC 50=0.06 mg/l and MIC 90=0.12 mg/l. A high proportion (100%) of isolates were fully resistant to Sm, while 22.6% of strains were resistant to Em. In conclusion, this study showed that Cro, Ctx, Cip and Rif were the most efficient drugs. Sulfonamides must be used neither for treatment nor for prophylaxis, as they would be ineffective. Serogroups B and C were predominant in this period in Romania. The need for new antimicrobial agents and vaccines is being felt in today's society.
