Despite the lack of evidence of efficacy of antibiotic agents for treating upper respiratory tract infection (URI) symptoms (i.e., acute cough, sore throat, purulent nasal discharge, bronchitis, and the common cold), primary care providers frequently prescribe antibiotic agents for patients presenting with such symptoms. Far from being a harmless practice, prescribing antibiotics for conditions for which there is no proven benefit of such therapy contributes to a number of adverse consequences, including the development of antimicrobial resistance and an unnecessary expense to patients and the healthcare system as a whole. An evidence-based approach to practice can guide nurse practitioners in making the best clinical management decisions for patients presenting with URI symptoms.
