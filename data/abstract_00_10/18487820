The use of both, retrospective and prospective data obtained from the health care process in biomedical research meets with problems related to the respective data structures used in different health information processing systems. This issue is explored in an exemplified clinical registry for antiviral resistance. Essentially, the data structure used in clinical systems or data capture systems conflicts with the requirements of many established methods of statistical analysis. To resolve this problem efficiently, a set of generic transformations is proposed.
