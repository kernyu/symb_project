The in vitro activity of levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, erythromycin, telithromycin, linezolid, synercid and vancomycin was measured against 36 genetically defined, gyrA/grlA double mutant MRSA clinical strains with an MIC to ciprofloxacin > or = 8 mg/l. The three newer fluoroquinolones tested were more active than ciprofloxacin. Resistance rates for levofloxacin and gatifloxacin were high (44.5 and 36.1%, respectively). All the strains were moxifloxacin-susceptible, though most of them had MICs close to the break point. All the strains were intermediate or resistant to erythromycin and most were also resistant to telithromycin. No strains were resistant to linezolid, synercid or vancomycin (MIC(90): 2, 1 and 2 mg/l, respectively).
