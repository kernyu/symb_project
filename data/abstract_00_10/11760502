The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a global problem in today's society. Presently, there is no cure for this devastating disease, but there are many treatment modalities from which to choose. The medications called antiretroviral agents must be carefully selected and customized for each person who is being treated for an HIV infection. Physicians and pharmacists must use extreme care when these drugs are ordered, because if they are used improperly, there will be an increase in resistance to the virus. In order to prevent resistance, people should be properly educated about these agents, how they should be taken, as well as the specific schedule to which they should comply. Education is the major factor in assisting with bringing this disease under control and reducing transmission. Antiretroviral agents recommended for HIV infection through the stages of reproduction, transmission, and treatment are discussed.
