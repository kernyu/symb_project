In this retrospective study, it was aimed to evaluate the primary drug resistance rates of 151 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) strains against primary anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs, isolated from 2213 tuberculosis suspected patients between January 2002 to December 2003 in our hospital, and also to compare these results with the data obtained from our previous results between January 1998 to December 2001. It has been detected that there was a significant decrease in the susceptibility rates of MTC isolates to all anti-TB drugs both yearly from 1998 to 2003 (p < 0.001), and for the total of 1998 and 2003 years period (p < 0.029). When only the years 1998 and 2003 were taken into consideration, significant increases were found in any (one or more) combination of the drugs with isoniazid (INH), and only INH resistance rates (p < 0.007 and p < 0.033, respectively). Thus, naturally there was also an increase in resistance to total any drug resistance (p < 0.029). We suggest that strict measures such as "directly observed therapy" should be undertaken in order to prevent development of drug resistance particularly against INH. Regular and continuous screening of anti-TB drug resistance should be accomplished to survey the presence of drug resistant strains in the nation, to define the suitable drug regimens and to evaluate the quality of tuberculosis control programs.
