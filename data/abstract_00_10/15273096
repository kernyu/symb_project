Dental plaque samples from 40 children were screened for the presence of bacteria resistant to amoxicillin. Fifteen children had used amoxicillin and 25 had not used any antibiotic in the 3 months prior to sample collection. All (100%) of the children harbored amoxicillin-resistant oral bacteria. The median percentage of the total cultivable oral microbiota resistant to amoxicillin was 2.4% (range, 0.1 to 14.3%) in children without amoxicillin use and 10.9% (range, 0.8 to 97.3%) in children with amoxicillin use, with the latter value being significantly higher (P < 0.01). A total of 224 amoxicillin-resistant bacteria were isolated and comprised three main genera: Haemophilus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Veillonella spp. The biodiversity of the amoxicillin-resistant microbiota was similar among the isolates from children with and without previous antibiotic use. The amoxicillin MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited for isolates from children who had used amoxicillin in the previous 3 months was higher (64 mg liter(-1)) than that obtained for the isolates from subjects who had not used antibiotics (16 mg liter(-1)). The majority of the amoxicillin-resistant isolates (65%) were also resistant to at least one of the three antibiotics tested (penicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline), with resistance to penicillin (51% of isolates) being the most frequently encountered. However, significantly more (P < 0.05) of the amoxicillin-resistant isolates from subjects with previous amoxicillin use were also resistant to erythromycin. This study has demonstrated that a diverse collection of amoxicillin-resistant bacteria is present in the oral cavity and that the number, proportions, MICs, and resistance to erythromycin can significantly increase with amoxicillin use.
