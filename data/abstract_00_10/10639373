The ability of 50 sequential subcultures in subinhibitory concentrations of telithromycin (HMR 3647), azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin A, roxithromycin, clindamycin, and pristinamycin to select for resistance was studied in five macrolide-susceptible and six macrolide-resistant pneumococci containing mefE or ermB. Telithromycin selected for resistance less often than the other drugs.
