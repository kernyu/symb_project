From 1994-2005, all uropathogens cultured from the urine of hospitalised urological patients were identified and their sensitivity was tested against the most important antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). Duplicate isolates were eliminated. The following results were obtained: (i) there was no general trend of increase in resistance; (ii) certain uropathogens developed resistance to some antibiotics; (iii) vancomycin- or linezolid-resistant staphylococci or enterococci did not play a role; (iv) the lowest overall rates of resistance were found with piperacillin/tazobactam; and (v) ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole showed the next favourable overall activity. Adequate initial antibiotic therapy is critical in the treatment of severe UTI. Therefore, ongoing surveillance of antibiotic resistance must be performed in every institution. Additionally, it reflects antibiotic and hospital infection policies in a defined department or institution.
