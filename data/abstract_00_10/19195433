Tenofovir is one of the drugs of choice in first-line combinations of antiretroviral therapy. Most data on safety and efficacy in this scenario initially came from clinical trials in which tenofovir was combined with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Because of this, as well as the possible interaction of tenofovir with some protease inhibitors and the suspicion that this combination could increase the risk of nephrotoxicity, analysis of the clinical experience available on the combination of tenofovir (associated with emtricitabine or another nucleoside analogue) with a protease inhibitor is essential. The present review reports data on efficacy and safety, mainly from clinical trials. Taken together, these studies provide sufficient information to indicate that the combination of tenofovir and protease inhibitors is safe and effective, justifying its selection in first-line therapy or rescue therapy after virological failure.
