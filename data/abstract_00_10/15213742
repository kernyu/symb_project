The effect of sunlight exposure on Salmonella typhimurium isogenic strains harboring an rpoS gene functional (rpoS+) or not functional (rpoS-) was investigated in microcosms of sterile sea water at 20 degrees C. The two strains rapidly lost their ability to produce colonies on solid culture media. The detrimental action of sunlight was more important when the salinity of sea water increased. The survival of stationary phase cells was influenced by RpoS. Bacteria grown in media with high salinity or osmolarity and transferred to sea water in stationary phase were more resistant to irradiation than those grown in media with low salinity. Prior growth under oxidative (0.2 mmol/L of H2O2) or amino acid starved (minimal medium) conditions did not modify the survival of either strain when they were exposed to sunlight. Bacteria were more resistant when cells were incubated in sea water in the dark prior to being exposed to sunlight. The resistance to sunlight irradiation was also greater in clones of both strains isolated from microcosms exposed to sunlight for 90 min, then further inoculated into sea water and reexposed to sunlight.
