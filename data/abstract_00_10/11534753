Injudicious use of antibiotics contributes to increased bacterial resistance, and patient expectations encourage physicians to overuse antibiotics. The authors evaluated the level of ill college students' antibiotic-seeking behavior to determine if receiving an antibiotic prescription influenced patients' satisfaction with visits to a clinician. Of 129 students with upper respiratory complaints presenting to a university health center, 55% expected an antibiotic prescription. Antibiotic expectation was significantly more likely among students who thought they had a bacterial versus a viral infection (90% vs 40%; p < .01). A clear diagnosis, an explanation of the rationale for treatment, and an antibiotic prescription were significantly associated with patient satisfaction. Clinicians prescribed an antibiotic for 36% of the students; only 13% of these 46 had requested an antibiotic during the visit. At some previous time, one third of the students had taken an antibiotic prescribed for an earlier illness or for another person. Better patient education and improved clinician-patient communication can potentially help to reduce the injudicious use of antibiotics.
