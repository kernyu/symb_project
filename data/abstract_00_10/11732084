The in vitro activity of sulperazon (cefoperazone/sulbactam) was tested against 94 ceftazidime-resistant strains of bacteria isolated from mostly seriously ill patients in critical care units. Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae made up 80% of the pathogens studied; 90% of the Klebsiella strains were producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). The MIC90 of sulperazon for Klebsiella was 12 mg/l (range 1.5-16 mg/l), indicating that this drug may be a useful alternative for the treatment of ceftazidime-resistant, ESBL-producing Klebsiella.
