Acid pretreatment is commonly used to release pentoses from the hemicellulose fraction of cellulosic biomass for bioconversion. The predominant pentose in the hemicellulose fraction of hardwoods and crop residues is xylose in the polysaccharide methylglucuronoxylan, in which as many as one in six of the beta-1,4-linked xylopyranose residues is substituted with alpha-1,2-linked 4-O-methylglucuronopyranose. Resistance of the alpha-1,2-methylglucuronosyl linkages to acid hydrolysis results in release of the aldobiuronate 4-O-methylglucuronoxylose, which is not fermented by bacterial biocatalysts currently used for bioconversion of hemicellulose. Enterobacter asburiae strain JDR-1, isolated from colonized hardwood (sweetgum), efficiently ferments both methylglucuronoxylose and xylose, producing predominantly ethanol and acetate. (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance studies defined the Embden-Meyerhof pathway for metabolism of glucose and the pentose phosphate pathway for xylose metabolism. Rates of substrate utilization, product formation, and molar growth yields indicated methylglucuronoxylose is transported into the cell and hydrolyzed to release methanol, xylose, and hexauronate. Enterobacter asburiae strain JDR-1 is the first microorganism described that ferments methylglucuronoxylose generated along with xylose during the acid-mediated saccharification of hemicellulose. Genetic definition of the methylglucuronoxylose utilization pathway may allow metabolic engineering of established gram-negative bacterial biocatalysts for complete bioconversion of acid hydrolysates of methylglucuronoxylan. Alternatively, Enterobacter asburiae strain JDR-1 may be engineered for the efficient conversion of acid hydrolysates of hemicellulose to biofuels and chemical feedstocks.
