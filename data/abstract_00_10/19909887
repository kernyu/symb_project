Most evidence-based methods to control the spread of antimicrobial resistance have been developed and applied to the hospital setting. Strategies to control the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals can be categorized as either infection control or antibiotic stewardship strategies. Infection control is the discipline focused on preventing the spread of infections within the health care setting; antibiotic stewardship can help minimize the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms by promoting prudent use of antibiotics. This article describes different infection control and antibiotic management strategies that can be used to control antimicrobial resistance in hospital settings.
