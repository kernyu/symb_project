To evaluate the therapeutic potential of FX0685, a new triazole antifungal agent, for the treatment of opportunistic fungal infections, particularly systemic candidiasis and aspergillosis, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed using fluconazole (FLC), itraconazole (ITC) and/or amphotericin B (AMB) as reference drugs. A preliminary in vitro study showed that the antifungal activity of FX0685 against FLC-susceptible Candida albicans, several non-C. albicans Candida species and Cryptococcus neoformans was superior to that of FLC and comparable or superior to those of ITC and AMB, while the anti-Aspergillus fumigatus activity of FX0685 was to varying degrees lower than that of ITC. FX0685 appeared to be comparable to FLC and ITC in the treatment of murine systemic C. albicans and pulmonary A. fumigatus infection, respectively. The biological property of FX0685 was characterized by its potent in vitro and in vivo activity against FLC-resistant C. albicans. Part of this unique property was explained by the finding that it retained potent inhibitory activity against those CYP51 molecules in which amino acid substitutions confer a phenotype of resistance to FLC and some other azole derivatives. All of these results lead to the possibility that FX0685 may be a potential antifungal drug candidate for the treatment of various clinical forms of systemic candidiasis, including those caused by FLC-resistant C. albicans, as well as for the treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis.
