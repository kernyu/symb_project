UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to assess frequency and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of non-fermenting gram-negative rods isolated from clinical specimens obtained from patients requiring intensive care, with emphasis on profile of the unit. Identification of cultured isolates was done using automated VITEK and API systems (bioMerieux, France). Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was tested by a disk-diffusion method according to the NCCLS recommendations. In total the analysis comprised 425 strains of non-fermenting gram-negative rods, constituting 58.9% of all isolates of gram-negative bacteria. In blood cultures predominated strains of A. baumannii (46.8%) and P. aeruginosa (40.4%), while in cultures of other clinical specimens these bacteria comprised 42.9% and 43.9% of isolates. Major differences were observed in frequency of these species on both ICU units. Strains of non-fermenting rods isolated from blood cultures comprised a lower percentage of strains susceptible to antimicrobials (particularly cefepime and carbapenems) than isolates cultured from other specimens. Strains of A. baumannii resistant to imipenem and meropenem were detected with a frequency of 12.5% and 26.7%, respectively. Resistance of P. aeruginosa strains to carbapenems was 62.2% and 44.3%, respectively. There was a relatively high percentage of strains susceptible to cefepime (82.0%), ceftazidime (78.9%), amikacin (77.8%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (69.7%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. There was a predominance (58.9%) of strains of gram-negative non-fermenting rods. 2. Isolates from blood cultures were characterised by a much higher percentage of resistant strains in comparison to other specimens. 3. Strains of A. baumannii resistant to carbapenems were recorded. 4. There were differences in frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility among the strains of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii depending on the type of clinical specimen and ICU profile.
