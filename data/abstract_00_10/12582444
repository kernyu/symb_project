In order to identify any changes in the incidence of Salmonella enterica serotypes and their resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents, we conducted a retrospective study of all the strains isolated from stool samples at Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa in Zaragoza from 1997 to 2000. We observed an increase in the number of isolates of Salmonella and Campylobacter and a decrease in other enteropathogens. Enteritidis was the most frequently isolated serotype (55.2%), showing an increasing tendency (from 44.1% in 1997 to 60.6% in 2000). Hadar, glostrup and virchow showed the highest rate of resistance to nalidixic acid. Enteritidis also showed an important increase in resistance to nalidixic acid (from 17.6% in 1997 to 41.4% in 2000). Typhimurium showed the highest resistance levels to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole. No resistance to fluoroquinolones or to cefotaxime was detected, with the exception of 0.5% of the S. enteritidis strains, which showed resistance to fluoroquinolones.
