Alkylating agents, such as temozolomide, are among the most effective cytotoxic agents used for malignant gliomas, but responses remain very poor. The DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) plays an important role in cellular resistance to alkylating agents. IFN-beta can act as a drug sensitizer, enhancing toxicity against a variety of neoplasias, and is widely used in combination with other antitumor agents such as nitrosoureas. Here, we show that IFN-beta sensitizes glioma cells that harbor the unmethylated MGMT promoter and are resistant to temozolomide. By means of oligonucleotide microarray and RNA interference, we reveal that the sensitizing effect of IFN-beta was possibly due to attenuation of MGMT expression via induction of the protein p53. Our study suggests that clinical efficacy of temozolomide might be improved by combination with IFN-beta using appropriate doses and schedules of administration.
