Data regarding clinical administration, outcomes, and costs of quinupristin-dalfopristin treatment in 48 patients with serious gram-positive infections in a large teaching hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Thirty-six patients had vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infections, 10 had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) infections, and 2 were treated empirically Overall, 67% of the patients were clinically cured, and 56% had bacteriologic eradication; overall response rate was 48%. Patients with VREF bacteremia had the highest clinical cure (82%) and bacteriologic eradication (73%) rates. Mortality rate was 31%, but 6 of 15 patients who died were treated successfully with quinupristin-dalfopristin. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter among patients who lived versus those who died (p<0.05). Similarly, the mean hospital cost/patient was significantly lower in patients who lived than in those who died ($35,244 vs $122,922). Quinupristin-dalfopristin is effective in the treatment of both VREF and MRSA or MRSE infections in patients who fail to respond to, or are intolerant of, vancomycin.
