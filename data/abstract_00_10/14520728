We show that Pandoraea apista must be added to the increasing list of pathogens capable of causing chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. It is most likely that this strain of P. apista was transmissible among patients with CF, leading to spread of infection from the index patient to 5 other patients exposed during participation in winter camps and/or hospitalization. All patients developed chronic infection with high levels of antibodies, and 4 patients had a downhill course of lung disease. P. apista must therefore be considered a new and sometimes important pathogen for CF patients. Cohort isolation prevented further spread of P. apista in our CF center.
