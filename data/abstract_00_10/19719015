In the last years, due to the high demand of food products supplemented with probiotics and the multiple nutritional and therapeutic benefits associated with them, research on these microorganisms has advanced considerably, including their selection and characterization. As a general recommendation, several entities as World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Organization for Agriculture and Food recommend that the specification of the alive species contained and their number shall appear in the label of the product. In the present study, six different commercially available products, supplemented with probiotics were analyzed, in order to evaluate the concentration of microorganisms through the shelf life of the product, identify the strains isolated and determine the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these. Results demonstrated that the strains isolated kept acceptable concentrations during the 28 days of storage. Nevertheless, the identification of these strains variated from the one reported on the label on several of the products tested. This can be due to the commercial method used for the identifications, which is based in the carbohydrate fermentation pattern and not in genotypic trials. The antimicrobials' susceptibility patterns found show that further research shall be performed in order to establish the intrinsic or acquired nature of the resistance determinants, and if these are codified by transferable elements among bacteria.
