Thirty-eight of 295 subjects participating in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy of daily administration of atovaquone/proguanil for malaria prevention developed malaria at some time during the 20-week prophylaxis period. These subjects (3 atovaquone/proguanil recipients and 35 placebo recipients) were treated with 4 tablets of atovaquone/proguanil per day for 3 days. Atovaquone/proguanil provided safe, well-tolerated, and effective therapy for uncomplicated malaria in nonimmune Indonesians.
