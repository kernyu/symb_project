The role of biofilm in implant infections and the genetic control of its production are still giving rise to great interest and controversial new results are continuing to emerge from widespread investigations. Bacteria embedded in biofilms are more resistant to most antibiotics. Hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of antibiotic multi-resistance in biofilm are brought to light, including the onset of persister cells during the attachment of bacteria to implant surfaces.This 2008 special issue ''Focus on Implant Infections'', presents new strategies for combating biofilm infections,such as the use of staphylococcal quorum-sensing inhibitors or the ''bioelectric effect'': the phenomenon by which electric current can enhance the activity of some antimicrobial agents against bacteria in biofilms.
