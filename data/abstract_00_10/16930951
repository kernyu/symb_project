The pharmacodynamic potency of imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates was investigated. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, confirmation of ESBLs by Etest and the disk approximation test were performed for 133 ESBL-producing isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Pharmacodynamic exposure, measured as percent of the dosing interval during which free drug was above the MIC (% fT>MIC), was modelled via a 5000-subject Monte Carlo simulation. Bactericidal cumulative fraction of response (CFR), defined as 40% fT>MIC, was calculated against each bacterial population. All agents achieved high bactericidal CFR against all ESBL isolates as a group, but ertapenem (96.26%) was slightly less effective than imipenem (99.96%) and meropenem (99.90%) (P<0.05). Similar results were observed against Klebsiella spp. only (P<0.05). Against E. coli, CFRs were close to 100%. Ertapenem is probably an effective agent against ESBL-producing bacteria, although its ability to achieve bactericidal pharmacodynamic exposures will depend on the bacterial susceptibility.
