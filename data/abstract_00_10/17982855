This is a retrospective study carried out in the orthopaedic and trauma department of the Yalgado-Ouedraogo teaching hospital. All the patients hospitalized in the service with a chronic osteomyelitis (COM) from March 1, 1996 to March 28, 2000 were included. The frequency of COM was 5.3%. The patients' average age was 17.7 with extremes of 2 and 60 years old. 63.9% were male; 80.7% had fistulized COM. A pathological fracture was observed in 16.9% of the patients. Lower limbs were affected most frequently (65%). Thirty patients (36.1%) had haemoglobin S, among them 22 had a major sickle cell disease. Staphylococcus aureus was present in the majority of the cases (more than 50%). Salmonella were observed among patients carrying haemoglobin S. One case of ceftriaxone-resistance salmonella osteomyelitis was reported. The medico-surgical and orthopaedic treatment was statistically more favourable than a medical or medico-surgical treatment without immobilization.
