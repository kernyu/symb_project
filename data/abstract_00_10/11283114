Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is potentially a new emerging pathogen with most strains susceptible to many antimicrobials except for beta-lactam antibiotics. We retrospectively reviewed MRSA isolates during a 20-month study period (January 1998 through August 1999) and investigated those that were clindamycin susceptible. Patients were not considered to harbor CA-MRSA if they had been admitted to a hospital within the preceding 2 years or if their isolate had been obtained more than 72 h after admission. There were 2,817 S. aureus isolates, with 1,071 (38%) being MRSA. Of these 1,071 isolates, 161 were clindamycin susceptible; these were recovered from 81 patients. Of these 81 patients, 20 appeared to have community-acquired strains, but only 2 could be confirmed as having CA-MRSA.
