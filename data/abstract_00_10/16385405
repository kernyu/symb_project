Fecal samples (n=1,584) for a parasite study were collected from Thoroughbred foals (n=349), 28 to 330 days old, on seven farms in central Kentucky during 49 monthly trips from May to October, November, or December 2004. The main purpose was to determine possible drug resistance of ascarids, also of strongyles, to ivermectin (IVM) and other commercially available compounds [fenbendazole, moxidectin (MOX), oxibendazole (OBZ), and pyrantel pamoate]. In addition, interest was on prevalence of foal parasites. Qualitative data were obtained by recording presence or absence of ascarid and strongyle eggs in feces from 7 to 25 days after treatment of some of the foals. None of the compounds completely eliminated ascarid eggs in feces of all foals posttreatment. Activity on ascarids was significantly the highest for OBZ and lowest for IVM. Activity on strongyles was significantly higher for IVM and MOX than for the other compounds. Prevalence (mean percentage of foals infected) was recorded for eggs of Parascaris equorum (39%), of strongyles (32%), and of Strongyloides westeri (2%) and oocysts of Eimeria leuckarti (28%) in feces of foals. One or more foals had infections of P. equorum on six farms (86%), strongyles on seven farms (100%), S. westeri on two farms (29%), and E. leuckarti on six farms (86%). The oldest foal infected with E. leuckarti was 301 days of age. Comparison was made on the prevalence of parasites in foals on five of the same farms in the 2004 study, which were part of a similar 14-farm project in 2003 (Lyons and Tolliver in Parasitol Res (2004) 92:400-404).
