Partial-thickness burns are often characterized by microbial contamination and copious exudate produced during the early postburn period. Consequently, topical wound management often relies on the use of antimicrobial agents and absorbent dressings, and an AQUACEL Hydrofiber Dressing containing ionic silver has been designed to meet such needs. To assess the antimicrobial properties of the AQUACEL Hydrofiber dressing, samples were challenged with a wide variety of recognized burn wound pathogens in a simulated wound fluid model. Dressing samples were inoculated with the challenge organisms at time zero and then reinoculated on days 4 and 9 to mimic the worst-case clinical scenario. The dressing was shown to be microbicidal against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (including antibiotic-resistant strains), yeasts, and filamentous fungi during a 14-day test period. Based on our results, the silver-containing dressing is likely to provide a barrier to infection, in addition to providing proven fluid-handling benefits of the AQUACEL Hydrofiber dressing, in the management of partial-thickness burns.
