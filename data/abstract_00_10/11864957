The in vitro activity of penicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin against 286 Neisseria lactamica isolates was determined by agar dilution and the category of susceptibility was analysed in accordance with the criteria used for Neisseria meningitidis. All isolates were considered to have intermediate susceptibility to penicillin. A total of 1.7% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin but all were susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. Rifampicin MICs ranged between 0.12 and 2 mg/L. Six isolates (2.1%) showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.
