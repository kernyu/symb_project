A relatively high rate of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium not susceptible to linezolid was observed in intensive care unit patients. Linezolid-resistant isolates carried the G2576T mutation in the 23S rRNA gene, belonged to different clones, and shared the same allelic profile, which clusters in the C1 multilocus sequence typing epidemic lineage.
