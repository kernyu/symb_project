Gametocytocidal activities of pyronaridine and DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors against two isolates of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, KT1 and KT3 were determined. After sorbitol treatment, pure gametocyte cultures of Plasmodium falciparum containing mostly young gametocytes (stage II and III) obtained on day 11 were exposed to the drugs for 48 h. The effect of the drugs on gametocyte development was assessed by counting gametocytes on day 15 of culture. Pyronaridine was the most effective gametocytocidal drug against P. falciparum isolates KT1 and KT3 with 50% inhibitory concentration of 6 and 20 nM, respectively. Moreover, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pyronaridine was lower than that of primaquine which is the only drug used to treat malaria patients harboring gametocytes. Prokaryotic (norfloxacin) and eukaryotic (amsacrine and etoposide) DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors were only effective against asexual but not sexual stages of the malaria parasites. Pyronaridine has both schizontocidal and gametocytocidal activities against the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum.
