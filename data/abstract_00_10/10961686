N-Methyl-N-D-fructosyl-amphotericin B methyl ester (MFAME) is a new derivative of amphotericin B, which is characterised by low toxicity to mammalian cells and good solubility in water of its salts. The antifungal activity and effects of MFAME towards Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae multidrug resistant MDR(+) and sensitive MDR(-) strains was compared with those of parent compound. The results obtained indicate that MDR(+) S. cerevisiae was sensitive to MFAME as well as to AMB. MFAME exhibited the same effects on fungal cells studied as parent antibiotic. The two antibiotics, depending on the dose applied induced cell stimulation, K+ efflux, and/or had a toxic effect.
