AML with trilineage myelodysplasia (AML/TMDS) is recognized as having of poor prognosis due to its resistance to chemotherapy in comparison with de novo AML. An AML/TMDS patient who failed to respond to ordinary induction therapy achieved complete remission with combination therapy consisting of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and low-dose Ara-C. No serious toxicity was observed. ATRA combined with low-dose Ara-C could be an alternative treatment for this kind of patient.
