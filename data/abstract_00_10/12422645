Susceptibility of 92 strains of mycobacteria to levofloxacin (5, 10 and 50 mcg/mL) was investigated by indirect method of absolute concentrations on Levenstain-Jensen media. The investigation was performed on 85 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from 83 patients with different types of tuberculosis and also on drug-sensitive laboratory strains of M. tuberculosis H37Rv-M, H37Rv-GISK, Academia, M. bovis-bovinus 8, M. bovis BCG and on two strains of M. fortuitum with total resistance to antimycobacterial agents. 87.8 per cent of clinical isolates were multi-drug resistant. From one patient treated with ciprofloxacin two strains of M. tuberculosis were isolated--one resistant to 5 mcg/mL of levofloxacin and second strain-resistant to 10 mcg/mL of levofloxacin. All other clinical and laboratory strains of mycobacteria (97.8 per cent) were susceptible to all three concentrations of levofloxacin.
