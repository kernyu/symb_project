OBJECTIVES: To determine the contribution of the AcrAB efflux system to cyclohexane tolerance in Salmonella enterica. METHODS: The expression of the efflux pump gene, acrB, and regulators marA and soxS from 46 isolates of S. enterica of 14 different serovars was determined by comparative RT-PCR and denaturing HPLC analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 46 isolates were cyclohexane tolerant, a phenotype associated with multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) and overexpression of efflux pumps. Of the cyclohexane-tolerant isolates 81% were MAR, whereas only 44% of the cyclohexane-susceptible isolates were MAR, confirming the association between cyclohexane tolerance and MAR. However, there was no correlation between cyclohexane tolerance or MAR and overexpression of acrB, soxS or marA. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cyclohexane tolerance in S. enterica can be mediated by an acrB-independent mechanism.
