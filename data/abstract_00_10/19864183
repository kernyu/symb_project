The evolution of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum against safe and affordable drugs such as chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is a major global health threat. Investigating the dynamics of resistance against these antimalarial drugs will lead to approaches for addressing the problem of resistance in malarial parasites that are solidly based in evolutionary genetics and population biology. In this article, we discuss current developments in population biology modeling and evolutionary genetics. Despite great advancements achieved in the past decade, understanding the complex dynamics of mutations conferring drug resistance in P. falciparum requires approaches that consider the parasite population structure among other demographic processes.
