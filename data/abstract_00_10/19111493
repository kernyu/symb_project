OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the prevalence of primary HIV drug resistance in a population of 128 injection drug users (48 female) prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: Genotypic and phenotypic profiles were obtained retrospectively for the period June 1996 to February 2007. Genotypic drug resistance was defined as the presence of a major mutation (IAS-USA table, 2007 revision), adding revertants at reverse transcriptase (RT) codon 215. Phenotypic drug resistance was defined as the fold change associated with >or=80% loss of the wild type virologic response due to viral resistance based on virtual phenotype analysis. RESULTS: Genotypic drug resistance was uncommon, and was only identified in six (4.7%) cases, all in the RT gene (L100I, K103N, Y181C, M184V, Y188L, and T215D). There were no cases of multi-class or protease inhibitor (PI) resistance. However, polymorphisms in the protease and RT genes were extremely common. Phenotypic drug resistance was also identified in six (4.7%) patients, four in the RT gene (in patients with mutations K103N, Y181C, M184V and Y188L) and two the protease gene (in two patients with minor PI mutations). In addition, 25 (19.5%) of the patients had reduced susceptibility to PIs, defined as resistance>20% but <80% of the wild type virologic response, with no primary PI mutations detected in all these patients. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of primary HIV drug resistance was low in this population of injection drug users.
