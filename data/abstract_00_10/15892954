The hepatitis C virus (HCV) subgenomic replicon system was used to study a possible involvement of nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) in the mechanisms of HCV resistance to interferon alpha (IFN-alpha). A series of chimeric HCV replicons was constructed. In these replicons, the NS5A gene in the backbone of the Con1 replicon was swapped by corresponding fragments obtained from four IFN-alpha responder and four IFN-alpha nonresponder patients that had been infected with the same HCV AD78 strain. Experiments with transfected Huh7 cells did not reveal significant differences in sensitivity of HCV RNA replication to IFN-alpha in cell clones, bearing chimeric Con1/AD78 replicons with NS5A sequences from IFN responders and nonresponders. Thus, these data provide no evidence that the NS5A protein contributes to the resistance of HCV replication to IFN-alpha.
