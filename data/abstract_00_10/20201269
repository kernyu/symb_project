OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against communitary and hospital staphylococcal strains isolated during 2006-2008 in Eastern region of Romania. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have tested 1022 staphylococci strains, identified by conventional laboratory methods. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by agar dilution method, according to NCCLS. RESULTS: For both hospital and communitary isolates, MIC 90 was 0.25 mg/L (4 fold less than breakpoint for sensitivity). Resistance was absent or reduced (1.7%) for coagulase- positive staphylococci, both communitary and hospital. For coagulase negative staphylococci, resistance for clinical strains is increased (6%) compared to comunitary strains (0.3%). In conclusion, ciprofloxacin is highly effective against staphylococci representing a therapeutic option for multiresistant strains. Our data shown the necessity of adequate antibiotic use in the hospital and community.
