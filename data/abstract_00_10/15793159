No relation between the presence of tetracycline resistance determinants tet(A) to tet(E) and the MICs of tigecycline was observed for Enterobacteriaceae, although tetracycline-susceptible isolates were more susceptible overall to tigecycline, whereas the presence of tet(M) in Staphylococcus aureus was associated with higher MICs of minocycline.
