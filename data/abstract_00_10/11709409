In anesthetized rats, we characterized the contributions of norepinephrine (NE) and ATP to changes in tail and hindlimb (femoral) vascular resistances (TVR and FVR, respectively) evoked by three patterns of sympathetic stimulation: 1) couplets (2 impulses at 20 Hz), 2) short trains (20 impulses at 20 Hz), and 3) a natural irregular pattern previously recorded from a sympathetic fiber innervating the rat tail artery. All stimuli evoked greater changes in TVR than FVR. Judging from the effects of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, the purinergic receptor antagonist suramin, or alpha,beta-methylene ATP (which desensitizes P2X receptors), we propose that NE has a major role in the constriction evoked by the couplet, as well as by the short train and by the low- and high-frequency components of the natural pattern, but that considerable synergy occurred between the actions of ATP and NE. This contrasts with previous in vitro studies that indicated that ATP dominates vascular responses evoked by sympathetic stimulation with a few impulses at low frequency and that NE dominates responses to longer trains or at high frequencies.
