Current microbial diagnostic is too slow to provide clinically useful information for the physician to prescribe, only when needed, the appropriate antibiotics.

These novel, fully integrated devices, coupled with appropriate databases, will insure better management of patients, should reduce health costs, and could impact on the spread of antibiotic resistance.
