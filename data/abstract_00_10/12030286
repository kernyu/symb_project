Emergence of resistant and multiresistant bacteria has become an important worldwide sanitary problem. International agencies recommend improving resistance surveillance studies in not only human but also animal origin strains. Because of its ubiquitous characteristics and zoonotic agent consideration, Salmonella spp. can be used as a good indicator microorganism for resistance surveillance studies. Salmonella spp. strains from animal sources isolated in 1996 (107) and 2000 (474) in Spain were tested against 12 different antimicrobials agents, using the disc diffusion method. Results were interpreted following the NCCLS criteria. Data showed that Salmonella spp. strains (61.7% in 1996 and 81.5% in 2000) were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Pig-related strains were considerably more resistant than strains from other sources. Enteritidis serotype was less resistant than other serotypes, except for ampicillin in 1996 (50% resistant) and nalidixic acid in 2000 (65.1% resistant). An emergent monophasic serotype, 4,5,12:i:-, first detected in 1997 in Spain was 100% resistant and 90% multiresistant. Typhimurium serotype was the most common Salmonella serotype from animal sources in both years. It was widely distributed among animals and was among the serotypes with a higher degree of resistance. The ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, streptomycin, and tetracycline resistance pattern, commonly associated with Salmonella serotype Typhimurium DT 104, had spread among other Typhimurium phage types and other Salmonella serotypes. Salmonella spp. strains isolated from feeding stuffs were considerably more susceptible than animal source strains, suggesting that the high Salmonella spp. resistance percentage was probably due to the use of antibiotics in animal farms rather than the consumption of contaminated feeding stuffs.
