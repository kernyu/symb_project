Phage-resistant mutants have been isolated from Streptococcus thermophilus. Selection was carried out using anti-phage antibodies or Hoechst 33258-labelled phages. Two mutants out of eight tested displayed reduced acidifying capacity. Selection of the bacteria that extruded more rapidly the fluorochrome 5-6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) restored the acidifying capacity of these two mutants to the level of the parental strains. Mutants displaying phage resistance and good acidifying capacity were obtained in 4-5 days. New phages that are able to overcome the protection mechanisms of the existing bacteria arise continually in the dairy environment. The procedures described here permit to replace promptly the starter culture susceptible to newly emerged phages with a resistant one.
