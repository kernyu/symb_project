There are numerous causes of acquired acute upper airway obstructions in children but most are secondary to infections, foreign bodies, and trauma. Recognizing impending airway obstructions is important because cardiopulmonary arrest rarely is a sudden event but rather follows a progressive deterioration in respiratory function. From an anatomic perspective, acute obstructions may present in the pharyngeal or laryngeal regions. In the pharynx, fascial layers create several potential peritonsillar, parapharyngeal, and retropharyngeal spaces that may accommodate abscess formation. Within the larynx and lower airways, small changes in radius dramatically affect the resistance to flow as described by Poiseuille's law, allowing for small amounts of inflammation to cause significant obstruction. The clinical presentation of acute upper airway obstruction will depend on the degree and location of the obstruction. Therapy is aimed primarily at maintaining a patent airway and prescribing appropriate antimicrobials.
