Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major nosocomial pathogen in India, and up to 70% methicillin resistance has been reported from hospitals in various parts of India. Hospitals use phenotyping for the most part, and molecular genotyping is not done. Here we report on the genotyping of 82 single-patient isolates from two hospitals in Bangalore, South India, for the first time. Most of the strains possessed type III or IIIA staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) cassettes, and we did not detect strains with type I, IA, or II cassettes. Most isolates also contained the type III cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) AB region. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing of a selected number of isolates have been carried out. Although most isolates that were chosen for MLST and spa typing had the same patterns, they were quite diverse in their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. PFGE, MLST, and spa typing of the Indian strains revealed that they are related to the previously described Hungarian and Brazilian clones.
