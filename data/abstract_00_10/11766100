Over-expression of multidrug efflux transporters causes Candida albicans cells to be resistant to azole antifungal agents. There are several kinds of indicator for multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype of higher eukaryotic cells. Calcein AM is a prefluorochrome that is known as a substrate for multidrug efflux transporters of mammalian cells. We investigated whether calcein AM was also extruded by the ATP-dependent multidrug transporter (cdr1p) of C. albicans. There was no significant difference in the accumulation of calcein AM between MDR cells and drug-susceptible cells of C. albicans even with sodium azide, suggesting that calcein AM may not be associated with the CDR1-gene-related multidrug efflux system of C. albicans. However, a structurally related prefluorochrome derivative, fluorescein diacetate (FDA), was shown to be extruded by the CDR1 mRNA-overexpressing yeast cells. In comparison with drug-susceptible cells, the resistant cells emitted very weak fluorescence when stained with FDA. Furthermore sodium azide increased the fluorescence of the resistant cells more than 20 times, whereas the fluorescence in the drug-susceptible cells with FDA and sodium azide was three to four times stronger. These results suggested that FDA might be extruded by the CDR1-related multidrug efflux transporter of C. albicans.
