Candida glabrata is very important pathogen which is resistant to some imidazoles (fluconazole). The aim of study was to compare a susceptibility of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata - strains isolated from patietnts treated in Centre for Treatment of Parasitic Diseases and Mycoses - to miconazole using MIC. 96.5% of strains were sensitive to miconazole; values of MIC for C. albicans were lower than for C. glabrata.
