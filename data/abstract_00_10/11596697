The efficacy and safety of two ultrashort azithromycin-containing regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection were studied. Patients positive for H. pylori infection were assigned to receive either a three-day drug regimen (group A) or a five-day regimen (group B). In both groups, patients received lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. twice daily on day 1 and, on days 2 and 3, lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. twice daily, amoxicillin 1 g (of anhydrous amoxicillin) p.o. twice daily, and azithromycin 500 mg (of anhydrous azithromycin) p.o. twice daily. Group B patients received lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. twice daily and amoxicillin 1 g p.o. twice daily for two additional days. Gastric biopsy specimens were subjected to culture and susceptibility testing. A minimum of four weeks after the completion of therapy, the patients underwent a 14C-urea breath test to determine whether H. pylori had been eradicated. A total of 28 patients were enrolled (15 in group A and 13 in group B). Treatment was well tolerated. H. pylori was eradicated in 4 (36%) of 11 patients in group A and 2 (22%) of 9 group B patients (26.6% and 15.4%, respectively, in intention-to-treat analysis). None of the isolates of H. pylori showed resistance to amoxicillin or clarithromycin. Regimens consisting of lansoprazole plus two or four days of azithromycin and amoxicillin therapy eradicated H. pylori in 36% and 22% of patients, respectively.
