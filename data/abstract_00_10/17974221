The Australian Group for Antimicrobial Resistance conducted a survey of the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in unique clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from patients admitted to hospital for more than 48 hours. Thirty-two laboratories from all states and territories collected 2,908 isolates from 1 May 2005, of which 31.9% were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The regional prevalence of MRSA varied significantly (P < 0.0001) from 22.5% in Western Australia to 43.4% in New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory. Prevalence of MRSA from individual laboratories varied even more from 4% to 58%. This variation was explained in part by distribution of age with the risk of MRSA significantly (P < 0.0001) increasing with age. Other unmeasured factors including hospital activity and infection control practices in the individual institution may have also contributed. Further investigation is warranted as reductions in prevalence would reduce morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.
