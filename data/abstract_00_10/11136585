OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of levofloxacin in the prevention of vascular prosthetic graft infection in a rat model. METHODS: Graft infections were established in the subcutaneous tissue of 225 male Wistar rats by implantation of Dacron prostheses followed by topical inoculation with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis. The study included a group without contamination, two contaminated groups without prophylaxis, two contaminated groups with intraperitoneal levofloxacin prophylaxis, two contaminated groups with intraperitoneal cefazolin prophylaxis, two contaminated groups with intraperitoneal teicoplanin prophylaxis and six contaminated groups with rifampin-soaked graft and intraperitoneal levofloxacin, cefazolin or teicoplanin prophylaxis. The grafts were removed after 7 days and evaluated by quantitative culture. RESULTS: The efficacy of levofloxacin against the methicillin-susceptible strain was not different to that of cefazolin or teicoplanin. Levofloxacin showed slight less efficacy than teicoplanin against the methicillin-resistant strain. The combination levofloxacin-rifampin demonstrated to be similarly effective to the combination rifampin-teicoplanin and more effective than the combination rifampin-cefazolin against both strains. CONCLUSIONS: Rifampin-levofloxacin combination seems useful for the prevention of late-appearing vascular graft infections caused by S. epidermidis.
