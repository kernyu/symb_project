Melioidosis is an emerging infection in India. Seventeen cases of culture proven melioidosis are reported in this study. The isolation rate was high during the rainy season. Except one case, all the patients had diabetes mellitus as an underlying disease. Eleven patients improved with ceftazidime or combination therapy and maintenance therapy with doxycycline and Cotrimoxazole. The high prevalence of B. pseudomallei in this region is a matter for serious concern.
