From Cladonia rangiferina were isolated two novel abietane diterpenoids, hanagokenols A (1) and B (2). Also in this investigation, four known abitetane diterpenoids (3-6), four known labdane diterpenoids (7-10), one known isopimarane diterpenoid (11), and six known aromatic compounds were isolated. These structures were elucidated primarily through extensive NMR experiments. Hanagokenol A (1) was a unique abietane diterpene having an ether linkage between C-6 and C-18 of sugiol. Hanagokenol B (2) is also a unique secoabietane diterpene, having gamma-lactone which occurred by cleavage and subsequently oxidation between C-6/C-7 of 12-hydroxydehydroabietinol. Furthermore, all the isolated compounds (1-17) were tested for the antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE).
