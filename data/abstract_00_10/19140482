Drug susceptibility of 195 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates was tested with the indirect method of absolute concentrations on the Lowenstein-Jensen medium. 151 and 44 M. tuberculosis strains were isolated from patients with respiratory tract tuberculosis and tuberculosis of extrapulmonary localization respectivily. The resistance of the isolates to the main and reserve antituberculosis drugs amounted to 79.5%, including 62.1% of the isolates with multiple drug resistance. Levofloxacin was used in a concentration of 10 mcg/ml. The resistance to levofloxacin was detected only in 4 isolates from the patients with respiratory tract tuberculosis (2.05%), whereas the resistance to ofloxacin amounted to 11.8%.
