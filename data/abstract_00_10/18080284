Glyphosate-resistant weeds have evolved as a result of the intensive use of glyphosate for weed control. An alteration in the way glyphosate is translocated within the plant has been identified as a mechanism of glyphosate resistance in populations of Lolium rigidum Gaud., L. multiflorum Lam. and Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq. In these resistant plants, glyphosate becomes concentrated in the leaves rather than being translocating throughout the plant. This type of resistance is inherited as a single dominant or semi-dominant allele. Resistance due to reduced translocation appears to be a common mechanism of resistance in L. rigidum and C. canadensis, probably because it provides a greater level of resistance than other mechanisms. This type of glyphosate resistance also appears to reduce the fitness of plants that carry it. This may influence how glyphosate resistance can be managed.
