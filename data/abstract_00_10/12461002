The antimicrobial properties of cephalosporin P1, an antibiotic structurally related to fusidic acid, were examined. Cephalosporin P1 exhibited potent activity against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus. Mutants of S. aureus resistant to cephalosporin P1 arose with a frequency of 1.6 x 10(-6) for selections at 4 x MIC, a frequency similar to that for fusidic acid. The mutations conferred cross-resistance to fusidic acid and mapped in fusA, the gene encoding elongation factor G. Cross-resistance between cephalosporin P1 and fusidic acid also occurred for S. aureus fusA mutants selected with fusidic acid, and in fusidic acid-resistant clinical isolates. Plasmid pUB101, which mediates resistance to fusidic acid in S. aureus, also conferred resistance to cephalosporin P1. Escherichia coli was intrinsically resistant to both fusidic acid and cephalosporin P1, but deletion of the AcrAB efflux pump resulted in susceptibility to both antibiotics. Although complete cross-resistance between fusidic acid and cephalosporin P1 was demonstrated, the nature and location of fusA mutations in S. aureus when cephalosporin P1 was the selective agent frequently differed from those selected with fusidic acid. This may reflect differences in the interaction of the two antibiotics with the translational apparatus, which results in the selection of separate mutation classes for each antibiotic. Furthermore, in three of 14 mutants selected with fusidic acid, resistance was attributed to mutations lying outside fusA. In contrast, mutations in 10 mutants selected with cephalosporin P1 were all located in fusA.
