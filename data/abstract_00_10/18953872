OBJECTIVE: To study the drug resistance profiles of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) and provide guidance for pediatric clinical prescription. METHODS: 5127 strains of ESBL producing E. coli were isolated from 5 children's hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guangzhou. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 349 strains to 9 antibiotics most in use in pediatrics were measured with agar dilution method. RESULTS: The prevalent rate of ESBL producing of E. coli was 46.7%. The resistant rates to ampicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were 23.1%, 67.2%, 24.5%, and 48.4% respectively, and the intermediate rates were 38.5%, 26.4%, 5.7%, and 19.1% respectively. The resistant rate to amikacin was 5.4%. All the strains were susceptible to imipenem. The MIC90 values of ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were 256 mg/L or higher. There were differences in the resistance profile to ampicillin/clavulanic acid, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin among different regions. CONCLUSION: ESBL is extensively prevalent among the E. coli strains isolated from the pediatric clinic that are resistant to most antimicrobial agents except imipenem and amikacin. Regional difference exists in drug resistance to some agents exist.
