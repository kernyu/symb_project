To develop biodegradable packaging that both acts as a moisture barrier and as antimicrobial activity, nisin and stearic acid were incorporated into a hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) based film. Fifteen percent (w/w HPMC) of stearic acid improved film moisture barrier. However, film mechanical resistance and film antimicrobial activity on Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus pathogenic strains were both reduced. This lower film inhibitory activity was due to interactions between nisin and stearic acid. The molecular interaction was modeled, and an equation was developed to calculate the nisin concentration needed to be incorporated into the film matrix to obtain a desired residual antimicrobial activity. Because the molecular interactions were pH dependent, the impact of the pH of the film-forming solution on film inhibitory activity was investigated. Adjusting the pH to 3 totally avoided stearic acid and nisin interaction, inducing a high film inhibitory activity.
