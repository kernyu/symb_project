The interest on the in vitro susceptibility to itraconazole has recently increased due the availability of the intravenous formulation. In this study, comparative MICs of this antifungal with voriconazole were carried out in 62 clinical isolates of filamentous fungi and 100 yeasts isolates using the NCCLS microbroth methods described in M38-A and M27-A2 documents. A MIC90 of 0.125 micrograms per ml was observed for itraconazole and voriconazole against Aspergillus fumigatus. Higher susceptibility to itraconazole was found for the filamentous form of Sporotrhix schenckii (p = 0.001). Voriconazole was more effective against Scedosporium apiospermium while Scedosporium prolificans isolates were resistant to both azoles. Some isolates of Rhizopus stolonifer were susceptible to itraconazole and resistant to voriconazole, but without statistical significance. Susceptibility of nine species of Candida was similar for both triazoles used in this study. However, Candida glabrata was more susceptible to voriconazole. Some fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans isolates were susceptible to itraconazole and / or voriconazole. Cryptococcus neoformans was more susceptible to itraconazole than to voriconazole. Itraconazole and voriconazole showed very close in vitro activity against the tested fungal isolated, except against S. schenckii. In spite of this, there were some differences in susceptibility among isolates within the same fungal species.
