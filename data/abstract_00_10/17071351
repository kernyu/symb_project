Strongylid gastrointestinal nematodes are an important cause of disease and economic loss in small ruminants. These parasites are particularly important in the eastern United States where the bloodsucking parasite Haemonchus contortus is the predominant species. Sheep and goats are infected with gastrointestinal nematodes while grazing and the biology of the infective larvae on the pastures is important in planning effective control programs. Fecal egg counts can be used to monitor control programs and drug efficacy and evaluate levels of pasture contamination.
