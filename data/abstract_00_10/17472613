The BioCell-Tracer (BCT) system is an automatic microscopic method used for measuring the growth rate of a single fungal hyphae, which has not yet been applied to study Fusarium spp. Considering the large resistance of Fusarium species to the available chemotherapy and that hyphae is the morphological fungal form most often seen in vivo, in this work, Amphotericin B MIC and MFC values for a Fusarium solani strain were obtained by the conventional assay method testing conidia and also by the BCT monitoring system. Both MIC and MFC values of AMB against F. solani determined by broth dilution method resulted in 4.0 microg ml(-1). By the BCT system, their values were 1.0 microg ml(-1), with an inhibition rate of 99.5% (Exp-GR) and 100.0% (Post-GR), showing that when testing hyphae directly, MIC and MFC were determined at two lower dilutions than the MIC and MFC values obtained with conidia. Using the BCT system, 4.0, 2.0 and 1.0 microg ml(-1) of AMB concentrations inhibited hyphae growth in 50 min whereas 0.5 microg ml(-1) of AMB needed 100 min to start hyphae growth inhibition. These findings lead us to conclude that antifungal susceptibility varies between conidia and hyphae. For this strain of Fusarium solani, hyphae were more susceptible to AMB than conidia.
