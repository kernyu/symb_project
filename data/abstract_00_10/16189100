Ceftobiprole (formerly BAL9141), the active component of the prodrug BAL5788 (ceftobiprole medocaril), is a novel cephalosporin with expanded activity against gram-positive bacteria. Among 152 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including 5 vancomycin-intermediate and 2 vancomycin-resistant strains, MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for ceftobiprole were each 0.5 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible strains and 2 mug/ml against methicillin-resistant strains. Against 151 coagulase-negative staphylococci (including 4 vancomycin-intermediate strains), MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were, respectively, 0.125 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible and 1 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml against methicillin-resistant strains. Teicoplanin was less active than vancomycin against coagulase-negative strains. Linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and daptomycin were active against all strains, whereas increased MICs for amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, minocycline, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, rifampin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, and fosfomycin were sometimes observed. At 2x MIC, ceftobiprole was bactericidal against 11 of 12 test strains by 24 h. Prolonged serial passage in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ceftobiprole failed to select for clones with MICs >4 times those of the parents; the maximum MIC achieved for ceftobiprole after 50 passages (in 1 of 10 strains) was 8 mug/ml. Single-passage selections showed very low frequencies of resistance to ceftobiprole irrespective of genotype or phenotype; the maximal ceftobiprole MIC of recovered clones was 8 mug/ml.
