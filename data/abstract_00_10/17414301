Nasofacial phycomycosis caused by Conidiobolus is a rare fungal infection most often encountered in the developing world in conditions of poverty. A clinical presentation of the natural history of this condition observed over a period of 6 years by a visiting volunteer surgical team demonstrates the role of multimodality surgical and antifungal drug treatment in producing a successful outcome. The particular sensitivity of this infection to the new generation antifungal Voriconazole is noted.
