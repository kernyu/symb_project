E-test, Vitek 2, MicroScan, agar dilution, and disk diffusion were compared for detection of decreased linezolid susceptibility due to 23S rRNA gene G2576T mutation among 32 clinical Enterococcus strains initially reported as intermediate or resistant by E-test alone or Vitek 2 confirmed by E-test. Agar and broth dilution methods were in concordance with PCR detection of the mutation, and disk diffusion was somewhat less sensitive but equally specific.
