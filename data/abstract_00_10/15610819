Resistance of parasitic nematodes to the cholinergic anthelmintic levamisole is associated with a reduction in the proportion of time that acetylcholine receptor ion-channels are in the open state decreasing the response of nematode parasites to the drug. Here we examine electrophysiological and contractile responses to acetylcholine and the cholinergic agonist, levamisole, in Ascaris suum muscle looking for a pharmacological approach that may be developed to increase the response to cholinergic agonists. We found that short application of the FMRFamide, AF2, produced modulation (long lasting potentiation) of the peak membrane potential response to acetylcholine but not to levamisole. Since levamisole preferentially activates L-type acetylcholine receptors, we also tested the effect of nicotine (selective activator of N-type acetylcholine receptors) and bephenium (selective activator of B-type acetylcholine receptors) and found again no effect of AF2 on peak membrane potential responses. We then tested atropine on the AF2 potentiation of acetylcholine and found it to inhibit the peak potentiation suggesting that AF2 receptors interact with muscarinic receptors to produce the potentiation of acetylcholine. We saw similar atropine sensitive potentiation of acetylcholine responses in our muscle contraction experiments. The potentiation of the acetylcholine responses shows that nematode acetylcholine receptors are capable of a level of plasticity. A model involving calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, CaM Kinase, calcineurin, muscarinic receptors and AF2 receptors is proposed to explain our observations. These observations are important because they point to a pharmacological approach that may be developed to counter resistance to cholinergic anthelmintics.
