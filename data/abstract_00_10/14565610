OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical, immunological and virological response and the emergence of resistance towards antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a cohort of HIV-2-infected patients. DESIGN: Observational study. PATIENTS: HIV-2-infected patients residing in the Netherlands. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2001 seven patients failed various ART regimens. The resistance mutations were analysed retrospectively. Development of mutations proved to be similar to that observed in HIV-1-infected patients, with the exception of a higher occurrence of the Q151M mutation within the reverse transcriptase gene. In a prospective study, comprising 13 consecutive naive HIV-2-infected patients, all patients achieved plasma HIV-2-RNA suppression below the detection limit (500 copies/ml). The antiretroviral regimen consisted of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and indinavir, with a boosting dose of ritonavir; the median follow-up was 91 weeks. Two patients experienced a temporary virological rebound, while at the same time therapeutic drug monitoring showed sub-therapeutic plasma levels of indinavir. CONCLUSION: Sustained viral suppression in HIV-2-infected patients can be achieved using an antiretroviral regimen of two NRTIs and boosted indinavir or lopinavir.
