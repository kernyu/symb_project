The comparative activity of five phenothiazines against multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDRTB) was studied using the Bactec 460 system. The order of antimycobacterial activity of the phenothiazines was: chlorpromazine = thioridazine > promethazine > promazine = desipramine. However, the levels required for an MIC 50 exceeded 1 mg/l and are beyond those that are clinically achievable. As phenothiazines are concentrated by macrophages that phagocytose and have in situ activity against mycobacteria, these agents may be considered for use as adjuvants for the management of freshly diagnosed tuberculosis in patients from populations with a high prevalence of MDRTB.
