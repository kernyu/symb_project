OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of an Escherichia that produced microcin 24 (Mcc24) on shedding of of Salmonella enterica serotypeTyphimurium in swine and evaluate evidence of in vivo activation of the Mcc24-mediated, multiple-antibiotic resistance (mar) operon. ANIMALS: 36 crossbred weaned pigs. PROCEDURE: 24 pigs were allocated to 2 groups (12 pigs/group). Pigs in 1 group received daily oral administration of an Mcc24-producing E coli, whereas the other group received a non-Mcc24-producing E coli. All pigs were challenge exposed with Salmonella Typhimurium chi4232. A third group of 6 pigs received Mcc24-producing E coli and was challenge exposed with an Mcc24-sensitive, marA-deleted strain of Salmonella Typhimurium 4232. After challenge exposure, fecal samples from all pigs were cultured to detect shedding of Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were screened for resistance to ciprofloxacin. Fecal samples were collected throughout the study, and tissue samples were collected during necropsy. RESULTS: Differences in shedding of Salmonella Typhimurium were not detected between groups receiving Mcc24-producing or non-Mcc24-producing E coli. No significant differences were found in quantitative analysis between groups receiving Mcc24-producing and non-Mcc24-producing E coli. Evidence of mar activation was not detected. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Microcin-producing E coli did not exert an effect on shedding of SalmonellaTyphimurium or mar activation in pigs. It may be difficult or impractical to create the conditions required for Mcc24 to be an effective part of a food safety intervention to reduce shedding of Salmonella Typhimurium.
