Tobacco plants expressing the mammalian 2'5'oligoadenylate system (2-5A system) exhibit resistance to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Here, to characterize the molecular aspect of the resistance to CMV in 2-5A system-expressing tobaccos, the activation of defense-related genes and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) as the markers for the hypersensitive resistance (HR), were elucidated. Northern hybridization analysis indicated that the expression of four pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes and five HR-related genes were induced in CMV-infected tobaccos expressing 2-5A system. Furthermore, the induction of SAR against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci as second challenge, was observed on CMV-inoculated tobaccos expressing 2-5A system. These results suggested that the resistance to CMV in tobacco expressing 2-5A system is associated with the establishment of an HR-like response.
