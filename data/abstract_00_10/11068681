The promoter-like sequence P15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 is active in Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Escherichia coli, but not in Lactococcus lactis. N-methyl-N-nitroso-N-guanidine (MNNG) mutagenesis of P15 was used to select for a promoter active in L. lactis MG1363. Molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated P16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a T-->A transversion. This deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. The activity of P16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pBV5030 (designated pLA16). The MIC of chloramphenicol in L. lactis, L. reuteri, L. plantarum, E. coli, and L. acidophilus harbouring pLA16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/mL, respectively. This represents an increase in promoter activity compared to P15 in L. reuteri of 3-fold, in L. plantarum of 9-fold, and in E. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in L. acidophilus of 7-fold.
