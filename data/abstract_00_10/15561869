BG958 reverses resistance in chloroquine-resistant isolates from different countries. Five mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum crt (pfcrt) gene resulting in the amino acid changes K76T, M74I, N75E, A220S, and R371I are systematically identified in resistance-reversed Asian, African, and Brazilian parasites which possess the pfcrt (CIET) haplotype. In combination with BG958, the activity of chloroquine is increased in parasites with the N86Y mutation in pfmdr1.
