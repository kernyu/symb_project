One of the most recent phenomena related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the emergence of a new vulnerable population: the elderly. One of the factors that account for this increase is the development of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), which has provided better quality of life and life expectancy for HIV-positive patients. However, ART is associated with adverse effects such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Due to the impact of ART on lipid and glucose metabolism, many studies were published involving HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, as well as their risk factors and the use of ART, but few of them reported on the cardiotoxicity of this therapy in the elderly. The objective of this study is to review the main metabolic changes caused by the use of antiretroviral therapy and its impact on an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in elderly people with HIV.
