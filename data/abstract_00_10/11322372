Although much of the interest in pulse methylprednisolone therapy (PMT) has centered around its use in children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, PMT has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of other proteinuric renal diseases. We hypothesized that a PMT-based treatment protocol, derived from the Tune-Mendoza protocol, would effectively induce a more rapid remission in young children with idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). A retrospective analysis was conducted of 11 consecutive SRNS patients (mean age 3.6 +/- 1.5 years) that received PMT between 1 August 1992 and 1 May 1998. The initial mean urinary protein/urinary creatinine ratio (UP/UC, mg/mg) was 8.3 +/- 9.7 and mean estimated creatinine clearance (CCr) 137.7 +/- 47.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2. An average of 24.8 +/- 10.5 PMT doses were given. The mean duration of PMT therapy until remission was 23.4 +/- 29.9 days (median 12 days). Cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide were used to maintain and extend remissions in 5 and 4 patients, respectively. At the conclusion of the study, the mean UP/UC was 0.12 +/- 0.22 and mean CCr 151.8 +/- 39.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (no CCr < or = 100 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Of the 11 patients, 9 attained complete remission. Adverse effects were mild and infrequent. This PMT protocol appears to safely and effectively induce remission in young children with SRNS. A future prospective trial that evaluates the efficacy of PMT in young children with SRNS is warranted.
