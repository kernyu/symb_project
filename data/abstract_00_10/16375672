Device-related infections in most nosocomial diseases can be traced to the formation of biofilms (microbial communities encased within a polysaccharide-rich extracellular matrix) by pathogens on surfaces of these devices. Candida species are the most common causative agents of these infections, and biofilms formed by these fungal organisms are associated with drastically enhanced resistance against most antimicrobial agents. This enhanced resistance contributes to the persistence of this fungus despite antifungal therapy. Recent studies showed that Candida biofilms exhibit antifungal resistance against most antifungal agents with the exception of echinocandins and lipid formulations of AMB. This review discusses methods used to evaluate biofilm resistance and provide information on susceptibility pattern of candidal biofilm as well as studies investigating the mechanisms underlying biofilm resistance.
