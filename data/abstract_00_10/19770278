Two clonally related Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, recovered from two patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit, were found to harbor a new OXA-2 variant (Asn148Asp), designated OXA-161. The plasmid location of bla(OXA-161) was demonstrated through electroporation to PAO1, and its codification in a class I integron (together with aacA4) was demonstrated through PCR and sequencing. bla(OXA-2) and bla(OXA-161) were cloned in parallel to demonstrate the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase properties of OXA-161, conferring resistance to ceftazidime and reduced susceptibility to cefepime and aztreonam.
