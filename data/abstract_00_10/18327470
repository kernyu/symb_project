Multiple resistances to antimicrobial drugs arising in Escherichia coli isolates may complicate therapeutic management of urinary tract infection (UTI) by this organism. In order to assess the multidrug resistance (MDR) among urinary E. coli isolates, we have tested 11 antimicrobial drugs against 67 isolates from outpatients attended in a tertiary-care teaching hospital and of 78 isolates from a municipal health unit, respectively in Ribeirao Preto, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Seventy-six percent and 22% of the isolates from the tertiary-care hospital and the municipal unit, respectively, were resistant to three or more different classes of agents, and were considered to present MDR. Among the isolates from the hospital patients, 73.0%, 65.0%, 58.0%, 58.0% and 31.0% were resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin, cephalothin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and norfloxacin, respectively; resistance from the municipal unit patients were 31.0%, 37.0%, 8.0%, 29.0% and 12.0% respectively, to the same drugs. The predominant phenotype among the MDR isolates presented is ampicillin, TMP/SMX and tetracycline resistance. The high prevalence of drug resistance among UTI patients calls for continuous surveillance to assure effective control of this infection.
