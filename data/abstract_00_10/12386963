The world is now being faced with the battle for antimicrobial resistant organisms(ARO), such as MRSA, PRSP, ESBL producing GNR, MDRP and VRSA. These AROs are causing hospital-acquired infections(HAI) by the way of person-to-person transmission. The role of microbiological laboratories in hospitals is quite important in controlling HAI. Firstly, accurate detection of AROs is essential. They have to be proficient in both isolation and detection of AROs. Secondly, they have to return the results rapidly for not only clinicians but infection control team(ICT) to prevent more spread of HAI if an isolated organism is ARO. Thirdly, they have to report the statistical data about isolated organisms for ICT in each hospital. AROs can be isolated by three major methods, detection of responsible resistant genes or proteins and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Most laboratories isolate AROs, using one or two of these methods. They should be prepared for and follow the most current criteria of AROs by Japanese original standard, or presented from NCCLS. Microbiological laboratories should also play a role in both hospital epidemiology and appropriate antimicrobial use by providing useful information, annual or periodical reports of antimicrobial susceptibility for isolated organisms which are relevant in their hospital. The microbiological laboratory which have good skills in detecting AROs, analyzing epidemiological data and communicating with all hospital workers, is now required from ICT in controlling HAI.
