BACKGROUND: Prior studies have found fluoroquinolone exposure to be a risk factor for infection with fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative rods in the acute care setting. However, risk factors may be different in the long-term care setting. METHODS: A case-control study design was used to determine whether fluoroquinolone exposure is a risk factor for fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli urinary tract infections in a long-term care center. Cases had fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli urinary tract infections; 4 controls were selected for each case. RESULTS: Thirty-three case patients were eligible; 132 controls were then selected. In the multivariable analysis, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli urinary tract infection was more common with prior fluoroquinolone use (odds ratio 21.8, 95% confidence interval, 3.7-127.1). CONCLUSIONS: Prior fluoroquinolone use is a strong risk factor for fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli urinary tract infection in the long-term care setting. Further studies are needed to examine the effect of interventions to decrease fluoroquinolone-resistant infections in the long-term care setting, including studying the effect of decreasing fluoroquinolone use.
