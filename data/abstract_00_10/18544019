To evaluate transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance and study the natural polymorphism in pol of HIV-1 strains of newly diagnosed women attending an antenatal clinic in Uganda we sequenced the protease and reverse transcriptase genes for 46 HIV-1 strains from the threshold surveillance. Of the 46 sequences analyzed, 48.0% were subtype A1 (n 22), 39.0% subtype D (n 18), 2.0% subtype A2 (n 1), 2.0% subtype C (n 1), and 9.0% intersubtype recombinant A1/D (n 4). Overall, many minor mutations were identified in the protease sequences. None of the strains had major associated mutations to any RTI drug or drug class interest after genotyping 37 samples of our cohort. The HIV drug resistance prevalence estimate in Entebbe following the HIVDR-TS methodology is less than 5% as set out by WHO guidelines.
