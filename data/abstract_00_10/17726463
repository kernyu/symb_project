B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) is characterised by the progressive accumulation of monoclonal CD5(+) B cells. In a previous study, we have analysed the expression profile of apoptosis-regulating genes using a cDNA-based microarray and found overexpression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 family member, bfl-1, in B-CLL cells with an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. In this study, bfl-1 mRNA levels have been determined by competitive PCR in an extended population of B-CLL patients to characterise its role in disease progression and development of chemoresistance. bfl-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with no response (NR) to last chemotherapy than in patients responding (partial response (PR)) to last chemotherapy (P<0.05) and in patients who had not required treatment (P<0.05). We found no correlation between bfl-1 mRNA levels and disease progression, IGHV mutational status or other clinical parameters. In addition, bfl-1 mRNA levels were inversely correlated with apoptotic response to in vitro fludarabine treatment of B-CLL cells. Specific downregulation of bfl-1 using siRNA induced apoptosis in resistant cells. Our data suggest that bfl-1 contributes to chemoresistance and might be a therapeutic target in B-CLL.
