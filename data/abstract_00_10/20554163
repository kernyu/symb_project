The activity of ceftobiprole and comparator agents was evaluated against a collection of 880 isolates, comprising 200 meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 200 meticillin-resistant S. aureus, 180 coagulase-negative staphylococci blood isolates, 100 Streptococcuspneumoniae and 200 macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci (100 Streptococcus pyogenes and 100 Streptococcus agalactiae). Ceftobiprole showed excellent activity against staphylococci (minimum inhibitory concentrations <or=4 microg/mL), irrespective of their susceptibility to other agents such as oxacillin, linezolid or glycopeptides. Ceftobiprole was also highly active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci, inhibiting 99.6% of all streptococci tested at <or=0.5 microg/mL. Based on these results, ceftobiprole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
