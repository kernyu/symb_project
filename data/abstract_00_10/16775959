The prevalence of gonococcal infections among sexually transmitted infections is decreasing particularly in developed countries, but the increase in antimicrobial resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an emerging issue. There is lack of data about the epidemiology and the resistance pattern of the pathogen in our country. Gonococcal infections are recently included among the reportable diseases in Turkey. The specific laboratory tests are difficult, expensive and seldomly used for diagnosis in our country. The infection is usuallly treated empirically. In this study, 30 N. gonorrhoeae strains isolated from clinical samples (endocervical, rectal and urethral swabs) obtained from registered/unregistered sex workers admitted to Ankara Municipiality Hospital of Dermatology and Venereal Diseases were tested for beta-lactamase production and the susceptibility to various antimicrobials. The susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution method, and the results were evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations. Of the isolates, 70% was found resistant to penicilin and beta-lactamase production was observed in 48% of them. The susceptibility rates of the isolates to ceftriaxone, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline were found as 100%, 100%, 97%, and 40%, respectively.
