UNLABELLED: Liver damage associated with chronic unexplained high serum transaminases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients under combined antiretroviral therapy is unknown. Liver histology was prospectively investigated in patients presenting serum transaminase elevation for more than 6 months, after exclusion of alcohol abuse, hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, autoimmune, and genetic liver diseases. In a subgroup of patients, liver mitochondrial activities were measured by spectrophotometry and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thirty patients were included with median values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels: 80 U/L, age: 46 years, body mass index: 23 kg/m(2), HIV RNA: 200 copies/mL, CD4 count: 365/mm(3), duration of HIV infection: 13 years, and duration of treatment exposure: 118, 41, and 53 months for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors, respectively. Histological anomalies were found in 22 of 30 patients. Steatosis was present in 18 patients, severe in nine patients, and associated with inflammation in 16 patients with a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Fibrosis was found in 18 patients, severe in six patients and associated with steatosis in 13 patients. Significant liver respiratory complex I defect, contrasting with high complex IV activity and normal mitochondrial DNA content, was observed in the group of patients compared with controls. The presence of NASH was correlated with high fasting glycemia and insulin levels, not with liver mitochondrial function or mitochondrial DNA content. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy with chronic transaminase elevation of unknown origin have a high rate of liver lesions, mostly consistent with NASH related to insulin resistance.
