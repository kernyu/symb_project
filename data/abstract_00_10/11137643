Antimicrobial use is the major determinant in the development of resistance. Many parameters of importance for optimal quality of antimicrobial therapy have already been defined. Maximal efficacy of the treatment should be combined with minimal toxicity at the lowest cost. Quality of antimicrobial drug use is dependent on knowledge of many aspects of infectious diseases. Considering efficacy, many of our indications for antimicrobial use need critical evaluation. Irrational use should be discouraged. Avoidance of the development of resistance is a quality parameter that will need increasing attention. This paper reviews the well-established factors that may influence the appropriateness of pharmacotherapy with antimicrobial drugs. It cites recent evidence supporting principles of prudent prescribing and gives an overview of audits that have addressed these parameters. Measures relating to resistance are discussed.
