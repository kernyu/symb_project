From January 1995 to June 2000, 19 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected in 19 cases of infectious skin diseases. Coagulase-negative staphylococci coexisted with P. aeruginosa in 10 cases and P. aeruginosa was also often associated with Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sp. or other species. Twelve cases carried P. aeruginosa more predominantly than the other species. Some coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus sp., S. aureus and Streptococcus sp. were also predominant. The frequency of predominant P. aeruginosa was significantly higher in secondary infections due to ulcers and decubitus than in secondary infections due to other skin diseases. P. aeruginosa was also often detected in the legs and feet, but not in the trunk. This organism showed high sensitivities to antibiotics, except minocycline. No significant differences in sensitivity or resistance to antibiotics were found between P. aeruginosa when detected as the predominant or single strain and this microorganism when detected as the non-predominant strain. Thus, the detection of P. aeruginosa important in choosing the appropriate antibiotics to be used and this is sometimes influenced by the patient's condition.
