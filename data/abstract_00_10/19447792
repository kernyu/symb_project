OBJECTIVES: We investigated the prevalence of raltegravir resistance-associated mutations at baseline and their evolution during raltegravir therapy in patients infected with different HIV-1 subtypes. METHODS: At pre-treatment screening, the integrase gene from plasma samples from patients infected with subtype B and non-B viruses was analysed. Raltegravir resistance evolution was further evaluated in 10 heavily pre-treated patients. RESULTS: Two hundred and nine plasma samples from 94 subtype B and 115 non-B patients were sequenced. No signature/primary raltegravir resistance mutations were detected at baseline. The secondary mutations L74M, T97A, V151I and G163R were observed with a frequency of <4%. The primary mutations N155H, Q148R/H or Q143R were observed during raltegravir therapy. The Q148R/H was detected only in subtype B. A switch of the primary mutation during raltegravir treatment was not restricted to the subtype B viruses. The prevalence of each primary mutation varied depending on the length of the raltegravir therapy. The Q148R/H was mostly detected after short exposure to raltegravir, while the Y143R was observed only after prolonged raltegravir exposure. We detected an association between the presence of the T206S in the baseline genotype and the absence of the primary Q148R/H mutation or any secondary mutation accompanying the N155H following raltegravir failure. CONCLUSIONS: A number of secondary and additional mutations were found in baseline genotypes. During therapy, when the virus was not optimally suppressed, resistance mutations developed, which were dependent on subtype and time on raltegravir.
