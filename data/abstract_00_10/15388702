Nine enterococcus-like strains were referred to the Streptococcus Laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for further identification from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System Laboratory at the CDC. The cultures were isolated from ground beef purchased from retail in Oregon in 2000. Conventional biochemical testing and analysis of whole-cell protein electrophoretic profiles distinguished these strains from known species of enterococci and vagococci. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies revealed that these strains were most closely related to the species Vagococcus fluvialis. DNA-DNA reassociation studies confirmed that these nine strains represented a new taxon. The relative binding ratio was 87 % or greater at the optimal temperature, and the divergence was less than 1 % for strains hybridized against the isolate designated the type strain. DNA-DNA relatedness was 25 % to V. fluvialis and 9 % or less to the other three species of Vagococcus. DNA-DNA relatedness was 33 % or less to the 25 currently described species of Enterococcus. On the basis of this evidence, it is proposed that these strains be classified as Vagococcus carniphilus sp. nov. The type strain of V. carniphilus is 1843-02T (= ATCC BAA-640T = CCUG 46823T). The clinical significance (if any) of these strains is yet to be determined.
