Thirteen clinical isolates of Escherichia coli resistant to ceftazidime that possessed an AmpC and other (beta-lactamases were identified. The effectiveness of different formulations of piperacillin/tazobactam to other beta-lactams was compared. Antibiotic susceptibility testing, polymerase chain reaction, amplification of blaTEM, blaSHV and blaAmpC, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to identify AmpC beta-lactamases were performed. Hydrolysis rates were obtained and residual enzymatic activity was determined. Cefepime and ertapenem were more active than piperacillin/tazobactam. In contrast, increasing the relative proportion of tazobactam improved susceptibility testing. Twenty micromolar tazobactam inhibited total beta-lactamase activity (as measured by nitrocefin hydrolysis rates) by greater than 75% against all isolates tested: in 11 of 13 E. coli isolates, total beta-lactamase activity was inhibited by 90%. The observed differences between MIC determinations and susceptibility to enzymatic inactivation by tazobactam against E. coli containing AmpC and other -lactamases may be due to the final tazobactam concentration achieved in the periplasmic space. Factors determining this are critical considerations in assessing beta-lactamase inhibitor potency.
