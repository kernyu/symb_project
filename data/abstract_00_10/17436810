During recent years the prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci in milk samples from Dutch dairy cows has increased. In 1999 16.2% of the bacteria isolated from milk collected from cows with subclinical mastitis were coagulase-negative staphylococci. In 2004 this proportion was 42.2%. The proportion of coagulase-negative staphylococci of the bacteria isolated from milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis was 7.3% in 1999 and 14.1% in 2004. In this study, the susceptibility of 108 coagulase-negative staphylococci to oxacillin, cefquinome, streptomycin, neomycin, penicillin, and the combination of nafcillin, penicillin, and streptomycin was tested. The isolates were cultured from milk collected from cows with mastitis and typed using the Api-Staph system. Eight species were identified. Staphylococcus chromogenes was the predominant species (41.7%), followed by Staphylococcus xylosus (15.7%) and Staphylococcus simulans (10.2%). With the agar dilution method all strains proved to be sensitive to cefquinome and 90% to oxacillin. Three isolates (2.8%) were mecA-positive. Despite the agar dilution results, these three isolates should be considered resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, penicillins combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor and all generations of cephalosporins). In the agar diffusion test, all isolates proved to be sensitive to the combination of nafcillin-penicillin-streptomycin, 99% were sensitive to neomycin and 1% intermediate sensitive, and 95% were sensitive to streptomycin, 4% resistant, and 1% intermediate sensitive. The coagulase-negative staphylococci were highly resistant to penicillin (37.4%), although the level of resistance varied between species, from 0% for Staphylococcus simulans to 100% for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Because coagulase-negative staphylococci are resistant to several antibiotics, sensitivity testing is important for targeted treatment of mastitis.
