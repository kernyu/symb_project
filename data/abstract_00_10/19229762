Owing to a rise in frequency and change in pattern of cases with fungaemia at our tertiary care centre, we conducted a prospective study for 4 months to understand the epidemiology and outcome of this infection. Detailed case histories including management protocol and outcomes were noted. Records of 140 cases with fungaemia (27.1% adult and 72.9% paediatric patients) were analysed. Although C. tropicalis was the most common yeast isolated, significantly higher isolation of C. guilliermondii (30.4%) and C. pelliculosa (17.6%) was noted in paediatric patients; and C. albicans (26.3%) and C. glabrata (10.5%) in adult patients. Rare species isolated included C. ustus (0.7%) and Trichosporon asahii (2.1%). Mortality was high (56.9% and 47.4%, respectively), in both groups of patients. Resistance to azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) emerged in C. albicans (12.5-18.8%) and C. tropicalis (10.2-13.6%). Antifungal susceptibility testing report modified the therapy from fluconazole to amphotericin B in 8 patients; 5 survived. In conclusion, the study highlighted the rise of non-albicans Candida species in our hospital with differential distribution in paediatric and adult wards and emergence of azole resistance.
