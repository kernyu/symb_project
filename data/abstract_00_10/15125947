In this study, we report the design, synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel indazole derivatives as DNA gyrase inhibitors with Gram-positive antibacterial activity. Our results show that selected compounds from this series exhibit potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including multi-drug resistant strains that is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE).
