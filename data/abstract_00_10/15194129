One hundred and sixty viridans group streptococci (VGS) and 26 Gemella spp. resistant to erythromycin were studied to detect macrolide lincosamide and streptogramin B (MLS(B)) phenotypes and to investigate resistance rates to other antibiotics. The M phenotype was most prevalent in both bacterial groups (59.6% in VGS, 69.2% in gemellae) and the iMLS(B) phenotype was found least often (9.3 and 13.9%, respectively). All isolates with M phenotype had the mef(A/E) gene, being prevalent the mef(E) subclass. cMLS(B) and iMLS(B) strains contained the erm(B) gene, alone or in combination with the mef(A/E) gene. Thirteen isolates were intermediately resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin and 11 strains showed low susceptibility to telithromycin. Linezolid was active against all the isolates tested and tetracycline resistance was the major one in VGS (41.6%) and Gemella spp. (46.2%).
