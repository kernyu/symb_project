Murine norovirus (MNV) was used as a surrogate to study resistance of human norovirus to disinfectants used in hospitals. MNV was sensitive to alcohol, alcohol hand rubs, bleach, and povidone iodine-based disinfectant. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR results indicated that the presence of viral RNA did not correlate with the presence of infectious virus.
