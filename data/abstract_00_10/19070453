The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program is a longitudinal antimicrobial surveillance study that has been in existence since 1997 in centers that are actively prescribing meropenem. This report examines the results from the study in Europe in 2007. A total of 5208 isolates were examined for activity (MIC) of meropenem and other broad-spectrum antibacterial comparators. Cumulative susceptibility rates using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria against all methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were imipenem (97.7%) > meropenem (97.3%) > piperacillin/tazobactam (96.2%) > tobramycin (94.2%) > gentamicin (92.0%) > ciprofloxacin (84.0%) > ceftazidime (39.8%). Against all species of Enterobacteriaceae, the rates were meropenem (99.4%) > imipenem (98.3%) > tobramycin (92.0%) > gentamicin (89.5%) > ceftazidime (86.2%) > piperacillin/tazobactam (85.5%) > ciprofloxacin (84.2%). Meropenem was most effective against the nonfermenters, although multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were reported. The continued need for surveillance studies such as MYSTIC is exemplified, and results from these types of surveillance can, hopefully, help in the correct choice of empiric therapy.
