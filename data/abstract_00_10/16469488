STUDY OBJECTIVES: To test safety and tolerability of long-term moxifloxacin in resistant tuberculosis (TB) patients and patients with intolerance to first line anti-TB drugs. DESIGN: Clinical evaluation of adverse events (AEs) during prolonged moxifloxacin treatment. SETTING: TB Unit of the Regional TB Reference Center, Villa Marelli Institute, Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Patients treated with moxifloxacin, 400 mg orally once daily for TB in the Villa Marelli Institute from January 2001 to December 2003 were enrolled. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were treated with moxifloxacin at the Villa Marelli Institute in the study period, for multidrug resistant (MDR) TB (14, 36.8%), for intolerance to first line anti-TB drugs (9, 23.7%), for combined resistance and intolerance to first line anti-TB drugs (12, 31.6%), other reasons (3, 7.9%). The mean duration of moxifloxacin treatment was 6.3 +/- 5.2 months. Twelve (31.6%) patients reported at least an AE due to moxifloxacin, mostly gastrointestinal (8, 21.0%), general (5, 13.2%) and central nervous system (3, 7.9%) AEs. In 4 (10.5%) patients the drug was withdrawn for major AEs; no irreversible or fatal events were recorded. Most of the patients (31, 81.6%) reported a treatment success, even if the success rate was lower in MDR TB patients (8/14, 51.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that a large proportion of patients experienced at least an AE due to moxifloxacin, the drug resulted safe in the long-term administration for complicated TB cases.
