The efficacies of several antimalarial drugs in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were compared, during an open, randomized trial, in New Halfa, eastern Sudan. The 96 patients who completed the 28 days of follow-up were treated with chloroquine (N = 26), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (N = 38) or quinine (N = 32). No treatment failures were observed among the patients given sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Only 23.1% of the patients given chloroquine showed adequate clinical response, however, the rest showing early (15.4%) or, more frequently, late (61.5%) treatment failure. In terms of parasitological failure, 54.1% of the patients given chloroquine showed early RI resistance, 7.7% showed late RI, and 15.1% showed RIII. Most (90.6%) of the patients treated with quinine had adequate treatment responses, the rest having late treatment failures (and late RI). The frequency of treatment failure was significantly higher, however, among the patients given chloroquine than in the quinine-treatment arm. The present results and those of earlier investigations indicate that the problem of chloroquine resistance is worsening in eastern Sudan, and that the use of chloroquine as the first-line drug for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in this area is now compromised. The response to quinine may also be faltering.
