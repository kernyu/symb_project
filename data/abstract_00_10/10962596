Chicken muscle, liver and egg samples were collected from 33 broiler and 5 layer farms in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia over a period of two years starting from January 1996. Antibiotic-residue positive samples were identified in the products of 23 (69.7%) broiler and 3 (60%) layer poultry farms. 87% and 100.0% of the antibiotic-residue positive broiler farms were positive for at least one tetracycline compound in raw muscle and liver respectively, while 73.9% and 95.5% were positive for 2 or more tetracyclines in these two tissues, respectively. Furthermore, 82.6% and 95.5% of the antibiotic-residue-positive farms had mean concentrations of at least one tetracycline compound in excess of the permissible maximum residue limit (MRL) in raw muscle and liver, respectively. These compounds also remained chemically detectable after cooking. Tetracycline levels exceeded MRL in 14.4% of antibiotic-positive raw eggs but the overall mean tetracycline concentration in each farm was below MRL. This study confirmed widespread misuse of tetracycline agents including multiple use of drugs belonging to the same pharmacological group and lack of implementation of recommended withdrawal times. This may be contributing to the high resistance rates to tetracyclines in both chicken and human microbial isolates observed in the region. This study, therefore, stresses the need for stricter regulations for the use of antimicrobial drugs in the poultry industry as well as the inspection of chicken for drug residues prior to marketing.
