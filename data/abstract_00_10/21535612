In this study, the metabolic activities (in terms of quantities of the produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and exopolysaccharides) of 8 strains of Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., and Pediococcus spp., were determined. Lactic acid levels produced by strains were 8.1 to 17.4 mg/L. The L. acidophilus Z1L strain produced the maximum amount (3.18 mug/mL) of hydrogen peroxide. The exopolysaccharides (EPS) production by the strains was ranged between 173 and 378 mg/L. The susceptibility of 7 different antibiotics against these strains was also tested. All strains were found to be sensitive to ampicillin. The tolerance of the strains to low pH, their resistance to bile salts of strains, and their abilities to autoaggregate and coaggregate with Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 were also evaluated. High EPS-producing strains showed significant autoaggregation and coaggregation ability with test bacteria (P < 0.01). A correlation also was determined between EPS production and acid-bile tolerance (P < 0.05). EPS production possibly affects or is involved in acid-bile tolerance and aggregation of Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., and Pediococcus spp. strains and supports the potential of L. acidophilus Z1L strain as new probiotic.
