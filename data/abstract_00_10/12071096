The rapid bactericidal activities of panipenem (PAPM), imipenem (IPM), and meropenem (MEPM) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated by using in vitro pharmacodynamic model simulating the human plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion at 500 mg for 0.5 hours. Against P. aeruginosa PAO1, PAPM and IPM showed rapider reduction in viable cell counts than MEPM at 0.5 hours after exposure. All drugs showed more than 3 log10 reduction in viable cell counts at 2 hours after exposure and bacterial regrowth was not observed throughout 6 hours. The initial bactericidal activities of the drugs against 4 clinical isolates within 1 hour after exposure were also investigated by the same method. Against P. aeruginosa strain 12,475, the 3 drugs showed similar initial bactericidal activity but PAPM and IPM showed stronger initial bactericidal activity than MEPM against the other strains as did against P. aeruginosa PAO1. The morphological change of a strain 12,489, for which the initial bactericidal activities were different largely, after 0.5 hours exposure to simulated drug-concentrations was investigated by scanning electron microscope. PAPM and IPM induced morphological changes in most of the cells and cell lysis and bulge formation. On the other hand, MEPM induced changes of the surface structure of cells and slightly elongated cells, but not cell lysis.
