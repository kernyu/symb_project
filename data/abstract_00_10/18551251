PURPOSE: The present study was envisaged to evaluate potential of combination therapy comprising of immunomodulator picroliv and antimalarial chloroquine against drug resistant Plasmodium yoelii (P. yoelii) infection in BALB/c mice. METHODS: The immunomodulatory potential of picroliv was established by immunizing animals with model antigen along with picroliv. Immune response was assessed using T-cell proliferation assay and also by determining the antibody isotype-profile induced in the immunized mice. In the next set of experiment, prophylactic potential of picroliv to strengthen antimalarial properties of chloroquine against P. yoelii (MDR) infection in BALB/c mice was assessed. RESULTS: T-cell proliferation as well as antibody production study reveals that picroliv helps in evoking strong immuno-potentiating response against model antigen in the immunized mice. Co-administration of picroliv enhances efficacy of CHQ against experimental murine malaria. CONCLUSION: The activation of host immune system can increase the efficacy of chloroquine for suppression of drug resistant malaria infection in BALB/c mice.
