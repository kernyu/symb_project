The susceptibility of the yeast-like fungi strains was assessed using the Fungitest method. The yeast-like fungi strains isolated from 406 patients with symptoms of candidiasis (oral cavity, vagina, urethra, skin, nails, and stomach) were evaluated. Differences between the susceptibility of strains isolated from different sites of the body to tested drugs were found. High resistance of tested strains to several antimycotics were identified. Fungitest is an easy and effective method in assessing the susceptibility of yeast-like fungi strains to antimycotics.
