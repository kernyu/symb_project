The fluoroquinolone gemifloxacin has recently been approved for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and mild community acquired pneumonia, including that caused by multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Owing to the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae, as well as resistance to other common pathogens of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community acquired pneumonia, it is important to have new, potent antimicrobial agents for the treatment of these infections. Gemifloxacin is the most potent antimicrobial agent in vitro for S. pneumoniae, and has excellent activity against the other key pathogens of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community acquired pneumonia, including the atypical microorganisms. The clinical trial outcomes of several studies that have evaluated gemifloxacin show a range of superior clinical or bacteriologic outcomes against several current antimicrobials, including levofloxacin, clarithromycin, trovafloxacin and ceftriaxone. The safety profile of gemifloxacin is similar to that of approved agents to treat acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community acquired pneumonia, with a low discontinuation rate of 2.2%. A nonphototoxic rash (usually a mild, maculopapular rash) was observed in 2.8% of patients in clinical studies.
