Recent work has shown that the Arabidopsis NPR1 protein not only plays an essential role in salicylic acid (SA)-mediated systemic acquired resistance and rhizobacterium-triggered induced systemic resistance, but also is involved in crosstalk inhibition of jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defense responses. Molecular characterization has revealed that activation of NPR1 and certain TGA transcription factors occurs under the reducing conditions that follow an initial oxidative burst after the induction of defense responses. In addition to NPR1 and TGA, the single-stranded DNA-binding transcription factor AtWhy1 and the WRKY70 transcription factor were recently found to be involved in SA-mediated defense and SA-JA crosstalk, respectively.
