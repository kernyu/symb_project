To determine the antibiotic resistance pattern and resistance plasmids, we studied 23 antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp. which caused infection in Bayindir-Ankara Hospital, Turkey. Biochemical and physiological identification tests were applied by the Vitek system and compared with the results of protein profiles by SDS-PAGE. From 23 isolates, 20 were identified as E. faecalis, 2 as E. faecium and 1 as E. gallinarum. Twenty four antibiotics belong to 10 different groups were used in susceptibility tests. Multiple antibiotic resistance was determined in 10 of 23 Enterococcus spp. Overall resistance to the used antibiotics was 47.3% and low level resistance was 16.6%. Among the isolates tested, 8.7% demonstrated high level gentamicin resistance, 17.4% demonstrated high level streptomycin resistance, and 43.5% demonstrated penicillin resistance. High level vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. rate was 34.8%, and 60.9% exhibited low level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. They contain plasmids which varied in numbers between 1 and 11 and the plasmid sizes ranged from 2.08 to 56.15 kb. In curing experiments with acriflavine, two different plasmids were shown in different molecular sizes of 33.49 and 13.6 kb while the first determined glycopeptide and penicillin resistance, the second one determined either glycopeptide or penicillin resistance in two different E. faecalis strains. On the other hand, a 22.58 kb plasmid, determining kanamycin resistance, was detected in an E. faecium strain. After the curing experiments, an elimination of 37.17 and 44.47 kDa protein bands was shown in E. faecium EFA1 and E. faecalis EFA13 in SDS-PAGE, respectively. This survey indicates the increase of antibiotic-resistant enterococci, especially to vancomycin in our hospital isolates.
