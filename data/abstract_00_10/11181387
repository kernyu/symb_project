Recently, it has been shown that a new mutational pattern (the E44D/A and/or V118I mutation) confers moderate phenotypic lamivudine resistance in the absence of the M184V mutation. The E44D/A and/or the V118I mutation does not exist in drug-naive patients, and the prevalence increases with the number of treatment regimens and lamivudine experience. The mutations can preexist in nucleoside-experienced but lamivudine-naive patients. They are always associated with zidovudine resistance-associated mutations, even in the absence of M184V. These mutations are more stable than the M184V substitution during antiretroviral treatment interruptions.
