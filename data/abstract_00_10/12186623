Eradication therapy has been incorporated into clinical practice. The regimens currently recommended for first-line treatment include a 2-week bismuth-based triple therapy (mainly in developing countries), a 1 - 2 week proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy and a 1-week ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC)-based triple therapy. However, these regimens fail to eradicate Helicobacter pylori in up to 20% of patients due to poor compliance, inadequate treatment duration, smoking, old age and bacterial resistance to nitroimidazoles and/or macrolides in particular. Therefore, alternative regimens that avoid nitroimidazoles and/or macrolides or overcome bacterial resistance to these drugs, improve compliance, minimise side effects and/or reduce costs have been evaluated. One-week quadruple therapy, which adds a PPI or histamine receptor 2-blocker to bismuth-based triple therapy, usually achieves an eradication rate of 90% when used as an alternative first-line therapy but the efficacy decreases when used as a rescue therapy. Several new triple therapies that may be used as alternative and/or rescue therapies have been evaluated. Among these are furazolidone-based (furazolidone plus an antibiotic and a bismuth salt, a PPI or RBC), fluoroquinolone-based (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin plus an antibiotic and a PPI) and ecabet sodium-based (ecabet plus two antibiotics) triple therapies. Recently, rifabutin has been used in combination with a PPI and amoxycillin as a rescue therapy, with satisfactory eradication rates. In addition, a number of new antimicrobial agents are currently under investigation in in vitro studies but the clinical values of these agents needs to be confirmed.
