Integrons are genetic elements composed of a gene encoding an integrase, gene cassettes and an integration site for the gene cassettes (att). The integrase excises and integrates the gene cassettes from and into the integron, but integrons themselves are not mobile. Two groups of integrons are known: resistance integrons and super-integrons. Nearly all known gene cassettes from resistance integrons encode resistance to antibiotics or disinfectants. These integrons are found on transposons, plasmids and the bacterial chromosome. Gene cassettes in super-integrons encode a variety of different functions. Super-integrons are located on the bacterial chromosome. More than 100 gene cassettes may be present, in contrast to resistance integrons where less than ten cassettes are present. Many species harbour super-integrons, which are species-specific, whereas particular resistance integrons can be found in a variety of species. The gene cassettes in resistance integrons probably originated from super-integrons. In the last few years, a variety of new gene cassettes have been described. Many of these encode resistance against newer antibiotics such as cephalosporins and carbapenems. Resistance integrons have been found in isolates from a wide variety of sources, including food.
