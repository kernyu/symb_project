Due to increasing antimicrobial resistance, a pressing need exists for new antibiotics to treat skin and soft tissue infections. Several newer agents such as tigecycline, daptomycin, and linezolid have been important additions for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pathogens. New drugs in development such as dalbavancin and ceftobiprole will further enhance our ability to treat mixed infections and improve patient compliance. These promising new antimicrobials will likely grow in importance as resistant bacterial strains increase in community-acquired infections.
