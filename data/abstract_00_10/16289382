The use of antimicrobials in domestic aquaculture is limited. There are only two approved and available antimicrobials for food fish (Terramycin for Fish) and Romet-30 and one approved for ornamental fish (nifurpirinol). These antimicrobials are only approved to treat specific diseases in specific aquatic animal species. Antimicrobial use data, as well as environmental fate information and analysis of barriers to transmission, are valuable for assessing qualitative or quantitative risk. In the US, the limited availability of antimicrobials and use in aquaculture suggests the best quantitative source of antimicrobial use information is directly from drug manufacturers.
