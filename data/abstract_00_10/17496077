Retraction of type IV pili is mediated by PilT. We show that loss of pilT function leads to upregulation of mtrF (multiple transferable resistance) and two operons encoding putative ABC transporters in Neisseria gonorrhoeae MS11. This effect occurs indirectly through the transcriptional regulator FarR, which until now has been shown to regulate only farAB. L-Glutamine can reverse pilT downregulation of the ABC transporter operons and mtrF.
