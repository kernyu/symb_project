Complex treatment including an individual selection of chemotherapy regimens with their timely correction and various laser therapy modalities was used in 147 adolescents with a first detected disseminated pulmonary tuberculous process (DPTP). All the patients were initially given treatment regimen 1. According to the results of chemotherapy correction (adverse reactions to antituberculous agents and drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis), the patients were divided into 3 groups. Inclusion of reserve-series drugs into the initial combination for most critically ill patients could prevent an exacerbation of tuberculosis in most cases (89.7%) during therapy. The employment of various laser therapy modalities in combination with an individual approach to using drugs in the intensive phase of treatment enhanced its efficiency in patients with DPTP, by accelerating the periods of positive changes by 1.5-2 months. This made it possible to achieve a smooth course of tuberculosis in 92.5% of patients with high rates of bacterial isolation cessation (99.2%) and decay cavity closure (97.6%).
