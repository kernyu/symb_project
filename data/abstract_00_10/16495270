Enterococcus gallinarum N04-0414 (MIC for vancomycin, 256 microg/ml) harbored a vanD-type vancomycin resistance operon as well as the intrinsic vanC1 operon. The D-Ala:D-Ala ligase 2 gene (ddl2) was not present in the strain, though it is found downstream of the vanS gene from the vanC operon in E. gallinarum ATCC 49573 and 19 other E. gallinarum strains tested.
