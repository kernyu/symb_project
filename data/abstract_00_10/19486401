AIM: To investigate the nisin Z innocuity using normal human gingival fibroblast and epithelial cell cultures, and its synergistic effect with these gingival cells against Candida albicans adhesion and transition from blastospore to hyphal form. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cells were cultured to 80% confluence and infected with C. albicans in the absence or presence of various concentrations of nisin Z. Our results indicate that only high concentrations of nisin Z promoted gingival cell detachment and differentiation. Determination of the LD(50) showed that the fibroblasts were able to tolerate up to 80 microg ml(-1) for 24 h, dropping thereafter to 62 mug ml(-1) after 72 h of contact, compared to 160 microg ml(-1) after 24 h, and 80 microg ml(-1) after 72 h recorded by the gingival epithelial cells which displayed a greater resistance to nisin Z. The use of nisin Z even at low concentration (25 microg ml(-1)) at appropriate concentrations with gingival cells significantly reduced C. albicans adhesion to gingival monolayer cultures and inhibited the yeast's transition. CONCLUSION: These findings show that when used at non-toxic levels for human cells, nisin Z can be effective against C. albicans adhesion and transition and may synergistically interact with gingival cells for an efficient resistance against C. albicans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study suggests the potential usefulness of nisin Z as an antifungal agent, when used in an appropriate range.
