BACKGROUND/AIMS: Treatment regimens with pegylated interferons have yielded improved response rates, compared with conventional interferon-based regimens, for chronic hepatitis C. However, little is known about the utility of such regimens for individuals who failed to respond to prior conventional interferon-based treatment. METHODS: 182 patients who had previously failed to eliminate circulating hepatitis C virus 24 weeks after completion of a multi-week course of either interferon monotherapy or interferon in combination with ribavirin were treated with peginterferon alfa-2b weekly and ribavirin daily for 48 weeks. RESULTS: The sustained viral response, was 20% (23/116) in previous non-responders and 55% (36/66) in previous relapsers (P<0.001). In previous non-responders, the sustained viral response in those with viral genotype 1 was 17% (19/109) compared to 57% (4/7) in those with genotypes 2 and 3 (P=0.03). In previous relapsers, the sustained viral response in those with viral genotype 1 was 53% (26/49) compared to 59% (10/17) with genotypes 2 and 3 (P=0.78). CONCLUSIONS: The response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin in previous non-responders with genotypes 2 and 3 and in prior relapsers with chronic hepatitis C is comparable to overall sustained viral response rates seen in previously untreated patients.
