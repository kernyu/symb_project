Two-component signal transduction systems are the primary means by which bacteria sense environmental change and integrate an adaptive response. In pathogenic bacteria, 2-component signal transduction (TCST) kinases are involved in the expression of virulence and antibiotic resistance. This makes bacterial TCST systems attractive targets for pharmacologic intervention. This paper describes a fluorescence polarization assay that quantifies the binding between bacterial DNA promoter segments and their cognate response regulator proteins. Using the Van RSTCST system from Enterococcus faecium, which encodes vancomycin resistance, the authors demonstrate inhibition of response regulator protein/promoter segment binding with a known inhibitor. Observed binding constants were comparable to those reported in surface plasmon resonance measurements and gel shift measurements.
