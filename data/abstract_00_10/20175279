Efficacy and tolerance of furamag and norbactin were compared in a prospective controlled trial with participation of 82 females aged 18-60 years with acute uncomplicated cystitis. All the women were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n=42) received norbactin (norfloxacin) in a dose 400 mg twice a day for 7 days. Group 2 (n=40) was given furamag in a dose 50 mg 3 times a day for 10 days. The results were evaluated 2 weeks after the treatment. The comparison of the treatment results showed that a new nitrofuranic drug furamag has significantly higher clinical and bacteriological efficacy: acute cystitis was cured in 95% patients, eradication of the infective agent occurred in 96.4% patients, tolerance was good in 97.5% patients. Sensitivity of the agents causing acute cystitis to nitrofurans reached 98.2% while to norbactin--only 86%.
