Escherichia coli strain LE316 contains a mutation in gyrB that results in the substitution of Val164 to Gly and confers both chlorobiocin resistance and temperature sensitivity. Selection for suppressors of the ts phenotype yielded second-site mutations in GyrB at His38 and Thr157. The properties of proteins bearing these mutations have been characterized, and a mechanism of suppression is proposed based upon structural considerations.
