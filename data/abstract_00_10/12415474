In order to elucidate trends in the incidence and susceptibility profiles of causative agents of bacteremia/fungemia in nine surgical intensive care units, a total of 744 isolates obtained during a 5-year period (1996-2000) were studied. The isolates included 698 bacteria and 46 fungi obtained from 523 positive blood cultures, representing 317 episodes of bacteremia/fungemia. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 2.3 episodes per 1000 surgical ICU admissions in 1996, 1.6 in 1997, 0.3 in 1998, 0.6 in 1999, and 1.7 in 2000. One Enterococcus faecalis (VanA) isolate resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin was recovered in 1996. Ciprofloxacin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased from 36% in 1996 to 20% in 2000, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins decreased from 40% in 1996 to 9% in 2000. In light of differences between these results and those found elsewhere, these findings might prove useful for making infection control policy decisions in intensive care units.
