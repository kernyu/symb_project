Three pharmacological subtypes of cholinergic receptors have been distinguished in Ascaris suum using a muscle contraction assay and classical pharmacological techniques. The receptor subtypes are: a B-subtype (sensitive to bephenium); an L-subtype (sensitive to levamisole and pyrantel); and an N-subtype (sensitive to nicotine and methyridine). Oxantel is a cholinergic anthelmintic that was first introduced for the treatment of whipworm, Trichuris, infections in children. Here, we compare the subtype selectivity of oxantel with thenium and other cholinergic anthelmintics. We used the A. suum assay to derive pA(2) values for the agonists: oxantel, thenium, bephenium, levamisole, pyrantel, nicotine and methyridine with the antagonists: paraherquamide, 2-desoxyparaherquamide and methyllycaconitine. pA(2) values, rather than pK(B) values, were determined for all agonists when it was found that Schild slopes for some agonists were significantly less than 1.0. The pA(2) of oxantel was 6.58+/-0.25 for paraherquamide; 5.39+/-0.28 for 2-desoxyparaherquamide; 7.01+/-0.19 for methyllycaconitine. Comparison of pA(2) values using cluster analysis showed that oxantel was grouped with nicotine and methyridine, the N-subtype agonists. Thenium had pA(2)s of 7.84+/-0.41 for paraherquamide; 5.52+/-0.50 for 2-desoxyparaherquamide; 6.33+/-0.19 for methyllycaconitine. Cluster analysis placed thenium between the L-subtype agonists and the B-subtype agonist. The therapeutic significance of classification of cholinergic anthelmintics is discussed. Combination of oxantel and pyrantel would have therapeutic advantages, covering N- and L-subtypes, and so increasing spectrum of action and reducing the potential for development of resistance. Our results predict that oxantel may remain effective in some nematode isolates that have become levamisole- and pyrantel-resistant.
