The aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial activity of selected alcoholic antiseptics against clinical strains, which possessed in majority a high level of drug resistance: MRSA (7), MSSA (3), E. coli: (9): strains producing ESBL (4), P. aeruginosa: (4), E. cloacae: (3), K. pneumoniae: (3). These strains were defined by MIC value, using antibiotic agar dilution method according to NCCLS. Fourteen alcoholic antiseptics were used in this study. Beside alcohol, they contained other active substances like iodine, hydrogen peroxide, chlorhexidine. Some additional agents were included for easier application, such as: gelling, moisturizing, aromatic or coloring substances. The objective of this study was also to determine the dependence of bactericidal activity on preparations (concentration). Product undiluted and diluted two and four times in water was analyzed according to prEN 12054 standard; 30 seconds and 1 minute contact time was used. The obtained data indicate that all tested undiluted antiseptics possessed bactericidal activity described by producers. However antiseptics (dilution leads to decrease and even loss of bactericidal activity. Two-times dilution of gel almost completely inactivated the product. Antimicrobial activity after 30 seconds of contact time was not affected by presence of additional agents in the tested antiseptics.
