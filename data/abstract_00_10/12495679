The objective of this study is to describe infections in a specialized burns intensive care unit from 1993 to 1999. The criteria for admission to the unit are: children with burns involving at least 10% or adults with burns involving at least 20% of total body surface; burns affecting face, perineum or feet; suspected or proven airway injury; electric or chemical burns; age less than one year or above 50; or pre-existing disease with any extent of burns. Surveillance of hospital-acquired infection was prospective. Hospital-acquired infection criteria used were those modified from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diagnosis of infection using skin biopsy was not done. Over the study period, 320 patients were admitted to our burns intensive care unit. One hundred and seventy-five (55%) developed 388 hospital-acquired infections. The rate for vascular catheter-associated bloodstream infections was 34 per 1,000 central line-days. The rate of ventilator associated pneumonia was 26 infections per 1,000 ventilator-days. Primary bloodstream was the most common infection with 189 episodes (49%); followed by 83 burn wound infections (21%) and 56 pneumonias (14%). In 76% of these infections and in 97% of the primary bloodstream infections, aetiological agents were identified. The micro-organisms causing infections were S taphylococcus aureus (24%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%), Acinetobacter spp. (14%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (12%). Candida spp. caused 8% of infections. Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms exhibited resistance to most antimicrobial agents used for therapy. During the first three days of hospitalization in the burns intensive care unit there were eight infections caused by S. aureus and three of these were resistant to oxacillin. These data provide background information regarding extensive burn patients on which decisions for control and prevention of hospital-acquired infections can be made.
