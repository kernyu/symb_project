A benzil derivative: scandione, 2',2"-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-4",5"-methylenedioxybenzil and two isoflavones: scandenal, 3'-formyl-4',5-dihydroxy-2",2"-dimethylchromeno-[6,7:5",6"]isoflavone and scanderone, 4',5-dihydroxy-3'-prenyl-2",2"-dimethylchromeno-[7,8:6",5"]isoflavone together with fifteen known compounds were isolated from the stem of D. scandens. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods. Radical scavenging, antibacterial and hypertensive activities of some of the compounds were investigated.
