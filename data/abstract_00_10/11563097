A "second generation" of TSAO molecules directed against TSAO-resistant strains have been prepared. The presence of two neighboring carbonyl groups at the 4" position of the 3'-spiro moiety seems to be important for the anti-HIV-1 activity against both wild type and TSAO-resistant strains. NMR conformational studies in solution and theoretical calculations of the novel compounds have also been carried out.
