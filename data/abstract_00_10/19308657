The incidence of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA) and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing P. aeruginosa has increased worldwide. The treatment options are limited for infectious diseases caused by these two organisms. The use of colistin has been of recent interest in cases involving both types. We report the case of a 74-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia who was successfully treated with intravenous colistin for maxillary sinusitis and orbital cellulites due to MBL-producing MDRPA during neutropenia, and then for pneumonia caused by the bacteria after the recovery of neutrophil counts.
