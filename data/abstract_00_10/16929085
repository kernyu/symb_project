We retrospectively evaluated fungaemia over the period 1996 to 2001 in five university hospitals. Over 350,000 blood cultures were collected during more than 7 million days of hospitalisation. The average rate of fungaemia over the six-year period was 0.82 per 10,000 patient days (range 0.65 to 1.21 per 10,000 patient days). The proportion of bloodstream infections caused by Candida albicans remained stable throughout the study period with a mean of 53% (range 48 to 62%). This is a change from trends described in previous studies, including a survey performed in the Netherlands. This study shows a new, stable rate of fungaemia and no further signs of increasing rate of infections due to non-albicans Candida species. Susceptibility to all tested antifungal agents remained stable throughout the study period.
