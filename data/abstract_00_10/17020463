The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a critical role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and survival. Components of the mTOR pathway are activated in a variety of tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and we have found that one surprising consequence of mTOR pathway activation is resistance of GBMs to the proapoptotic effects of agents such as APO2L/TRAIL. mTOR inhibition has become feasible following the development of rapamycin and comparable analogs with improved pharmacological properties, including CCI-779, RAD001 and AP23573. Numerous studies have also demonstrated promising proapoptotic activity, with relatively mild side effects, using rapamycin analogs in vitro and in vivo in conjunction with APO2L/TRAIL. These studies suggest that mTOR inhibitors can be combined with APO2L/TRAIL as a potential tumor-selective therapy.
