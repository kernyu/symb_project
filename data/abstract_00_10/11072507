The Stichting Werkgroep Antibioticabeleid (SWAB, Foundation Antibiotics Policy Team) has issued guidelines for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in Dutch hospitals. Antibiotic prophylaxis is generally recommended for surgical procedures with relatively high postoperative infection rates and those in which consequences of infection are really serious. Studies have revealed that prophylaxis given within two hours before incision is most effective. Short-term, preferably single-dose prophylaxis, is as effective as multiple-dose prophylaxis in most procedures. For reasons of cost effectiveness and prevention of induction of resistance, single-dose prophylaxis is recommended. The antimicrobial agent of choice for perioperative prophylaxis should not be widely used as a therapeutic agent, should be selectively active against micro-organisms most frequently isolated from surgical site infections, and should have a plasma-half-life that makes single-dosing possible for most operations. Therefore cefazoline is an agent that is widely used for perioperative prophylaxis.
