Functional and structural similarities between tRNA and eukaryotic class 1 release factors (eRF1) described previously, provide evidence for the molecular mimicry concept. This concept is supported here by the demonstration of a genetic interaction between eRF1 and the decoding region of the ribosomal RNA, the site of tRNA-mRNA interaction. We show that the conditional lethality caused by a mutation in domain 1 of yeast eRF1 (P86A), that mimics the tRNA anticodon stem-loop, is rescued by compensatory mutations A1491G (rdn15) and U1495C (hyg1) in helix 44 of the decoding region and by U912C (rdn4) and G886A (rdn8) mutations in helix 27 of the 18 S rRNA. The rdn15 mutation creates a C1409-G1491 base-pair in yeast rRNA that is analogous to that in prokaryotic rRNA known to be important for high-affinity paromomycin binding to the ribosome. Indeed, rdn15 makes yeast cells extremely sensitive to paromomycin, indicating that the natural high resistance of the yeast ribosome to paromomycin is, in large part, due to the absence of the 1409-1491 base-pair. The rdn15 and hyg1 mutations also partially compensate for inactivation of the eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) resulting from the formation of the [PSI+] prion, a self-reproducible termination-deficient conformation of eRF3. However, rdn15, but not hyg1, rescues the conditional cell lethality caused by a GTPase domain mutation (R419G) in eRF3. Other antisuppressor rRNA mutations, rdn2(G517A), rdn1T(C1054T) and rdn12A(C526A), strongly inhibit [PSI+]-mediated stop codon read-through but do not cure cells of the [PSI+] prion. Interestingly, cells bearing hyg1 seem to enable [PSI+] strains to accumulate larger Sup35p aggregates upon Sup35p overproduction, suggesting a lower toxicity of overproduced Sup35p when the termination defect, caused by [PSI+], is partly relieved.
