The activities of OPT-80 against 453 intestinal bacteria were compared with those of seven other drugs. OPT-80 showed good activity against most clostridia, staphylococci, and enterococci, but streptococci, aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and Clostridium ramosum were resistant. Poor activity against anaerobic gram-negative rods may maintain colonization resistance.
