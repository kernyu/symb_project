The influence of nisin on the heat and pressure resistance of Bacillus anthracis Sterne spores was examined. The decimal reduction times (D-value) of spores in milk (2% fat) at 80, 85, and 90 degrees C were determined. In the absence of nisin, the D-values were 30.09, 9.30, and 3.86 min, respectively. The D-values of spores heated in the presence of nisin (1 mg/ml) were not significantly different (P = 0.05). However, spores heated in the presence of nisin had a 1- to 2-log reduction in viability, after which the death kinetics became similar to those of spores in the absence of nisin. The z-values all were 11.2 degrees C regardless of the presence or absence of nisin. The pressure sensitivity of B. anthracis Sterne spores in the presence and absence of nisin also was determined. Spores treated with nisin were 10 times more pressure sensitive than were spores subjected to pressure in the absence of nisin under the conditions used in this study.
