Furanocoumarins are well-known natural products that occur in the most evolved genera of Apiaceae family. This compounds were found to have cytotoxic, phytotoxic, photosensitizing, insecticidal, antibacterial and high anti-fungal effects. Aviprin is considered as a linear furanocoumarin substituted at C8 with an oxygenated prenyl residue. In this study we found that aviprin is a bioactive compound that exhibits high antibacterial, antifungal and phytotoxic activity. The compound stunted the germination of lettuce seeds with IC50 value of 0.270 mg/mL. The compound also inhibited the mycelia growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Aviprin indicated antibacterial activity against tested gram negative and positive bacteria with inhibition zone of 19-23.5 mm. Our results shown that aviprin can play an allelopatic role for plant.
