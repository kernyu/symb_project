[reaction: see text] The rapid diversification of glycopeptides via glycorandomization reveals that significantly diverse substitutions are tolerated and suggests there may be a synergistic benefit to the construction of mechanistically related natural product core scaffold fusions. This work also further highlights the utility of chemoenzymatic approaches to diversify complex natural product architectures.
