The influence of genetic modification on the decontamination process of mycobacteria was investigated using a wild type Mycobacterium bovis BCG Pasteur and its isogenic mutant strain. The result showed that the killing effect of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) progressively increased with prolonged incubation (up to 20 minutes), and the deteriorating effect of NaOH was more severe on the genetically modified strain.
