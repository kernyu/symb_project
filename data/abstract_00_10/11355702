Vitreoscilla becomes resistant to killing by hydrogen peroxide and heat shock when pretreated with nonlethal levels of hydrogen peroxide. The pretreated Vitreoscilla cells (60 microM hydrogen peroxide for 120 min) significantly increased survival of the lethal dose of 20 mM hydrogen peroxide or heat shock (22 degrees C --> 37 degrees C). This indicates the existence of an adaptive response to oxidative stress. However, cells pretreated with 60 microM hydrogen peroxide became nonresistant to a lethal dose of a menadione. This result shows that hydrogen peroxide does not induce cross-resistance to menadione in Vitreoscilla. Furthermore, Vitreoscilla treated with hydrogen peroxide, heat shock, and menadione showed a change in the protein composition, as monitored by a two-dimensional gel analysis. During adaptation to hydrogen peroxide, 12 proteins were induced. Also, 18 new proteins synthesized in response to heat shock were detected by a 2-D gel analysis. The redox-cycling agents also elicited the synthesis of 6 other proteins that were unseen with hydrogen peroxide.
