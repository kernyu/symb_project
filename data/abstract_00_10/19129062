The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) caused by both common and uncommon opportunistic fungi is increasing along with emerging fungal resistance. Since traditional agents (amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole) are limited by an inadequate spectrum of activity, drug resistance or toxicity, there is a great interest in the development of new antifungal agents for treatment of IFIs in high-risk populations. In recent years a number of systemic antifungal drugs have become available and options for treatment of IFIs have expanded. A new generation of triazole agents (voriconazole, posaconazole, isavuconazole, ravuconazole and albaconazole), with a broad spectrum of activity and sufficient improvements in potency to overcome resistance have emerged and represent an alternative to conventional antifungals for the prevention and treatment of IFIs. This article focuses on the microbiology, pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of the new antifungal triazole generation.
