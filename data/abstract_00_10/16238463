We examined the effect of leptin on the insulin resistance in skeletal muscles by measuring glucose transport. Male Wistar rats were fed rat chow or high-fat diets for 30 days. Before sacrifice, rats fed high-fat diet were subcutaneously injected with leptin (1 mg/kg b.w.) for 3 days. The glucose transport in epitrochlearis and soleus muscles did not differ in the experimental groups under basal conditions, however these values decreased significantly in the rats fed high-fat diet under insulin stimulation (p<0.01). Leptin treatment recovered the decreased glucose transport in epitrochlearis (p<0.05) and soleus muscles (p=0.08). Triglyceride concentrations in soleus muscles were increased significantly in the rats fed high-fat diet as compared to rats fed chow diet (p<0.01), and were decreased significantly by leptin treatment (p<0.01). The glucose transport was measured under basal conditions and after 60 microU/ml of insulin treatment with or without 50 ng/ml of leptin. Leptin had no direct stimulatory effect on glucose transport under both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions in vitro. These results demonstrate that leptin injection to rats fed high-fat diet recovered impaired insulin responsiveness of skeletal muscles and muscle triglyceride concentrations. However, there was no direct stimulatory effect of leptin on insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscles in vitro.
