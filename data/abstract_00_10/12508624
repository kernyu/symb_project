A total of 323 Salmonella typhi isolates (261 isolates obtained during 1995-99 from Ludhiana and 62 randomly selected isolates obtained between 1980-99 from Chandigarh) were analyzed for drug resistant pattern. S. typhi isolates prior to 1986 were sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested by disc diffusion method. Most common multidrug resistance pattern noticed was ACCo T i.e. resistance to ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and tetracycline. This study has revealed that withdrawal of chloramphenicol due to high level of resistance during 1990-94, has led to re-emergence of 43-93 percent chloramphenicol sensitive mutants during 1995-99. Two S. typhi isolates in 1995 and one in 1999 from Ludhiana depicted resistance to ciprofloxacin. Susceptibility of S. typhi isolates to third generation cephalosporins ranged between 87 to 100 per cent. There was a gradual increase with time period in mean minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin as it increased from 0.066 ug/ml for 1980-83 S. typhi isolates to 0.13 ug/ml for the 1996-99 isolates. Similarly, cefotaxime mean MIC for 1980-83 isolate was 0.172 ug/ml which further increased up to 0.32 ug/ml for S. typhi isolates encountered between 1996-99. In contrast, mean MIC value of 0.62 ug/ml of Ceftriaxone remained unchanged irrespective of the year of isolation of S. typhi isolates.
