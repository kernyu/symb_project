The overall prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) was 2% (10/590) among 590 canine specimens submitted to an Italian veterinary diagnostic laboratory during a two-month period, and 21% (10/48) among Staphylococcus intermedius group (SIG) isolates. All methicillin-resistant strains exhibited additional resistance to fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, lincosamides, tetracyclines, and potentiated sulfonamides, belonged predominantly to spa type t02 and harboured SCCmec type II-III cassette.
