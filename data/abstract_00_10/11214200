Infectious diarrhea is the most common infectious disease syndrome worldwide resulting in more than five million deaths annually. The greatest morbidity and mortality is seen among children younger than two years of age. A variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens are responsible for the various syndromes. A combination of host susceptibility and organism virulence factors is responsible for disease. Most episodes of gastroenteritis are self-limited. The hallmark of patient management is strict attention to fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Antimotility agents should be used with caution if at all in children, but may be helpful in adults with travelers' diarrhea. Antimicrobial therapy may shorten the duration of diarrhea in some illnesses, but use is restricted due to emergence of resistance or due to lack of availability in some countries. Newer strategies for prevention include vaccine development.
