The paper gives the results of studies to determine blood bacteriostatic activity (BBA) in the use of a patient's autostrain and semiliquid medium versus the clinical and laboratory parameters of the course of a process in 101 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. There is evidence for the relationship of the BBA to the sensitivity to isoniazid and the structure of drug resistance. The zero values of BBA correspond to the severest course of the disease. The efficiency of treatment is much higher in patients with high and moderate BBA. The latter's determination using the semiliquid medium permits an objective evaluation of the efficiency of chemotherapy, identification of patients with a poor prognosis, and then choice of an individual treatment regimen on day 7 after the test just before obtaining the data on drug sensitivity.
