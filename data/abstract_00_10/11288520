Treatment of mycobacterial infections differs from that of other bacterial diseases due to several properties possessed by the mycobacteria and the host. A hallmark of mycobacteria is the complex lipid-rich cell envelope that protects the organism from both the host response and antimycobacterial therapy. In addition, mycobacteria are facultative intracellular parasites which generally cause a more chronic type of disease. These properties add greater constraints to efficient therapy. To be effective, drugs must be able to penetrate the host macrophage and preferably have reduced toxicity and be effective at low doses to allow prolonged therapy. The author presents the general properties of the pathogen/host relationship in mycobacterial infections, in addition to the therapeutic choices available and the mechanisms of action involved in treatment. The evolution of technology for antimycobacterial therapy is illustrated by a discussion of new strategies being developed for the treatment of mycobacterial infections.
