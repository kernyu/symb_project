The locus RTM1 is necessary for restriction of long-distance movement of tobacco etch virus in Arabidopsis thaliana without causing a hypersensitive response or inducing systemic acquired resistance. The RTM1 gene was isolated by map-based cloning. The deduced gene product is similar to the alpha-chain of the Artocarpus integrifolia lectin, jacalin, and to several proteins that contain multiple repeats of a jacalin-like sequence. These proteins comprise a family with members containing modular organizations of one or more jacalin repeat units and are implicated in defense against viruses, fungi, and insects.
