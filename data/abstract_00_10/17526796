While the potential emergence of food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria with resistance to lantibiotics is a concern, the creation of derivatives of starter cultures and adjuncts that can grow in the presence of these antimicrobials may have applications in food fermentations. Here a bank of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 mutants was created and screened, and a number of novel genetic loci involved in lantibiotic resistance were identified.
