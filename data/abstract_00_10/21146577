This study was performed to evaluate the beneficial effect of Undaria pinnatifida ethanol extract (UEFx) on insulin resistance in diet-induced obese mice. A high-fat diet was supplemented with the UEFx at 0.69% (wt/wt) dose, which contains an equivalent amount of 0.02% fucoxanthin (wt/wt), or with Fx at 0.02% (wt/wt) dose in diet. After 9 weeks, both UEFx supplement significantly lowered the amount of visceral fat, the size of adipocyte, the fasting blood glucose concentration, the plasma insulin and the insulin resistance index similar to pure as shown by Fx supplement, compared to the high-fat (HF) control group. Blood glucose level was negatively correlated with hepatic glucokinase activity (r = -0.533, p < 0.05), whereas positively correlated with hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme activities (r = 0.463, p < 0.05 for glucose-6-phosphatase; r = 0.457, p < 0.05 for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase). Ratio of hepatic glucokinase/glucose-6-phosphatase and glycogen content were significantly elevated by the UEFx and Fx supplements. Supplementation of the UEFx as well as Fx seemed to stimulate the beta-oxidation activity and inhibit the phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity resulting in a decrease in the hepatic lipid droplet accumulation. The results indicate that the UEFx can prevent insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation that is partly mediated by modulating the hepatic glucose and lipid homeostasis in the high fat-induced obese mice.
