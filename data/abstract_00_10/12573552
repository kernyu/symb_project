There is little published data detailing fluoroquinolone resistance in clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. The purpose of this study was to characterize the resistance mechanisms of 34 fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae clinical isolates obtained from medical centers in 8 of 10 Canadian provinces between 1997 and 2000. The quinolone resistance determining regions of gyrA, parC, and parE from the isolates were sequenced. The isolates were evaluated for reserpine-sensitive efflux of ciprofloxacin and the new fluoroquinolones: gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The isolates were typed using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The majority of the isolates were genetically unrelated. Lower level fluoroquinolone resistance (ciprofloxacin MIC 4-8 microg/ml) was associated with amino acid substitutions in ParC, while higher level resistance (ciprofloxacin MIC > or = 16 microg/ml) was associated with amino acid substitutions in both ParC and GyrA. ParE substitutions were not associated with clinical resistance. Twelve of 34 (35%) isolates demonstrated reserpine-sensitive efflux of ciprofloxacin. Efflux alone conferred low level ciprofloxacin resistance in 3 isolates. Significant reserpine-sensitive efflux of the new fluoroquinolones was not observed.
