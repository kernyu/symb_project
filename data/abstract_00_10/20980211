Agents that specifically target the replication cycle of the virus direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) by directly inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease, the NS5B polymerase and NS5A are currently in clinical development. The need to achieve serum drug concentrations able to suppress viral replication is a key factor for a successful antiviral therapy and the prevention of resistance. Thus pharmacokinetics parameters became important issues for drugs used in the therapy of hepatitis C. The ratio of C(min)/IC(50) (inhibitory quotient or IQ) can provide a surrogate measure of a drug's ability to suppress HCV replication, by taking into account the relationship between plasma drug levels and viral susceptibility to the drug. Ritonavir boosting may be a useful strategy to improve pharmacokinetic parameters. Characterising resistance to DAAs in clinical trials is essential for the management of a drug regimen to reduce the development of resistance and thereby maximise SVR rate. The lesson of HIV therapy, provide a compelling case for the exploration of combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents.
