Three major North American surveillance programs have tracked antimicrobial resistance patterns among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other common respiratory tract pathogens. The Canadian Bacterial Surveillance Network shows the progressive increase in resistance among pneumococcal S. pneumoniae to penicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. The data from the Tracking Resistance in the United States Today study also show a steady rise in pneumococcal resistance among common antibiotics as well as an increase in multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae. The US component of the Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin study has detected increasing resistance to many antimicrobial agents among common respiratory isolates, with marked geographic variations in resistance patterns. The patterns of resistance detected by these major surveillance programs are a warning signal regarding the continued emergence of resistance among community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens.
