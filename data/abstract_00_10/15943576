The HIVNET 012 trial in Uganda demonstrated that a regimen of single-dose nevirapine (NVP) can prevent HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission. Previous studies show that HIV-1 with one or more NVP resistance (NVPR) mutations can be selected in many women as early as 7 days after single-dose NVP. We evaluated the genetic linkage of NVPR mutations in plasma from women in HIVNET 012 collected 7 days after single-dose NVP administration. The HIV-1 pol region was amplified and cloned from 20 plasma samples (16 with NVPR mutations detected by population sequencing and 4 with no NVPR mutations detected), and 10 clones from each sample were sequenced. Up to five different NVPR mutations were detected in clones from a single sample. K103N and Y181C were the most common mutations detected. Clones with two genetically linked mutations were detected in four samples. Different combinations of NVPR mutations were linked in individual clones, but none of the clones contained both K103N and Y181C. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether selection of minority variants with one or more NVPR mutations after single-dose NVP is clinically relevant.
