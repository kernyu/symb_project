A simple and highly efficient rice transformation system was established based on the studying of factors influencing the Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation. Embryogenic calli derived from mature embryos were infected and cocultivated with A. tumefaciens EHA101 harboring binary vectors: pHQ9, pHQ10, pHQT3. The highest transformation frequency was about 100 hygromycin resistance calli per gram of calli explants, and above 85% of these calli could be regenerated into plants. The putative transgenic plants were confirmed by GUS assay and southern-blot analysis. Hygromycin resistance tests indicated that the segregation of transgene in T1 progeny corresponded to the Mendelian ratio, 3:1. This system will benefit the functional genomic study of rice by using T-DNA insertion mutagenesis and gene targeting.
