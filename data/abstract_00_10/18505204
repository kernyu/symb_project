Salmonella spp. (n = 468), isolated from the feces of sows, nursery, and grow-finish pigs in 20 farrow-to-finish herds in Alberta and Saskatchewan, were tested for susceptibility to 16 antimicrobials. No resistance was identified to amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin or nalidixic acid, and less than 1% of the isolates were resistant to cefoxitin and gentamicin. Isolates were most commonly resistant to tetracycline (35%) and sulfamethoxazole (27%). Overall, 59% of the Salmonella were susceptible to all 16 drugs (pansusceptible). Isolates from sows were more likely to be pansusceptible than isolates from nursery or grow-finish pigs. Resistance to 2 or more drugs occurred in 29% of the isolates and was significantly more likely to occur in Salmonella from nursery pigs than from sows. The odds of resistance to 4 of the drugs, streptomycin, ampicillin, kanamycin and cephalothin, were significantly higher in isolates from nursery pigs than grow-finish pigs, while the odds of resistance to 2 drugs, tetracycline and streptomycin, were higher in Salmonella from nursery pigs than from sows. More age-specific risk factor studies are needed to investigate these differences between production phases.
