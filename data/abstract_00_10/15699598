A total of 27 clinical isolates of Mannheimia haemolytica from cattle in Japan from 2001 to 2002 were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 25 different antimicrobials were determined by an agar dilution method according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Of the 27 isolates, seven isolates (26.9%) were resistant to at least one of the 25 drugs and resistance rates ranged from 3.7 to 18.5%. Resistance rates to dihydrostreptomycin (18.5%), oxytetracycline (11.1%), and doxycycline (11.1%) were relatively high and those to the remaining drugs were less than 10%.
