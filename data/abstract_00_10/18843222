In response to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, leading to increasing bacterial resistance and the decreasing development of new antibiotics, the Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (an independent, interdisciplinary panel of healthcare professionals established to advocate the appropriate use of antibiotics) has developed criteria to guide proper antibiotic selection. These criteria include: establishment of a need to justify use of antibiotics (e.g., colonization versus disease); evidence-based results; therapeutic benefits; safety; use of pharmacodynamic indices for optimal drug and optimal duration; cost-effectiveness. Promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics should provide for optimal outcomes for our patients.
