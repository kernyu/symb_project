After careful review of evidence-based literature, clinical and laboratory criteria for diagnosis of bacterial and fungal endocarditis are examined. The choice criteria for therapy of bacterial endocarditis, both empiric and directed against a specific pathogen, are reviewed, on the basis of the clinical and epidemiological context (prosthetic or native valve, left or right heart, drug addiction). Different treatment options are proposed, based on results of antibiotic resistance testing. Indications and contraindications for a parenteral home treatment and those for surgical treatment are examined, also according to the results of ultrasonography.
