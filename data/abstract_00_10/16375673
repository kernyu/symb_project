The increasing incidence of fungal infections combined with the emerging problem of antifungal drug resistance have prompted investigations of the mode of action of the currently used antifungal therapeutics (antimycotics). The routinely used antimycotics can be grouped into six different classes based on their mode of action. In this review, the mode of action and antifungal spectrum of these classes are discussed, together with possible resistance development against them.
