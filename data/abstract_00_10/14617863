By alkylation of hexamethylenetetramine with halogenated derivatives of ketones, ethers, esters or amides of acids, alkyl- and aralkyl halides the corresponding N-monoalkylated compounds of hexamethylenetetramine were obtained. The quaternization of pyridine nitrogen in 5,6-benzoquinoline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, quinoline, 1,10-phenanthroline molecules with alkyl- or aralkylhalides was carried out. The susceptibility of Gram-positive (Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli, Salmonella cholerae suis, Salmonella enteridis Gartneri) microorganisms to synthesized quaternary ammonium salts by disc difussion method has been detected. The bacteriostatic action of 0.5-1% solutions of all compounds was assessed in comparison with benzalkonium chloride. It was shown, that the most effectiveness against all strains is possessed by quaternary hexamethylenetetramine ammonium salts, and especially salts, containing 1-propynyl- or hydroxycarbamoylmethyl radicals. The action of these two compounds against Salmonella and Streptococcus was stronger than the action of benzalkonium chloride. Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to these compounds were detected. It was shown, that 1% solutions of chlorides of N-(1-propynyl) hexamethylenetetramonium and N-(hydroxycarbamoylmethyl) hexamethylenetetrammonium demonstrate the same bacteriostatic action against P. aeruginosa as well as benzalkonium chloride.
