AIMS: To determine the genetic determinants responsible for tetracycline resistance in oxytetracycline resistant bacteria from aquaculture sources in Australia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty of 104 (19%) isolates tested were resistant to oxytetracycline (MIC > or = 16 microg ml(-1)). Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, one or more tet genes were detected in 15/20 (75%) isolates tested, but none were found in 5/20 (25%). tetM (50%) was the most common determinant, followed by tetE (45%), tetA (35%) and tetD (15%). Five of 12 oxytetracycline resistant isolates studied were able to transfer their R-plasmid to Escherichia coli recipients of chicken, pig and human origin. tetA, tetD and tetM were found to be transferred while tetE was not transferred. Southern hybridization and PCR were used to confirm transfer of determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial isolates from aquaculture sources in Australia harbour a variety of tetracycline resistance genes, which can be transferred to other bacteria of different origin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacteria from aquaculture sources in Australia contribute to the resistance gene pool reservoir. The in vitro transfer of tetracycline R-plasmid from aquatic bacteria to E. coli isolates from various sources is an indication of the potential public health risk associated with these resistance determinants.
