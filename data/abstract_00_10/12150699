Over the past decade many well-tried chemotherapeutic agents have lost their effectiveness. This is due to a phenomenon referred to as multi-drug resistance. The most likely cause of multi-drug resistance is an increase in the activity of an efflux pump mediated through the actions of a P-glycoprotein. There is a continuing search, not only for new chemotherapeutic agents, but also for agents that can reverse the acquired resistance to existing agents.
