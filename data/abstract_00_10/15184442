PCR primers specific for the recently described antimicrobial resistance-associated Escherichia coli clonal group A (CGA), a widespread cause of drug-resistant urinary tract infections in the United States, were devised on the basis of a novel single-nucleotide polymorphism identified within the housekeeping gene fumC, i.e., C288T. In comparison with two reference PCR-based fingerprinting methods, ERIC2 PCR and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, a PCR assay incorporating the new primers provided 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the detection of CGA among 138 diverse clinical and reference E. coli isolates. E. coli reference (ECOR) strain 47 was shown to be a member or a close relative of CGA (by ERIC2 PCR and RAPD analysis, respectively) and yielded a positive assay result. The new CGA-specific PCR assay, which exhibited interlaboratory reproducibility and stability under various experimental conditions, should allow the rapid and specific detection of CGA by any laboratory equipped for diagnostic PCR.
