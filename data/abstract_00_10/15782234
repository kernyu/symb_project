In the production of the Spanish traditional blue-veined Cabrales cheese, lactic acid bacteria strains free of antibiotic resistance that have a transferrable capacity are necessary as components of a specific starter. To select for these bacteria, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12 antibiotics and 2 mixtures (containing beta-lactamase inhibitor and penicillin) were determined by microbroth and agar dilution techniques in 146 strains belonging to the genera Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and Leuconostoc. The antibiotic-resistance profiles of Lactococcus and Enterococcus species were different from those of Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc, but clear genus- or species-associated patterns were not observed. Cefoxitin and metronidazole were not effective against bacteria of these genera. The MICs of beta-lactam antibiotics for lactobacilli and leuconostoc isolates were higher than those for lactococci and enterococci, but no strain was clinically resistant. All lactobacilli and leuconostoc isolates were resistant to high levels of vancomycin, a type of resistance not seen among the tested members of the genera Lactococcus and Enterococcus. The majority of the observed resistance appeared to be either intrinsic or nonspecific, although some strains of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. were resistant to antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline.
