We have evaluated two simple, rapid and low-cost colorimetric methods for the detection of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A total of 151 M. tuberculosis strains were tested for resistance to rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid by resazurin microplate assay (REMA) and nitrate reductase assay (NRA) in comparison with the conventional proportion method (PM) on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. A complete agreement was found between NRA and PM, while one false RMP-susceptible result was found by REMA. REMA and NRA tests are rapid and inexpensive, and could be good alternatives to the conventional PM in low-resource countries.
