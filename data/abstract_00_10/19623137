The present study was done to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from different clinical specimens and healthy controls in the department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College from July, 2007 to June, 2008. A total of 62 Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from 230 specimens. Among them 32(23%) S. epidermidis were isolated from 200 cases and 30(100%) were isolated from 30 healthy controls. Antimicrobial susceptibility test of the isolates was carried out by disk diffusion method as per recommendation of Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute, 2007. Isolates of S. epidermidis from cases showed multidrug resistance as follows-penicillin 94%, oxacillin 56%, gentamycin 44%, erythromycin 41%, doxycycline 37%, cephradine 34%, ciprofloxacin 28%, ceftriaxone 28%, fusidic acid 22% and cefuroxime 19%. On the other hand, isolates of S. epidermidis from controls were susceptible to all antibiotics except penicillin, which was only 10% resistant. A remarkable difference was observed in the resistance pattern of S. epidermidis isolated from cases and healthy controls. However in our study no isolates of S. epidermidis was resistant to rifampicin and vancomycin, which can be used as last line of drugs to treat nosocomial S. epidermidis infection.
