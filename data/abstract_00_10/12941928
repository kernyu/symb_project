The gamma(1)34.5 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) functions to block the shutoff of protein synthesis involving double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). In this process, the gamma(1)34.5 protein recruits cellular protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to form a high-molecular-weight complex that dephosphorylates eIF-2alpha. Here we show that the gamma(1)34.5 protein is capable of mediating eIF-2alpha dephosphorylation without any other viral proteins. While deletion of amino acids 1 to 52 from the gamma(1)34.5 protein has no effect on eIF-2alpha dephosphorylation, further truncations up to amino acid 146 dramatically reduce the activity of the gamma(1)34.5 protein. An additional truncation up to amino acid 188 is deleterious, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal domain alone is not functional. Like wild-type HSV-1, the gamma(1)34.5 mutant with a truncation of amino acids 1 to 52 is resistant to interferon, and resistance to interferon is coupled to eIF-2alpha dephosphorylation. Intriguingly, this mutant exhibits a similar growth defect seen for the gamma(1)34.5 null mutant in infected cells. Restoration of the wild-type gamma(1)34.5 gene in the recombinant completely reverses the phenotype. These results indicate that eIF-2alpha dephosphorylation mediated by the gamma(1)34.5 protein is required for HSV response to interferon but is not sufficient for viral replication. Additional functions or activities of the gamma(1)34.5 protein contribute to efficient viral infection.
