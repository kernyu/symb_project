Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an emerging infection of the twenty-first century. This chronic Infection is mainly caused by bacteria, although fungi can also be associated with it. It is Important to know the profile of bacteria causing IE in a given region so as to suggest the empirical therapy for this serious illness. Blood culture isolates of clinically diagnosed or suspected cases of IE admitted to various wards of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences were analyzed retrospectively from January 2000 to June 2004. Standard techniques were used for the isolation and identification of the bacteria. Our study has demonstrated the predominance of Gram-negative bacilli, especially, Acinetobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are notorious for antimicrobial resistance, as the aetiological agents of IE. Amongst Gram-positive cocci, Enterococci exhibiting HLAR comprised the predominant species. Methicillin resistance among staphylococcal strains in this Tertiary care hospital is adding to the therapeutic challenge in the management of this serious illness. Although antimicrobial treatment should not be delayed in such cases, we cannot undermine the importance of isolation and identification of the etiological agents and the determination of the antimicrobial susceptibility for the management of these life-threatening conditions as well as for the formulation of guidelines for empirical therapy of these cases.
