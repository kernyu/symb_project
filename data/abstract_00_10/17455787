Transition from exponential phase of growth to stationary phase in Streptomyces aureofaciens is characterized by a decrease in the rate of translation and induction of tetracycline (Ttc) biosynthesis. In exponential phase, no significant changes were found in the activity of ribosomes at binding of ternary complex Phe-tRNA.EF-Tu.GTP to the A-site on ribosomes. Overexpression of Ttc in stationary phase is accompanied by a decrease in the binding of the ternary complex Phe-tRNA.EF-Tu.GTP to the A-site of ribosome and a formation of an aggregate with Ttc by part of the ribosomes. Antibiotics that cause ribosome to stall or pause could increase the requirement for tmRNA in the process called trans-translation. We found differences in the level of tmRNA during the development of S. aureofaciens. Subinhibitory concentrations of Ttc, streptomycin and chloramphenicol induced an increase in the tmRNA level in cells from the exponential phase of growth. In vitro trans-translation system of S. aureofaciens was sensitive to Ttc at a concentration of > 15 micromol/L; the trans-translation system can thus be considered to contribute to resistance against Ttc produced only at sublethal concentrations. These experiments suggest that the main role of the rising tmRNA level at the beginning of the Ttc production is connected with ribosome rescue.
