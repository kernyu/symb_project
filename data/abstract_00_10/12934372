OBJECTIVE: To investigate the infectious distribution and resistant of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydia trachomatis in the chronic prostatitis. METHODS: The identification and susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeaes and Mycoplasmas were detected by a cultural method. The nitrocefin test was used to detect the beta-lactamase in Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. Chlamydia trachomatis was identificated by a monoclonal gold labeled antibody method. RESULTS: A total of 2,900 prostatic fluids were detected and the rates of isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydia trachomatis were 3.3%, 12.8%, and 0.9%, respectively. The prevalence of beta-lactamase in Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains was 12.6%. The resistant percentages of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains were 73.7% to penicillin and 91.6% to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin respectively, but the susceptibility to spectinomycin, cephalosporin and cefoxitin was good. The resistant rates of Mycoplasma to tetracycline, acetylspiramycin, erythromycin, and ofloxacin were 50.0% or more, but the susceptibilities to roxithromycin, doxycyclin, levofloxacin, minocyclin, josamycin, and azithromycin were about 70.0%-80.0%. CONCLUSION: The isolation rate of Mycoplasma is higher than that of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in the chronic prostatitis. It is important to detect the susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma for the use of antibiotics in reason.
