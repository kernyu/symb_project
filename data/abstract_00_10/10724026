Isolates of 390 Staphylococcus aureus were tested against 13 different antibiotics by a disc diffusion method as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Strains were isolated from blood (5.7%), cerebrospinal fluid (0.5%), respiratory tract (11.8%), pus and wound (73.3%), urine (1.8%), genital specimens (1.0%) and other specimens (4.3%). Only 4.6% of the isolates were fully susceptible to all the drugs tested. Resistance to penicillin was 94.1%, methicillin, 39.7%, chloramphenicol, 8.5%, ciprofloxacin, 29.2%, clindamycin, 2.1%, erythromycin, 45.9% gentamicin, 40.5%; rifampicin, 3.3% tetracycline, 47.2%, co-trimoxazole, 38.5%, mupirocin, 2.8%, fusidic acid, 3.6%. None of the isolates was resistant to vancomycin. The susceptibility of methicillin-resistant strains to erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin was low, while clindamycin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, and rifampicin remained active.
