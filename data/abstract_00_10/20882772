Beta-lactam antibiotics remain the drugs of choice for treatment of S. pneumoniae infections in spite of growing level of resistance. The formation of S. pneumoniae resistance to these drugs is mediated by modifications of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), the targets of the antibiotic action. A new approach to detection of mutations in PBP1A, 2B and 2X genes based on minisequencing reaction followed by MALDI-ToF (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight) mass spectrometry was developed in this study. The evaluation of these mutations prevalence in clinical S. pneumoniae isolates (n = 194) with different susceptibility level to beta-lactam antibiotics was performed. Twenty-four different combinations of mutations in PBPs (genotypes) were detected. All isolates susceptible to penicillin (n = 49, MIC > or = 0.06 > or = gamma/ml) carried no mutations in all analyzed loci. For 145 S. pneumoniae isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MIC > 0.06 > or = gamma/ml) the mutations in PBPs were detected in 133 (91.7 %) cases that testify to high diagnostic sensitivity of such approach. The isolates with MIC > or = 4 > or = gamma/ml (n = 20) carried multiple mutations in all analyzed genes that confirms cumulative effects of penicillin resistance formation. However, it was not possible to associate observed mutations in PBPs genes with decrease of susceptibility to cefotaxime that allows suggesting the entire difference in molecular mechanisms of formation of resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins. The offered method of S. pneumoniae genotyping is suitable for susceptibility testing to penicillin of individual isolates and for molecular monitoring of the resistance determinants in population.
