The alarming spread of multiple drug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, combined with the frequent occurrence of S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis in biofilm-type infections, indicates a growing need for new therapies. The experimental steroidal amide anprocide [3beta-acetoxy-17beta-(l-prolyl)amino-5alpha-androstane] significantly reduced c.f.u. ml(-1) per suture (P <0.0001) in a murine model of topical S. aureus infection. In chequerboard assays with planktonic-grown S. aureus and S. epidermidis, anprocide was synergistic with bacitracin, oxacillin, clindamycin or ceftriaxone. Anprocide was also synergistic in combination with bacitracin or oxacillin against some isolates of biofilm-grown S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
