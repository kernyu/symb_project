An ethanol extract of the Peruvian plant Clavija procera, a member of the rare Theophrastaceae family, was fractionated using a colorimetric bioassay-guided protocol against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), yielding the oleanane triterpenoid aegicerin (1) as the active constituent. Its MIC values ranged between 1.6 and 3.12 microg/mL against 37 different sensitive and resistant MTB strains (1 H37Rv, 21 susceptible clinical isolates, 2 INH-resistant clinical isolates, and 13 MDR clinical isolates).
