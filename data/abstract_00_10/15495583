Tuberculosis (TB) remains the main infectious cause of deaths in the world. Due to the slow metabolism of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the isolation, identification and drug susceptibility testing requires several weeks. New techniques have improved specificity, turnaround time and cost effectiveness. Although these methods yield results within hours from sample collection, the clinical significance of each positive result requires rigorous evaluation in most cases. Herein the advantages and disadvantages of the most promising molecular techniques for detection of TB and drug resistance are discussed.
