BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause a wide variety of illnesses. Primate animals can be infected by the pneumococcus. A disease occurred among rhesus monkeys in winter 2006. METHODS: Routine clinical observation, necropsies, bacteriological examinations were conducted, and PCR, pathogenicity to BALB/c mice and antibiotic susceptibility test were examined additionally. RESULTS: We conclude that the agent is S. pneumoniae. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility test, a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight daily of Erythromycin was given intramuscular injection for 5 days, resulting in the disappearance of clinical signs, and no newly case reappear be observed till today. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, it is suggested that the outbreak of respiratory disease in the rhesus monkeys was because of transmission of S. pneumoniae among rhesus monkeys. The antibiotic therapy finding underscores the utility of Erythromycin to cure the infected rhesus monkeys without causing side effects and without contributing to the further development of antibiotic resistance.
