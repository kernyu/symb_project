The relentless emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance warrant an increased awareness of the problem and improved coordination and standardisation of surveillance systems, as well as resistance control strategies. Moreover, this underscores the urgent need for new antibiotics active against the emerging resistant pathogens. Ceftobiprole is a new beta-lactam molecule engineered for bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci that also exhibits an extended broad spectrum of activity covering the most clinically important Gram-positive (methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, penicillin-susceptible and -resistant pneumococci, other streptococci and ampicillin-susceptible enterococci) and Gram-negative (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus spp. and Moraxella spp.) pathogens. Results from studies with experimental infections and from clinical trials support a role for ceftobiprole in treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and suggest a potential role for this drug in treating other types of serious infection caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
