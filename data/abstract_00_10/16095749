AIMS AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine whether antibiotics are used for self-medication in southern Spain, a region belonging to European Union. The data were collected by a survey in the Costa del Sol region, Spain during 2002 by using a convenience sample of 1000 Finns living permanently in the area (response rate 53%, n=530). RESULTS: Antibiotics were used by 28% of the respondents during the previous 6 months before the query. Of the antibiotic users, 41% had bought their antibiotics without a prescription. Clearly the most common indication for antibiotic use was common cold, with almost half (45%) of the antibiotic users reporting it as purpose of medication, followed by sore throat (17%). The number of courses did not differ between prescription and non-prescription antibiotic users, most (64%) of the users having used one course. Neither did the groups differ according to background variables used, including the frequency of experiencing adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Unnecessary and unrational self-medication with antibiotics seems to be common in southern Spain among Finnish immigrants. This may indicate that Spanish health care system, including community pharmacies are failing their task in enhancing rational use of medicines. It is important that all the member countries within EU will take their responsibility in promoting public health goals in their national policy, e.g., in minimising the antibiotic resistance for expanding.
