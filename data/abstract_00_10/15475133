Overuse of antibiotics and failure to apply basic infection control policies and procedures have contributed to the increasing multi-drug resistance of many nosocomial pathogens. The alarming increase of multi-drug-resistant bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicilin-resistant Staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci) causes infected wounds associated with high mortality and morbidity in burned patients and focuses attention on the need for better treatment and prevention of wound infections. The review points out and discusses some emerging alternatives to antibiotics used in clinical practice, with special emphasis on the role of the innate immune response and potential application of human host defense peptides in thermal injury.
