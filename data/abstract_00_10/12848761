Cases of fluconazole-resistant Cryptococcus neoformans have been reported in AIDS patients previously treated with fluconazole. We report a case of fluconazole-resistant cryptococcal meningitis in an HIV-negative patient not previously exposed to fluconazole. The patient experienced a clinical relapse after discontinuation of therapy with amphotericin B and subsequent initiation of fluconazole therapy. In vitro resistance was initially verified by Etest and tablet diffusion and later confirmed by NCCLS broth microdilution.
