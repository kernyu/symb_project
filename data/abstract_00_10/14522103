Salmonella spp. are significant bloodstream pathogens and are routinely monitored for antimicrobial resistance by the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Six hundred and one bloodstream infection (BSI) isolates of Salmonella spp., collected over a 5-year period (1997-2001) were tested for their susceptibility against 20 antimicrobial agents, comparing year and geographical region. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi was the most frequently identified 'species' (43% of identified strains), although 'unspeciated' strains predominated overall (54.2%). The rank order for six selected drugs tested by their MIC(90) values and percentage susceptibility was: ceftriaxone (< or =0.25 mg/l; 99.5% susceptible)>ciprofloxacin (0.12 mg/l; 99.3%)> trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (< or =0.5 mg/l; 92.7%)>amoxycillin/clavulanate (16 mg/l; 89.7%)>ampicillin (>16 mg/l; 81.0%)>tetracycline (>8 mg/l; 79.4%). Most isolates remained highly susceptible to all 20 agents examined, with the exception of Salmonella Typhimurium (only 35.3% susceptible to tetracycline, 41.2% to ampicillin, and 61.8% to amoxycillin/clavulanate). DT104 resistance phenotypes were noted in 3.4 and nearly 60.0% of unspeciated Salmonella and S. Typhimurium, respectively. Unexpectedly, the highest overall susceptibility rates were recorded in Latin America. Fluoroquinolone resistance was observed and nalidixic acid screening MICs (< or =8 mg/l) predicted full susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Five-year results from the SENTRY Program show no clear trend toward greater resistances in Salmonella spp. BSIs for the commonly used antimicrobial classes. With the exception of S. Typhimurium DT104, most Salmonella spp. remain highly susceptible to the tested antimicrobials that maybe utilized for Salmonella BSI.
