Newborns are very susceptible to infections because their immune systems are not fully developed and react to antigen exposure preferentially with unresponsiveness. UV-inactivated herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) represents such an antigen and does not induce an immune response in neonates. In contrast, protective T cells were primed in newborn mice by a single replicative cycle of DISC HSV-1 given once within 24 h of birth. Each of the HSV-1-primed CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells induced in wild-type or interferon-deficient mice conferred resistance to naive animals exposed to a lethal virus challenge. Inactivated HSV-1, injected at variable doses up to 10(4) times that of DISC HSV-1, was ineffective in inducing any detectable immune responses in neonates. Thus, the capacity of HSV-1 to replicate once, but not the number of virus particles per se, was decisive in inducing protective T-cell-associated immunity in newborn mice.
