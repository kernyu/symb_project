The research on the use of pharmaco-therapeutic/pharmacoeconomic guidelines in therapy of bacterial infections was carried out in all patients hospitalized at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases of the Clinical Center of Vojvodina in a three-month period. The overall antibiotic utilization in therapy of bacterial infections was determined. The total cost of all administered antibiotics was calculated as well as the defined daily dose/100 patient-days. The structure of bacterial causes and their resistance to standard antimicrobial therapy was established for all isolated strains. The results of bacterial resistance surveillance were the basis to lay down the guidelines for initial adequate antimicrobial therapy (according to the site of infection and pathogen), in view of resistance maps for bacterial strains isolated from the tested materials. The guidelines for choosing appropriate antibiotic therapy were based on pharmaco-therapeutic/pharmacoeconomic principles, taking into account the state of bacterial resistance, drug administration schedule, and lowest therapy cost. During the implementation of guidelines for appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy, large therapy cost savings of 1.275.576.9 dinars (33.9%.) were recorded, compared to the period before the implementation of the guidelines.
