Antipneumococcal activity of BMS 284756 was compared to those of six agents by MIC and time-kill methodologies. BMS 284756 had the lowest MICs compared to those of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin against quinolone-susceptible (< or =0.016 to 0.06 microg/ml) and quinolone-resistant (0.03 to 1 microg/ml) pneumococci. BMS 284756 was bactericidal against 11 of 12 strains at two times the MIC after 24 h.
