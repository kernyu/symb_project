In order to assess the molecular epidemiology of 40 previously identified extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, gene sequencing was performed. While the previous examination of these isolates revealed one TEM producer, the sequencing procedure performed in this study identified 13 additional TEM producers, and all of the sequenced genes reflected production of nonESBL TEM-1. All 38 suspected SHV producers were confirmed to be carriers of blaSHV-ESBL genes using the PCR/Nhel test and sequencing. Among them, types SHV-2, SHV-5, and SHV-12 were found in 20, 10, and 7 isolates, respectively, and SHV-2a was identified in 1. SHV-5 and SHV-12 conferred higher resistance to ceftazidime and cefepime, while SHV-2 and SHV-2a raised the minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime and cefpirome. Fourth-generation cephalosporins were found to be more active against the isolates than third-generation cephalosporins.
