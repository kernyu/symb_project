A surveillance study was performed on the pattern and antimicrobial susceptibilities of microorganisms isolated from blood cultures in the main pediatric oncology unit in the United Arab Emirates. The only previous data were published in 1995. During 1998-2000, the pattern of bloodstream infection changed. Enterobacter spp. and Enterococcus spp. emerged as frequent pathogens, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa became less common. There was a high incidence (65/198) of polymicrobial bacteremia not previously reported. This study highlights the need for continuous surveillance of the pattern of bloodstream infection in pediatric oncology patients so that changes may be detected and antimicrobial treatment modified appropriately.
