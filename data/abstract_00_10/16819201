We investigated Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) contamination on the surface of working tables in ward staff centers and the effects of disinfection by wiping with 80% (v/v) ethyl alcohol on this contamination. When working tables were not regularly disinfected or washed, S. aureus [methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and/or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)] was detected in 29 (51.8%) of 56 tables in 6 wards investigated. MRSA was detected in 17 (30.4%) of 56 tables and in all investigated wards. The S. aureus contamination density on the entire surface of the S. aureus-contaminated tables was 2081+/-8915 (mean+/-S.D.) colony-forming units (cfu) (n=29, range, 10-4.8x10(4) cfu), and the MRSA contamination density on the entire surface of the MRSA-contaminated tables was 158+/-200 cfu (n=17, range, 10-7.4x10(2) cfu). The second investigation was performed immediately after working tables not regularly disinfected or washed were disinfected by wiping once with 80% (v/v) ethyl alcohol, and MRSA was detected in 5 (8.9%) of 56 tables. The contamination density on the entire surface of the MRSA-contaminated tables was 36+/-30 cfu (n=5, range, 10-80 cfu). The third investigation was performed immediately after working tables not regularly disinfected or washed were disinfected by wiping with 80% (v/v) ethyl alcohol twice with a 1-min interval, and no S. aureus contamination was observed in any of 56 tables. These results suggest that disinfection by wiping once with 80% (v/v) ethyl alcohol could not completely eliminate MRSA in particulates. For the disinfection of the MRSA-contaminated surface of working tables and the removal of particulates, regular disinfection by wiping with 80% (v/v) ethyl alcohol is necessary.
