The post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) on susceptible and erythromycin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (M phenotype and inducibly resistant) of rokitamycin and erythromycin were investigated in vitro using microbiological impedance measurement. Exposure of susceptible S. pyogenes strains to 1/4, 1/2, 1 and 2 MIC erythromycin and rokitamycin resulted in PAEs of rokitamycin in the same order of magnitude as those of erythromycin and that were dose dependent. The duration of rokitamycin PAEs in erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes strains (M phenotype and those with inducible resistance) were comparable with those observed in susceptible strains. This was not the case for erythromycin. The investigation showed that a 16-membered ring macrolide such as rokitamycin has different PAEs from those of a 14-membered ring macrolide such as erythromycin. They also indicated that, as the PAEs of rokitamycin on the M phenotype and inducible resistant strains were comparable with those on susceptible strains, no re-evaluation of therapeutic dosing regimens was required.
