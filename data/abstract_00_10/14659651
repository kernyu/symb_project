The activity of nine peptide deformylase (PDF) inhibitors undergoing clinical evaluation were compared with co-amoxiclav, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, erythromycin and telithromycin against a range of respiratory and skin pathogens (n=166). The PDF inhibitor showed good activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moxarella catarrhalis, Group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus irrespective of beta-lactam or fluoroquinolone susceptibility. Against Haemophilus influenzae, MIC(90) values were generally higher. BB-88488 was the most active compound. Overall these data suggest that PDF inhibitors are an interesting new class of antimicrobial worthy of further investigation in the treatment of respiratory tract and skin infections.
