This guideline, developed by the Office International des Epizooties for the monitoring of the quantities of antimicrobials used in animal husbandry, provides the methodology required to assess the amounts of antimicrobials used, to supply data to be used for risk analysis and to improve guidance on the appropriate use of antimicrobials. Information may be gathered from a number of sources, such as the competent authorities, industry and users. The usefulness of different types of information is discussed and recommendations are given on how to collect detailed information, each year, on the antimicrobial quantities used per class and active substance. Information should also be collected on the route of administration (oral and parenteral) and the animal species.
