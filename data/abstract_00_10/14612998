Leishmania is a protozoan parasite responsible for considerable morbidity worldwide. The pathologies caused by Leishmania infections are varying with the species. The ongoing determination of the Leishmania major genome sequence represents a milestone for Leishmania research. We discuss here the use of transcriptomics and proteomics to accelerate our understanding of key processes related to Leishmania biology. These two techniques should be useful to find genes and proteins that are expressed in a stage-specific manner and examples of the use of such techniques are provided. Both approaches will complement each others. Indeed, while a number of stage-specific genes have increased stable RNA levels, an even larger subset of the Leishmania amastigote genes are regulated at the level of translation. The availability of the Leishmania genome should also permit important advances in finding species-specific genes that could explain different pathologies. Functional genomic and proteomic approaches should also be useful for understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance in the parasite. The availability of both the Leishmania genome and of its human host or of the mouse animal model will facilitate large scale studies and increase our understanding of host-pathogen interactions.
