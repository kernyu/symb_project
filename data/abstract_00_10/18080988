Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a 4(th) major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cigarette smoking and oxidative/nitrosative stress leading to chronic inflammation is considered as a major cause of COPD but up to now, details of molecular pathways responsible for development of disease are unknown. Recent reports indicate the role of disruption in histone function in promoting synthesis of inflammatory cytokines through increased gene transcription which underlies disease development. Core histone acetylation/deacetylation regulate their transcription activity and drug induced changes of its intensity may be an interesting field of further research. In this article the opinions about the role of steroids as inhibitors of the inflammatory process as well as resistance to steroids have been presented. Findings from studies which aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory activity of drugs such as theophylline and N-acetylcysteine and their ability to suppress oxidative stress may suggest the usefulness of these drugs in causative treatment of COPD. However, further studies are necessary to confirm these findings.
