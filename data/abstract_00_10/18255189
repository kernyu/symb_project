We investigated the effect of topical temporin A in the management of methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-infected experimental surgical wounds in mice. The wound, cut through the panniculus carnosus of BALB/c mice, was inoculated with 5x10(7) colony-forming units of MRSA. Mice were treated with Allevyn, temporin A-soaked Allevyn, Allevyn and daily intraperitoneal teicoplanin (7mg/kg), temporin A-soaked Allevyn and daily intraperitoneal teicoplanin. Main outcome measurements were: quantitative bacterial culture, histological examination with assessment of micro-vessel density and of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in tissue sections, and VEGF plasma levels alike. Treatment with temporin-A associated with teicoplanin injection significantly reduced bacterial load to 0.85 x 10(1)+/-0.1 x 10(1)CFU/ml. Histological examination showed that infected mice receiving temporin A-soaked Allevyn (with or without teicoplanin) had a higher degree of granulation tissue formation and collagen deposition compared to the other treated groups. A significant increase in serum VEGF expression was observed in mice receiving temporin A topically and temporin A topically associated with intraperitoneal teicoplanin. In conclusion our results demonstrated that temporin A is effective in the management of infected wounds, by a significant bacterial growth inhibition and acceleration of wound repair process.
