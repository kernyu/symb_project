Functional foods need to be assessed for beneficial effects to support claims, but also for toxic effects. This report describes two examples of how complex food samples are initially characterized in human cells in vitro. Water extracts of green tea (GT) and black carrots (BC) were analyzed for key ingredients (catechins and anthocyanidins, respectively). Extracts, reconstituted mixtures of the major ingredients or individual compounds [(-)-epigallocatechin gallate or cyanidin, respectively] were evaluated in parallel using human colon cells (HT29 clone 19A). End points of cytotoxicity included determination of membrane integrity, proliferation inhibition, and genetic damage. Cells were pretreated with plant compounds at sub-toxic concentrations, and their resistance to toxicity of H2O2 was evaluated as a parameter of protection. The extracts reduced cell viability (BC) and cell growth (BC, GT) and caused DNA damage (BC, GT). They were more toxic than their key ingredients. Neither GT-samples nor BC protected against H2O2-induced DNA damage, whereas cyanidin did. In vitro analysis of extracts from functional foods firstly aims at defining the sub-toxic concentrations at which protective activities are then further characterized. It also allows comparing responses of complex samples and individual compounds, which is important since effects from protective food ingredients can be masked by accompanying toxic components.
