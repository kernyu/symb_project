Airway smooth muscle (ASM) hypertrophy and hyperplasia are characteristics of asthma that lead to thickening of the airway wall and obstruction of airflow. Very little is known about mechanisms underlying ASM remodeling, but in vascular smooth muscle, it is known that progression of atherosclerosis depends on the balance of myocyte proliferation and cell death. Small heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is antiapoptotic in nonmuscle cells, but its role in ASM cell survival is unknown. Our hypothesis was that phosphorylation of Hsp27 may regulate airway remodeling by modifying proliferation, cell survival, or both. To test this hypothesis, adenoviral vectors were used to overexpress human Hsp27 in ASM cells. Cells were infected with empty vector (Ad5) or wild-type Hsp27 (AdHsp27 WT), and proliferation and death were assessed. Overexpressing Hsp27 WT caused a 50% reduction in serum-induced proliferation and increased cell survival after exposure to 100 microM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) compared with mock-infected controls. Overexpression studies utilizing an S15A, S78A, and S82A non-phosphorylation mutant (AdHsp27 3A) and an S15D, S78D, and S82D pseudo-phosphorylation mutant (AdHsp27 3D) showed phosphorylation of Hsp27 was necessary for regulation of ASM proliferation, but not survival. Hsp27 provided protection against H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity by upregulating cellular glutathione levels and preventing necrotic cell death, but not apoptotic cell death. The results support the notion that ASM cells can be stimulated to undergo proliferation and death and that Hsp27 may regulate these processes, thereby contributing to airway remodeling in asthmatics.
