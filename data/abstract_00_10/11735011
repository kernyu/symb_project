BACKGROUND: Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis surely reduces surgical infection rate. Pharmacokinetic data of oral ofloxacin in combination with its antibacterial spectrum suggest effective protection against perioperative infection. In addition, costs, adverse effects, and induction of microbial resistance are low. Therefore we performed a controlled randomized study comparing oral and intravenous single dose prophylaxis. METHODS: A total of 61 patients undergoing colonic or pancreatic resection randomly received either a single dose standard intravenous prophylaxis or ofloxacin 400 mg and metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 h before surgery. Postoperative infections were recorded for 3 weeks. RESULTS: Groups were very well comparable regarding age, overweight, concomitant disease, type and duration of surgery, blood loss, and volume support. Infectious complications occurred in 14.8% after parenteral and 3.3% after enteral antibiotic prophylaxis. There was no difference in post-operative hospital stay. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that single-dose oral ofloxacin is at least as effective as a standard intravenous prophylaxis in patients with colonic or pancreatic resection. It offers significant advantages regarding costs and ease of administration.
