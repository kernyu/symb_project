Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is involved in the stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that cAMP is required for resistance to fluconazole in S. cerevisiae. In addition, activation of Ras2, a regulator of cAMP generation, results in some protection from fluconazole toxicity in a fashion independent of the efflux transporter Pdr5p.
