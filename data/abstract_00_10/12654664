Rifampin (RIF) releases smaller quantities of lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from Streptococcus pneumoniae than ceftriaxone (CRO). Due to the rapid development of resistance, RIF cannot be used as a single agent for therapy of bacterial meningitis. For this reason, we compared the effect of treatment with RIF followed by treatment with CRO (RIF-CRO) or the effect of treatment with clindamycin (CLI) followed by treatment with CRO (CLI-CRO) to that of CRO alone on the concentrations of LTAs and teichoic acids in vitro. The effects of RIF-CRO on LTA concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and on neuronal injury were investigated in a rabbit model of S. pneumoniae meningitis. In vitro, bacterial titers were effectively reduced by CRO, RIF-CRO, and CLI-CRO when each drug was used at 10 micro g/ml. The levels of release of LTAs after the initiation of therapy were lower in RIF-CRO- and CLI-CRO-treated cultures than in cultures treated with CRO alone (P < 0.05 from 3 to 12 h after initiation of treatment). Similarly, in rabbits, the increase in the amount of LTAs in CSF was lower in RIF-CRO-treated animals than in CRO-treated animals (P = 0.02). The density of dentate apoptotic granular cells was lower after RIF-CRO therapy than after CRO therapy (medians, 58.4 and 145.6/mm(2), respectively; 25th quartiles, 36.3 and 81.7/mm(2), respectively; 75th quartiles, 100.7 and 152.3/mm(2), respectively; P = 0.03). Therefore, initiation of therapy with a protein synthesis-inhibiting antibacterial and continuation of therapy with a combination that includes a beta-lactam may be a strategy to decrease neuronal injury in bacterial meningitis.
