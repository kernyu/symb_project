BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common cause of bacterial-associated keratitis in soft contact lens wearers, due to wrong use of soft contact lenses. Problems are often severe corneal ulcers and even corneal perforations. We report on a soft contact lens wearer with credibly correct use of soft contact lenses and nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa-associated keratitis. CASE REPORT: A 33-year old woman suffered from corneal ulcer and corneal infiltration with beginning endophthalmitis 2 days after having used of new soft contact lenses. After systemic and local antibiosis and penetrating keratoplasty we could stop endophthalmitis before reaching the vitreous and retina. RESULTS: Histological and microbiological examinations showed a corneal ulcer with severe corneal infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa with resistance to mezlocillin and intermediale resistance to gentamicin. After therapy a stable situation with visual acuity of 20/60 was attained. CONCLUSIONS: Previous reports on Pseudomonas aeruginosa-associated keratitis in soft contact lens wearers demonstrate corneal problems due to extended or overnight wear or unsuccessful contact lens cleaning. We present a case of nosocomial corneal infection after soft contact lens wearing and nosocomial infection because of contact with a partner working in an intensive-care unit. Hygienic rules should be strictly followed by patients and staff using soft or hard contact lenses for visual correction or for therapeutic reasons.
