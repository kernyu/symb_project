The analysis of the literature data for the last 10 years showed that microbiological, spectroscopic, chromatographic and electrochemical methods were most often used in quantitative determination of antibiotics in biological samples and drugs. Beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics were widely investigated. The characteristics of different methods of the antibiotic determination were discussed.
