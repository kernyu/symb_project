The prevalence of Salmonella enterica serotypes, antimicrobial susceptibility, and phage typing of serovers were studied. Clinical presentations of the infected cases were also examined. The study was carried out during August 1993-September 1996 in and around Calcutta, India. In total, 1,025 faecal samples from hospitalized diarrhoeal children were screened for enteropathogens. Four S. enterica serotypes were identified in 157 (15.3%) cases as a single pathogen. S. enterica serotype Typhimurium was detected in 110 (70%) cases. S. Seftenberg, S. Infantis, and S. Virchow were detected in 28 (17.8%), 14 (8.9%), and 5 (3.2%) cases respectively. S. Typhimurium was isolated from 11 (3.2%) non-diarrhoeal control children. All of these children had acute watery diarrhoea, and 5% of them had severe dehydration, 40% had some dehydration, and 55% had no dehydration. Vomiting, fever, and diffused pain in abdomen were the associated presentations of these children. Most (95%) of them recovered with oral rehydration therapy only and without any antibiotics. In-vitro susceptibility testing showed that 120 of the 121 S. Typhimurium strains isolated from cases and controls were resistant to the commonly-used drugs. Thirteen of the 121 strains were phage-typeable and belonged to the phage type 193. However, no clinical or epidemiological significance could be established with these typeable strains. The findings of the study indicate that diarrhoeagenic Salmonella is one of the major pathogens causing diarrhoeal diseases in eastern India.
