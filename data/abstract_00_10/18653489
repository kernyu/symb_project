OBJECTIVES: To investigate the anti-adherence and antimicrobial durability of anti-infective catheters against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus aureus (resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin and methicillin) and MDR Gram-negative bacteria (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus and Enterobacter agglomerans) that are often associated with catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). METHODS: Catheters impregnated with minocycline and rifampicin (M/R) or with silver-platinum and carbon (SPC) or with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (CHX/SS) were compared with non-coated catheters. Adherence of organisms was tested by using an established biofilm colonization model. All isolates were rifampicin-resistant. Antimicrobial durability was tested by soaking 1 cm segments of the catheter in serum and determining zones of inhibition against the tested organisms at weekly intervals. RESULTS: The M/R catheters showed significantly superior anti-adherence activity and more prolonged antimicrobial durability when compared with CHX/SS-central venous catheter (CVC), SPC-CVC and uncoated control catheters against MDR and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (MDR VRSA) (all P values < or = 0.02), MDR S. maltophilia (all P values < 0.005) and MDR A. baumannii/calcoaceticus (all P values < 0.002), respectively. M/R-CVC and CHX/SS-CVC had comparable anti-adherence and antimicrobial durability against MDR E. agglomerans, and these two were superior to SPC-CVC and the uncoated control catheters (all P values < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: M/R-CVC demonstrated superior anti-adherence activity and more prolonged antimicrobial durability when compared with other approved anti-infective catheters against MDR VRSA and/or MDR Gram-negative bacteria that are often associated with CRBSIs. This finding could explain their efficacy and better performance in clinical studies.
