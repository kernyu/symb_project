BACKGROUND: Recent data on the burden of hospitalization and clinic visits for rotavirus gastroenteritis are needed to support the decision to introduce rotavirus vaccine in the Philippines. METHODS: From 2005 through 2006, children aged <5 years with acute diarrhea who attended 1 of 7 clinics and/or hospitals in Muntinlupa City, the Philippines, were enrolled. Clinical and demographic data were collected, and a stool specimen was obtained for rotavirus testing and typing for G and P antigens. The incidences of different clinical outcomes of rotavirus gastroenteritis were determined for 3 townships under surveillance and were extrapolated to the Philippines with use of national data sets. RESULTS: The prevalence of rotavirus was 31% (171/560) among children hospitalized with diarrhea, 30% (155/520) among those who presented to the emergency department, and 15% (56/385) among those who presented to a clinic. The annual estimated incidence (per 100,000 children aged <5 years) of rotavirus gastroenteritis in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings was 755, 451, and 279, respectively. Of 274 strains, 50 (18%) were nontypeable. Of the 128 strains that underwent G and P typing, 98% belong to the globally common strains G3P[P], G2P[4], and G1P[8]. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis in the Philippines is high and is predominantly caused by strains against which current vaccines have shown good efficacy, suggesting that routine immunization will have a large impact on rotavirus disease burden.
