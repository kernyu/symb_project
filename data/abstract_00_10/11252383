In a collection of 111 transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines, silencing of the nptII gene was observed in 62 (56%) of the lines and three distinct nptII-silencing phenotypes were identified. Two T-DNA constructs were used, which differed in distance and orientation of the marker gene relative to the border sequences. Comparison of the sets of lines generated with each vector, indicate that the T-DNA construct configuration influence the incidence of lines displaying silencing, as well as the distribution of silencing phenotypes. Twenty lines were investigated more thoroughly. The frequency of silencing varied between siblings in 19 lines, including three lines containing a single T-DNA copy. The last line showed 100% silencing. The gus gene present in both constructs could be expressed in the presence of a silenced nptII gene. Investigation of methylation at a single site in the pnos promoter revealed partial methylation in multi-copy lines, but no methylation in single-copy lines. For 16 lines, the overall frequencies of silencing differed significantly between control plants and plants exposed to temperature stress; in 11 of these lines at the 0.1% level. In several cases, the frequency of silencing in progeny of stress-treated plants was higher than for the control group, while other lines showed higher frequencies of kanamycin-resistant progeny for the stress-treated sibling plants.
