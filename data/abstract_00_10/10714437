Resistance to acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection is mainly associated with a Th1 immune response, characterized by gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) production and activation of macrophages. The outcome of the Th1 response in the spleen and serum of BALB/c and C3H mice infected with T. cruzi, Tulahuen strain was studied. The levels of interleukin-12 p40 (IL-12 p40) and IFN-gamma, as well as natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity were determined at different time-points during the acute phase, and the production of cytokines was also studied in the chronic infection. At 2 days post-infection (pi), spleen cells from C3H mice increased their NK cell activity and the ex vivo spontaneous release of both IL-12 p40 and IFN-gamma. On the other hand, BALB/c mice reached low levels of NK cell cytotoxicity and no IFN-gamma production was detected at this time pi, but the cytokine was released at high amounts in the second week of the infection. Seric IL-12 p40 concentrations showed a 3-fold increase in both mouse strains on the second day pi and remained high throughout the acute phase. However, seric IFN-gamma levels increased during the late acute infection and were higher in BALB/c than in C3H mice. In chronically infected mice IL-12 p40 was as high as in the acute phase in the serum of both strains, but only BALB/c mice still produced IFN-gamma. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report showing the protein levels of IL-12 p40 determined in vivo in acute and chronic T. cruzi infections. The results reveal differences between both mouse strains in the mechanisms controlling the onset and fate of the Th1 response triggered by the parasite and a long lasting pro-inflammatory stimuli.
