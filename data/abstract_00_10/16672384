An oligonucleotide chip (Combichip Mycobacteria chip) detecting specific mutations in the rpoB, katG, and inhA genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was compared with conventional antimicrobial susceptibility results. The probes detecting drug resistance were as follows: 7 wild-type and 13 mutant probes for rifampin and 2 wild-type and 3 mutant probes for isoniazid. Target DNA of M. tuberculosis was amplified by PCR, followed by hybridization and scanning. Direct sequencing was performed to verify the results of the oligonucleotide chip. One-hundred seven of 115 rifampin-resistant strains (93%) had mutations in the rpoB gene. Eighty-five of 119 isoniazid-resistant strains (71%) had mutations in the katG gene or inhA gene. The diagnostic oligonucleotide chip with mutation-specific probes is a reliable and useful tool for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of resistance against rifampin and isoniazid in M. tuberculosis isolates.
