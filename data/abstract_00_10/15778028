Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen. Since 1989, a rapid increase in the incidence of enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis by VRE has been reported. The use of avoparcin in animal husbandry is reportedly associated with the appearance of VRE. In this study, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was established to detect and differentiate resistant types of enterococci, which specifically amplify the four van genes that encode vancomycin resistance elements. Using this method, we investigated the incidence rates and types of VRE from two types of farms: those that had used avoparcin and those that had not used avoparcin. A total of 1091 animal fecal samples were collected from 70 pig farms and 32 poultry farms. A total of 425 enterococci were isolated from the fecal samples. Among the 425 isolates, six showed a pattern of high-level vancomycin resistance (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration, MIC: 64-256 microg/ml). Out of six high-level VRE, three were isolated from poultry farms that had used avoparcin and three were not. The six high-level VRE harbored the vanA gene. Sixty-seven of 425 isolates that showed a pattern of low-level vancomycin resistance (MIC: 4-8 microg/ml) were associated with the presence of vanC-1 or vanC-2/3 gene. We also performed a repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) method to compare the genetic relatedness between the high-level VRE of six animal isolates and 31 human isolates. None of the animal isolates had a similar rep-PCR pattern as the human isolates but similarities between human VRE isolates were observed.
