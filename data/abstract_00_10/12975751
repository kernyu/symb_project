The incidence of invasive aspergillosis is markedly increasing, and mortality remains dismal. Previously there were only 2 antifungals with activity against Aspergillus, but over the last few years there has been an explosion of newer agents and reformulations of older antifungals. Exploration has also begun with immunotherapy, with use of cytokines and granulocyte transfusions alone or in combination with antifungal therapy. This review will detail the available in vitro, in vivo, and clinical experience with the newer antifungal and immunomodulatory therapies in development for treatment of invasive aspergillosis.
