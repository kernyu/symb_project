OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pneumoniae) isolated from Chinese children with pneumonia. METHODS: Hypopharyngeal aspirate specimens were collected from hospitalized children with pneumonia who were admitted to the children's hospital located in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou or Shanghai from February 16, 2006 to February 16, 2007. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of S.pneumoniae isolates against penicillin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime (sodium), ceftriaxone, erythromycin, vancomycin, ofloxacin and imipenem was determined by E-test method. RESULTS: A total of 279 S.pneumoniae isolates were obtained. Eighty-six percent of the isolates were not susceptive to penicillin, and 23.3% was resistant to penicillin. The rate of susceptibility of the isolates to amoxicillin was 92.1%, and to cefuroxime and ceftriaxone was 19.0% and 75.3%, respectively. The isolates also showed a high susceptibility to vancomycin (99.6%) and ofloxacin (97.8%). Seventeen point six percent of the isolates were not susceptive to imipenem, and most of those were intermediate. Almost of all isolates were resistant to erythromycin. There were some distinct regional differences in the susceptibility to antimicrobials tested except for erythromycin, vancomycin and ofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: The S.pneumoniae isolates from Chinese children with pneumonia were susceptive to amoxicillin, vancomycin and ofloxacin, but were not susceptive or resistant to penicillin, cefuroxime and erythromycin. The isolates kept susceptibility to ceftriaxone and imipenem to a certain extent.
