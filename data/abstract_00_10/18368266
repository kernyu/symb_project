Results from a cross-sectional observational study on candidemia conducted at Hospital de Clinicas, Federal University of Parana, are presented. From January 2001 to December 2004, one hundred candidemia cases were evaluated. The incidence was 1.27 episodes per 1,000 hospitalizations and Candida was the eighth most frequently isolated agent from bloodstream infections. The patients ages ranged from five days to 89 years, with a mean of 32 years. Sixty percent of the cases occurred in adults (66% > 50 years old) and 40% in children (52% < one year old). Fifty-nine percent had been admitted to medical wards and 41% to the intensive care unit. Candida albicans was the most (59%) frequent species followed by Candida tropicalis (15%) and Candida parapsilosis (9%). The most (97%) prevalent coexisting conditions were the use of antibacterial drugs, central venous catheter (77%), H2 blockers (57%), total parenteral nutrition (49%) and admission to the intensive care unit (41%). Out of the 51 isolates tested, three of Candida glabrata presented dose-dependent susceptibility to fluconazole and resistance to itraconazole. One sample of Candida krusei presented dose-dependent susceptibility to fluconazole and one of Candida pelliculosa presented dose-dependent susceptibility to itraconazole. Among the study population, 68% received antifungal therapy, but the mortality was 56%.
