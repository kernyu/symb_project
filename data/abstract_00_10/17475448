We questioned 62 dermatology outpatients with atopic eczema and Staphylococcus aureus colonisation regarding their use of topical preparations containing fusidic acid during the previous 6 months as well as the pattern of any such use. Recent exposure to topical fusidic acid was significantly correlated with the presence of fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus (FRSA) (P=0.04). There was also a significant trend towards increasing FRSA carriage with increased duration of use. Short courses of 2 weeks or less did not appear to change the FRSA profile compared with non-exposure, and intermittent usage appeared to be the most detrimental, although subgroup sizes were small. Our study cautions against prolonged or intermittent use of fusidic acid-containing products in patients with eczema.
