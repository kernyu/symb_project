Faecal samples of healthy dogs (n=39) and cats (n=36) obtained in Northern Portugal were seeded on Levine agar plates, and two Escherichia coli isolates per sample were recovered (78 of dogs and 66 of cats). The susceptibility to 16 antimicrobial agents was tested in this series of 144 E. coli isolates. Almost 20% of them showed tetracycline resistance and 12 and 15% presented ampicillin or streptomycin resistance, respectively. The percentage of resistance to the other antimicrobial agents was in all cases below 4%, and no resistant isolates were detected for ceftazidime, imipenem, cefoxitin or amikacin. Two isolates (from one dog) showed cefotaxime-resistance and harboured both the CTX-M-1 and OXA-30 beta-lactamases. A bla(TEM) gene was detected in 12 of 17 ampicillin-resistant isolates, the aac(3)-II gene in the three gentamicin-resistant isolates, aadA in 7 of 22 streptomycin-resistant isolates, and tet(A) and/or tet(B) gene in all 28 tetracycline-resistant isolates. The gene encoding class 1 integrase was detected in six E. coli isolates, including the four trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant isolates and those two harbouring CTX-M-1 and OXA-30 beta-lactamases; different gene cassette arrangements were identified: dfrA1+aadA1 (two isolates), dfrA12+orfF+aadA2 (two isolates) and bla(OXA30)+aadA1 (two isolates). One amino acid change in GyrA protein (Ser83Leu or Asp87Tyr) was detected in four nalidixic acid-resistant and ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolates and two amino acid changes in GyrA (Ser83Leu+Asp87Asn) and one in ParC (Ser80Ile) were identified in one nalidixic acid- and ciprofloxacin-resistant isolate. Faecal E. coli isolates of healthy pets could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.
