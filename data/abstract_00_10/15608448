We have tested 250 strains belonging to 15 species of clinically important dermatophytes and Scopulariopsis against ten antifungal drugs using an agar diffusion method (NeoSensitabstrade mark, Rosco, Taastrup, Denmark). Some of the experimental factors were adapted to dermatophyte development, such as temperature (28 vs. 35 degrees C) and time of incubation (2-5 days vs. 21-74 h). The antifungals used are itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, sertaconazole, terbinafine, tioconazole, fluconazole, isoconazole and econazole. Except for fluconazole, all the drugs tested have shown to be highly effective, especially sertaconazole and terbinafine. Percentages of susceptibility ranged between 94% for terbinafine, 87.6% for sertaconazole and 86.4% clotrimazole; 81.6% econazole; 42.8% fluconazole; 57.2% isoconazole; 78.4% itraconazole; 74.4% ketoconazole; 73.3% miconazole, and 85.2% for tioconazole. Percentages of resistance were similar between sertaconazole and terbinafine (4%) but in contrast to the 48% obtained for fluconazole.
