The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of composition and technological processing on pharmaceutical availability of active substance as well as on the properties of porous gelatin-alginate matrices. The active substance carrier included glycerol or peanut oil apart from gelatin and sodium alginate, and some matrices were additionally modified with calcium lactate. The obtained matrices were characterized by good sorption properties and high resistance to proteolytic enzymes. The release of the model antibiotic followed the pattern of first order kinetics, while half-release time in vitro (in the experimental conditions) was 1.5 to 3 hrs.
