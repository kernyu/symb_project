Many diversely produced natural peptides, as well as those produced semisynthetically and synthetically, have been found to inhibit the growth or even be lethal to a wide range of fungi. Some of these have the potential to aid mankind in combating mycoses caused by emerging pathogens or as a result of the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant fungi. Antifungal peptides may also assist in non-medical fields such as agriculture. For example, introduction by transgenic research of antifungal peptides could improve crop production yields by increasing host resistance to fungal invasion. The aim of this review is to provide information on research on these important peptides.
