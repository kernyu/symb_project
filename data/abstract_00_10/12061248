Chlorhexidine is an antibacterial agent of the bisguanide family. It's the most effectual molecule of all antiseptics for oral use. Because of its so frequent use, we have elaborated a protocol in order to estimate the resistance of the sub-gingival flora bacteria to its actions. We have determined the minimal inhibitory concentration of the different observed bacteria species and, have from that stage, progressively increased the concentration at a rate of 5 micrograms/ml. The obtained results show that the bacteria can undergo structural and/or biochemical alterations to adapt to more significant concentrations.
