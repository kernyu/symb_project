The dehydro-orotate dehydrogenase inhibitor leflunomide is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, its influence on host resistance to Candida albicans infection in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was investigated. Leflunomide administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days in mice with CIA inhibited collagen-specific cellular and humoral responses. The drug did not change the severity of primary C. albicans infection evaluated by kidney and liver colonization. At the early stage of infection leflunomide inhibited IFN-gamma production and enhanced IL-4 secretion. The effect of the drug on IL-4 production was less pronounced at the late phase of infection. Leflunomide enhanced anti-Candida IgM antibody production and diminished anti-Candida IgG antibody synthesis. This correlated with impaired resistance to reinfection. Results demonstrate that leflunomide administration to mice with collagen-induced arthritis might affect mechanisms of the late immune response to C. albicans infection.
