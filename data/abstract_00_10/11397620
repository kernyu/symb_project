Serum bactericidal activity was studied in a crossover manner in 10 volunteers, after 2-day administration of grepafloxacin 600 mg qd, ofloxacin 400 mg bid and clarithromycin 500 mg bid. Bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was estimated using a standardized microdilution method. Grepafloxacin was highly active against Gram-negative organisms and adequate against pneumococci (mean, 1:13.3). Clarithromycin was very active against both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-partially-resistant S. pneumoniae (1:102.5) but had poor activity against H. influenzae (1:3.1). Minor adverse effects were commonly associated with grepafloxacin.
