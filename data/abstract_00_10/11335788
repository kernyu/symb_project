c-raf-1, a cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase, plays an important role in mitogen- and damage-responsive cellular signal transduction pathways. Expression of c-raf-1 modifies cell growth, proliferation and survival. Although expression of c-raf-1 has been studied in several tumors, the role of c-raf-1 in leukemia is so far unclear. We examined the expression of c-raf-1 in the human leukemia cell lines U937 and K562, and in a cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C)-resistant cell line (K562AC) derived from K562. Expression of c-raf-1 was increased in U937 and in Ara-C-resistant K562AC cells compared with the parental cells. We then investigated whether inhibition of c-raf-1 expression by antisense oligonucleotides increases the sensitivity to Ara-C in U937 and K562AC cells. Antisense oligonucleotides for c-raf-1 inhibited expression of c-raf-1 mRNA, but did not affect cell growth and increased sensitivity to Ara-C but not to other drugs such as adriamycin, VP-16 or vincristine. These results suggest that c-raf-1 is one of the factors involved in Ara-C resistance in leukemia and lend weight to the case for development of anti-cancer therapeutics involving oncogene-targeted antisense oligonucleotides.
