A total of 73 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were measured for susceptibilities to nine fluoroquinolones, and nucleotide sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) were determined. MIC90s of sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, grepafloxacin, and gatifloxacin were less than 0.5 mg/L and the MIC90 of ciprofloxacin was 2 mg/L, although MIC values of some isolates to ciprofloxacin were more than 2 mg/L. We found that 60 of 73 isolates had only Ile-460-Val/ParE substitution and two isolates had an additional substitution of Ser-114-Gly/GyrA, while none of the isolates had any other substitutions in QRDRs of either ParC/E or GyrA/B. The isolates carrying Ile-460-Val/ParE substitution were more resistant to the fluoroquinolones norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin than the isolates with no amino acid substitution and the differences in MIC values were significant, suggesting that Ile-460-Val/ParE substitution in recent clinical S. pneumoniae isolates should be involved in the low-level fluoroquinolone resistance.
