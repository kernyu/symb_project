The purpose of this study was establishing the basic energetic parameters of amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii mitochondria respiring with malate and their response to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of Fe(2+) ions. It appeared that, contrary to a previous report (Trocha LK, Stobienia O (2007) Acta Biochim Polon 54: 797), H(2)O(2)-treated mitochondria of A. castellanii did not display any substantial impairment. No marked changes in cytochrome pathway activity were found, as in the presence of an inhibitor of alternative oxidase no effects were observed on the rates of uncoupled and phosphorylating respiration and on coupling parameters. Only in the absence of the alternative oxidase inhibitor, non-phosphorylating respiration progressively decreased with increasing concentration of H(2)O(2), while the coupling parameters (respiratory control ratio and ADP/O ratio) slightly improved, which may indicate some inactivation of the alternative oxidase. Moreover, our results show no change in membrane potential, Ca(2+) uptake and accumulation ability, mitochondrial outer membrane integrity and cytochrome c release for 0.5-25 mM H(2)O(2)-treated versus control (H(2)O(2)-untreated) mitochondria. These results indicate that short (5 min) incubation of A. castellanii mitochondria with H(2)O(2) in the presence of Fe(2+) does not damage their basic energetics.
