The problem of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is on the rise worldwide. However, significant regional differences exist with respect to incidence, types of prevalent outbreak strains and accompanying resistance patterns as well as local conditions and resources to control epidemics. Intensive care units are regularly epicenters of MRSA epidemics. Accordingly, anaesthesists, intensive care physicians and surgeons need to know the established recommendations and guidelines about early recognition and infection control of MRSA, must be familiar with principles of the antimicrobial MRSA therapy, and should adapt the principles for prevention and therapy of MRSA infections to the needs of the respective institution and situation. The result of this process has to be a rational and efficient approach to this nosocomial pathogen allowing its control under consideration of cost effectiveness.
