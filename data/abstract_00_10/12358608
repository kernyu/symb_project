A total of 162 sheep fleece samples were collected from 2315 sheep clinically examined for evidence of dermatitis. The sheep belonged to 32 flocks raised in northern and middle Jordan. Eighty-three samples showed no obvious abnormalities, whereas the remainder showed exudation (79 samples), fleece discoloration (18) and fleece roughness (40) and abscesses (7). Seventeen Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were obtained from these samples. Antibacterial resistance in vitro was common; resistance to tetracycline, amoxycillin, erythromycin and cotrimoxazole was shown by > 90% of the isolates. Resistance to norfloxacin (29.4% of isolates), ciprofloxacin (17.6%) and amikacin (17.6%) was also demonstrated. Fourteen isolates were serum resistant when assessed after 1-3 h incubation in sheep and calf sera, and their count increased by 2-2.9 and 2.5-3.5 respectively.
