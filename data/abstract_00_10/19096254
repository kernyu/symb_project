BACKGROUND/AIMS: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is an integral component of immune response. Highly polymorphic HLA genes may play a pivotal role in the response of antiviral therapy. We investigated the effects of HLA gene polymorphism on the clinical outcome of chronic hepatitis B patients who received lamivudine treatment. METHODS: Depending on their clinical response to lamivudine therapy, a total of sixty one patients were divided into following groups; non-responders, viral breakthroughers, relapsers, and seroconverters. HLA-A, -B, -Cw, -DRB and HLA-DRB1 alleles typing was performed on each group through the polymerase chain reaction and the sequence-specific oligonucleotide hybridization method. The distribution patterns of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB, and HLA-DRB1 were then analysed. RESULTS: When non-responders were compared to the other groups, high frequencies in HLA-Cw1, HLA-DRB14 and HLA-DRB4 (p=0.015, 0.033 and 0.004 respectively) were evident. When seroconverters were compared to viral breakthroughers, high frequencies in HLA-A2 and HLA-DRB4 (p=0.048, 0.025 respectively) were evident. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that HLA-A2, HLA-Cw1, HLA-DRB14 genes are related to the clinical outcomes of lamivudine treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. These genes may be used in the prediction of the clinical outcome of lamivudine therapy in chronic hepatitis B patients.
