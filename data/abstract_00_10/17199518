Contaminated poultry meat has been identified as one of the principal foodborne sources of Salmonella. Molecular characterization of Salmonella is important in addressing methods to control this pathogen. Seventy-four retail turkey meat samples were collected from various stores in Fargo, North Dakota in the fall of 2003. Salmonella was recovered from 30 samples using the standard conventional culture method (FSIS, USDA). Isolated Salmonella were characterized by serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis, plasmid analysis, and antibiotic resistance profiling. Five serotypes were identified among the isolates: Newport (n = 12), Hadar (n = 8), Heidelberg (n = 7), 4,12:nonmotile (n = 2), and Reading (n = 1). XbaI PFGE analysis revealed 13 PFGE types and succeeded in grouping the isolates according to their serotypes. Plasmid profiling identified 5 plasmid types (with 1 or 2 plasmids) among eleven isolates that harbored plasmids. Seventeen isolates were resistant to antibiotics. The Heidelberg serotype showed resistance to multiple antibiotics: 1 isolate had resistance to gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole, and streptomycin, and 6 isolates had resistance to tetracycline, gentamycin, sulfamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin. The Hadar serotype isolates were resistant to 2 or 3 antibiotics: tetracycline and streptomycin (1 isolate); tetracycline and kanamycin (1 isolate); and tetracycline, kanamycin, and streptomycin (6 isolates). The 4,12:nonmotile serotype isolates showed resistance to tetracycline only. The Newport and the Reading serotypes were susceptible to all 16 of the antimicrobials tested.
