We recently documented the identification of a 26.5 kDa protein named BmNox in the gut fluid of Nistari strain of Bombyx mori, which possessed antiviral activity against BmNPV in vitro. In this report, we report the characterization of the full-length gene encoding BmNOX and the levels of expression of this gene in select tissues of silkworm larvae from a BmNPV-susceptible and a BmNPV-resistant strain to the defense capability in Bombyx mori larvae challenged with BmNPV. We also evaluated the BmNox expression in various stages of larval life of a resistant and a susceptible strain of Bombyx mori selected from among a panel of strains of silkworm. Nistari, a multivoltine strain of silkworm, expressed BmNOX during all five larval stages, and were highly resistant to BmNPV infection. In sharp contrast, CSR(2), a bivoltine strain, showed weaker expression of BmNOX in the anterior midgut in larval life and was highly susceptible to BmNPV infection. BmNOX is a secretory protein with dual expression in gut fluid and mid gut tissue. BmNOX is expressed heavily in the posterior mid gut, with weaker expression in the fore- and mid-gut regions.
