This article summarizes personal reflections from the perspective of general practice on developments with regard to antibiotic resistance and the containment of antibiotic prescribing during the lifetime of the Specialist Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance in England. These reflections concern the entry of antibiotics into the food chain, recent extensions of prescribing responsibilities and developments towards improved surveillance and reduced antibiotic prescribing. A large gap remains between the scientific appreciation of the risks from antimicrobial resistance and effective means to measure it and thereby hopefully control it.
