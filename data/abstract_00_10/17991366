A review on the etiological profile of urinary tract infections in childhood and the sensitivity pattern of urinary pathogens in Spain is presented. Escherichia coli continues to be the main etiological agent of urinary tract infection in childhood. Consequently, its sensitivity pattern will usually determine the choice of empirical therapy. The predominance of E. coli is reduced in certain circumstances, in which the presence of other microorganisms is increased. However, the clinical information available at diagnosis does not allow accurate identification of the etiology; only staining and microscopic urine examination can help in treatment selection. In Spain, E. coli presents a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole, whereas second- and third-generation cephalosporins, fosfomycin, aminoglycosides and amoxicillin-clavulanate maintain high sensitivity. In some areas, amoxicillin-clavulanate and first-generation cephalosporins show high levels of resistance, which can limit their empirical use.
