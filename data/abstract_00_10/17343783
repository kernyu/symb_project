AIM: To explore the possibility and the possible mechanism of reversing ATRA-resistance in MR2 cells by using IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). METHODS: After MR2 cells(ATRA-resistance cell line) were treated with IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma and ATRA alone or IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in combination with ATRA respectively, the cell proliferation was tested by MTT colorimetry, the cell differentiation was tested through light microscope, by NBT test and flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein was observed by indirect immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma could inhibit the proliferation of MR2 cells. The effects were more obviously in both IFN-alpha+ATRA group and IFN-gamma+ATRA group. But there were no significant difference between either IFN-alpha group and IFN-gamma group or IFN-alpha+ATRA group and IFN-gamma+ATRA group (P>0.05). Both IFN could also induce the differentiation of MR2 cells. The effects of IFN-alpha+ATRA group and IFN-gamma+ATRA group were more obvious. However, the differentiation of MR2 cells induced by IFN-gamma+ATRA group was more higher than that by IFN-alpha+ATRA group (P<0.05). Both IFN could induce the expression of PML protein. CONCLUSION: The reversing effcet of IFN-gamma+ATRA group on ATRA-resistence in MR2 cells are more powerful than that of IFN-alpha+ATRA group, which may be related to the different signal transduction pathway of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma.
