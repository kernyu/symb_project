Mutations at codon 315 of the katG gene were detected in 312 of 364 (85.7%) isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Seven of 52 (13.5%) isoniazid-resistant isolates with the wild-type Ser315 codon and 10 of 52 (19.2%) isoniazid-resistant isolates with a mutated katG allele had mutation -15C-->T in the promoter of the mabA-inhA operon.
