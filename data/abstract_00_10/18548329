Forty-eight strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Agona and 33 strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Weltevreden were characterized by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting using 3 different arbitrary primer, Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. By using RAPD, 81 strains (44 strains of S. Agona and 33 strains of S. Weltevreden) can be clustered into 14 groups and 6 single isolates whereas ERIC-PCR produced 7 clusters and 3 single isolates. Thirteen antimicrobial agents were used and all the isolates were resistant to erythromycin and showed Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance indexes, ranging from 0.08 to 0.62. Poultry still remain as the common reservoir for multi-drug-resistant Salmonella. On the other hand, vegetables contaminated with S. Weltevreden showed a gain in antimicrobial resistance. Besides that, consistent antibiograms were observed from S. Weltevreden isolated at Kajang wet market on 2000/08/02.
