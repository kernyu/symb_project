The objective of this study conducted in Fann University Teaching Hospital in Dakar, is to establish correlation beetwen the prescription and consummation of antibiotics in the one hand, and the susceptibility of strains isolated in this hospital on the other hand. An interview of medical practitioners and pharmacists was realised to appreciate the antibiotics used in the clinics, the bacteria taken aim, the criteria of choice, the place of antibiogram, the place of antibiotics in orders of medicines and pharmacists, the consummest family of antibiotics. In the lab, all of pathogen bacteria were tested by disc diffusion test (antibiogram) to appreciate the susceptibility to antibiotics. The results show that Enterobacteria represented 60.8% of isolates and among them, Escherichia coli (30.6%) was the most representative specie in hospitalized and non hospitalized patients. 52% of the strains of E. coli were susceptible to aminopenicillins in external patients, versus less than 35% in hospitalized. In Neurosurgery, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent bacteria and all of the strains were susceptible to imipenem, dibekacin and ciprofloxacin. Beta-lactams were the most used drugs in the first place (78.8%), related to habits of prescription of medical staff and to avaibility of antibiotics. The choice of antibiotics must take the susceptibility of strains into account.
