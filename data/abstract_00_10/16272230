Antibiotic resistance is an important concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing fuels the evolution of resistance, while poor basic hygiene facilitates the spread of resistant microbes between patients and healthcare staff. The development of infection with a resistant pathogen may lead to poorer health and economic outcomes. The problem for the frontline clinician, however, is how to balance the responsibility of prudent prescribing with the risk of sub-optimally treating a patient who may be infected with a resistant pathogen. This article discusses how hospital physicians can use severity and risk factor assessment, and knowledge of local microbial epidemiology, to guide empiric antibiotic prescribing. Most patients hospitalised with a community acquired bacterial infection in the UK can still be managed with a traditional first line antibiotic(s). In contrast, regimens that account for resistance are often required in patients with hospital acquired infections, particularly if the patient is critically ill.
