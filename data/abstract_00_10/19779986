BACKGROUND: In this prospective study, operative and nonoperative management of acute appendicitis were evaluated regarding their safety and cost effectiveness. METHODS: Two hundred ninety patients presenting to our Emergency Department between March 2005 and March 2006 with acute appendicitis were included in this prospective study. Nonoperative medical therapy was performed in 107 patients (Group 1), and 183 patients were treated surgically (Group 2). Routine follow-up controls were done on the 10th day, at the 3rd and 6th months and at the first year after discharge in Group 1. Both groups were compared regarding age, gender, mean hospital stay, modified Alvarado score, morbidity, mortality, and cost effectiveness. RESULTS: The male/female ratio of Groups 1 and 2 were 65/42 (mean age: 30.98+/-1.30) and 125/58 (mean age: 26.25+/-0.79), respectively. In Group 1, 19 patients were operated. Operation indications were resistance to therapy, patient's request, and operation in another hospital. Although the mean hospital stay of Group 1 was statistically significantly longer than Group 2, the mean cost of the therapy was $559 in Group 2 and $433 in Group 1. Morbidity rates were similar, with no mortality in either group. CONCLUSION: With its high success rate and cost effectiveness, medical treatment seems to be a good alternative to the gold standard therapy of surgery in management of acute appendicitis.
