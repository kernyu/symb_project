Summary The susceptibility to six antifungals: amphotericin B (AMF), 5-fluorocytosine (5-F), miconazole (MIK), ketoconazole (KET), fluconazole (FLU) and itraconazole (ITR) was tested among 206 Candida spp. isolated from paediatric and adult patients with haematological malignancies. To determinate the susceptibility the commercial microdilution method Fungitest (Bio-Rad, France) was used. The strains were classified as susceptible, intermediate susceptible, or resistant on the base of the growth in following breakpoint concentrations of particular drugs: 2 and 8 microg ml(-1) for AMF, 2 and 32 microg ml(-1) for 5-F, 0.5 and 8 microg ml(-1) for MIK, 0.5 and 4 microg ml(-1) for KET and ITR, and 8 and 64 microg ml(-1) for FLU. The highest activity to overall species showed AMF (only one resistant strain) and 5-F (85% susceptible strains). Most of C. albicans isolates were susceptible to tested azoles. The percentages of C. albicans resistant to FLU, ITR, KET and MIK were 4, 11, 8, and 0.8%, respectively. The less susceptible to azoles were C. glabrata and C. krusei (14% and 44% isolates resistant to FLU). A non-albicans Candida isolated from adult patients receiving KET prophylaxis was more frequently resistant to FLU than isolates from patients without previous exposure to azoles (P < 0.05). We did not observe differences in the susceptibility of Candida strains isolated from children compared with those from adults.
