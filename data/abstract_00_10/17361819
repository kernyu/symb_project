OBJECTIVE: To assess the immune status and metabolic reaction of hepatic enzymes on mice with alveolar echinococcosis (AE) after treatment with matrine (Mat) and albendazole (ABZ). METHODS: Mice with AE were treated with single dose Mat, ABZ and combined Mat and ABZ respectively for 60 days. The serum level of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-alpha was detected before and after treatment. NO, LD content and LDH, NOS, iNOS, Na+-K+ ATPase, Ca 2+ Mg+2 ATPase activities in hepatic tissue homogenate from the mice were measured by chromatometry. RESULTS: The level of IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-alpha decreased in the treated groups than infected control (P<0.05), and especially that of IL-4 and TNF-alpha in the drug-combination group. While the level of IL-2 increased in the combination group than the infected control (P<0.05). The content of NO and the activity of NOS and iNOS in hepatic tissue decreased after treatment than control (P<0.05). iNOS in Mat and combination groups decreased more significantly than that of ABZ group (P<0.05). The LDH activity also decreased after treatment (P<0.05), however, the decrease of LD occurred only in the combination group (P<0.05). The activity of Na+-K+ ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase increased in the treated groups (P<0.05) with more considerable increase of Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase in Mat and combination groups than the ABZ group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Matrine may strengthen the immunity of the mice and shows an inhibitory effect on the growth of Echinococcus multilocularis in vitro and in vivo, which is posssibly related to the intervention of calcium ion passages and reversion of the multi-drug resistance.
