The purpose of this study was to determine the erythromycin resistance of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) isolated from throat cultures. GABHS were isolated from 74 (10.4%) throat cultures of 710 patients with upper respiratory tract infections. Penicillin resistance was observed in none of the strains. Of these strains, 4 (5.4%) were found to be resistant to erythromycin. It was concluded that erythromycin resistance in GABHS, although high in some countries, was not a problem in our country at the moment. So, penicillin G and its alternative erythromycin and other macrolides are still reliable antibiotics for the treatment of GABHS infections.
