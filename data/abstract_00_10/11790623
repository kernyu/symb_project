The ever-increasing resistance to current anti-infective drugs has become a major concern to the medical community. As a result, research efforts have been stepped up with the ultimate goal to provide new, more effective and safer antimicrobial treatments that will overcome the resistance problem. In this context, advances in molecular biology, automation and combinatorial chemistry will play a crucial role in the timely introduction of these products onto the market. How the application of combinatorial techniques can impact anti-infectives research will be reviewed using illustrative examples.
