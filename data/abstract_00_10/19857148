In recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs), the mortality associated with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) remains high, despite the introduction of broad-spectrum antifungal agents over the past 2 decades. Preventing exposure to fungal pathogens in this population is impossible; therefore, clinicians have focused on prophylactic use of antifungal agents to prevent IFIs in high-risk HSCT recipients. It is important to target antifungal prophylaxis by type of HSCT (autologous or allogeneic), local epidemiology, and risk factors for IFIs so that patients can receive the most appropriate agent while balancing costs and the risks of toxicity, and minimizing the development of resistance. To assist clinicians in weighing the pros and cons of currently available antifungal agents when choosing a suitable prophylactic regimen, we provide a review of several key prospective randomized trials that evaluated various antifungal agents for primary prophylaxis in adult HSCT recipients. In addition, we describe the epidemiology of and risk factors for IFIs in HSCT recipients, the difficulties in diagnosing IFIs, antifungal agents used for prophylaxis, and the goals of primary prophylaxis. Fluconazole remains the gold standard for primary prophylaxis in autologous HSCT recipients. For allogeneic HSCT recipients, the agent chosen for prophylaxis must be based on the patient's risk factors for IFIs. In low-risk patients, fluconazole is an appropriate agent to use for primary prophylaxis immediately after transplantation. However, in allogeneic HSCT recipients who develop complications, such as graft failure, graft-versus-host disease, or cytomegalovirus infection, prophylaxis with a mould-active agent should be used.
