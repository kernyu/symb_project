Resistance of Leishmania parasites to specific chemotherapy has become a well-documented problem in the Indian subcontinent in recent years but only a few studies have focused on the susceptibility of American Leishmania isolates. Our susceptibility assays to meglumine antimoniate were performed against intracellular amastigotes after standardizing an in vitro model of macrophage infection appropriate for Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis isolates. For the determination of promastigote susceptibility to amphotericin B, we developed a simplified MTT-test. The sensitivity in vitro to meglumine antimoniate and amphotericin B of 13 isolates obtained from Brazilian patients was determined. L. (V.) braziliensis isolates were more susceptible to meglumine antimoniate than Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. EC(50), EC(90) and activity indexes (calculated over the sensitivity of reference strains), suggested that all isolates tested were susceptible in vitro to meglumine antimoniate, and did not show association with the clinical outcomes. Isolates were also uniformly susceptible in vitro to amphotericin B.
