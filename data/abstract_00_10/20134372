BACKGROUND/AIM: Many studies have revealed a close relationship between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HP eradication on insulin resistance, serum lipids and low-grade inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, single-center study which consisted of 159 patients. The patients with HP infection received a 14-day sequential regimen. A HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) level was used to assess insulin resistance. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients with HP infection and seventy-one patients without HP infection were studied. HOMA-IR, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and C reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly lower in patients with HP infection compared to the patients without HP infection (P<0.05). The HP eradication rates with a sequential regimen in dyspeptic patients were 53.4%. Six weeks after the end of eradication therapy, the mean fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, TC, TG, LDL-C, and CRP levels in patients with successful eradication were significantly decreased from the pretreatment levels (P<0.05) and HDL-C level was significantly increased from the pretreatment levels (P<0.05). The mean fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, TC, TG, LDL-C, CRP levels and HDL-C levels in patients with unsuccessful eradication were not significantly changed from pretreatment levels (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study showed beneficial effects of HP eradication on insulin resistance, atherogenic lipid abnormalities and low-grade inflammation. The results suggest that HP eradication may prevent coronary artery disease and metabolic syndrome.
