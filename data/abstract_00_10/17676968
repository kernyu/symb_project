Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a disease-causing organism that has been present in hospital settings since the 1960s. However, a genetically distinct strain of MRSA, called community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), has emerged in recent years in community settings among healthy individuals. While this organism has been found to be less resistant to antibiotics, it is also more virulent and capable of causing a spectrum of illnesses. School nurses must be aware of the risk factors for this infection and understand its signs, symptoms, diagnostic testing, and management. With this knowledge, school nurses can help protect students, staff, and community members from this increasingly prevalent pathogen.
