Cyclic and periodic IFN treatment (CPIT) consisting of induction treatment with nIFN-beta followed by maintenance treatment with IFN-alpha could prevent viral breakthrough and achieve rapid virological response (RVR) and early virological response (EVR) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The efficacy and immune response of RBV+PEG-IFN-alpha2b using induction approach with CPIT (novel combination treatment: NCT) in 7 CHC patients with genotype 1b and high viral load were evaluated. A biometric multiplex serum cytokine assay was utilized to characterize the immunomodulatory effect. RVR and EVR were 7/7 and 7/7, respectively. Viral titers dropped below detectable levels in five patients with sustained virological response (SVR) before the end of CPIT (early virological responder: EAVR), and two patients without SVR after the end of CPIT (late virological responder: LAVR). At baseline, in EAVR compared with the controls, IL-6 and IL-15, CXCL-8 and CXCL-10 levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05); IL-10 and IL-13 levels were significantly lower (P < 0.05); and the IL-12 level was lower. In LAVR, GM-CSF, CXCL-8 and CXCL-10, and CCL-4 levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05); and IL-10 and IL-12 were lower than the controls. In EAVR but not LAVR, the IL-12 increased and the CCXL-8 decreased significantly (P < 0.05). In conclusion, NCT-induced viral clearance leading to improvement in the innate immune response resulting in SVR in CHC with genotype 1b and high viral load.
