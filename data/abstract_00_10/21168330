A series of 1,7-diaminoisoquinolinamines, that are expected to mediate antimalarial activity by the same mechanism employed by the chalcones, were produced. Six 7-benzylamino-1-isoquinolinamines were found to be submicromolar inhibitors in vitro of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, with the best possessing activity comparable to chloroquine. Despite being developed from a lead that is a DHFR inhibitor, these compounds do not mediate their antimalarial effects by inhibition of DHFR.
