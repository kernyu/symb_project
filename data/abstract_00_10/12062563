The resistance of gastro-intestinal nematodes of small ruminants (sheep and goat) to benzimidazole anthelmintic drugs seems to be linked primarily to a single mutation in the isotype 1 beta-tubulin gene. This study was carried out to investigate the origin and diversity of benzimidazole-resistance alleles in trichostrongylid nematodes. We sequenced a 550 bp fragment of the isotype 1 beta-tubulin gene from several benzimidazole-resistant Teladorsagia circumcincta populations isolated from dairy goat farms in the central and south-western France. We also sequenced the same beta-tubulin fragment from Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Haemonchus contortus populations in south-western France. We found eight benzimidazole-resistance alleles in all T. circumcincta populations studied, six in H. contortus populations, and only one in T. colubriformis populations. In most cases, only one benzimidazole-resistance allele was present in T. circumcincta and H. contortus populations, but two alleles were found in a fewer number of them. Some T. circumcincta populations shared the same benzimidazole-resistance allele whereas some others had a specific benzimidazole-resistance allele. Similar findings were obtained for H. contortus. As no parasites are introduced once the flock of dairy goat farms has been constituted, these data indicate for the three studied species that rare pre-existing benzimidazole-resistance alleles already present before the isolation of populations had been selected. On the other hand, the fact that some benzimidazole-resistance alleles were specific to one population of T. circumcincta or H. contortus, seems to be in agreement with the hypothesis of the selection of spontaneous mutations. Thus, the origin of benzimidazole-resistance alleles in trichostrongylid nematodes seems to involve primarily the selection of rare alleles and possibly of spontaneous mutations.
