We have developed the [5-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-furyl]acrylic acid substituted benzophenone 4g as a novel lead for anti-malarial agents. Here, we demonstrated that the acyl residue at the 2-amino group of the benzophenone core structure has to be a phenylacetic acid substructure substituted in its para-position with methyl or other substituents of similar size. The trifluoromethyl substituted derivative displayed an IC(50) of 47 nM against the multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain Dd2.
