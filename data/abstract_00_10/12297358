During 1999-2000, 5015 isolates were collected from 13 countries and tested against levofloxacin. Overall, levofloxacin resistance minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC>or =8 mg/l) was found in 40 isolates (0.8%). The highest resistance rates were in Hong Kong (8.0%), China (3.3%) and Spain (1.6%). Levofloxacin retained an MIC(90) of 1 mg/l in all countries. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of resistant isolates demonstrated the presence of clones in countries where levofloxacin resistance exceeded 1%, suggesting that the elevated resistance rates could result from resistant clones within participating hospitals. DNA-sequence analysis of the quinolone-resistance-determining regions of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes showed that the most common mutations were in GyrA (Ser81Phe), ParC (Ser79Phe, Lys137Asn) and ParE (Ile460Val), accounting for 40% of the isolates tested. Levofloxacin-resistant isolates were generally non-susceptible to other fluoroquinolones tested. Future studies to characterise resistant isolates by other molecular methods may ensure that the appropriate counter-measures can be taken to control the spread of resistant isolates.
