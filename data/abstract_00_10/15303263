Eight 2-arylbenzofurans and an isoflavone isolated from medicinal plants were tested for their antimicrobial activities against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Among these compounds, six hydrophobic 2-arylbenzofurans (log P = 4.4-8.7) exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against five VRE strains(VanA-, VanB-, and VanC-phenotypes) (MICs = 3.13-6.25 microg/mL). Five compounds also showed antibacterial activity against ten MRSA strains (MIC80 = 3.13 microg/mL).
