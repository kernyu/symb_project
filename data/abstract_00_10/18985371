The objective of this study is to present the antimicrobial management modalities of treating upper respiratory tract (URT) and head and neck infections. This article discusses the current antimicrobial treatment strategies of URT and head and neck infections. The increasing antimicrobial resistance of many bacterial pathogens has made the treatment of URT and head and neck infections more difficult. This review summarizes the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology and antimicrobials therapy of acute and chronic URT and head and neck infections. These infections include dental (gingivitis, periodontitis, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, and periodontal abscess), acute and chronic otitis media, mastoiditis and sinusitis, pharyngo-tonsillitis, peritonsillar, retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses, suppurative thyroiditis, cervical lymphadenitis, parotitis, siliadenitis, and deep neck infections including Lemierre syndrome. In conclusion, the proper management of these infections requires an accurate clinical and bacteriological diagnosis.
