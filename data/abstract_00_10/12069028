Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an increasingly recognized cause of nosocomial infection of special interest because of its resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. We report a case of generalized infection by S. maltophilia, including meningitis, bacteremia and respiratory tract infection, in a patient who had undergone multiple neurosurgical procedures and who was treated with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole.
