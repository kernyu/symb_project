BACKGROUND/AIMS: To elucidate the mechanisms of action of interferon (IFN) against hepatitis C virus (HCV), we studied the serum HCV dynamics of free-virions (FV) and immune-complexes (IC) in patients treated with IFN. METHODS: FV and IC were separated by immunoprecipitation using anti-human immunoglobulin and quantified serially using real-time detection-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Initially [1st phase (0-24 h)], the FV decreased more rapidly compared to IC [exponential decay slope (EDS)=1.78+/-0.42 vs. 0.99+/-0.31 log10/day, P<0.001; half-life=5.65+/-2.02 vs. 12.5+/-2.83 h, P<0.0001], but at the 2nd phase (1-14 days), half-life of FV was significantly longer than that of IC (101+/-117 vs. 14.2+/-1.08 h, P<0.005). Regarding response to IFN, the decline slope was not significantly different at the 1st phase, but at the 2nd phase, the FV-HCV RNA decreased more slowly in non-responders than in sustained responders to IFN (EDS=0.05+/-0.02 vs. 0.34+/-0.19 log10/day, P<0.005; half-life=186+/-112 vs. 15.3+/-1.85 h, P<0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of escape mutants from the neutralizing antibodies may be involved in resistance to IFN. Analyzes of FV- and IC-HCV dynamics are useful for predicting the IFN efficacy and understanding the mechanism of IFN action in chronic hepatitis patients.
