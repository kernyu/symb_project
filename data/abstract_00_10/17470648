A new natural IND-type metallo-beta-lactamase variant, IND-5, was identified in a clinical isolate of Chryseobacterium indologenes. IND-5 shared 92.8% and 92.4% amino acid homology with IND-1 and IND-3, respectively. Purified enzyme (pI = 8.8, M(r) = 25,000) was able to hydrolyze penicillins, some narrow- and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, and carbapenems but not monobactams.
