The present study was carried out to screen and analyze the genetic characteristics of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli strains isolated from chicken meat marketed in the local markets of the Taif region in Saudi Arabia. A total of 119 samples were purchased from various supermarkets and examined for bacterial contamination with resistant E. coli. Thirty-seven E. coli isolates were evaluated for their antibiotic susceptibilities and the presence of class 1 integrons and antibiotic resistance genes. Results of antibiograms revealed that E. coli isolates were resistant to one or more of the antibiotics tested. Resistance was most frequently observed against sulphafurazole (89.2%), ampicillin (78.4%), nalidixic acid (70.3%), streptomycin (48.6%), chloramphenicol (32.4%), and gentamicin (24.3%). Fifteen E. coli strains have multidrug resistance phenotypes and harbored at least three antibiotic resistance genes. The bla(TEM) (beta-lactamase) and sul (sulfonamide) resistance encoding genes were detected in all the tested isolates. Polymerase chain reaction screening detected class 1 integrons in all multiresistant E. coli isolates. The present study provides an assessment of the occurrence of multidrug resistance of E. coli from raw chicken meat collected from local markets.
