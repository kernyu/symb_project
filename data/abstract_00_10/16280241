Fifty faecal samples from healthy adults were grown on MacConkey agar and three pink colonies were subcultured, identified to species level and their antimicrobial susceptibility determined. Forty-seven samples yielded 141 isolates of Escherichia coli that were susceptible to most antimicrobials. Resistance was noted for ampicillin (30.5%), chloramphenicol (12.1%), tetracycline (23.4%), trimethoprim (24.8%) and co-trimoxazole (22.7%). A direct faecal plating method was used for extended resistance screening with E. coli as the indicator organism. Zone breakpoints were determined using normalised resistance interpretation and gave similar susceptibility results. Eighty-eight isolates of E. coli from within the zones of inhibition revealed four times more antimicrobial resistance. Extended antimicrobial resistance screening both provides the susceptibility profile of the dominant E. coli isolate and detects greater resistance in rare isolates.
