Two unrelated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, one with a single mutation in grlA, the other with multiple mutations in gyrA, gyrB, grlA, grlB, norA and the norA promoter region, encoding low-level and high-level ciprofloxacin resistance, respectively, were studied. The characterized mutations in these genes were conserved when both strains were passaged for at least 500 generations in an antibiotic-free environment. New, rapidly stabilized mutations and higher MICs were detected for strains passaged in sub-MIC ciprofloxacin concentrations. The seeming irreversibility of quinolone resistance may affect the long-term success of this drug class.
