OBJECTIVE: To investigate the active efflux of fluoroquinolones in clinical isolated strains of Escherichia coli. METHODS: The accumulation of ciprofloxacin and tosufloxacin for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and the effect of glucose and Carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) on the uptake of Escherichia coli were determined by a modified fluorometric assay. RESULTS: The accumulation of ciprofloxacin in sensitive and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) organisms decreased with energy dependence, and the decrease in MDR isolate was prominent. Incubation with CCCP increased the accumulation of ciprofloxacin up to three-fold in MDR isolate but not in sensitive isolate. In contrast, CCCP appeared to have no influence on the uptake of tosufloxacin in Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that energy-dependent active efflux is one of the mechanisms of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones resistance, but it does not play any role in hydrophobic fluoroquinolones resistance in Escherichia coli.
