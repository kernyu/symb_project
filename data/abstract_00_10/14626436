Methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are implicated in serious infections and nosocomial outbreaks, and show resistance to a wide range of antibiotics, thus limiting the treatment options. Therefore, rapid detection is clinically crucial for both treatment and infection control measures. This study assessed the performance of a rapid latex agglutination kit marketed to detect MRSA clinical isolates (MRSA-Screen test Denka Seiken Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) based on detecting a specific penicillin binding protein 2a (PBP2a) in comparison to the NCCLS oxacillin salt agar screen plate, the 1 microg oxacillin disk diffusion test, and the oxacillin MIC by E-test. Testing was carried out on 133 isolates consisting of 99 MRSA and 34 methicillin sensitive strains of S. aureus (MSSA). Concordant results were observed between the latex kit and all the other tests for the 99 MRSA isolates. Only 1 of the 34 MSSA isolates gave a positive agglutination reaction in the latex kit. The kit sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 100% and 97%, respectively. This reliable performance indicates that the MRSA-Screen latex test is very useful test for the rapid detection of MRSA isolates in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
