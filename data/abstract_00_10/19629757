Improving pristinamycin production from Streptomyces pristinaespiralis was performed by introducing the resistance gene ptr followed by selection for enhanced tolerance to pristinamycin and fermentation test. To transfer ptr into S. pristinaespiralis, an effective method was established for the first time by using the intergeneric conjugation of DNA from Escherichia coli to S. pristinaespiralis. The procedure was optimized with heat treatment, spore concentration, optimum medium used in conjugation, concentration of MgCl(2), etc. With the optimized conditions, the conjugation frequency was up to 1.36 x 10(-3) exconjugants per recipient. The procedure was used to transfer the ptr gene into S. pristinaespiralis, resulting in 146 exconjugants. These exconjugants were screened on the pristinamycin-resistant plates, and then the fermentation test subsequently. Finally, two strains (SPR1 and SPR2) were obtained with a high yield of 0.11 and 0.15 g/l, respectively, which is about six to eight times more than that of wild-strain ATCC25486. The subculture experiments indicated that the hereditary character of the high-producing S. pristinaespiralis SPR1 and SPR2 was stable. Our work suggests that introducing resistance gene ptr into S. pristinaespiralis could be the way to improve the production of pristinamycin through the enhancement of antibiotic tolerance.
