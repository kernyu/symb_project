Bacteremia is a complex clinical syndrome in constant transformation that is an important, growing cause of morbidity and mortality. Even though there is a great deal of specific information about bacteremia, few comprehensive reviews integrate this information with a practical AIM. The main objective of these Guidelines, which target hospital physicians, is to improve the clinical care provided to patients with bacteremia by integrating blood culture results with clinical data, and optimizing the use of diagnostic procedures and antimicrobial testing. The document is structured into sections that cover the epidemiology and etiology of bacteremia, stratified according to the various patient populations, and the diagnostic work-up, therapy, and follow-up of patients with bacteremia. Diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are presented as recommendations based on the grade of available scientific evidence.
