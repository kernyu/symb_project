Viridans streptococci are a major cause of infective endocarditis, and penicillin non-susceptibility is increasing in these organisms. We present the initial reported case of infective endocarditis due to penicillin non-susceptible viridans streptococci successfully treated with ceftriaxone monotherapy. The lack of evidence supporting the recommendations for treatment of endocarditis due to penicillin non-susceptible viridans streptococci is discussed.
