OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was made from November 1999 to May 2002 in order to revaluate the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine in pediatric Plamodium falciparum malaria in Ivory Coast. DESIGN: This study was included in the national Plasmodium falciparum-susceptibility supervision program. Two hundred and fifty-six out of 594 patients from six to 59 months of age were included. Chloroquine was administered in accordance with the standard 14 day WHO protocol; i.e. administered dose of 25 mg/kg, in split doses, over three days. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-seven patients completed the treatment. Among these, 217 presented with adequate clinical response (87.8%). The percentage of therapeutic failure was 12.2% with 12 early cases of therapeutic failure and 18 late cases of therapeutic failure. Chloroquine was more efficacious in Agnibilekrou (11.3% of therapeutic failure), Bondoukou (10.4%), and Tanda (10%), than in Abengourou (16.4%). Parasitic reduction on patients with resistant Plasmodium was superior to 90%, from day 0 to day 3. The risk of therapeutic failure was significantly linked to patient age. CONCLUSION: Considering these results, the authors suggest that the first-line treatment with chloroquine must be continued for uncomplicated malaria in humans.
