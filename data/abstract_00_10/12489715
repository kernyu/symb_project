Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 20 antimicrobial agents were determined against 51 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from bovine intramammary infections. Fourteen (27.4%) isolates were resistant to benzylpenicillin, but none of the isolates was resistant to cloxacillin, nafcillin, or cephems. Among aminoglycosides, gentamicin was the most active, with an MIC50 of 0.2 microg/ml, followed by kanamycin, with an MIC50 of 0.78 microg/ml. Five isolates (9.8%) were resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, three isolates (5.9%) to kanamycin and two isolates (3.9%) to gentamicin. Resistance to erythromycin was observed in two isolates (3.9%). Tylosin was less active than erythromycin, with MIC50s of 1.56 microg/ml versus 0.39 microg/ml, but none of the isolates was resistant to this antibiotic. Oxytetracycline MICs were situated in the range of 0.39-1.56 microg/ml for 48 susceptible isolates. Although 19 (37.3%) isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents, a single resistance pattern was most frequent: benzylpenicillin (12 isolates), dihydrostreptomycin (two isolates) and kanamycin (one isolate). There were no isolates resistant to antimicrobial agents such as methicillin, lincomycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol and virginiamycin, which have not been approved for use in cattle husbandry in Japan.
