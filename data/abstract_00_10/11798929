OBJECTIVE: To investigate the population biology of Streptococcus pneumoniae carried by healthy children. METHODS: Drug resistant patterns and serotypes of 222 strains were determined. PFGE, BOX PCR and pbp fingerprint techniques were used to analyze the homology among strains. RESULTS: Among 222 nasopharyngeal isolates from 5 day-care centers, there were 32 penicillin intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP, MIC 0.125 approximately 1 mg/L), and no penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP, MIC >/= 2 mg/L) was found. The main serotypes of all strains were 23F (25.7%), 6A (13.1%), 19F (10.8%), and 6B (8.1%). The serotypes of PISP were mainly 23F (50%), 19A (15.6%) and 19F (15.6%). Among the 32 PISP strains, 8 BOX PCR clusters and 7 PFGE types were identified. The resistance patterns, serotypes, BOX PCR and pbp fingerprints of PFGE type A strains were highly consistent. In day care center (DCC) SY, the penicillin resistant rate was 31.8%, being much higher than the average level. Twenty of the 21 PISP strains isolated from this DCC belonged to PFGE type A or B. CONCLUSIONS: The penicillin resistant rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae carried by healthy children in 5 DCCs of Shanghai was still low. However in one DCC, there could be a prevalence of some resistant clones which resulted in high penicillin resistant rate.
