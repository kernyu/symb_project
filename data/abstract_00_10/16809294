We have identified dihydroxythiophenes (DHT) as a novel series of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase inhibitors with broad antiviral activities against different HIV isolates in vitro. DHT were discovered in a biochemical integrase high-throughput screen searching for inhibitors of the strand transfer reaction of HIV-1 integrase. DHT are selective inhibitors of integrase that do not interfere with virus entry, as shown by the inhibition of a vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped retroviral system. Moreover, in quantitative real-time PCR experiments, no effect on the synthesis of viral cDNA could be detected but rather an increase in the accumulation of 2-long-terminal-repeat cycles was detected. This suggests that the integration of viral cDNA is blocked. Molecular modeling and the structure activity relationship of DHT demonstrate that our compound fits into a two-metal-binding motif that has been suggested as the essential pharmacophore for diketo acid (DKA)-like strand transfer inhibitors (Grobler et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:6661-6666, 2002.). This notion is supported by the profiling of DHT on retroviral vectors carrying published resistance mutations for DKA-like inhibitors where DHT showed partial cross-resistance. This suggests that DHT bind to a common site in the catalytic center of integrase, albeit with an altered binding mode. Taken together, our findings indicate that DHT are novel selective strand transfer inhibitors of integrase with a pharmacophore homologous to DKA-like inhibitors.
