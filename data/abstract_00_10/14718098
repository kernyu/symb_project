To assess fluoroquinolone susceptibility of Campylobacter strains in Senegal, skin samples were collected from 250 chicken carcasses from January 2001 to October 2002. Among 205 isolated Campylobacter strains, 59% and 41% were identified as Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, respectively; the overall ciprofloxacin-resistance rate was 34%.
