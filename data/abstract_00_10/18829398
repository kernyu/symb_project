BACKGROUND: This study was designed to address the concern that intensive regimens to eradicate early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in patients with cystic fibrosis may lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant isolates. METHODS: Data was analysed retrospectively over a 10 year period at the Leeds Regional Paediatric Cystic Fibrosis Centre. All patients with first-ever isolation of P. aeruginosa who successfully completed an eradication regimen were included. Antibiotic sensitivities of P. aeruginosa were compared between initial and subsequent re-isolations in patients where eradication was successful and in those where treatment had failed. RESULTS: Forty one patients with first acquisitions for P. aeruginosa and who completed eradication treatment were identified. Eradication treatments consisted of oral, intravenous, nebulised antibiotics or a combination of these. The antibiotic sensitivity of P. aeruginosa in first growths was high and remained so on subsequent re-isolations. A repeated measures logistic model found no significant difference with time of isolation. There was no statistically significant difference in antibiotic sensitivity between P. aeruginosa isolated after successful and failed eradication. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated intensive regimens for P. aeruginosa eradication did not result in a significant increase in overall antibiotic resistance between initial and subsequent growths of this organism over the period of this study.
