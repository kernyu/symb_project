Screening and development of new antibiotic activities to counteract the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) human pathogenic bacteria has once again become a priority in human chemotherapy. Here we describe a novel mammalian cell culture-based screening platform for the detection of streptogramin antibiotics. Quinupristin-dalfopristin (Synercid), a synthetically modified streptogramin, is presently the sole effective agent in the treatment of some MDR nosocomial infections. A Streptomyces coelicolor transcriptional regulator (Pip) has been adapted to modulate reporter gene expression (SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase) in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) in response to streptogramin antibiotics. This CHO cell-based technology was more sensitive in detecting the production of the model streptogramin pristinamycin, from Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, than antibiogram tests using a variety of human pathogenic bacteria as indicator strains. The reporter system was able to detect pristinamycin compound produced by a single S. pristinaespiralis colony. The assay was rapid (17 hours) and could be carried out in a high-throughput 96-well plate assay format or a 24-well transwell set-up. This novel mammalian cell-based antibiotic screening concept enables detection of bioavailable and non-cytotoxic representatives of a particular class of antibiotics in a single assay and represents a promising alternative to traditional antibiogram-based screening programs.
