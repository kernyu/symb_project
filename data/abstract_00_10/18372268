A case of decubitus ulcer infected with multidrug-resistant Enterococcus raffinosus is reported in this article. This is the first report of wound infection caused by an Enterococcus raffinosus isolate resistant to antibiotics other than beta-lactams, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin. This case adds to the knowledge base concerning the onset of antibiotic resistance in this uncommon species and confirms the emerging role of daptomycin as a promising alternative in therapy of severe difficult-to-treat enterococcal infections.
