PURPOSE: This study characterized 99mTc-Mebrofenin (MEB) and 99mTc-Sestamibi (MIBI) hepatic transport and preferential efflux routes (canalicular vs. basolateral) in rat and human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). METHODS: 99mTc-MEB and 99mTc-MIBI disposition was determined in suspended hepatocytes and in SCH in the presence and absence of inhibitors and genetic knockdown of breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp). RESULTS: The general organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp/OATP) inhibitor rifamycin SV reduced initial 99mTc-MEB uptake in rat and human suspended hepatocytes. Initial 99mTc-MIBI uptake in suspended rat hepatocytes was not Na+-dependent or influenced by inhibitors. Multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp2/MRP2) inhibitors decreased 99mTc-MEB canalicular efflux in rat and human SCH. 99mTc-MEB efflux in human SCH was predominantly canalicular (45.8 +/- 8.6%) and approximately 3-fold greater than in rat SCH. 99mTc-MIBI canalicular efflux was similar in human and rat SCH; basolateral efflux was 37% greater in human than rat SCH. 99mTc-MIBI cellular accumulation, biliary excretion index and in vitro biliary clearance in rat SCH were unaffected by Bcrp knockdown. CONCLUSION: 99mTc-MEB hepatic uptake is predominantly Oatp-mediated with biliary excretion by Mrp2. 99mTc-MIBI appears to passively diffuse into hepatocytes; biliary excretion is mediated by P-gp. The SCH model is useful to investigate factors that may alter the route and/or extent of hepatic basolateral and canalicular efflux of substrates.
