Docetaxel is one of the most active drugs in second-line therapy for non-small-cell-lung-carcinoma (NSCLC). The aim of this multicenter study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of weekly low-dose docetaxel. Forty-two patients with advanced NSCLC pretreated with cisplatinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled. Docetaxel was administered at a dose of 25 mg/m(2) weekly for 12 consecutive weeks. A total of 386 doses were given with a median number of 10 doses per patient (range: 3-12). Treatment showed low incidence of hematologic toxicity and modest non-hematologic toxicity. An episode of grade 4 thrombocytopenia was reported but no episodes of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Most frequent non-hematologic toxicities were asthenia and alopecia. Response rate was 10.5% and median survival time (MST) was 12.8 weeks. Weekly treatment with 25 mg/m(2) docetaxel for 12 consecutive weeks appears to be a feasible and active regimen with mild toxicity in heavily pretreated NSCLC patients.
