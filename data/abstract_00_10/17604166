In this preliminary study we report the activity of 3-methyl-9-substituted-6-oxo-6,9-dihydro-3H-[1,2,3]-triazolo[4,5-h]quinolone-carb oxylic acids and their esters as a new class of antiinfective agents against MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In antitubercular screening against H37Rv and 11 clinically isolated strains of M. tuberculosis several derivatives (1o,3a,c,i,j,p) showed MIC(90) in the range 0.5-3.2 microg/mL. 3c showed no cytotoxicity and proved to be the most potent derivative exhibiting MIC(90)=0.5 microg/mL against all M. tuberculosis strains and infected human macrophages (J774-A1) tested.
