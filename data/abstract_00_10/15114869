The double-disk synergy test (DDST) using Mueller-Hinton agar and antibiotic disks with centrally positioned disks of amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and piperacillin-tazobactam and, at a center-to-center distance of 25-30 mm, 2-4 disks with 10 various beta-lactam antibiotics per one plate was performed in 58 clinical isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia to determine the effectivity of 3 beta-lactamase inhibitors. When tested with clavulanate as the central beta-lactamase inhibitor synergic action on tested strains was the most frequent with aztreonam (81.0% of strains), cefoperazone (63.8%), and cefepime (60.3%). With sulbactam the synergic action, i.e. DDST positivity, was high in the case of cefoperazone (15.5%), ampicillin, aztreonam and piperacillin (8.6% each); with tazobactam it was the most frequent with aztreonam (53.4%), cefoperazone (44.8%) and cefepime (37.9%). No synergy was demonstrated after application of meropenem regardless of the kind of beta-lactamase inhibitor used. In 58 strains of S. maltophilia, 55 different profiles of DDST positivity were found. The results confirm that clavulanate is the most effective inhibitor of S. maltophilia beta-lactamases. The utilization of DDST (performed in the recommended way) for the typization of strains Stenotrophomonas species and for the estimation of potential effectiveness combinations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors for the therapy of stenotrophomonade infections was suggested.
