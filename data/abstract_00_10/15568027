Human healthy skin is continuously exposed to bacteria, but is particularly resistant to the common gut bacterium Escherichia coli. We show here that keratinocytes secrete, as the main E. coli-killing compound, the S100 protein psoriasin in vitro and in vivo in a site-dependent way. In vivo treatment of human skin with antibodies to psoriasin inhibited its E. coli-killing properties. Psoriasin was induced in keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo by E. coli, indicating that its focal expression in skin may derive from local microbial induction. Zn(2+)-saturated psoriasin showed diminished antimicrobial activity, suggesting that Zn(2+) sequestration could be a possible antimicrobial mechanism. Thus, psoriasin may be key to the resistance of skin against E. coli.
