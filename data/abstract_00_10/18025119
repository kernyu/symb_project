Among 10,872 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from a nationwide study of 88 French hospitals in 2005, 169 (1.7%) expressed an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. The most prevalent species were Escherichia coli (48.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (23.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%). Molecular analysis underlined the polyclonal spread of CTX-M-expressing E. coli, primarily isolates of the CTX-M-1 subgroup.
