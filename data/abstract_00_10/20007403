We retrospectively evaluated 410 patients with coinfection or cocolonization due to vancomycin-resistant (VR) enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The prevalence rate was 19.8%. Risk factors included isolation of VR Enterococcus faecalis and use of linezolid or clindamycin. Inc18-like vanA plasmids were found in 7% of VR E. faecalis isolates and none of the VR E. faecium isolates.
