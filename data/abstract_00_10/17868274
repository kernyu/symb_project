The management of patients with pre-existing tuberculosis (TB) undergoing liver transplantation is challenging. Cautious immunosuppression is required to prevent reactivation of disease, and second-line anti-tuberculous treatment may be necessary to prevent graft hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, liver transplantation in the context of isoniazid-resistant TB has seldom been reported. We report on a 44-year-old man with recent isoniazid-resistant extra-pulmonary TB who developed subacute hepatic failure requiring emergency liver transplantation and treatment with second-line anti-tuberculous therapy. We demonstrate that patients who have pre-existing TB can be successfully treated with alternative anti-tuberculous medication while under immunosuppression post transplantation. Pre-existing TB, including resistant strains, should not be an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation.
