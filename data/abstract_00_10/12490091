OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological status of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and the drug resistance profiles of such organisms. METHODS: A total of 282 clinical isolates of E. coli and 180 of K. pneumoniae were collected from different districts of Zhejiang Province. Inhibitor potentiated broth dilution tests were performed for detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Etests were performed to detect the drug resistance of these strains against nine commonly used antibiotics. RESULTS: The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 34.0% and 38.3%, respectively. The average prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 35.7%. The resistance prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains to ceftazidime and cefotaxime was 40% and 26% respectively, so were those to cefepime, cefoxitin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. All these strains were sensitive to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results in this study showed that the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was high, while extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains were resistant to most antimicrobial agents except imipenem.
