Bloodstream infections are a serious complication among critical patients. The detection of microbial pathogens in blood cultures is an important diagnostic tool. This study aimed to isolate and characterize bacteria from the blood of patients admitted to the clinical intensive care unit of a teaching hospital, between April 2003 and April 2004. The bacteria isolated were identified by biochemical/enzymatic tests and detection of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile using the disk diffusion method. A total of 304 blood cultures from 195 patients were evaluated. Forty-nine (16.1%) of the blood cultures presented microbe development. The predominant species was Pseudomonas stutzeri (18.2%). Gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria showed greater resistance to ampicillin; vancomycin and linezolid were the most active agents for Gram-positive cocci and carbapenems for Gram-negative rods. Because of the impact of bloodstream infection within the hospital context, additional studies are needed in order to give backing for prevention and control measures.
