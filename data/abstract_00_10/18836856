We evaluated the usefulness of dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO)-based multiplex PCR, Seeplex HBV Lami-DR assay (Seegene Institute of Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea), to detect lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants in a comparison with the use of TRUGENE HBV genotyping and restriction fragment mass polymorphism (RFMP). Sera from 44 chronic hepatitis B patients were analyzed for the presence of mutations at codons 180 and 204 by performing DPO-based multiplex PCR, RFMP, and TRUGENE. The overall concordance rate among the three assays was 40.9% (18/44). Concordance rates between multiplex PCR and RFMP or multiplex PCR and TRUGENE were 61.4% (27/44) and 50.0% (22/44), respectively. In ten patients, multiplex PCR identified additional mutants not found using the other two methods. DPO-based multiplex PCR is a highly sensitive method to identify minor mutant populations and could be a practical tool in the monitoring of lamivudine resistance.
