Conjugates of three components namely folic acid, poly(ethyleneglycol) and 3 '-azido-3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT) are presented. Folate-PEG units were coupled to AZT to facilitate delivery of the nucleoside into the cell. A convenient separation of the polydisperse PEGylated-folic acid regioisomers produced upon conjugation is described. This is to select for the active gamma-regioisomer over the inactive alpha-regioisomer. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were conducted against an ovarian cell line (A2780/AD) that overexpresses the folate receptor (FR) and compared to a FR free control cell line. Compared to AZT a approximately 20-fold greater potency against the resistant ovarian line was observed for the conjugates.
