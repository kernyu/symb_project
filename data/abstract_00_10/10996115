BACKGROUND: Genotypic resistance of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) against lamivudine evolves within months after onset of therapy. OBJECTIVES: To determine the longitudinal order in which resistance mutations appear and to compare the kinetics and pathogenicity of wild-type and resistant HBV. STUDY DESIGN: In a longitudinal study, consecutive samples were drawn over a period of 28 months from a patient with chronic hepatitis B, and resistance mutations were followed by sequencing a part of the polymerase region of HBV. These data were compared with HBV copy numbers, HBsAg and ALT levels, and results of consecutive liver biopsies. RESULTS: After 21 weeks of treatment, a silent mutation at codon 528 (CTG to TTG) occurred. Significant genotypic resistance was detectable after 68 weeks, indicated by a substitution of isoleucine for methionine at residue 552 (M552I). Nineteen weeks later, the virus exhibited additional resistance-associated mutations (L528M and I552V). The resulting high-level resistance was reflected by an increase of serum HBV copies of 4.7 log(10). The turnover of wild-type and resistant HBV was 2.6x10(6) and 1.8x10(6) virions/day, respectively. HBsAg and ALT levels were lower within the period when resistant HBV was detectable. During treatment the progress of liver fibrosis was arrested. CONCLUSIONS: The in vivo replicative capacities and dynamics of wild-type and resistant HBV were similar. However, resistant HBV seemed to exhibit reduced pathogenicity.
