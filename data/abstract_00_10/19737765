The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute published in 2008 new interpretive criteria for the identification of methicillin resistance in staphylococci isolated from animals. The sensitivity of the 2008 interpretive criteria for mecA gene-positive Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, compared with the previous criteria of 2004, was investigated. Thirty clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius from dogs were used. The presence of the mecA gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction. The minimum inhibitory concentration for oxacillin was determined by broth microdilution. The 2008 breakpoint of >or=4 microg/ml for methicillin resistance resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 73.3% (22/30). The 2004 breakpoint guideline of >or=0.5 microg/ml resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 97% (29/30). For oxacillin disk diffusion, the 2008 interpretive criterion of <or=10 mm for methicillin resistance resulted in a sensitivity of 70% (21/30). If intermediate isolates (11 or 12 mm) were considered resistant, the sensitivity was 93% (28/30). If intermediate isolates (11 or 12 mm) were considered resistant, the sensitivity was 93% (28/30). Application of the 2004 interpretive criterion of <or=17 mm resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% (30/30). For cefoxitin disk diffusion, the interpretive criterion of <or=21 mm for methicillin resistance (as used for Staphylococcus aureus) resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 6.7% (2/30). The interpretive criterion of <or=24 mm (as used for coagulase-negative staphylococci) resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 43.3% (13/30). With the use of 2008 interpretive criteria, all 3 tests produced what we consider to be an unacceptable level of false negative results. Our findings also suggest that cefoxitin disk diffusion is an inappropriate screening test for methicillin resistance of canine S. pseudintermedius.
