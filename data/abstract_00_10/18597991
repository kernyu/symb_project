AIM: To determine daily dynamics of antibacterial resistance as well as antilysozyme and coagulase activity of S. aureus strains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On an example of clinical strains of S.aureus isolated from patients with surgical infections daily dynamics of biological characteristics of staphylococci was studied. After 12 hours of incubation strains were tested for coagulase activity by standard method (test tube method), antilysozyme activity by photometric method, and antibacterial resistance by method of serial dilutions in agar. Tests were repeated each 3-hours during a day. RESULTS: Variation of levels of studied biological characteristics of staphylococci during a day was revealed. Structures of coagulase and antilysozyme circadian rhythms had some differences in different S. aureus strains. Alongside with it, similarity in temporal expression of such biological characteristics of staphylococci as antibacterial resistance and antilysozyme activity was noted. CONCLUSION: Obtained data open prospect to use biorhythmological approach in study of biological characteristics of microorganisms during evaluation of their mechanisms of adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Chronobiological approach allows to reveal periods of maximal expression of S. aureus characteristics that could be used for increasing of effectiveness of antibacterial treatment by the choice of optimal time for administration of antibiotic.
