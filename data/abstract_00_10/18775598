OBJECTIVE: To characterize organisms causing wound infection following abdominal hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN: All patients who underwent an abdominal hysterectomy (December 2002-January 2006) and developed abdominal wall wound infection proven by a positive culture were included in the study. Patient information was collected from the computerized files. The isolated microorganisms were characterized for antibiotics susceptibility. RESULTS: Sixty-eight (68/620, 10.96%) patients had positive wound cultures. Of 100 isolated microorganisms, 44 were resistant to cefonicid (prophylactic treatment) and 15 were resistant to combined ampicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole (empirical treatment). Major co-morbidities (including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, past malignancies, renal, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, hypothyroidism or anemia), were found to be significantly associated with pseudomonal infection (P<.008). CONCLUSION: A significant portion of pathogens causing post-hysterectomy abdominal wall wound infection are resistant to the prophylactic treatment, and some are resistant to the empirical treatment. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of various prophylactic regimens with better coverage of Enterococcus fecalis, as well as the effectiveness of empirical treatment active against the resistant Enterobacteriaceae group.
