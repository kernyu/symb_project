The in vitro effect of nine antibiotic combinations was investigated in Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms using ATP-bioluminescence for viable bacterial cell quantification. Four slime-producing (SP) strains were used to form biofilms 6, 24 and 48 h old. These biofilms were exposed for 24 h to antibiotics at 4 x, 2 x, 1 x and 0.5 x MIC. Combinations involving tetracycline together with another antibiotic were the most efficient at the biofilm age and concentration range under study. The combination vancomycin-rifampicin produced the highest bactericidal effect on 6 h biofilms at 4 x MIC, but this effect decreased dramatically in older biofilms. To detect possible antibiotic synergy in combinations that had a significant killing effect, antibiotics were studied not only in combination but also individually. Synergic effects were observed in all the combinations tested. Differences between the effect in combination and the sum of individual antibiotic effects (degree of synergy) were significant (mostly P< 0.001) and exceeded 1 log10 cfu/mL in the majority of cases. In 48 h biofilms, antibiotics caused a significant bactericidal effect when applied in combination, but never when used individually. These results indicate that the biofilm test applied allows the detection of synergy between antibiotics and suggests that this assay could be useful in clinical and extensive synergy studies on S. epidermidis biofilms.
