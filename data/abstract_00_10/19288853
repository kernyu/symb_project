Between June 2006 and April 2007, I measured T serotypes and antibiotic susceptibilities of 367 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from children with pharyngotonsillitis in Asahikawa. Prevalent serotypes were 12 (33.8%), 1 (22.9%), and 28 (12.5%). The MIC90s of beta-lactams were 0.008 microg/ml in penicillin G, cefcapene, cefditoren, cefteram, cefdinir and faropenem, and 0.015 microg/ml in amoxicillin. Of 367 isolates, macrolide-resistant (erythromycin > 0.5 micro/ml) strains account for 42 (11.4%).
