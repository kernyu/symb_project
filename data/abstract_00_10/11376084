We evaluated 25 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients at a major Egyptian reference hospital in Assiut, Egypt, who had been treated for at least 1 year for tuberculosis. Typing patterns (IS6110) were diverse, and multidrug resistance was found among 11 (44%) of the isolates. Mutations associated with antimicrobial drug resistance were found in rpoB, katG, rpsL, and embB in the resistant isolates.
