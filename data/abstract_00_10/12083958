The past 30 years have witnessed the emergence of new infectious diseases as well as the re-emergence of those thought to be defeated or under control. It is likely that this threat will continue and that infectious micro-organisms will be found to be responsible for numerous diseases whose etiology had been previously unknown. Compounding this threat is the rapid evolution of drug resistance by micro-organisms that is rendering many existing antimicrobial agents obsolete. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new classes of antimicrobial agents and the identification of new drug targets. Over the past decade, advances in high-throughput automated DNA sequencing have delivered a wealth of genetic information in the form of whole genome sequences of microbial pathogens. Coupled with this advancement has been the development of new genetic tools and computational advances capable of selecting genes of particular interest as well as testing for the effects of candidate drugs. While no new drugs have yet been developed, further study into the application and limitations of these new approaches to the identification of novel targets will aid in overcoming the current problem of antimicrobial drug resistance.
