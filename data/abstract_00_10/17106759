We evaluated the French Azay-Mycobacteria network for surveillance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance by matching data with those collected through the mandatory notification (MNTB). Sensitivity of Azay was 96% by capture-recapture analysis. Cases reported to MNTB were more often smear-positive than non-reported cases. Concordance of data collected for common cases was excellent for a majority of variables (k > 0.79), excepted for tuberculosis site (k = 0.52). These results suggest a good quality of the network.
