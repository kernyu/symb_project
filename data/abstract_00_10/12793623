Respiratory disease is common in pediatrics and diagnosing pneumonia may be clinically challenging. Changes in pneumococcal resistance and immunization practices continue to change the incidence and etiologies of pneumonia. Careful attention to epidemiologic, seasonal, and specific pediatric clinical factors and using adjunct radiographs and laboratory tests should guide the emergency physician in his or her management strategy, including selection of antibiotics and inpatient or outpatient disposition.
