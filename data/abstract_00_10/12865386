OBJECTIVES: To determine the susceptibility of southern African strains of Yersinia pestis to novel as well as conventional antimicrobial agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MICs of 28 strains of Yersinia pestis from a southern African plague focus were determined by agar dilution. RESULTS: The most active agents were cefditoren and the fluoroquinolones, both conventional and novel. The in vitro activity of macrolides was poor against this member of the Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSION: Further investigation of the novel quinolones olamufloxacin (HSR 903) and ABT 492 in animal models of plague would seem to be justified.
