Ketolides represent the latest group of macrolide antibiotics. Tight binding of ketolides to the ribosome appears to correlate with the presence of an extended alkyl-aryl side chain. Recently developed 6,11-bridged bicyclic ketolides extend the spectrum of platforms used to generate new potent macrolides with extended alkyl-aryl side chains. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the site of binding and the action of bridged macrolides in the ribosomes of Escherichia coli. All the bridged macrolides investigated efficiently protected A2058 and A2059 in domain V of 23S rRNA from modification by dimethyl sulfate and U2609 from modification by carbodiimide. In addition, bridged macrolides that carry extended alkyl-aryl side chains protruding from the 6,11 bridge protected A752 in helix 35 of domain II of 23S rRNA from modification by dimethyl sulfate. Bridged macrolides efficiently displaced erythromycin from the ribosome in a competition binding assay. The A2058G mutation in 23S rRNA conferred resistance to the bridged macrolides. The U2609C mutation, which renders E. coli resistant to the previously studied ketolides telithromycin and cethromycin, barely affected cell susceptibility to the bridged macrolides used in this study. The results of the biochemical and genetic studies indicate that in the E. coli ribosome, bridged macrolides bind in the nascent peptide exit tunnel at the site previously described for other macrolide antibiotics. The presence of the side chain promotes the formation of specific interactions with the helix 35 of 23S rRNA.
