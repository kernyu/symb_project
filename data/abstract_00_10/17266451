Cefdinir is an oral third-generation cephalosporin (also known as an advanced-spectrum or generation cephem) with good in vitro activity against the pathogens responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections. The drug distributes very well in respiratory tract tissues and fluids, as well as skin blisters and ear fluids; its pharmacokinetic profile allows once- or twice-daily administration. Oral cefdinir 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily in adults and adolescents, or 14 mg/kg/day in one or two daily doses in pediatric patients, administered for 5 or 10 days, has shown good clinical and bacteriological efficacy, at least equivalent to that of other oral agents in randomized controlled trials conducted in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, pharyngitis and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections. Cefdinir is well tolerated and the oral suspension has shown superior taste or palatability over other comparator oral antimicrobial agents. Thus, cefdinir continues to represent an important cephalosporin option for the treatment of adult, adolescent and pediatric patients with mild or moderate respiratory tract or cutaneous infections, especially in areas with elevated rates of beta-lactamase production in Haemophilus influenzae and where resistance to other commonly used agents has emerged (e.g., macrolides, penicillins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).
