The spread of the plasmid-mediated carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase OXA-58 was detected in Acinetobacter sp. clinical isolates from southern Europe, the Balkans, and central Turkey. It may contribute significantly to the emergence of carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp., at least in this part of the world.
