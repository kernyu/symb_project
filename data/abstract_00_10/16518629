To obtain data on peritonitis and exit-site and/or tunnel infections (ESI/TI) in Japanese children undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) from January 1999 through June 2003, we surveyed 22 members of the Japanese Study Group of Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis (JSPPD) by questionnaire. One hundred and thirty patients were eligible. Seventy episodes of bacterial peritonitis occurred in 45 patients (0.17 episodes/patient-year), and 123 ESI/TI occurred in 60 patients (0.29 episodes/patient-year). S. aureus and MRSA were found to be the causative organisms in 39% and 13% of the peritonitis episodes, and in 59% and 20% of the ESI/TI, respectively. Tunnel infection was found in 55% of the MRSA peritonitis episodes. Eleven percent of the peritonitis episodes relapsed, and 19% needed hemodialysis. One patient died due to MRSA peritonitis. The PD catheter was removed in all fungal and 78% of MRSA peritonitis. However, the type of organism did not influence the need for catheter-related surgery for ESI/TI. Neither peritonitis nor ESI/TI was prevented by the use of a swan-neck catheter, a downward-pointing exit site, povidone iodine exit-site care, bathing instruments, or nasal mupirocin. In conclusion, MRSA peritonitis was not uncommon in children in Japan, was frequently associated with tunnel infections, and had a poor outcome. No association was found between the occurrence of infection and preventive measures previously reported as effective. Alternative approaches are needed in children, especially for MRSA.
