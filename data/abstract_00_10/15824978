We describe the first reported case of anaerobic sepsis due to Bacteroides fragilis with simultaneous resistance to metronidazole, beta-lactams, beta lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems, macrolides, and tetracyclines. Microbiological cure and clinical improvement was achieved with linezolid therapy, an agent that may be useful for the treatment of multidrug-resistant anaerobic infections.
