This paper reviewed the pathways of bacterial protein secretion and discussed the targets of pathogenic bacteria for antibiotics. Inhibition of protein secretion could lead to the growth decline, morphological alteration, and reduction of bacterial virulence, as well as the deprivation of their drug resistant. It was concluded that protein secretion could be a suitable target for new antibiotic agents.
