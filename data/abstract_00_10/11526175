A biprobe assay utilizing LightCycler technology was developed to detect rifampin resistance-associated gene mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis rpoB gene. Three biprobes detected all mutations present in the 46 rifampin-resistant isolates. Wild-type sequences were correctly identified in each case. The method was reproducible, accurate, and easy to use.
