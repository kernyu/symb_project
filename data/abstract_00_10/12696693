A study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial effect of sodium lactate (NaL) (0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5%) on the survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in 93% lean ground beef. Samples inoculated with a mixture of four strains of E. coli O157:H7 (10(7) to 10(8) CFU/g) were subjected to immersion heating in a water bath stabilized at 55, 57.5, 60, 62.5, or 65 degrees C. Results of statistical analysis indicated that the heating temperature was the only factor affecting the decimal reduction times (D-values) of E. coli O157:H7 in 93% lean ground beef. The change in temperature required to change the D-value (the z-value) was determined as 7.6 degrees C. The thermal resistance of this organism was neither affected by the addition of NaL nor by the interactions between NaL and temperature. Adding NaL to ground beef to reduce the thermal resistance of E. coli O157:H7 is therefore not recommended.
