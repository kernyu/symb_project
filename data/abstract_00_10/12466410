A total of 287 Acinetobacter isolates belonging to DNA groups 2 (A. baumannii) and 13TU was collected consecutively from 46 hospitals and typed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting with primers DAF-4 and ERIC-2. With a similarity coefficient of >/=72% as a cut-off value, 37 clusters of genotypically similar isolates (genotypes) were recognised. Four major clusters, found in 15, 12, 12 and 8 hospitals respectively, accounted for 42% of isolates, but only three of these predominant clusters were associated with outbreaks of infection in individual hospitals. Many of the isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, including expanded-spectrum beta-lactam agents, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, but >98% remained susceptible to carbapenems and colistin. Overall, the study demonstrated that a heterogeneous population of Acinetobacter DNA group 2 and 13TU isolates, frequently showing multiple resistance to antibiotics, was causing infections in UK hospitals, and that four predominant genotypes appeared to have disseminated among geographically distinct locations.
