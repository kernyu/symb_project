Short course regimens; 2HRZ (E)(S)/4HR (E), 6HRS (E)/3-6HR and 6-9HR have been accepted as a standard chemotherapy (SC) for initial treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in Japan. We studied the frequency of the treatment completion, the causes of the treatment failure and the outcome of the patients in whom INH or RFP was discontinued within 6 months after starting SC. The subjects included 597 newly diagnosed culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients admitted to 16 national hospital in 1996. Results were as follows. 1. In 47 (7.9%) of the 597 patients, either INH (19; 3.2%) or RFP (33; 5.5%) was discontinued. These 47 cases were defined as a SC incompleted group and the other 550 as a SC completed group. 2. The patients in the SC incompleted group were seen more frequently in the ages of 20s (11.9%), 50s (10.9%), 60s (11.7%) or 70s (11.4%). 21 (13.6%) of 154 female patients and 26 (5.9%) of 443 male patients were in the SC incompleted group. 3. The causes of cessation of INH or RFP were drug side effects (33; 5.5%), drug resistance (10; 1.7%) and complications or underlying diseases (8; 1.3%). 4. Fever or eruption (19; 3.2%) and drug induced hepatitis (12; 2.0%) were frequently seen as drug related side effects causing the cessation of INH or RFP. 5. The rate of culture negative conversion of TB bacilli at 6 months after the start of the treatment was 98.9% in the SC completed and 88.9% in the SC incompleted group respectively. In the SC incompleted group, there were three cases continuously positive and two other patients who relapsed and became culture positive again. In these five patients, INH or RFP was discontinued because of drug resistance.
