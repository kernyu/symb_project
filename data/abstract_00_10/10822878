In the USA therapeutic suggestions for a more appropriate treatment of community acquired pneumonias, are presently under revision. In this review we underline the difficulties encountered today, at the beginning of the year 2000, in the formulation of appropriate guidelines for this disease, taxed just about constantly by a mortality rate of nearly 8%. We emphasized the problem of bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics and the frequency of polymicrobial pulmonary infections with an obvious worsening of the prognostic outlook. Directions about choice and use of some antibiotics have been provided, citing especially the fluoroquinolones and the more recent one, the moxifloxacine. A recommendation is given as well to pharmaceutical companies for them to provide better directives about the ideal modalities of administration of new antibiotics with the double aim of helping patients and also attempt to prevent onset of bacterial resistance.
