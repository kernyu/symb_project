Phenotypic characteristics, antimicrobial susceptibility, and genetic relationships were analyzed in 107 Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from cows with subclinical mastitis in Southeastern Brazil. Thirteen different biochemical patterns were detected among isolates. A predominant pattern represented by about 54% of the isolates was distributed among several herds. Isolates of distinct phenotypic profiles were also detected within a herd. Susceptibility to ampicillin, cefotaxime, cephalotin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, rifampin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and vancomycin, determined by the disk diffusion method, was observed in 44.9% of isolates. On the other hand, 55.1, 7.4, and 2.8% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin/penicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin, respectively. Genetic diversity was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using SmaI as the restriction enzyme. All isolates could be typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which identified 16 types and 24 subtypes. Type A and its subtypes comprised 54.2% of all isolates and were recovered from 6 of the 9 herds analyzed. Other types and subtypes were also found in multiple herds. Although multiple types and subtypes were found within a specific herd, a predominant type was frequently observed.
