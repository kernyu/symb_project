Malaria, a vector-borne infectious disease, is currently a grave and universal concern with a significant social, economic, and human cost, mainly in developing countries. In addition, the emergence and spread of resistance to antimalarial therapies have further aggravated the global situation. Currently most of the research is focused on development of antimalarial drugs, drug resistance, and novel formulations to maximize the therapeutic effect. A number of novel molecules potentially active against malarial parasites are being developed. A vaccine is still viewed as a critical part of a long-term malaria control strategy. In the last several years various studies have shown significant progress in the development of vaccines against malaria. Advancement in vaccine technology and immunology is being used to develop malaria subunit vaccines that would open up new vistas for effective treatment and control of malaria. The development of an effective malaria vaccine represents one of the most important approaches that would provide a cost-effective intervention in addition to currently available malaria control strategies. An overview on progress in antimalarial vaccines is presented.
