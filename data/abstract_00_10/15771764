AIM: To determine the efficacy of three Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens and factors affecting the eradication results in Finland. METHODS: A total of 342 H. pylori-positive adult patients from primary health care referred for gastroscopy at 23 centres in different parts of Finland were randomized to receive either (i) lansoprazole 30 mg b.d., amoxicillin 1 g b.d. and metronidazole 400 mg t.d.s. (LAM), (ii) lansoprazole 30 mg b.d., amoxicillin 1 g b.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (LAC), or (iii) ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.d., metronidazole 400 mg t.d.s. and tetracycline 500 mg q.d.s. (RMT). A (13)C-urea breath test was performed 4 weeks after therapy. RESULTS: The eradication result could be assessed in 329 cases. Intention-to-treat cure rates of LAM, LAC, and RMT were 78, 91 and 81%. The difference was significant between LAM and LAC (P = 0.01) and between LAC and RMT (P = 0.04). The eradication rates in cases with metronidazole-susceptible vs. -resistant isolates were for LAM 93% vs. 53% (P = 0.00001), for LAC 95% vs. 84%, and for RMT 91% vs. 67% (P = 0.002). Previous antibiotic use, smoking, and coffee drinking reduced the efficacy of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In unselected patients in primary health care, LAC was the most effective first-line eradication.
