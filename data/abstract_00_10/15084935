BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine (CsA) is a substrate for the MDR-1 gene product P-glycoprotein (P-gp). CsA efficacy may be modulated by lymphocyte P-gp expression levels. In this study, CsA inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation in whole-blood cultures ex vivo has been related to (1) lymphocyte P-gp expression and (2) the C3435T polymorphism in the MDR-1 gene, which has been reported to alter P-gp function. METHODS: In 30 renal-transplant recipients taking CsA monotherapy, P-gp expression was measured by flow cytometry. Whole-blood samples were stimulated with purified protein derivative (PPD) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). CsA resistance ex vivo was defined as less than 10% reduction in proliferation with either PPD or PHA at 2 hours compared with 0 hours. RESULTS: CsA resistance was associated with greater P-gp expression using either PPD (median expression, resistant 1.89 vs. sensitive 0.96, P =0.02) or PHA (1.66 vs. 0.96, respectively, P =0.02). Whole-blood CsA levels in resistant and sensitive patients were similar. The C3435T polymorphism did not affect inhibition of proliferation by CsA (P >0.05 for all between genotype group comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that lymphocyte P-gp expression determines the degree of inhibition of proliferation by CsA ex vivo; whether this also affects CsA effectiveness in vivo and therefore graft survival requires further study.
