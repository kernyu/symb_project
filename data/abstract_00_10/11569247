The influence of supernatants and cell extracts of vaginal lactic acid bacilli on the growth, catalase, antilysozyme and anticomplementary activity of S. epidermidis and E. coli was studied. Changes observed in the persistence characteristics of these microorganisms were found to develop in different directions: in S. epidermidis a decrease in antilysozyme activity was mainly observed, while in E. coli the suppression of anticomplementary activity was registered. The modifying influence of lactic acid flora, revealed in this investigation, is regarded as one of the mechanisms facilitating the formation of microbiocenosis and ensuring colonization resistance.
