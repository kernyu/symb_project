The aim of the article was to determine the structure of infections agents in diabetic foot infections and their sensibility to antibiotics A total of 295 microbial isolates were obtained from 115 patients with confirmed diabetic foot infection, treated in 2005-2009 years. Of these aerobes were found in 92.88%, anaerobes - in 7.12%. Microbal associations, various aerbal bacteria were found in 58,49% of cases, associations of aerobes with anaerobes - in 17.92% of cases; from 21.70% of patients were isolated microbial monocultures. The most common gram positive infect in diabetic foot infection was S. aureus, gram negative - P. aeroginosa. Methicillinresistent S. aureus were - 57,52%. In 95.57% of cases S. aureus strains were sensitive to vancomicin. Strains of P.aeruginosa were highly resistant to all investigated antibiotics. Enterobactericeae shown high sensitivity to karbopenemes (95.96%). It is concluded, that success of antimicrobial therapy depends on correct choice of antibiotic, based on in time exposal of etiology of infection, determination of its sensitivity to antimicrobial remedy, considering of its pharmacocinetical features.
