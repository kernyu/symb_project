Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 is an emerging enteric pathogen in swine of increasing medical importance. In this study, the time course and the actin-dependent host signaling processes necessary for invasion of a S. Typhimurium DT104 field isolate were investigated in IPEC J2 epithelial cells derived from porcine small intestine. Internalized bacteria were quantified by a gentamicin resistance assay. DT104 internalization into epithelial monolayers increased steadily between 15 and 120min after apical inoculation. Internalization was reduced by the Rho GTPase inhibitor mevastatin, the N-WASP inhibitor wiskostatin and the actin-disrupting agent cytochalasin D, but not the Rac1 GTPase inhibitor NSC-23766. Early DT104 invasion of porcine enterocytes appears to be mediated by Rac1 GTPase-independent changes in epithelial actin assembly.
