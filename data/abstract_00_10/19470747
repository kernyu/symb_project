Elderly individuals have increased morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases due in part to the progressive age-associated decline in immune function. Despite this, the old mouse model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has revealed a CD8- and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-dependent early resistance to infection. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which CD8 T cells from old mice contributed to the early immune response to M. tuberculosis. Following a low-dose aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis, CD8 T cells were identified as being a dominant source of IFN-gamma expression in the lungs of old mice early after infection, before the typical onset of antigen-specific immunity. In addition, M. tuberculosis-induced IFN-gamma production by CD8 T cells isolated from naive old mice was major histocompatibility complex class I independent but was dependent on interleukin-12p70, confirming an innate role of CD8 T cells during M. tuberculosis infection. Moreover, the ability of CD8 T cells from old mice to produce increased innate IFN-gamma levels in response to M. tuberculosis infection was defined as a unique function of CD8 T cells from old mice and not the aged lung environment. Finally, we have identified increased expression of SET as being one possible mechanism by which CD8 T cells from old mice produce enhanced levels of IFN-gamma. Additional characterizations of the signaling events that lead to enhanced innate IFN-gamma production by CD8 T cells in old mice may lead to novel strategies to further enhance or perpetuate beneficial immune responses in the elderly.
