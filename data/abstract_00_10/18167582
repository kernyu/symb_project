Protein adsorption on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and oligo(ethylene oxide) (OEO) monolayers is studied at different packing densities using the Langmuir technique. In the case of a PEO monolayer, a protein adsorption minimum is revealed at sigma(-1) = 10 nm(2) for both lysozyme and fibrinogen. Manifested are two packing density regimes of steric repulsion and compressive attraction between PEO and a protein on top of the overall attraction of the protein to the air/water interface. The observed protein adsorption minimum coincides with the maximum of the surface segment density at sigma(-1) = 10 nm(2). However, OEO monolayer presents a different scenario, namely that the amount of protein adsorbed decreases monotonically with increasing packing density, indicating that the OEO chains merely act as a steric barrier to protein adsorption onto the air/water interface. Besides, in the adsorption of fibrinogen, three distinct kinetic regimes controlled by diffusion, penetration and rearrangement are recognized, whereas only the latter two were made out in the adsorption of lysozyme.
