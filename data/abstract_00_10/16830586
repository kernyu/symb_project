The influence of hydrogen peroxide on the dynamics of transition into uncultivable state (UCS) and on the reversion of V. cholerae and their subcultures, resistant to hydrogen peroxide, was studied. The transition of the initial cultures in river and distilled water into UCS took place earlier than that in resistant to hydrogen peroxide variants. The capacity for reversion to hydrogen peroxide resistant subcultures preserved, on the average, 2 - 3 times longer. An increase in the level of hydrogen peroxide in uncultivable populations was found to be 2.7 - 4.4 times. Subcultures, resistant to hydrogen peroxide, in the vegetative form had lower characteristics of peroxide concentrations than in uncultivable form (UCF), but somewhat higher than in initial variants. In revertants the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was lower in UCF, but somewhat higher than in vegetative cultures. The dynamics of the formation of UCF by cholera vibrios, with different degree of stability to the action of hydrogen peroxide, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in uncultivable populations, the deceleration of transition into uncultivable forms, an accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and an increase in the time of the reversion of clones, resistant to hydrogen peroxide, made it possible to suggest that the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide was possible to make an essential contribution to the formation of UCF of cholera vibrios in an experiment.
