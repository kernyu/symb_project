Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen that can cause a multitude of severe infections. In neurosurgical patients the usual presentation is ventriculitis associated with external ventricular drainage. Carbapenems have been considered the gold standard for the treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii ventriculitis, but resistant isolates are increasing worldwide, reducing the therapeutic options. In many cases polymyxins are the only possible alternative, but their poor blood-brain barrier penetration could require them to be directly administered intraventricularly and clinical experience with this route is limited. We review the literature concerning intraventricular use of colistin (polymyxin E) for A. baumannii ventriculitis and add three cases successfully treated with this method. Our experience suggests that intraventricular colistin is a potentially effective and safe therapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii central nervous system infections.
