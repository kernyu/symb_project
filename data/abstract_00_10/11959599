Six strains of staphylococci were exposed to levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or trovafloxacin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Each agent demonstrated a rapid 3-log(10) kill versus susceptible isolates regardless of condition. Against clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility, regrowth occurred by 24 h and was frequently associated with further increases in MICs.
