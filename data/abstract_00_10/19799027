Nowadays, it is necessary to emphasize the three basic inseparable elements in the treatment of severe burn infection, which are systemic care, burn wound care, and rational use of antimicrobials topically or systematically. Systemic care has been shifted from simple nutritional support to maintaining the systemic homeostasis, including balancing immune-inflammatory response, and protecting organs from dysfunction. Some work focused on regulating systemic immune response in the initial phase and the balance of inflammatory response after occurrence of severe burn infection have been reported. These results at least broaden our thinking to recognize that treatment should not only destroy microbes, but also balance the response of the body. Escharectomy in earlier phase has been a consensus. Currently, we turn our vision into how to use "damage control surgery (DCS)" concept in management of severe burn. DCS in burn care includes the evaluation of perioperative situation more accurate to make a more appropriate surgical decision. Meanwhile, an overall strategy should be established to confront the rapidly increasing drug resistance of the pathogens. The release of endotoxin after use of antimicrobials, which has been studied widely, should be explored further.
