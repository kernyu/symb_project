Replacement of the alpha4 helix of ParC with that of GyrA increased the stability of topoisomerase IV-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes. This mutant topoisomerase IV-mediated cell killing was more efficient than topoisomerase IV-mediated cell killing in Escherichia coli. Thus, the alpha4 helix plays critical roles in determining the stability and the cytotoxicity of ternary complexes.
