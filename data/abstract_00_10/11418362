BACKGROUND: The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor Zidovudine (ZDV) decreases mother to child transmission of HIV infection. Nevertheless, significant proportions of mothers who are treated during pregnancy with ZDV still transmit the virus. Along with other factors, failure of ZDV prophylaxis may be due to maternal infection with ZDV-resistant strains and their consequent vertical transmission. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to investigate the occurrence of mutations at codon 215 in HIV-1 infected infants and its association with clinical status and virological parameters. STUDY DESIGN: The cohort consisted of 49 HIV-1 infected infants. Mononuclear cell DNA was isolated from whole blood and served as the input DNA for both a qualitative DNA PCR and the codon 215 assay (nested PCR). HIV-1 viral load (RNA PCR) was measured in plasma by the Roche Amplicor Monitor assay. RESULTS: Twelve of the 49 (24.5%) demonstrated viral strains with mutation at codon 215. A significant difference was found in infants born between 1992 and 1994 (6.3%) compared to those born in 1998-1999 (33.3%). Furthermore, in those infants born in 1998-1999, there was a trend toward an increase in the frequency of zidovudine resistant mutations at codon 215 corresponding to an increase in maternal zidovudine treatment. The mixture of wild and mutant HIV-1 strains was detected in two of 14 infants (14.3%) with a low viral load (<750000 c/ml) compared to nine of 19 (47.4%) infants with extremely high levels of HIV-1 RNA concentration (>750000 c/ml). Only two of 33 tested infants were HIV symptomatic and in both, a mixture of wild and mutant HIV-1 strains was detected. In both infants, the viral load was >750000 c/ml. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the overall frequency of ZDV resistant strains in infants born in 1998-1999 was significantly higher than that found in infant samples from 1992 to 1994. By 1998, the standard of care for mothers known to be infected with HIV was treatment with either monotherapy using ZDV or combined therapy using a variety of antiretroviral agents including ZDV. Although the exact role of ZDV resistance in limiting the effectiveness of therapies aimed at blocking vertical transmission of HIV remains to be defined, it is clear that drug resistant strains of HIV are occurring more frequently in all types of HIV infection, including infants.
