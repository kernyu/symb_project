Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis is a highly invasive pathogen that infects humans and causes systemic infections that require antimicrobial therapy. Surveillance in Taiwan showed that fluoroquinolone resistance in S. Choleraesuis markedly increased from 2000 to 2003, reaching approximately 70% in 2003.
