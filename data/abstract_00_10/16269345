The in vitro activities of three amphibian peptides magainin II amide, citropin 1.1 and temporin A alone and in combination with eight clinically used antimicrobial agents (imipenem, ceftazidime, clarithromycin, vancomycin, amikacin, polymyxin E, ciprofloxacin and linezolid) were investigated against several multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from surgical wound infections. Antimicrobial activities were measured by MIC, MBC and time-kill studies. P. aeruginosa strains were more susceptible to magainin II amide and less susceptible to temporin A. S. aureus isolates were highly susceptible to temporin A and citropin 1.1. The combination studies showed synergy between citropin 1.1 and clarithromycin. Magainin II amide and temporin A showed synergism with imipenem and ceftazidime. Finally, all peptides showed synergistic effects with polymyxin E. These results provide evidence for the potential use of these antimicrobial peptides in the topical or systemic treatment of surgical wound infections.
