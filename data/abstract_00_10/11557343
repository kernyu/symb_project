Nuclease-resistant moenomycin-binding aptamers with dissociation constants in the range of 300 to 400 nM have been selected. Competition experiments have demonstrated that these aptamers recognize a disaccharide analogue of moenomycin. The results offer the opportunity of setting up a selective and sensitive assay for identifying moenomycin biosynthetic precursors.
