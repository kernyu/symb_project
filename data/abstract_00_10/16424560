Fluconazole has been used as prophylaxis against systemic fungal infections in preterm neonates. We conducted a study to determine whether cessation of a policy of prophylactic fluconazole results in a resurgence of fungal infections in a unit. Neonates born in the 3 epoches: A 36-month pre-Fluconazole prophylaxis epoch (Group 1), a 21-month Fluconazole prophylaxis epoch (Group 2) and a 39-month post Fluconazole prophylaxis epoch (Group 3) were compared for incidence and onset of fungal sepsis and resistance patterns. There was a decline in the incidence of fungal sepsis from Group 1 to Group 2, and it remained stable from Group 2 to Group 3. There was no significant difference in resistance to Fluconazole and to any of the azoles in Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
