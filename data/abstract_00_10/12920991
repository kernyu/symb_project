A case of bacteremia due to high-level-vancomycin- (MIC = 64 micrograms/ml) and high-level-teicoplanin- (MIC = 32 micrograms/ml) resistant Enterococcus gallinarum is described. Both genes, van C1 and van A, respectively conferring natural low-level resistance and acquired high-level resistance to vancomycin, were found in the enterococcal genoma. The present is the first report of an E. gallinarum isolate showing the van A genotype in Argentina.
