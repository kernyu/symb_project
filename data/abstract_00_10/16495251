We have compared the activities of posaconazole and other currently available antifungal agents against a collection of 3,378 clinical isolates of yeasts and filamentous fungi. A total of 1,997 clinical isolates of Candida spp., 359 of other yeast species, 697 strains of Aspergillus spp., and 325 nondermatophyte non-Aspergillus spp. were included. The average geometric means of the MICs of agents that were tested against Candida spp. were 0.23 microg/ml for amphotericin B, 0.29 microg/ml for flucytosine, 0.97 microg/ml for fluconazole, 0.07 microg/ml for itraconazole, 0.04 microg/ml for voriconazole, 0.15 microg/ml for caspofungin, and 0.03 microg/ml for posaconazole. Voriconazole and posaconazole were active in vitro against the majority of isolates, with resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole, and against Cryptococcus neoformans and other Basidiomycota yeasts. Posaconazole was the most active of antifungal agents tested against Aspergillus spp., with an average geometric mean of 0.10 microg/ml. It was active against Paecilomyces spp., Penicillium spp., Scedosporium apiospermum, and some black fungi, such as Alternaria spp. Multiresistant filamentous fungi, such as Scedosporium prolificans, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, and Fusarium solani, were also resistant to voriconazole, caspofungin, and posaconazole. Amphotericin B and posaconazole were found to be active against most of the Mucorales strains tested. Posaconazole and currently available antifungal agents exhibit a potent activity in vitro against the majority of pathogenic fungal species.
