HBV cannot be fully eradicated from the body because of the persistence of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. True cure is infrequent, but persistent suppression of HBV DNA slows liver disease progression and helps to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment options for chronic hepatitis B include pegylated interferon and 4 licensed oral nucleosides/nucleotides (lamivudine, adefovir entecavir and tenofovir). Interferon is the only drug with a defined duration of treatment. It is effective in 30% to 40% of patients but is poorly tolerated. In contrast to interferon, nucleotide/nucleoside analogs have only minor adverse effects. However, a resurgence of the infection may occur when these drugs are withdrawn, implying that treatment may have to continue indefinitely. The onset of viral resistance to these agents also limits their long-term use but can be minimized by ensuring potent suppression of viral replication.
