Infections caused by Candida yeasts are common in elderly individuals. Seventy-five isolates of Candida spp. were obtained from saliva samples of 136 institutionalized elderly individuals resident in six retirement homes of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Forty-seven isolates (62.66%) were identified as Candida albicans, 15 (20%) as C. tropicalis, 7 (9.33%) as C. glabrata, 4 (5.33) as C. parapsilosis, and 2 (2.67%) as C. guilliermondii. Among the 136 elderly individuals studied, 49 (36%) were male and 87 (64%) were female. Ages ranged from 60 to 90 years old. Sixty-three (46.3%) of the institutionalized individuals were denture wearers and, among them, 53 (84.1%) carried Candida yeasts in the oral cavity. Forty-four subjects presented lesions in the oral mucosa and among these, 36 (82%), had positive culture for Candida spp. The samples were tested for the in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole and 5-flucytosin, and great variations were observed in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these drugs according to the species.
