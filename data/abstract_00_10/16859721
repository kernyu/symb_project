An antiviral protein (AVP), imparting high level of resistance against sunnhemp rosette virus (SRV) was purified from the dried leaves of Amaranthus tricolor. The purified protein (AAP-27) exhibited approximately 98% inhibition of local lesion formation at a concentration range of approximately 30 microg ml(-1). The protein was found to be highly basic glycoprotein monomer (pI approximately 9.8) of Mr 27 kDa, with neutral sugar content of 4%. The purified protein exhibited N-glycosidase and RNase activities. We have also isolated full-length cDNA clone, encoding this protein designated as A. tricolor antiviral protein-1 (AAP-1). Two primers, one designed on the basis of N-terminal sequence of the purified protein and the other from the conserved active peptides of other AVPs/RIPs were used for PCR amplification of double stranded cDNA, isolated from the leaves of A. tricolor. The amplified fragment was used as a probe for library screening. The isolated full-length cDNA consisted of 1058 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 297 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of AAP-1 has a putative active domain conserved in other AVPs/RIPs and shows varying homology to the RIPs from other plant species.
