A total of 56 isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, including 38 isolates from poultry, 16 from cattle and two from pigs, collected between 1976 and 2004, were subjected to bacteriophage typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Phage type (PT) 8 was predominant in bovine isolates, whereas PT1 and PT4 were predominant in poultry isolates. Resistance was found for 8 of 11 antimicrobials tested, at the following rates: 46.4% for dihydrostreptomycin followed by ampicillin and oxytetracycline (both 8.9%).
