In 540 beta-hemolytic streptococci, the rates of resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and clindamycin were 80.0, 22.8, 20.2, and 19.1%, respectively. Of the erythromycin-resistant isolates, 63.3% had the constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) resistance phenotype, 23.9% had the M phenotype, and 12.8% had the inducible MLS(B) resistance phenotype. The constitutive MLS(B) resistance phenotype with the erm(B) gene was dominant in Korea.
