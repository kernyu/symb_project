Sheep scab, caused by Psoroptes ovis, is a severe and debilitating disease that can be treated and controlled by the use of acaricidal dips or the use of broad-spectrum avermectins. In Switzerland, control measures are state regulated. In particular, sheep should be routinely treated with ectocide dips or avermectin injections before they are moved onto common alpine pasture in late spring. However, a substantial part of the sheep population remains untreated and represents a potential reservoir for the mite population. Untreated sheep that are not moved to alpine pasture may infest treated sheep when flocks are reassembled in autumn. In an attempt to identify infested sheep, all flocks in the Canton of Schwyz (Switzerland) were serologically tested in 2001 and in 2002 (587 and 565 flocks, respectively). In 2003, a representative number (182 of the 531 flocks) was again investigated. Seropositive flocks were treated with doramectin (0.3 mg kg(-1) body weight, intramuscularly) from 2001 to 2003. In spring 2002, no chemo-methaphylaxis was given to seronegative flocks before movement onto common alpine pastures. Of the 587 flocks surveyed in spring 2001, 34 were seropositive (5.8%). These consisted of 21 infested with P. ovis, 1 with P. cuniculi, 4 with Chorioptes spp. and 8 of seropositivity of unknown origin; there was a decrease of seropositive flocks in spring 2002 (4.4%) with 15, 0, 2 and 8, respectively. Of the 182 flocks surveyed in spring 2003, just 4 flocks (2.2%) were seropositive. All the seropositive reactions in these flocks were the result of Chorioptes spp. infestations. There was a corresponding decrease in the proportion of seropositive animals from 6.3% in spring 2001 to 2.1% in spring 2003. These results corroborate the concept that it may be possible to target chemo-metaphylaxis and hence decrease the use of endectocides as well as of ectocides to control sheep scab. This would be of great benefit in reducing the likelihood of development of anthelmintic resistance against avermectins, decreasing the extent of environmental and human contamination with potentially toxic products and diminishing potential drug residues in meat and milk.
