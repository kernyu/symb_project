Staphylococcus aureus oxiva 10 and oxiva 14 strains clinically isolated from diabetic patients were resistant to gentamycin and oxacillin The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of oxacillin and gentamycin were 720 and >2048 microg/mL, respectively, for oxiva 10 and 680 and 400 microg/mL. respectively, for oxiva 14; both strains carry mecA and femA genetic determinants in their genomes. In addition, both are vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) isolates. The addition of vancomycin led to significant decreases in oxacillin resistance of both oxiva 10 and oxiva 14 strains, whereas the addition of vancomycin to gentamycin plates showed a decrease in gentamycin resistance of non-high-level gentamycin-resistant (non-HLGR) oxiva 14 and indifference in gentamycin resistance in HLGR oxiva 10. Transmission electron microscopy of representative strains unveils a remarkable increase in the thickness of the cell wall, indicating that thickening of the cell wall is a common phenotype associated with vancomycin resistance in VISA isolates. The present study reports that the rate of synergism and synergistic effect in the combination vancomycin-gentamycin vary according to the MICs of gentamycin.
