Isolates of Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis (n = 17), Hadar (n = 18), and Virchow (n = 13) from cases of human infection and from food production animals were screened using a miniaturized antimicrobial microarray to determine the number and spectra of resistance genes. Among Enteritidis, the number of genes detected was: animal isolates, mean = 4.6; human isolates, mean = 5.3. Resistance to streptomycin, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides was usually encoded by only one resistance gene in animal isolates, but human isolates often carried more than one gene encoding resistance to the same class of antimicrobial. Among Hadar, the number of genes detected was: animal isolates, mean = 2.0; human strains, mean = 2.6. Resistance to streptomycin was encoded by strA, rather than aadA genes because these were detected in only one human isolate. Among Virchow, the number of genes detected was: animal isolates, mean = 1.6; human isolates, mean = 5.6. As with Enteritidis, human Hadar isolates often carried more than one gene encoding resistance to the same class of antimicrobial. Due to the complexity of routes of transmission of Salmonella spp. from food production animals to humans, full phenotypic and genotypic comparison of resistant isolates is critical in ascertaining the sources of resistant isolates.
