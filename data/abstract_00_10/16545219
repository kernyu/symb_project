INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of hospital-acquired infections and the use of antibiotics in hospitals in Aarhus County, Denmark, and to compare these results with those of previous prevalence studies from 1994 and 1999. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from departments with seven-day beds were included in a prevalence study that took place in September 2003. An infection control team visited each department on a particular day. Based on patients' notes and cardex, patients with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and community-acquired infections (CAIs) were registered. Data on antibiotic use and microbiological findings were also noted. RESULTS: Among the 1,510 patients included in the study, the overall prevalence of hospital-acquired infections was 10%. The distribution of the most frequent HAIs was urinary tract infection (34%), postoperative wound infection (19%), pneumonia (12%) and septicaemia (9%), respectively. A total of 456 patients (30%) received antibiotics on the prevalence day. The antibiotics were given as prophylaxis to 64 (14%) of these patients. Penicillins were the most frequently used drugs, accounting for 42% of all prescriptions. CONCLUSION: Compared to a previous prevalence study in 1999, a non-significant increase was seen in the prevalence of HAIs. However, the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics increased significantly from 1994 to 2003 in general and in particular with regard to the use of quinolones and cephalosporins.
