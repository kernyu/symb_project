The purpose of the study was to analyze the distribution of the macrolide-resistance genes in 134 erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus blood-culture isolates collected at 15 German university hospitals. The most prevalent resistance gene was ermC (68/134; 50.7%), followed by ermA (52/134; 38.8%), ereB (10/134; 7.5%), and mrsA/msrB (4/134; 6%). The least common genes were ermB (3/134; 2.2%) and ereA (1/134; 0.7%). Overall, resistance to erythromycin was predominantly due to the presence of two erm genes, although with different distributions, depending on the methicillin-resistance pattern.
