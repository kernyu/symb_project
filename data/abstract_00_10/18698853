Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) linked with the uropathogens Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) account for the majority of nosocomial infections acquired in the clinical environment. Because these infections develop following initial adhesion of the bacterial pathogens to the catheter surface, there is increased interest in developing effective methods to inhibit attachment of cells to biomaterials used in the manufacture of indwelling devices. High molecular weight proanthocyanidins (PAC) extracted from the North American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) were examined for their potential to reduce the initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria (E. coli CFT073 and E. faecalis 29212) to two model biomaterials, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Well-controlled experiments conducted in a parallel-plate flow chamber (PPFC) demonstrated decreased attachment of both bacteria to PVC and PTFE when either the bacteria, biomaterial or both surfaces were treated with PAC. Most significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion was observed for the condition where both the bacteria and biomaterial surfaces were coated with PAC. Additional experiments conducted with nonbiological model particles demonstrate comparable extents of adhesion inhibition, supporting a nonbiospecific mechanism of PAC action. The results of this study are promising for the implementation of PAC in the clinical milieu for prevention of device associated infection as the proposed functional modification is independent of antibacterial mechanisms that may give rise to resistant strains.
