We studied the effect of lactational exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the susceptibility to Listeria infection of offspring in C57BL /6NCji mice. The offspring were nursed by TCDD-treated dams and exposed to TCDD from birth to weaning via milk. The exposure had little effect on the weights of immune organs and the spleen or the thymus cell population in the dams and offspring, but it enhanced the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in the serum after Listeria infection. The clearance of Listeria monocytogenes from the spleen was impaired in the off-spring. These results suggest that the exposure to TCDD of the offspring via milk disrupted the host resistance of the offspring, even though the main immune parameters were unchanged.
