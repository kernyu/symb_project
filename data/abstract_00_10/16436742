The penetration of telavancin was 2% into inflamed meninges and ca. 1 per thousand into noninflamed meninges after two intravenous injections (30 mg/kg of body weight). In experimental meningitis, telavancin was significantly superior to vancomycin combined with ceftriaxone against a penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strain. Against a methicillin-sensitive staphylococcal strain, telavancin was slightly but not significantly superior to vancomycin.
