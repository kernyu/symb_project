OBJECTIVE: To determine resistance patterns of multiresistant Gram-negative organisms at a surgical hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in order to guide appropriate antibiotic prescribing and improve infection control procedures. METHOD: All samples sent in for microbiological analysis over a 3-month period were included. A resource neutral double disc-diffusion test was introduced to detect the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. RESULTS: We obtained 350 bacterial isolates from clinical specimens; 87.4% were Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Of these, 88.9% were Enterobacteriaceae, of which 14.7% produced ESBL. Fifteen (37.5%) of these were isolated within 48 h of admission. Resistance to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin occurred in 70.0% and 72.5% of those organisms that produced ESBL and in 39.5% and 38.7% of those that did not. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was common: 36.7% of all GNB were resistant to ceftriaxone, 34.0% to cefotaxime, 19.6% to ceftazidime and 36.7% to cefoperazone. CONCLUSION: Multiresistant Gram-negative organisms are common and pose a challenge to antibiotic therapy. Successful implementation of a simple test to detect ESBL production allowed reporting of these organisms, appropriate antibiotic prescribing and infection control interventions. Development of antibiotic-prescribing guidelines must take into account these resistance patterns.
