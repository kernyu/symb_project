Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has an important aetiological role in localized juvenile periodontitis and in progressive periodontitis in adults. A. actinomycetemcomitans is found mainly in periodontal pockets but also in whole saliva, a potential transmission medium. It is sensitive to peroxidase-halide systems, but the differences between periodontitis associated clinical isolates and type strains are unclear. The sensitivities of these 2 strain groups to lactoperoxidase (LP)-iodide (I(-))-hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) combinations were investigated, and the sensitivities were compared with the susceptibilities to four antibiotics. There was great variation between the sensitivities of different strains, but the 2 strain groups responded similarly. The LP (75 microg)-I(-) (100 nmol)-H(2)O(2) (1000 nmol) combination produced a similar degree of inhibition as 2 microg ampicillin. The LP-I(-) system might be a potential antimicrobial agent against A. actinomycetemcomitans transmission via saliva.
