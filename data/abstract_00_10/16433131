As antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections continue to emerge over time, influenced by selective pressure, and the costs of treating these infections increase, the ability of microbiology laboratories to accurately detect drug resistant bacteria and communicate susceptibility test results effectively to clinicians in a timely manner is more important than ever. Ongoing cooperation and coordination of activities among clinical pathologists, technical personnel, pharmacy, clinical services, and infection control using up-to-date laboratory methodologies and interpretive criteria to develop laboratory reports that are transmitted efficiently through computerized communication systems for use within each particular institution are essential to provide optimum patient care, control resistance, and conserve resources.
