A new convenient molecular typing method, simultaneous polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, for three different genes of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was evaluated using 35 isolates of MRSA and comparing results with those previously reported for sequencing-based spa typing. Twenty-nine isolates of the most frequent protein A (spa) type were discriminated into 6 different types by PCR-RFLP. In contrast, spa typing could discriminate only 1 of the 19 most frequent PCR-RFLP-type isolates. The discriminatory powers of the two methods were equal for the other isolates. These results suggest that PCR-RFLP has the advantages of both relative easiness and greater discriminatory power than spa typing. We also report the case of a suspected outbreak in which PCR-RFLP was sufficient for ruling out the possibility of an outbreak. Thus, PCR-RFLP is preferable as a preliminary screening method for epidemiological studies of nosocomial infection caused by MRSA.
