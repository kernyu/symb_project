We prospectively studied the type, frequency and outcome of infections in 513 patients with 762 consecutive episodes of febrile neutropenia (FN) over a five-year period between 1995 and 1999 in a single paediatric oncology unit. The findings were then compared with a similar study carried out in our unit between 1990 and 1994. The types of bacterial isolates and sensitivity patterns were also studied to identify trends and to gauge the suitability of antibiotics chosen for empirical therapy. Bacteraemia was documented in 35.4% of FN episodes, although 70% of patients did not have an obvious site of sepsis. The majority of isolates (61.9%) were gram-negative bacteria, a consistent finding throughout the study period. Resistance to ceftazidime, amikacin and imipenem among gram-negative bacteria was 26.3%, 21.2% and 0.7%, respectively. Methicillin resistance among gram-positive bacteria was 26.3%, while no vancomycin-resistant bacteria were encountered. There were 36 sepsis-related deaths. Factors associated with a fatal outome were prolonged capillary refill time, hypotension, fever above 39 degrees C and pneumonia. Rapid neutrophil recovery was associated with a good prognosis. A change to our current choice of empirical antibiotics for FN, comprising ceftazidime/ceftriaxone and amikacin appears necessary because of the relatively high resistance rates found.
