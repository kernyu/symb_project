BACKGROUND: Growing multiple drug resistance among gram-negative bacilli among hospitalized patients is a serious therapeutic problem, and the aim of the study was to assess the situation in our hospital. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the disk method was carried out on 1,533 isolates of gram-negative bacilli from urine, pus, body fluid and blood from hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of isolates were susceptible only to meropenem and either to piperacillin + tazobactam, to cefoperazone + sulbactam or to both. Eleven percent of isolates were susceptible only to meropenem and 6% were resistant to all antimicrobial agents including meropenem. CONCLUSION: Growing multiple drug resistance among gram-negative bacilli in hospital practice demands a rigid antibiotic policy and strict infection control measures.
