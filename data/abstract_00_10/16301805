There are six putative genes for multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family multidrug efflux pumps in the chromosome of Vibrio cholerae. We have so far analyzed two MATE family pumps in V. cholerae non-O1 NCTC4716. Here we cloned four remaining genes for putative MATE family efflux pumps by the PCR method from this microorganism and designated them as vcmB, vcmD, vcmH and vcmN. Each one of the four genes was introduced and expressed in the drug hypersusceptible host Escherichia coli KAM32 cells. We observed elevated MICs of multiple antimicrobial agents, such as fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, ethidium bromide and Hoechst 33342 in the transformants. Energydependent efflux of substrate was observed with the transformed cells. We found that efflux activities of VcmB, VcmD and VcmH were Na+-dependent, but that of VcmN was Na+-independent. Thus, all six of the MATE family multidrug efflux pumps of V. cholerae non-O1 have been characterized. We also found that all six genes were expressed in cells of V. cholerae non-O1.
