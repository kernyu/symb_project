Before changing antiretroviral regimens, the treatment team must review the treatment history, establish the context, assay plasma concentrations of antiretrovirals, genotype viral resistance, and if necessary reinforce adherence. Changing treatment that is successful from an immunological and virological standpoint may be indicated in the case of severe adverse events, which may lead to poor adherence, or to reduce long-term, notably cardiovascular, complications, or to simplify treatment. Virological failure can lead to the adaptation of treatment to the genotype or to the prescription of multiple combinations (7 or 8 drugs) or to the recycling of some drugs. Tolerance affects adherence. Improvement in the latter can be obtained by simplification, which should be attempted only once one is sure of the virological efficacy.
