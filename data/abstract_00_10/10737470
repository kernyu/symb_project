PURPOSE: We review the literature on gentamicin, including single daily dosing and "switch" therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used MEDLINE to search the literature from 1966 to June 1997, and then manually searched bibliographies to identify studies that our initial search might have missed. RESULTS: Gentamicin has attractive characteristics, including wide spectrum, infrequent resistance, economy and familiarity. Although limited by well known toxicities, gentamicin remains a drug of choice for serious Gram-negative infections. Dosing strategies, such as single daily dosing and switch therapy, have renewed enthusiasm for this time-honored drug. CONCLUSIONS: Gentamicin remains a valuable drug in urology. Once daily dosing and switch therapy offer the potential to increase effectiveness and convenience while decreasing toxicity and costs.
