Of 175 Clostridium difficile strains isolated from patient hospitalized in one academic hospital in Warsaw between 2005-2006, one isolate belonged to PCR-ribotype 027/toxinotype III. This isolate had tcdA, tcdB, binary toxin genes (cdtA and cdtB), a 18-bp deletion and a 1 bp deletion at 117 position in the tcdC gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed high level resistance to erythromycin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin. This is a first report of the 027 strain of C. difficile in Poland.
