The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the main reason why tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major health problem worldwide. It is urgent to discover novel anti-mycobacterial agents based on new drug targets for the treatment of TB, especially MDR-TB. Tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, which is essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis and meanwhile absent in mammals, provides potential anti-TB drug targets. One of the promising drug targets in this pathway is anthranilate synthase component I (TrpE), whose role is to catalyze the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate using ammonia as amino source. In order to get a deep understanding of TrpE, a study on purification and characteristic identification of TrpE is required. In this work, the putative trpE gene of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was expressed as a fusion protein with a 6x His-tag on the N-terminal (His-TrpE) in Escherichia coli. The recombinant TrpE protein was successfully purified and then its enzymatic characteristics were analyzed. The native TrpE without His-tag was obtained by removal of the N-terminal fusion partner of His-TrpE using enterokinase. It was found that N-terminal fusion partner had little influence on TrpE catalytic activity. In addition, the key residues related to enzyme catalytic activity and that involved in l-tryptophan inhibition were predicted in the structure of M. tuberculosis H37Rv TrpE. These results would be beneficial to the designing of novel anti-TB drugs with high potency and selectivity.
