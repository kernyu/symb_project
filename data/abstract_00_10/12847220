IL-12 and IL-15 stimulate T, B, and NK cell functions through independent mechanisms, and cooperative effects of these cytokines have been reported. The human MHC class I-negative small cell lung cancer cell line, N592, genetically engineered to secrete IL-15, N592/IL-15, showed a reduced tumor growth rate, while N592 cells engineered with IL-12, N592/IL-12, grew similarly to the wild-type N592, N592 parental cells (N592pc), in nude mice. However, N592 cells coexpressing both cytokines, N592/IL-12/IL-15 cells, were completely rejected by 100% of nude mice. Here we show that 60% of nude mice rejecting N592/IL-12/IL-15 cells were resistant to N592pc rechallenge. SCID mice rejected N592/IL-12/IL-15 cells, but did not develop resistance to N592pc rechallenge, suggesting a role of Ab responses. Among nude mice rejecting N592/IL-12/IL-15 cells, those developing resistance to N592pc rechallenge had significantly higher titers of anti-N592 IgG2b Abs than nonresistant nude mice. Induction of an Ig class switch in nude mice was related to the expression of IFN-gamma and CD40 ligand in the draining lymph nodes. An IgG2b, anti-N592 mAb, derived from N592/IL-12/IL-15-immunized nude mice splenocytes induced significant protection against N592pc, while an IgM mAb was ineffective. The protective IgG2b mAb, but not the IgM mAb, triggered Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by nude mouse splenocytes against N592pc. These data indicate that IL-12 and IL-15 synergistically trigger innate, immunity-mediated, anti-tumor effects, resulting in cytotoxic IgG Ab responses in T cell-deficient mice. Protective Ab responses may relate to both direct actions of IL-12 and IL-15 on B cells and to the activation of an innate immunity-B cell cross-talk.
