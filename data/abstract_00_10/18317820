Cervical necrotizing fasciitis (CNF) is a life-threatening complication of pharyngeal or dental infections. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether dental or pharyngeal source result from different pathogen(s) in CNF and whether antibiotics, given before admission, influence the antimicrobial resistance of pathogens. In 152 CNF patients, Streptococcus milleri group and Prevotella species were the predominant isolates, frequently copathogens, mostly in dental CNF samples. Penicillin and clindamycin resistance were observed in 39% and 37% of cases, respectively, independently of any previous antibiotic therapy. Thus, a combined aerobe-anaerobe infection may have a synergistic effect, which allows the infection to spread in cervical tissues.
