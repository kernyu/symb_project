OBJECTIVE: It has been postulated that gemcitabine inhibits DNA repair, and platinum resistance is due to increased DNA repair activity. The addition of gemcitabine to platinum-based agents may have synergistic tumoricidal activity. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all patients with recurrent, persistent, or progressive fallopian tube or ovarian carcinoma treated with a platinum-based compound and gemcitabine from 2001 to present was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients on second to eight line chemotherapy met inclusion criteria. The median age was 53 years. Twenty-two patients received cisplatin and gemcitabine, and 7 patients received carboplatin and gemcitabine based on results of chemoresistance assays or prior chemorelated toxicities. The intent to treat was with six cycles of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) and either cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (AUC 5) day 1 and gemcitabine only on day 8 of a 21-day cycle. The median number of cycles administered was six. There were 20 grade 3 and 4 toxicities and 63% of patients by cycle 6 needed erythropoietin marrow support and 19% needed GCSF support by cycle 4. Twenty-one patients required discontinuation of day 8 that most commonly occurred at cycle 4. Eleven (38%) had CR, 5 (17%) had PR, 6 (21%) had SD, and 7 (24%) had PD, which is a 55% overall response. Nineteen of 29 patients (66%) showed platinum resistance to initial therapy. Of those, four (21%) had CR, four (21%) had PR, six (32%) had SD, and five (26%) with PD, which demonstrates a 42% overall response rate for this particular subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant combination platinum-based agent with gemcitabine is a very effective and well-tolerated treatment for recurrent fallopian tube or ovarian carcinoma; even in those who exhibit initial platinum resistance.
