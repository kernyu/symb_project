Resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) develops quickly and independently if they are used in combination with NRTIs or protease inhibitors (PIs) as rescue therapy, mainly due to the low genetic barrier of this class of drugs. In this study we examined clinical, therapeutic, and virologic characteristics in 88 patients with mutations conferring resistance to NNRTIs, and in 11 patients 1 year after stopping NNRTI therapy. Between patients administered Nevirapine (NVP) and those taking Efavirenz (EFV), no statistical differences were found in CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, time on NNRTI therapy, or number of PIs administered previously. A slow decline in the detectability of mutations encoding NNRTI resistance was found.
