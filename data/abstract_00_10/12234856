A mutation was discovered in the Pribnow box of the ampC promoter in a clinical Escherichia coli strain. This -11 C-to-T transition created a perfect homology with the -10 consensus sequence. The new promoter was cloned upstream of the cat gene of pKK232-8 and induced a sixfold increase in promoter strength.
