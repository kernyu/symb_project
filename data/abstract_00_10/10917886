Susceptibility to Plasmodium chabaudi depends on the relative dominance of T(h)1/T(h)2 responses in host mice. A T(h)2-dominant response during the early phase of infection in susceptible A/J mice causes a fatal disease course due to severe malaria. Schistosoma mansoni is a potent inducer of a T(h)2-dominant response not only to the parasite antigens, but also to other antigens concurrently existing in the host animals. In spite of S. mansoni infection, these A/J mice escape death from malaria and showed accompanied enhanced production of IFN-gamma to malaria antigens. Treatment with anti-IFN-gamma mAb in S. mansoni-infected A/J mice abolished the resistance to malaria, indicating that IFN-gamma was responsible for the resistance to P. chabaudi in S. mansoni-infected A/J mice. Results in this study show that under certain circumstances, S. mansoni infection can promote type 1 immune responses in A/J mice that normally develop T(h)2 responses.
