Treatment of Mycobacterium avium disease remains challenging when macrolide resistance develops. We infected C57 beige mice and treated them with mefloquine, SRI-286, and moxifloxacin. SRI-286 (80 mg/kg) was bactericidal in the liver. Mefloquine plus moxifloxacin or mefloquine plus SRI-286 were better than mefloquine alone.
