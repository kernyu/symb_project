Hepatitis A virus and Poliovirus 2 inactivation tests were carried out using three peracetic acid concentrations (160, 320 and 640 mg/l) at different pH condition and at +20 degrees C temperature. HAV HM-175 strain was grown in FRhK4 cells and titrated in PFU (plaque technique) and the Poliovirus 2 strain was grown in monkey kidney cells RC-37 and titred in TCID50. The viral titration reduction was determined in the space of an hour with the disinfectant contact at 10-15 minutes intervals. The results obtained with the hepatitis A virus have shown a good linear trend between viral titration and contact time at the highest concentrations without any particular pH influence. The complete viral activity absence was achieved after 30-60 minutes of contact at 640 mg/l concentration. As regards Poliovirus 2 a good linear trend was highlighted between titrations and times at all the concentrations in shorter times at pH acid. The complete viral activity absence was obtained with 640 mg/l concentration after 30 minutes at pH acid. The HAV seems to own a higher resistance than Poliovirus 2 and Poliovirus 1 too.
