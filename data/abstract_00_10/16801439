In mice, a selective decontamination of the digestive tract regimen consisting of orogastric tobramycin, polymyxin E, and amphotericin B in combination with subcutaneous cefepime inhibited gram-negative bacilli, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, and did not promote vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) colonization. However, concurrent administration of subcutaneous ampicillin-sulbactam resulted in promotion of VRE.
