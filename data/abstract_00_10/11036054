Tetracycline is an important component of combination therapies for Helicobacter pylori eradication. Twenty-nine tetracycline-resistant isolates requiring MICs ranging from 4 to 16 microgram/ml were isolated from Korean (22 of 460) and Japanese (7 of 105) patients. Interestingly, all of the 29 tetracycline-resistant isolates exhibited cross-resistance to metronidazole, and the cross-resistance was transferred to tetracycline-sensitive H. pylori strains.
