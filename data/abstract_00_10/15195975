The maximum volumetric productivity of beta-galactosidase by a Kluyveromyces marxianus mutant, grown on lactose/corn steep liquor medium for 3 d, was 150 IU l(-1) h(-1) which is twice that of the parent organism. During product formation, mutated cells provided more resistance against thermal inactivation.
