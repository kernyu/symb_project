In the province of Quebec, Canada, from 1996 to 1998, 3,650 invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were reported. A total of 1,354 isolates were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. The distribution of serotypes remained stable over the 3 years, with serotypes 14, 6B, 4, 9V, 23F, and 19F accounting for 61% of the isolates. Overall, 90% of isolates were included in the current 23-valent vaccine and 67% were included in the 7-valent conjugate vaccine. We were able to determine that resistance to penicillin and to other antibiotics is increasing.
