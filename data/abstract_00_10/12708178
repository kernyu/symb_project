Nosocomial infections, caused by Acinetobacter are very common in neonatal intensive care units. They are one of the major health problems. Our retrospective study report 20 cases followed in neonatology care unit of children's hospital in Casablanca from 1998 to 2000. Our aims work were to evalue the incidence and the antibioresistance and to insist for the prevention. Incidence has been estimated to 43% of nosocomial infection confirmed and 0.9% of all hospitalisations. Acinetobacter was isolated from various types of nosocomial infection septicaemia (55%), nosocomial pneumonia (30%) and meningitis (15%). The incidence of resistance was 60% for imipineme, 45% for ciprofloxacin and 30% for amikacine. This multiresistance was often responsible for failure of antibiotic therapy. Mortality was very high (55%). The prevention of nosocomial infection remains essential.
