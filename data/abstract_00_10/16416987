PURPOSE: To evaluate conjunctival bacterial flora in children and its resistance to the most frequently antibiotics used by the ophthalmologists in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial conjuntival cultures obtained in 593 children without ocular infections. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic bacterial isolates were identified in 26.3% children. Most frequently isolated were Gram-positive cocci (70.5%). Significant resistance of Gram-positive cocci to aminoglicosides (5% to 65%) was observed. Emerging resistance to fluoroquinolones, especially of coagulase-negative staphylococci (in 21%), was also observed.
