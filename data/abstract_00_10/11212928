The impala transposon of Fusarium oxysporum is an active element. We demonstrated that the imp160 copy, transposed into the gene encoding nitrate reductase, is an autonomous element, since it excises from this gene and reinserts at a new genomic position in backgrounds free of active elements. An element in which the transposase gene was replaced by a hygromycin B resistance gene was used (1) to demonstrate the absence of endogenous transposase in several F. oxysporum strains and (2) to check the ability of different genomic copies of impala to transactivate this defective element. This two-component system allowed the identification of autonomous elements in two impala subfamilies and revealed that transactivation can occur between highly divergent elements. We also demonstrate that the autonomous copy transposes in a closely related species complex, F. moniliforme, in a fashion similar to that observed in F. oxysporium. The ability of impala to function as a two-component system and to transpose in a heterologous host promises further advances in our understanding of the factors that modulate transposition efficiency and demonstrates the potential of impala as a means of establishing a transposon tagging system for a wide range of fungal species.
