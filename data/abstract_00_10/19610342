Campylobacter inoculation studies are limited without a suitable marker strain. The lurpose of this study was to screen Campylobacter strains (n=2073) obtained from poultry carcass rinses through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Antimicrobial Resistant Monitoring System for resistance to gentamicin and evaluate one strain's efficacy as a marker. A C. coli strain was found resistant to gentamicin at >32 microg/ml. Gentamicin was incorporated into media (Campy-Cefex agar, Brucella agar, and blood agar) from 0 to 1000 microg/ml, and the upper level of gentamicin resistance was determined. C. coli strain's upper level of growth on Campy-Cefex plates, blood agar plates, and Brucella agar plates was 400, 300, and 200 pg/ml, respectively. Ceca and postpick carcass rinses were obtained and streaked onto Campy-Cefex agar at the above gentamicin levels to evaluate background microflora exclusion. Campy-Cefex agar containing gentamicin at 100 ag/ml prevented from the ceca, and reduced from the rinse, background microflora. The C. coli strain was orally or intracloacally inoculated into chicks. At 1, 3, and 6 weeks of age, inoculated broilers were removed and several tissue types sampled for the presence of the marker strain. At 6 weeks of age, 10 additional noninoculated penmates were sampled. The C. coli strain colonized chicks, disseminated to body tissues, colonized penmates, and persisted throughout the 6-week grow-out. The C. coli strain's unique characteristic, being resistant to high levels of gentamicin, allows for a marker that can be used in a wide range of Campylobacter research projects.
