About 110 sporadic, epidemiologically unrelated Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains isolated in the Slovak Republic were analyzed for the presence of integrons. Of these 110 examined strains, 47 were of definitive phage type DT104 and 63 were strains of various phage type, RDNC and untypeable, designated here as non-DT104 strains. All isolates were also tested for antimicrobial resistance to 10 antibiotics as well as for the presence of virulence plasmid. Of 63 non-DT104 strains, 15 isolates were multiple-resistant, independently from phage type, other strains were resistant to one, two or three drugs. Resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and sulfisoxazole was most frequently observed. Among the DT104 isolates up 65.9% exhibited characteristic pentaresistance--ACSSuT phenotype. The integron content was studied in PCR experiments using a 5'-CS/3'-CS primer pair. Fourteen non-DT104 strains, independently from phage type, were found to carry integrons with amplicons 650-1900 bp in size. Thirty-six DT104 strains contained integrons of 1000 and 1200 bp and 31 of they exhibited the ACSSuT phenotype. No integron was found in 10 DT104 strains, which included strains mostly resistant only to streptomycin, tetracycline and sulfisoxazole. The majority of non-DT104 strains did not possess any integrons. Our findings show the widespread existence of both resistant and multiple-resistant epidemiologically unrelated Salmonella typhimurium strains and suggest that integrons contribute to this antimicrobial resistance. The presence of 90-kb virulence plasmid in the 54 non-DT104 and in the all DT104 strains was found.
