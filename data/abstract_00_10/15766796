Clostridium clostridioforme is a relatively antimicrobial resistant, phenotypically heterogeneous anaerobe that has been involved in a variety of infections. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed three principal species in what has been called Clostridium clostridioforme - Clostridium bolteae, C. clostridioforme, and Clostridium hathewayi. Based on the 16S rDNA sequence information we obtained, we developed a cost-effective, timesaving one-step multiplex PCR assay for rapid and accurate differentiation of these three species. The established multiplex PCR identification scheme was applied to the identification of 88 clinical isolates that had previously been identified phenotypically as C. clostridioforme. The identification obtained from multiplex PCR assays showed 100% agreement with 16S rDNA sequencing identification. This scheme will permit more accurate assessment of the role of these three Clostridium species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the species.
