A case of fingernail infection by Fusarium is presented. This nondermatophytic mold is an infrequent cause of onychomycosis, more typically involving the great toenail. Characteristic histologic features including the presence of hyphae and chlamydoconia are helpful in rapid diagnosis and selection of appropriate antifungal therapy. Although Fusarium has shown resistance to most antifungal medications in vitro, intermittent therapy with fluconazole led to improvement in this patient.
