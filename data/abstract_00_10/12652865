In this study, a total of 225 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from various clinical specimens (114 wounds, 27 blood, 16 of each catheter and sputum, 14 throat swabs, 10 tracheal aspirates, 7 of each urine and drain materials, 6 pleural fluids, 5 graft materials, 2 cerebrospinal fluids, 1 ascitis fluid) of hospitalized patients, were tested in-vitro for their susceptibilities to fusidic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) by disk diffusion method. Two-hundred-eighteen (96.9%) of isolates were found susceptible to both fusidic acid and TMP-SMX, 4 (1.8%) were resistant to both of the agents (3 isolates from wound, 1 from sputum), 2 (0.9%) (both of them were wound isolates) were resistant only to fusidic acid, and 1 (0.4%) (throat isolate) was resistant only to TMP-SMX.
