Worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most important communicable diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality. Its control requires multi-drug therapy for at least six months, which could lead to patient non-compliance, failure of therapy and ultimately resulting in the emergence of drug resistance. Fixed dose combinations (FDCs) in TB therapy reduce the number of tablets to be consumed and thereby increase patient compliance with recommended treatment regimens. Thus, FDCs play a significant role in preventing the emergence of drug resistance and successful treatment. However, the quality of FDCs with respect to variable bioavailability and their registration requirements are major hurdles to their implementation in national TB control programs. It is anticipated that a large global market for FDCs will encourage large-scale production and increased competition, which in turn will result in FDCs at affordable prices. The Global Drug Facility (GDF), established by the World Health Organization (WHO), aims to ensure universal uninterrupted access to quality TB drugs for implementation of directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) in resource-poor countries. In this program, four FDCs were accepted as the drugs of first choice because of their obvious advantages in controlling TB. This demands the necessity of addressing quality and registration requirements of FDCs systematically. In light of this current knowledge on anti-TB FDCs, their dosage, combinations, available clinical studies and the experiences with TB therapy has been discussed in this article, which should serve as lessons for selection of appropriate FDCs for other diseases such as malaria and AIDS.
