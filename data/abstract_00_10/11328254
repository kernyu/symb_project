BACKGROUND: Triple therapies with proton pump inhibitor/ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC), clarithromycin (C) and either amoxicillin (A) or a nitroimidazole (I) are widely accepted as treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. However, it is not clear which of these antibiotic combinations should be preferred. AIM: To evaluate whether there is a difference in efficacy between triple therapies with proton pump inhibitor/RBC, clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or a nitroimidazole. METHODS: The literature was examined for randomized trials comparing proton pump inhibitor/RBC-C-A and proton pump inhibitor/RBC-C-I. Studies were grouped according to the type of acid inhibitor used (proton pump inhibitor or RBC) and differences between pooled cure rates were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were identified: seven using RBC, 39 using proton pump inhibitor, one using both. RBC-C-I was somewhat superior to RBC-C-A, although this difference only reached statistical significance in intention-to-treat analysis. Overall, proton pump inhibitor-C-I and proton pump inhibitor-C-A were equally effective, but in nitroimidazole-susceptible strains, proton pump inhibitor-C-I performed better, in nitroimidazole-resistant strains, proton pump inhibitor-C-A performed better. No serious side-effects were reported and pooled drop-out rates were equal. CONCLUSIONS: In general, proton pump inhibitor-C-I and proton pump inhibitor-C-A are equally effective and therefore other factors such as local prevalence of resistant strains, cost of therapy and options for second-line treatment should determine which regimen should be preferred. When using RBC, the RBC-C-I combination is somewhat superior to RBC-C-A.
