Antibiotic therapy has been integral to the management of inflammatory acne vulgaris for many years. Systemic antibiotics work via antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory modes of action, and have been found to be useful in managing moderate-to-severe acne. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include tetracyclines, erythromycin and trimethoprim, with or without sulfamethoxazole. In selecting the appropriate antibiotic for patients needing to receive topical or systemic antibiotic therapy, the clinician should take into account the severity of the acne, cost-effectiveness, the safety profile of the drug and the potential for development of resistance. The widespread and long-term use of antibiotics over the years has unfortunately led to the emergence of resistant bacteria. The global increase in the antibiotic resistance of Propionibacterium acnes may be a significant contributing factor in treatment failures. It is therefore essential that clinicians prescribing antibiotics for the treatment of acne adopt strategies to minimise further development of bacterial resistance. This includes addressing compliance issues, using combination therapies, avoiding prolonged antibiotic treatment, and avoiding concomitant topical and oral antibiotics with chemically dissimilar antibiotics.
