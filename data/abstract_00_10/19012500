BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to exact a huge toll on the health of residents of endemic countries. Thus, new approaches to prevention and treatment are needed. OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on novel therapies for the prevention of malaria. METHODS: Systematic MEDLINE search from 1956 to 2008 using the search term 'malaria' (with the subheadings 'intermittent preventive treatment', 'mass drug administration', 'chemotherapy', 'artemisinin-based combination therapy' and 'home-based management of malaria'). CONCLUSIONS: Chemoprophylaxis is used as a short-term protective measure for non-immune visitors to malaria-endemic countries. However, in malaria-endemic areas, chemoprophylaxis has not been implemented widely because of concerns related to sustainability, cost-effectiveness, appropriate delivery systems and development of drug resistance. Intermittent preventive treatment, a novel approach to malaria control, has the potential to provide some of the benefits of sustained chemoprophylaxis without some of its drawbacks.
