This cross-sectional survey assessed physicians' perceptions, knowledge and practices concerning antimicrobial resistance. Ninety-nine percent of participants reported that they perceived antimicrobial resistance as an important problem, and 86.7% agreed that antimicrobials are overprescribed, but only 2.9% rated "practicing antimicrobial control" as the most important strategy for preventing resistance. The results of this study warrant educational programs on antimicrobial resistance and the distribution of information regarding local antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
