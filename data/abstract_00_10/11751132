In experimental meningitis a single dose of gentamicin (10 mg/kg of body weight) led to gentamicin levels in around cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 4 mg/liter for 4 h, decreasing slowly to 2 mg/liter 4 h later. The CSF penetration of gentamicin ranged around 27%, calculated by comparison of areas under the curve (AUC in serum/AUC in CSF). Gentamicin monotherapy (-1.24 log(10) CFU/ml) was inferior to vancomycin monotherapy (-2.54 log(10) CFU/ml) over 8 h against penicillin-resistant pneumococci. However, the combination of vancomycin with gentamicin was significantly superior (-4.48 log(10) CFU/ml) compared to either monotherapy alone. The synergistic activity of vancomycin combined with gentamicin was also demonstrated in vitro in time-kill assays.
