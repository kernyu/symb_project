Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma with a poor median survival despite conventional therapy. Here, we present the case of a patient with multiply relapsed mantle cell lymphoma, having failed treatment with chemotherapy, steroids and rituximab. He was treated with single-agent thalidomide at a dose of 800 mg daily and entered a good partial remission which was maintained for the next 6 months. There is clearly a need for further studies of thalidomide in mantle cell lymphoma to confirm this promising initial result.
