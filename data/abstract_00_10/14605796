Expression of the thioredoxin ( trxA) gene of Rhodobacter sphaeroides is regulated by oxidative stress at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. All oxidative stress agents tested resulted in a moderate or strong increase of trxA mRNA levels, which was not due to increased mRNA stability. While the kinetics of increased trxA mRNA and of sodB mRNA, encoding superoxide dismutase, were similar after addition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( t-BOOH) or hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), different kinetics were observed after addition of diamide or paraquat, indicating the involvement of different stress responses in the regulation of these genes. The level of TrxA did not increase to the same extent as trxA mRNA levels. Furthermore, the addition of H(2)O(2) or t-BOOH led to increased turnover of the protein. Apparently, increased txA transcription compensated, at least in part, for the reduced stability of the protein. A strain expressing lower levels of thioredoxin 1 showed decreased resistance to diamide and H(2)O(2) but increased resistance to paraquat and t-BOOH compared to the wild-type. These data implicate the involvement of various systems in the response to different types of oxidative stress and the participation of thioredoxin 1 in the defense against oxidative stress caused by diamide or H(2)O(2).
