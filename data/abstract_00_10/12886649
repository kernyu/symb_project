Topical problems of modern disinfectology are formulated in connection with differences in the resistance of different microbial groups, species, strains to disinfectants, as well as with the "critical ability" of instruments and, accordingly, with different requirements to the necessary levels of decontamination. Factors determining the effectivity of disinfection are described. Requirements to "ideal" disinfectants and disinfectological technologies are considered. The problems of harmonization of approaches to the evaluation of Russian and foreign disinfectological methods and bringing them closer together are discussed.
