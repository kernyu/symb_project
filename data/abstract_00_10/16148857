A retrospective review of an outbreak of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus soft tissue infections in a high school football team was conducted. Thirteen players had 20 infections. Available community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates showed identical antibiotic susceptibility and field inversion gel electrophoresis analysis band patterns. Nasal cultures and mupirocin were ineffective at predicting and controlling infection, respectively. Infections treated with beta-lactam antibiotics were at risk for recurrence.
