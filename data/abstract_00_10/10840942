Malachite green (MG) consisting of green crystals with a metallic lustre, is highly soluble in water, cytotoxic to various mammalian cells and also acts as a liver tumor promoter. In view of its industrial importance and possible exposure to human beings, MG poses a potential environmental health hazard. We have previously reported the malignant transformation of Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells by MG. In this study, we have made an attempt to study the effects of MG on the induction of apoptosis in normal and MG transformed Syrian hamster embryo cells and the expression of altered p53 and bcl-2 immunohistochemically. Induction of apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry on the basis of G0/G1 hypodiploid peak, Tunel assay and DNA ladder pattern. Flow cytometric analysis showed a dose and time dependent induction of apoptosis by MG in control cells whereas induction of apoptosis by MG was marginal in transformed cells. Tunel assay and DNA ladder pattern also showed decreased apoptosis in transformed cells by MG compared to controls. Immunostaining studies showed intense staining for p53 in transformed cells whereas no staining was observed in control cells. Also transformed cells showed overexpression of bcl-2 with exclusive nuclear localization compared to controls which did not show staining. The present study indicated that MG transformed Syrian hamster embryo cells have decreased sensitivity to apoptosis compared to normal cells and overexpression of altered p53 and bcl-2 seems to be conferring resistance to MG induced apoptosis.
