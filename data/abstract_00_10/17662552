Time-kill kinetics performed with tigecycline, in fresh MHB, demonstrated a consistent 1 to 2 log(10) CFU/ml reduction in bacterial counts against the majority of clinically relevant pathogens tested. Although classified as a bacteriostatic agent, tigecycline shows bactericidal activity against select isolates associated with serious infection. In general, vancomycin and imipenem demonstrated bactericidal activity.
