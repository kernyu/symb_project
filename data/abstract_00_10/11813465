Risk factors and treatment strategies for systemic candidal infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) are discussed. The past two decades have seen a dramatic increase in the frequency of infections caused by Candida species. Risk factors associated with candidemia include treatment with multiple antimicrobials for extended periods, presence of central venous catheters, total parenteral nutrition, colonization by Candida species, abdominal surgery, prolonged stay in the ICU, and compromised immune status. Since the 1960s, conventional amphotericin B has been the primary treatment option for fungal infections. Although effective, amphotericin B has extensive toxicity. Three lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B have been developed in an attempt to decrease nephrotoxicity and improve drug delivery. Practitioners have also been offered alternatives by the introduction of less toxic azole antifungals, such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole; however, their widespread use has resulted in other problems, such as the selection of resistant isolates. There is controversy concerning fluconazole's effectiveness. In the treatment of systemic candidal infections, especially in critically ill patients. Clinical trials do not support the prophylactic or empirical use of fluconazole in the ICU. Treating patients who have no microbiological evidence of infection provides no therapeutic benefit and shifts the fungal flora to noncandidal strains that are more resistant to fluconazole. Patients in ICUs are often susceptible to systemic candidal infection. Preemptive therapy with fluconazole may reduce mortality in high-risk patients. Fluconazole and amphotericin B appear equally effective in treating established systemic candidal infections.
