Here, we present data on the activity of benzyl bis(thiosemicarbazone); 3,5-diacyl-1,2,4-triazole bis(4-methylthiosemicarbazone) and their Pd(II) complexes against the replication of wild type and of acyclovir (ACV)-resistant, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) and type 2 (HSV 2) strains. The data were compared to those under the action of acyclovir. The testing of cytotoxic activity suggests that these compounds may be endowed with important antiviral properties. It is interesting to note that the Pd(II)-benzyl bis(thiosemicarbazone) complex, 2, exhibits a significant activity against acyclovir-resistant viruses R-100 (HSV 1) and PU (HSV 2) with an in vitro selectivity index (SI) of 8.0 vs. 0.01 for acyclovir. This complex also negatively influenced the expression of key structural HSV 1 proteins (VP23, gH and gG/gD), thus suppressing simultaneously virus entry, transactivation of virus genome, capsid assembly, and cell-to-cell spread of infectious HSV progeny.
