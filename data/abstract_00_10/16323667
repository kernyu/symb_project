The aim of this study was to characterize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates recovered from different infectious sites of hospitalized patients at two university hospitals. Fourteen isolates were analyzed by repetitive sequence based PCR (Rep-PCR), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA assay (RAPD-PCR), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We found that a prevalent clone of MRSA, susceptible to rifampin, minocycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (RIF(s), MIN(s), TMS(s)) was present in both hospitals in replacement of the multiresistant MRSA South American clone, previously described in these hospitals. The staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCCmec) type I element was detected in this new clone.
