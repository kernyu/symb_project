With respect to pneumococci, there is a need to detect first-step mutants with reduced fluoroquinolone (FQ) susceptibility from which second-step, resistant mutants are likely to be selected in the presence of antipneumococcal FQs. Here, we describe an interpretative disk diffusion test, of which three options are presented, that allows the distinction between first- and second-step mutants. Using five FQ disks (pefloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin, option 1), all known mechanisms of altered FQ susceptibility found in first-step mutants (ParC, ParE, GyrA, or efflux) and in second-step mutants (ParC and GyrA or ParE and GyrA) can be accurately detected, making this option a useful epidemiological tool. Using three FQ disks (pefloxacin, norfloxacin, and levofloxacin, option 2), the most prevalent FQ-resistant mutants, but not the first-step GyrA mutants, can be detected. With only two FQ disks (norfloxacin and levofloxacin) in the third and simplest option, first-step mutants can be distinguished from second-step mutants, however, without differentiation of ParC, ParE, or efflux alterations.
