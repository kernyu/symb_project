Nosocomial infections caused by gram-negative bacilli which produce extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) are associated with the increase of morbidity and mortality in hospitals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of ESBL, specifically the TEM and SHV type, produced by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. strains, and also to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates in comparison with other antibiotic families. A total of 326 strains were collected between 2002-2004 from hospitals in Havana City. The susceptibility tests were carried out according to the NCCLS guides and they were confirmed as. ESBL producers by the double disk diffusion method. The molecular characterization of these enzymes was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using two sets of oligonucleotides to amplify genes encoding TEM and SHV type beta-lactamase. The ESBL phenotype was detected in 31 (10%) Escherichia coli isolates, 19 of these strains (61%) carried the blaTEM genes, 5 (16%) blaSHV genes, 4 (12%) strains carried both genes and 11 strains (35%) carried the non-ESBL blaTEM and blaSHV genes. In Klebsiella spp. the ESBL phenotype was detected in 10 (36 %) isolates, only one strain carried the blaTEM gene. The most active antimicrobials against Escherichia coli were ciprofloxacin (64.5%) and gentamicin (58.07%); in the case of Klebsiella spp. the same antimicrobials were the most active with similar susceptibility (70%) for both. The carbapenems still remain the most active antibiotics against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. strains, which are ESBL producers. However, their use should be closely controlled.
