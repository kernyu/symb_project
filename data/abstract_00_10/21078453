This article covers HIV drug resistance among pregnant women and the implications of transmission of resistant HIV to the infant. Resistance to antiretroviral drugs may be acquired or can emerge while HIV-infected pregnant women are on antiretroviral therapy, either before or during pregnancy. Resistance to antiretroviral drugs among HIV-infected infants may be acquired from the mother in utero or during the intrapartum period. Resistance may also emerge from exposure to antiretroviral drugs given to the infant for prophylaxis against HIV transmission. In settings where breastfeeding is practiced, ongoing transmission of HIV from breastfeeding may lead to transmission of resistant HIV from the mother. If the mother is taking antiretroviral drugs while breastfeeding, resistance to antiretroviral drugs may emerge in an HIV-infected infant from ingestion of antiretroviral drugs via breast milk. The magnitude and implications of antiretroviral resistance among HIV-infected pregnant women and HIV-infected infants are summarized.
