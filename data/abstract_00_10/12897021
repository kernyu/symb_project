The cell wall of the environmental pathogen Mycobacterium avium is important to its virulence and intrinsic antimicrobial resistance. To identify genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, "transposome" insertion libraries were screened for mutants with altered colony morphology on medium containing the lipoprotein stain Congo red. Nineteen such mutants were isolated and mapped, including 10 with insertions in a functional island of cell wall biosynthetic genes that spans approximately 40 kb of the M. avium genome.
