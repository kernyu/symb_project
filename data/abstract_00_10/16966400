Posaconazole and itraconazole were more potent inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis, in both intact cells and cell extracts from Absidia corymbifera and Rhizopus oryzae, than voriconazole and fluconazole. Similarly, expression of CYP51 from R. oryzae in Saccharomyces cerevisiae significantly increased resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole but not to posaconazole and itraconazole.
