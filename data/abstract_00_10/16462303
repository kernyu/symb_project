We report a 21-month-old boy with primary lung abscess caused by multidrug-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae. A computed tomography-guided aspirate obtained on admission grew penicillin-, ceftriaxone-, erythromycin- and clindamycin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae. The patient was treated for 10 days with parental rifampin and cefotaxime and then for 4 weeks with oral cefpodoxime and recovered without complications.
