This Phase IIb, placebo-controlled study involved 55 TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy. They were divided into two groups, matched by age, gender, baseline bodyweight and clinical manifestations: one group (n = 27) received a once-daily V-5 Immunitor (V5) immunotherapy pill and the other (n = 28) received placebo. Only one (3.7%) and three (10.7%) subjects in V5 and placebo arms, respectively had first-diagnosed, drug-sensitive TB; the remaining patients had re-treated TB, multidrug-resistant TB or HIV-TB coinfection. After 1 month, 26 out of 27 patients (96.3%) became sputum smear negative in the V5 group (p < 0.0000001), whereas seven out of 28 (25%) in the placebo group had converted (p = 0.005). V5 contributed to the downregulation of TB-associated inflammation, as shown by normalization of high leukocyte counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and faster defervescence than controls. Patients in both arms experienced an increase in the levels of hemoglobin corresponding to 128.9 +/- 17.6 versus 133.1 +/- 14.7 g/l (p = 0.03) and 112.6 +/- 14 versus 117 +/- 11.7 g/l (p = 0.03) in V5 and placebo arms, respectively. In total, 19 out of 28 placebo patients (67.9%) gained, on average, 1.07 kg (59.1 +/- 10 vs 60.1 +/- 10.4 kg; p = 0.003). By contrast, all patients in the V5 group gained weight with mean 3.4 kg (59.7 +/- 8 vs 63.1 +/- 9 kg; p = 5.7E-007). Clinical symptoms improved among all patients in V5 arm, while 28.6% of patients on placebo reported satisfactory results (p = 0.007). No adverse or side effects attributable to V5 were seen at any time. Further studies are needed to gauge the extent of the benefits of V5 as safe and effective adjunct immunotherapy for TB.
