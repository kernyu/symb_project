Seasonal samplings of rumen and fecal populations of Enterobacteriacae from sheep digestive tract were done to elucidate potential occurrence and spreading of antibiotic resistance in the environment. Thus 350 rumen and fecal isolates were tested for ampicillin (Amp) resistance in single sampling. Low frequency of Amp resistance (from 0 to 15%) was observed. The occurrence of tem1 encoded Amp resistance confirmed by PCR was observed among both rumen and fecal isolates. The small tem1 carrying plasmid and its transfer (mobilization) was detected and partially characterized after conjugation to laboratory Escherichia coli strain.
