Plasmodium vivax parasites with chloroquine resistance (CQR) are already circulating in the Brazilian Amazon. Complete single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses of coding and noncoding sequences of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes revealed no associations with CQR, even if some mutations had not been randomly selected. In addition, striking differences in the topologies and numbers of SNPs in these transporter genes between P. vivax and P. falciparum reinforce the idea that mechanisms other than mutations may explain this virulent phenotype in P. vivax.
