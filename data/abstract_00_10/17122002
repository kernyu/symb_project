A study was designed to describe the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant (CR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a large well-defined geographical region with a centralized laboratory system serving one pediatric and three large adult hospitals (acute care centers I, II, and III). Molecular characterization was done using PCR with sequencing of the integron-associated gene cassettes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using a modified combined Stenotrophomas maltophilia and Streptococcus pneumoniae protocol with SpeI was performed on CR P. aeruginosa strains isolated in the Calgary Health Region during 2002-2006. The majority (96%) of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates produced VIM-2 with gene cassettes aacC1 and aacA4, while 4% produced IMP-7 with gene cassettes aacC4 and aacC1. Eighty-six percent of VIM-2 producers belonged to a cluster (MBLV) that was responsible for nosocomial outbreaks during 2003 (intensive care unit) and 2004 (bone marrow transplant unit) at acute care center I. Environmental isolates from these units also belonged to MBLV. The majority of strains from cluster MBLVR (related to MBLV) were present in acute care center III. Isolates producing IMP-7 belonged to a different cluster (MBLI) and were related to strains described during the 1990 s. PFGE of the MBL-negative CR strains showed that 37% belonged to a closely related cluster, NMBL, whose members were predominantly isolated from acute care center II. Our findings suggest that CR and dissemination of MBL clusters among P. aeruginosa populations in large geographic healthcare regions are dynamic processes that require continuous molecular surveillance.
