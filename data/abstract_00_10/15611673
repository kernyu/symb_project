OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence rates of nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and of SP with diminished susceptibility to penicillin (PDSP) according to two types of day care, i.e. children in group day-care (GDC) and those attended by a child minder (CM) before and after the implementation of a local public health campaign promoting prudent antibiotic use in pediatric care. METHODS: Two cross sectional studies were conducted in each care setting in 1999, 2000 and 2002, on a random sample of children. RESULTS: Initial prevalence rates for SP before the campaign were 54% in the GDC group in 1999 and 34% in the CM group in 2000, with 63% and 52% PDSP, respectively. In 2002 theses rates were 58 and 33% for SP (p<10(-5)) and 64 and 53% for PDSP, respectively. The proportion of children who received antibiotics decreased in both care settings between the two surveys, from 47 to 37% in the CM group (p=0.03) and from 60 to 51% in the GDC group (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: These results are in favor of the child minder setting and also illustrate the positive impact of a public health campaign on the frequency of antibiotic prescriptions.
