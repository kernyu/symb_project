In this study, the acute toxicity of the organophosphorous pesticides dichlorvos and chlorpyrifos to two different species of Artemia (A. salina and A. parthenogenetica) was evaluated. In addition, the in vivo effect of these two pesticides on cholinesterase (ChE) activity of both A. salina and A. parthenogenetica was also determined. The characterisation of the ChE, using different substrates and specific inhibitors, and the normal range of activity in non-exposed individuals were previously investigated for both species. The results obtained indicate that the ChE of A. salina is different from that of A. parthenogenetica and that both enzymes cannot be classified neither as acetylcholinesterase nor as butyrylcholinesterase since they show intermediary characteristics between the two vertebrate forms. The range of normal ChE activity was 2.65+/-0.15 U/mg protein for A. salina, and 3.69+/-0.17 U/mg protein for A. parthenogenetica. Significant in vivo effects of both pesticides on Artemia ChE activity were found, at concentrations between 5.38 and 9.30 mg/l for dichlorvos and between 1.85 and 3.19 mg/l for chlorpyrifos. Both Artemia species are resistant to these pesticides and they are able to survive with more than 80% ChE inhibition. However, A. parthenogenetica is more resistant than A. salina, with about a 95% reduction in its ChE activity respect to the control for nauplii exposed to the median lethal concentrations (LC50), without lethal effects after 24 h of exposure.
