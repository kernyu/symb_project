Culture-based values for antimicrobial susceptibility of 28 antimicrobials against different bacteria isolated from clinical material in a tertiary care hospital were used to pick the most promising antimicrobials. Isolates originating from urinary tract, blood and pyogenic foci, enteric fever and enteritis were grouped. Antimicrobials, systemic or oral, exhibiting a 75% or more susceptibility were compartmentalized in relation to divergent clinical disorders. Retrospective categorized culture-based susceptibility values should help a rational prospective chemotherapeutic intervention against infectious syndromes encountered in hospital practice.
