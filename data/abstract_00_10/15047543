We have demonstrated that 6,7-dihydroxyflavone by itself has only a weak antibacterial effect on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) but that at concentrations less than MIC it synergistically elevates the susceptibility of clinically isolated MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains to beta-lactam antibiotics from 8- to 32,800-fold.
