Microbial biofilms have been observed as congregates and attached communities on a diverse range of microecosystems of medicinal and industrial importance. Until recently, most investigations have been performed on planktonic (floating or fluid phase) microorganisms. After realization of the biofilm existence and their recalcitrance toward conventionally adopted preventive strategies and antimicrobial agents, research has been shifted toward novel therapeutics based drug delivery and targeting approaches. With the emergence of various biofilm models and methods to assess biofilm formation and physiology, it is pivotal to discuss various novel strategies that may become the therapeutic tools and clinically adaptable strategies of the future. This review explores various novel research strategies studied to date for their potential in effective biofilm eradication.
