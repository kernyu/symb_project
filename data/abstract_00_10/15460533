Seventeen S. aureus clinical isolates, collected from an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during a seven-month period were analyzed to investigate their antimicrobial susceptibility and clonal diversity. Eleven isolates (65%) were found to be resistant to methicillin (MRSA). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles of genomic DNAs, and analysis of the polymorphisms of the variable regions of the protein A (spa) and coagulase (coa) genes revealed a lower clonal heterogeneity among MRSA than among methicillin-susceptible isolates (MSSA). Two of the MRSA clones were repeatedly isolated in different patients, within a variable period of time, suggesting the presence in the ward of a resident, endemic and multi-drug resistant MRSA population. Our results also emphasize the lower discriminatory power of spa and coa typing compared with PFGE typing.
