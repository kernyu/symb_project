Placental sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum in pregnancy may impair the usefulness of molecular markers of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. In 300 infected, delivering women, the concordance of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism-derived parasite resistance alleles in matched samples from placenta and circulation was 83 to 98%. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance typing in peripheral blood is reasonably representative of P. falciparum infecting pregnant women.
