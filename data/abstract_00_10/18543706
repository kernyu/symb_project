In order to contribute to the national debate on the change of protocol of the simple forms of malaria treatment in Burkina Faso, we conducted a transversal descriptive study among 397 private pharmacies users in Ouagadougou. The aims of the study were: - making an inventory of the antimalarials and signs which led to self-medication; - identifying the factors favouring self-treatment and the reasons why these antimalarials have been bought; - making an inventory of the misuses of antimalarial drugs by individuals practicing self-medication; - checking the knowledge base in individuals practicing self-medication in relation to resistance to antimalarials. We noticed that chloroquine (39.3%), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamin (24.4%), arthemisinin and its by products (15.1%) were the three main molecules which account for antimalarial self-treatment However the use of these molecules was inappropriate regarding the dosage (41.3%) as well as the rate of intake (40.7%). Self-medication was motivated by the common signs of malaria and the way in which this parasitosis has become an every day feature in people's minds. The choice of the molecule, the knowledge of the directions for use and the rate of intake were significantly linked to the level of education (p < 0.001). Self-medication being one of the major causes of resistance development, it is necessary together with local pharmacies retailers, to organize information campaigns on the correct use of molecules of the new antimalarial therapeutic scheme which will be adopted.
