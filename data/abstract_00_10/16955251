The prospective cohort study presented here assessed the risk factors associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa gastrointestinal colonization (PAGIC) in 933 patients hospitalized in five different wards in a French university hospital. A total of 195 patients were colonized. By logistic regression, hospitalization in an intensive care unit and length of hospital stay were independent risk factors. A significant association was observed between fluoroquinolone use and PAGIC caused by an ofloxacin-resistant strain (p < 0.0001), imipenem use and PAGIC caused by an imipenem-resistant strain (p < 0.0002) and ceftazidime use and PAGIC caused by a ceftazidime-resistant strain (p < 0.02). The ecological impact of antibiotic use is of great clinical relevance and clinicians should consider antimicrobial resistance in order to limit the development and dissemination of resistant microorganisms.
