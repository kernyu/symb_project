The bacterial ribosome is a target for a variety of drug classes including macrolides. Macrolide antibiotics are primarily used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. One of the most important features of the macrolide class is the excellent safety profile allowing the drug to be used broadly across all age groups. The emergence of macrolide resistance, especially in S. pneumoniae, threatens the long-term usefulness of macrolide antibiotics. The newly developed ketolide class, including telithromycin and ABT-773, evolved from the macrolide class and displays significant improvements over macrolides while maintaining safety profiles similar to macrolides. The key improvement in antimicrobial spectrum is the in vitro potency against macrolide resistant pathogens, especially S. pneumoniae. This review outlines the key improvements of ketolides over macrolides in terms of in vitro microbiology, as well as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and updates the current understanding of drug-ribosome interactions. The application of cutting-edge technology such as ribosome structure-based rational drug design and genetic engineering are also briefly discussed.
