OBJECTIVES: Paediatric pneumococcal meningitis causes high rates of neurological sequelae and is presenting challenges due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Diagnosis can be difficult and management is frequently complicated and resource intensive. This population-based study outlines the diagnosis, clinical course and initial resource use of Western Australian (WA) children diagnosed between 1990 and 2000. METHODS: The charts of all rural and metropolitan children discharged from all WA hospitals with International Classification of Disease 9 and 10 codes of pneumococcal or streptococcal meningitis from the Health Department's Hospital Morbidity Data System were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Ninety-four episodes of pneumococcal meningitis were confirmed (median age 12.4 months). Initial diagnosis was often difficult with a suggestive prodrome in less than one quarter of cases and a median of two reviews until diagnosis (range 1-7). The median duration of hospitalization was 11.6 days, 41.5% were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 47.9% had seizures. There were eight related deaths and neurological sequelae occurred in 24. Initial hospitalization cost on average $A 19,900. Penicillin resistance was first noted in 1993 and occurred in 4.6% of isolates. Most cases (84.5%) were caused by serotypes contained in the currently available seven-valent conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal meningitis is often difficult to diagnose, necessitates long and frequently complicated in-patient stays and has high rates of neurological sequelae. It is possible to prevent most cases with new conjugate vaccines.
