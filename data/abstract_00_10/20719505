Apoptosis is a highly regulated process by which excessive cells are eliminated in order to maintain normal cell development and tissue homeostasis. Resistance to apoptosis often contributes to failure in cancer prevention and treatment. Apoptotic cell death regulators are considered important targets for discovery and development of new therapeutic agents in oncology research. A class of novel aza-lupane triterpenoids were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for antitumor activity against a panel of cancer cell lines of different histogenic origin and for ability to induce apoptosis. 3,30-Bis(aza) derivatives were identified not only to possess improved cytotoxicity compared to the natural product betulinic acid but also to affect cell death predominantly via apoptosis, whereas the mono(aza) derivatives apparently triggered cell death via different, non-apoptotic pathway(s).
