The efficiency of treatment has been studied in 100 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis caused by drug-resistant (DR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) strains and complicated by bronchial diseases, treated at the units of the Clinic of Phthisiopulmonology, I. M. Sechenov Moscow Medical Academy, in 2004 to 2006. Several forms of specific and/or nonspecific bronchial diseases are shown to be detected in patients with drug resistance in MBT. Pulmonary tuberculosis caused by DR MBT strains and complicated by bronchial diseases is characterized by the lower interferon-producing capacity of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and by more significant impairments in the mechanisms of local lung protection. Inclusion of the immunomodulator leukinferon into the combined therapy of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by bronchial diseases contributes to the elevation of BAL cell production of alpha and gamma-interferons, reduces the generation of active oxygen forms in the BAL phagocytes and brush biopsy specimens, and increases the levels of immunoglobulins in BAL. The local administration of leukinferon reduces the time of cure of specific and nonspecific bronchial diseases in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who isolate DR MBT strains, thus promoting the enhanced efficiency of treatment in reducing the times of bacterial isolation and decay cavity closure and the length of hospital stay.
