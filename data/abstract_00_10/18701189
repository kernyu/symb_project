Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to carbapenems (MRAB-C) has become endemic in many hospitals in the UK. We describe an outbreak of MRAB-C that occurred on two intensive care units using ORION criteria (Outbreak Reports and Intervention studies Of Nosocomial infection). All patients colonised or infected with MRAB-C were included. Enhanced infection control precautions were introduced in Phase 1 of the outbreak. The adult neurosciences critical care unit (NCCU) was partially closed in Phase 2 and strict patient segregation, barrier nursing and screening thrice weekly was introduced. When control was achieved, NCCU was reopened (Phase 3) with post-discharge steam cleaning and monthly cleaning of extract and supply vents. There were 19 cases, 16 on NCCU and three on the general intensive care unit (ICU). Mean age was 52 years, with six cases being female. All patients were mechanically ventilated and ten had either an extraventricular drain or intracranial pressure monitoring device in place. Four patients developed a bacteraemia, with one further case of ventriculitis. Nine patients had no clinical evidence of infection and four were identified initially on screening. Ten patients were treated; there were eight deaths. Environmental samples showed heavy contamination throughout NCCU. MRAB-C affects critically ill patients and is associated with high mortality. This outbreak was controlled by early involvement of management, patient segregation, screening of patients and the environment, and increased hand hygiene environmental cleaning and clinical vigilance. A multidisciplinary approach to outbreak control is mandatory.
