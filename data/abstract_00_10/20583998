The MexAB-OprM drug efflux pump is central to multidrug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ability of the tripartite protein to confer drug resistance on the pathogen is crucially dependent on the presence of all three proteins of the complex. However, the role of each protein in the formation of the intact functional complex is not well understood. One of the key questions relates to the (in)ability of MexB to act independently of its cognitive partners, MexA and OprM. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, in the absence of MexA and OprM, MexB can: (i) recruit AcrA and TolC from Escherichia coli to form a functional drug-efflux complex; (ii) transport the toxic compound ethidium bromide in a Gram-positive organism where the periplasmic space and outer membrane are absent; and (iii) catalyse transmembrane chemical proton gradient (DeltapH)-dependent drug transport when purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Our results represent the first evidence of drug transport by an isolated RND (resistance-nodulation-cell division)-type multidrug transporter, and provide a basis for further studies into the energetics of RND-type transporters and their assembly into multiprotein complexes.
