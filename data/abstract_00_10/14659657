MUC7 16-mer (residues 36-51 of human salivary mucin, MUC7) and histatin 5 possess potent in vitro antifungal activity. In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy of these peptides in vivo using the experimental model of murine vulvo-vaginal candidiasis. The treatment groups included MUC7 16-mer, histatin 5, clotrimazole (all in pluronic F127 gel), and placebo (gel alone). Mice were treated intravaginally for 7 consecutive days. At the end of the treatment, anticandidal activities were assessed by colony counts and by histological examination. All groups except clotrimazole presented positive cultures; no statistically significant differences were found in fungal burden amongst placebo and any treatment group except clotrimazole. Histopathological findings confirmed the microbiological results; all groups with the exception of clotrimazole showed variable signs of infection.
