OBJECTIVES: We studied the impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase/reverse transcriptase (Pol/Rt) heterogeneity on adefovir rescue therapy in 34 consecutive chronic hepatitis B patients with viral breakthrough during lamivudine monotherapy. METHODS: The Pol/Rt A-F domains were directly sequenced in all patients at baseline, and 12 and 24 months. Response to therapy was evaluated at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months by quantitative HBV-DNA. RESULTS: Primary treatment failures did not occur. At 6 months 24/34 (70.6%) patients had viraemia<10(4) copies/mL [initial viral response (IVR)]; at 12 and 24 months 23 (71.9%) and 26 (81.3%) of 32 had HBV-DNA<200 copies/mL [complete viral response (CVR)]. IVR or CVR patients did not show viral breakthroughs, which occurred in one of the six remaining patients. All but three patients had baseline rtM204I/V substitutions associated with rtL180M in 23, rtL80I/V in 14, rtV173L in 4, rtT184S in 3, rtQ215S in 2 and rtA181S in 2 cases. rtA181S without rtM204I/V was found in one patient. Four of the six patients (67%) without 24 month CVR showed rtA181S or rtT184S substitutions either alone or with typical lamivudine resistance profiles. Baseline HBV-DNA levels were negatively associated with IVR (univariate analysis, P=0.023). At least one of rtA181S and rtT184S substitutions correlated negatively with IVR and CVR (univariate analysis, P=0.001) and was independently associated with absence of CVR (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Lamivudine monotherapy favours the emergence of viral quasispecies that influence the response rate to adefovir rescue therapy independently from baseline viraemia and lower the susceptibility to other nucleos(t)ide analogues.
