The effects of a propolis extract obtained by supercritical fluid extraction on sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents were examined in HeLa cells and resistant sublines thereof. In addition, the actions of propolis and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a constituent of propolis, on the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein/MDR1, were evaluated in paclitaxel-resistant HeLa/TXL cells (MDR1-overexpressing cells). In HeLa cells, the sensitivity to paclitaxel and doxorubicin, substrates of MDR1, was unchanged in the presence of propolis. In HeLa/TXL cells, propolis increased sensitivity to these MDR1 substrates. The accumulation of Rhodamine123, also a substrate for MDR1, by HeLa/TXL cells increased in the presence of 50 microg/mL, but not 10 microg/mL, of the extract. However, the growth inhibition of HeLa/TXL cells by paclitaxel was not changed by CAPE, although the accumulation of Rhodamine123 increased significantly in the presence of 100 microm, but not 1 nM or 1 microm, CAPE. Collectively, the extract was suggested to inhibit the function of MDR1 and to increase the sensitivity to MDR1 substrates in HeLa/TXL cells, effects likely to be caused by constituents other than CAPE.
