The bacitracin resistance of Bacillus licheniformis, a producer of bacitracin, is mediated by the ABC transporter Bcr. Bacillus subtilis cells carrying bcr genes on high-copy number plasmids developed collateral detergent sensitivity, as did human cells with overexpressed multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein. Resistance against bacitracin and sensitivity of resistant cells to detergents were shown to be inseparable phenomena associated with the membrane part of Bcr transporter, namely protein BcrC. A fused protein, consisting of ATP-binding protein BcrA and membrane component BcrC was constructed. It resembled a half molecule of P-glycoprotein and was capable of providing a significant degree of antibiotic resistance and detergent sensitivity.
