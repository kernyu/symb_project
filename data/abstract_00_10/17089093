The aim of the present study was to characterize clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one of the bacterial species most often implicated in foreign-body-associated infections, for their ability to form biofilms and for the presence of mecA and IS256 element. Sixty-seven Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates, obtained from implantable medical devices, were investigated. Overall, 70% of the strains were positive for ica operon genes, 85% possessed atlE, and 46% contained aap. In 89% of the population, the Congo red agar test confirmed the correlation between the presence of ica genes and slime expression. Almost all of the strains could be classified as biofilm producers by both the crystal violet assay and microscopy. The bacterial population studied showed a very high frequency of strains positive for mecA as well as for the IS256 element. Although well-structured biofilms have been previously observed only in those strains possessing genes belonging to the ica operon, this study demonstrates that strains lacking specific biofilm-formation determinants can be isolated from catheters and can form a biofilm in vitro. Hence, different and yet-to-be identified factors may work together in the formation and organization of complex staphylococcal microbial communities and sustain infections associated with implanted medical devices.
