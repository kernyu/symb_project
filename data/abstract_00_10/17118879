Microparticles are widely employed as carriers of biologically active compounds with many possible applications. For targeted drug delivery and sustained release purposes, biopolymers (i.e. polysaccharides and proteins) have been proposed. In this study, microsphere formulations of vancomycin were prepared by the spray-drying method. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a polymer matrix and was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde after microsphere preparation. The product yield obtained from the spray-drying method was approximately 75%. The mean particle size was 5 +/- 1.6 microm, with the majority of particles between 4 and 8 microm. The extent of cross-linking affected the release of vancomycin from microspheres. Moreover, both rate and extent of vancomycin release from microspheres decreased with increasing glutaraldehyde concentration. Encapsulation of vancomycin did not alter the bioactivity of the drug and it was more effective in killing Staphylococcus aureus than the solution form.
