OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability and clinical practicability of cefoxitin disk diffusion test in the detection of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus (MRS) heterogenic drug-resistant strains. METHODS: Three hundred and ten strains of staphylococcus isolated from clinics were detected by the oxacillin disk diffusion test, the cefoxitin disk diffusion test as well as the oxacillin agar dilution test according to the standard operation procedures of NCCLS, and the detection of mecA gene of staphylococcus was used as a criterion. The sensitivities and specitivities of the 4 methods were compared. RESULTS: By the detection of mecA gene, the ratio for MRSA was 57.1%(113/198) and the ratio for MRCNS was 62.5%(70/112). Both the sensitivity and specificity of cefoxitin disk diffusion test in the detection of MRS were 100%, and those in the detection of MRCNS were 98.6% and 100%. CONCLUSION: Cefoxitin disk diffusion test is reliable, simple and convenient, and it can be used as a conventional method for the detection of MRS in clinical laboratories.
