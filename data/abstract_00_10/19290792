Drug resistance in malaria jeopardizes the most elementary objectives of malaria control--reducing suffering and eliminating mortality. An important, and so far the only known, mechanism of drug resistance appears to be polymorphisms in the malaria parasite genes. Efforts to circumvent antimalarial drug resistance now range from the use of combination therapies with existing agents to genomics-based studies directed toward discovering novel targets and agents. However, the potential contribution of host genetic/molecular factors, particularly those associated with antimalarial drug metabolism, remains largely unexplored. Our knowledge concerning the basic mechanisms involved in the pharmacokinetics of antimalarial drugs is fragmentary. In addition, the link between antimalarial drug pharmacokinetics and treatment outcomes is generally unclear. The purpose of this article is to provide general background information on antimalarial drug resistance and associated parasite genetic factors, and subsequently highlight the aforementioned unexplored and unclear areas, with a view to stimulate much needed further research.
