Susceptibilities to amphotericin B and fluconazole of 909 Candida species collected during the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts (TSARY) in 2002 were determined by the broth microdilution method. There were 395 (43.5%) Candida albicans, 244 (26.8%) C. tropicalis, 187 (20.6%) C. glabrata, 63 (6.9%) C. parapsilosis, 9 (1%) C. krusei, and 11 (1.2%) others. Among them, 23 (2.5%) isolates were resistant to amphotericin B. They consisted of 10 C. glabrata, 6 C. krusei, 3 C. albicans, 1 C. tropicalis, 1 C. parapsilosis, and 2 others. The resistance rate to amphotericin B has increased compared with that of TSARY 1999 (2.5% versus 0.5%). There were 7 C. krusei, 5 C. albicans, 3 C. glabrata, and 2 others isolates resistant to fluconazole. The resistance rate to fluconazole has decreased from 8.4% in 1999 to 1.9% in 2002. A pattern of coresistance to both amphotericin B and fluconazole was observed.
