Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a facultative intracellular pathogen with which over a billion people have been infected and 3 million people die annually. The bacterium induces vigorous immune responses, yet evades host immunity, persisting within phagosomes of the infected macrophages. Thus, it is necessary to delineate that the virulence-related intracellular survival mechanism and the host immune responses to eradicate M. tuberculosis on the molecular basis. In this regard, recent findings clearly indicated that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an essential role in the recognition of MTB components by macrophages and dendritic cells, resulting in not only activation of innate immunity but also development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. It has been also reported that induction of early death of the infected cells may be one of the strategy of host defense against MTB because macrophages go into apoptosis upon infection with MTB, resulting in suppression of the intracellular replication. Furthermore, recent report has shown that autophagy is induced by IFN-gamma and suppress intracellular survival of mycobacteria, suggesting that activation of autophagy pathway is required to overcome phagosome maturation arrest induced by MTB. In addition, it is known that IFN-gamma plays an important role in protection. The cytokine that is produced from NK cells and dendritic cells at the early period of infection strongly induces not only macrophage activation but also development of antigen-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD4+T cells. Since antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and CD1-restricted T cells are also reported to contribute to the protective immunity, cooperation of these T cells is essential for the host resistance. In this paper, I am going to summarize the recent progress of the understanding of protective immunity against MTB.
