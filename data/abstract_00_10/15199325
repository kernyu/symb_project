No significant changes in viral load and CD4 cell count were observed 2-4 weeks after the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) from the current therapy of patients exhibiting resistance mutations to this class of drugs. The data suggest that in the presence of specific resistance mutations NNRTIexert no residual antiretroviral activity and could be withdrawn without viral rebound.
