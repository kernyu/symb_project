The aim of our study was to evaluate a frequency of isolation and susceptibility to antibiotics of Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin resistant among 154 strains S. pneumoniae isolated between 2003 and 2006 in University Hospital of Dr. A. Jurasza in Bydgoszcz. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by disc-diffusion method according to the guidelines of Clinical and laboratory Standards Institute and The national Reference Centre for Antimicrobial Susceptibility. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for penicillin and cefotaxime were assessed by E-test method. Study shows increasing isolation of SPPR strains from 8,2% in 2003 to 32,0% in 2006. Strains were mostly isolated from patients ofNeurosurgery and Neurotraumatology Clinic and Rehabilitation Clinic. SPPR strains were mainly isolated from respiratory tract. Over 68% of SPPR showed intermediate resistance to penicillin and 73,3% of strains were susceptible to cefotaxime. Between 2003 and 2006 increased percentage of resistance strains to erythromycin, tetracycline and sulphometoxasol.
