Multiple drug resistance is one of the problems associated with the treatment of urinary tract infection. Urine bacterial culture confirmed extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in 56 patients in the Department of Urology, Hokkaido Social Welfare Association Furano Hospital. The mean age of the patients was 83 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1:2. The source of infection was cystitis in 51 patients and pyelonephritis in 5 patients. The most common underlying disease was neurogenic bladder in 42 patients, and a urinary tract catheter had been placed in 33 patients. Before the detection of ESBL-producing E. coli, common bacteria included E. coli, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas. ESBL-producing E. coli were sensitive to the following antibiotics: carbapenem; cephamycin; aminoglycoside; and synthesized penicillin. ESBL-producing E. coli are resistant to multiple drugs. The use of urinary tract catheterization and antibiotics for asymptomatic urinary tract infection should be kept to a minimum.
