There is a great need for alternative modes of inhibition for the design of anti-HIV therapies, due to the increased resistance of HIV to currently approved drugs. A novel strategy for generating potent dimerization inhibitors of HIV-1 protease is described based on sidechain-linked interfacial peptides. In a number of cases the activity of these agents against HIV-1 protease was found to be among the most potent reported, with inhibitory constants in the low nM range.
