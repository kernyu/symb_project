Infections in patients with cirrhosis are a common complication causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Bacterial translocation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many infections in cirrhosis. In turn, infections are involved in the pathogenesis of many episodes of decompensated cirrhosis, such as esophageal variceal bleeding, renal insufficiency, the hemodynamic alterations of cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is currently the most frequent infection in cirrhosis. Mortality from this entity has recently decreased due to early diagnosis, the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy, and albumin administration. However, infections due to multiresistant microorganisms have recently increased, leading to greater mortality. Primary prophylaxis with quinolones is effective in preventing infections and is associated with lower mortality in a selected population of patients with liver cirrhosis.
