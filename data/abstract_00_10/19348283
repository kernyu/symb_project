Mycotoxin Fumonisin B1 posseesses the weak DNA-damage activity for the E. coli strain defective in UvrA gene participating in DNA reparation. Fumonisin B1 in the concentration 10(-5) M increases a resistance of wild type E. coli cells to antibiotic doxycycline. Obtained results indicate the influence of fumonisin B1 on the genome of the cultured E. coli cells.
