Staphylococci are a major cause of infections associated with indwelling medical devices. Biofilm formation on these devices adds to the antibiotic resistance seen among clinical isolates. RNAIII-inhibiting peptide (RIP) is a heptapeptide that inhibits staphylococcal pathogenesis, including biofilm formation, by obstructing quorum sensing mechanisms. Bismuth ethanedithiol (BisEDT) also prevents biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. RIP and BisEDT were combined to prevent infections in a rat graft model, using antibiotic sensitive and resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. BisEDT, RIP, or rifampin, or their combinations reduced the graft associated bacterial load over seven days. BisEDT-RIP was the best combination, reducing bacterial load to undetectable levels. BisEDT-RIP may prove useful for coating medical devices to prevent staphylococcal infections.
