Antiretroviral susceptibility analyses were performed in plasma samples collected from 32 HIV-1 non-B-infected individuals, most of whom had received antiretroviral drugs. Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease gene sequences were obtained, and 15 anti-HIV drugs were tested in a recombinant virus phenotypic assay. Phenotypic results were obtained in 25 (78.1%) samples, while genotypic data were recorded in 19 (59.4%). In seven samples (21.9%), neither genotypic nor phenotypic results were obtained. Ten of 13 samples with plasma HIV RNA below 2000 copies/mL did not yield genotypic results. Resistance assays work accurately when testing HIV-1 non-B subtypes. However, as for subtype B variants, a low viral load is the most important factor limiting the application of these tests.
