The present study was conducted to isolate aerobic as well as anaerobic microbes from patients of gingivitis and adult periodontitis and to study the susceptibility patterns of these isolates to different antibiotics. In our study all the samples belonging to the control as well as the study groups yielded microbes. Aerobes and facultative anaerobes were isolated from 100 percent and 96 percent cases of normal gingiva and orodental infections respectively. Anaerobes were isolated from 80 percent of the normal gingival samples and 97 percent of the cases of orodental infections. Metronidazole was found to be the best for the anaerobes while the aerobes and facultative anaerobes showed good susceptibility to cefazolin and cefotaxime.
