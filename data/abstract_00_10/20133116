Acute sinusitis in children is a controversial issue in terms of its diagnostic criteria, classification and therapeutic management. A therapeutic delay can lead to complications if the cause is bacterial. Guidelines have been set, but they are not consensual in pediatrics. Complications of acute bacterial sinusitis are uncommon in children, but they can be extremely severe and cause high morbidity and mortality. Because of their rarity, they often are not identified early, exposing the patient to an unfavorable outcome. We report on a case of acute bacterial pan-sinusitis complicated with thrombophlebitis of the cavernous sinuses and meningitis in a 9-year-old child, in spite of early and adapted antibiotic therapy. The bacterial agent was Staphylococcus aureus, which had no resistance or toxin profile. The progression was favorable under intravenous antibiotic therapy and after bilateral sphenoidectomy. This case raises the question of the best therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in pediatrics and the management of complications.
