This is a case study of a 5-week-old child, after prolonged hospitalization in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, with fever and urinary tract infection caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing, gentamicin-resistant, Escherichia coli. This case highlights the importance of taking risk factors for resistant bacterial infection into account in young, ill-appearing infants, and suggests that in some cases empirical antibiotic treatment should be even broader than recommended by current guidelines.
