The in vitro inhibitory effects of diallyl disulphide (DADS), diallyl trisulphide (DAT), roselle calyx extract and protocatechuic acid (PA) on the growth of Helicobacter pylori (15 susceptible, 11 clarithromycin-resistant and 9 metronidazole-resistant strains) were studied. The inhibition zone was determined after each agent had been heated at 25, 60, 100 degrees C for 60 min. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each agent was determined by the tube dilution assay. The results showed that heat treatment did not affect the anti-H. pylori activity of DADS, DAT, roselle calyx extract and PA, and the MIC values of these agents against test H. pylori strains were in the range 8-64 mg/L. The time-kill study assay for DAT and PA at 1x MIC was monitored in Muller Hinton broth supplemented with 10% horse blood or mice stomach homogenate. Both DAT and PA inhibited the growth of all test H. pylori in broth and mice stomach homogenate (p < 0.05); however, the inhibitory effects of these two agents were less in mice stomach homogenate than in broth (p < 0.05). DAT at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 mg/L and PA at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 mg/L were used for urease activity assay. These two agents significantly reduced urease activity of test H. pylori strains (p < 0.05), in which DAT and PA at 1x MIC reduced the urease activity of H. pylori to 70% and 40%, respectively. These agents, based on their lower MIC values and heat tolerance, might be useful in the prevention or therapy of H. pylori.
