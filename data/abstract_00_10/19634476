The present study aimed to ascertain for the current situation of antimicrobial resistance of major urinary tract bacteria in Saint Camille Medical Centre. During two consecutive years, 794 urine specimens were analyzed for microorganism isolation and identification. The microorganisms were identified by conventional methods used in the centre and antimicrobial assays were performed by the NCCLS agar disk diffusion. Pathogenic microorganism's isolation was attempted for 89.04% samples. Escherichia coli (32.76%) was the most frequently isolated microorganism followed by Staphylococcus aureus (22.74%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.45%). The antimicrobial screenings revealed very high antimicrobial resistance, to beta-lactams. The resistance rates recorded with E. coli were 76.64, 74.01, 25 and 74.34% for ampicillin, amoxicillin amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. Microorganisms were still susceptible to quinolones however, attention should be paid, because, the resistance rate already reached 10% for nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Periodic performance of prevalence studies is a useful tool to know the current situation of microorganisms and their resistance patterns in an institution and it helps to access the emergence and the spread of antibiotic resistance.
