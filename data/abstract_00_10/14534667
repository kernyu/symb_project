BACKGROUND: Many of the currently used Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens fail to cure the infection due to either antimicrobial resistance or poor patient compliance. Those patients will remain at risk of developing potentially severe complications of peptic ulcer disease. AIM: We studied the impact of the antimicrobial resistance on the efficacy of a short course pantoprazole based triple therapy in a single-center pilot study. METHODS: Forty previously untreated adult patients (age range 20 to 75 years, 14 males) infected with Helicobacter pylori and with inactive or healing duodenal ulcer disease were assigned in this open cohort study to 1 week twice daily treatment with pantoprazole 40 mg, plus clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 400 mg. Helicobacter pylori was assessed at entry and 50 3 days after the end of treatment by rapid urease test, culture and histology of gastric biopsies. The criteria for eradication was a negative result in the tests. Susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin and metronidazole was determined before treatment with the disk diffusion test. RESULTS: One week treatment and follow up were complete in all patients. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori was achieved in 35/40 patients (87.5%) and was higher in patients with nitroimidazole-susceptible strains [susceptible: 20/20 (100%), resistant: 10/15 (67%)]. There were six (15%) mild adverse events reports. CONCLUSIONS: A short course of pantoprazole-based triple therapy is well tolerated and effective in eradicating Helicobacter pylori. The baseline metronidazole resistance may be a significant limiting factor in treatment success.
