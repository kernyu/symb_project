In vitro, the reverse transcriptase mutation K65R can simultaneously reduce drug susceptibility, replicative capacity and restrict HIV-1 replication. Here, we assessed the effect of tenofovir discontinuation for a patient receiving antiretroviral therapy whose HIV-1 had a dominant K65R/M184V genotype. Although limited by the single-case nature, the data support a hypothesis that there is no HIV viral RNA or CD4+ T-cell count benefit of taking tenofovir for experienced patients with genotypic evidence of K65R/M184V.
