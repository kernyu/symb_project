UNLABELLED: The hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is the most common cause of acute renal failure in young children and most often follows an episode of gastroenteritis caused by an enterohemorrhagic strain of Escherichia coli (O157:H7). HUS induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) is rare. We report an 18-month-old patient who presented with HUS associated with SP resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins. CONCLUSION: Despite a protracted course including renal failure requiring 15 days of peritoneal dialysis, her kidney function completely recovered.
