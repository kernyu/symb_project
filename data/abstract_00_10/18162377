Commensal bacteria of food-producing animals are considered an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the current prevalence of resistance to 18 different antibiotics in animal commensal Escherichia coli isolated from food-producing animals from three different farms with specific modes of antimicrobial use. A very high prevalence of resistance was found to tetracycline, a moderate level to streptomycin, ampicillin, cefalothin and nalidixic acid and a low of resistance to the other tested antibiotics. Resistance to two or more antibiotics was observed among all swine E. coli, 63.2% of broiler isolates and 37.5% of cattle isolates. The results show that commensals of food-producing animals from Vojvodina region are important reservoirs of resistance to older-generation antibiotics.
