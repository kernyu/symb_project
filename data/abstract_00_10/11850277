Polymyxin B (PXB) and the cecropin A-melittin hybrid CA(1-8)M(1-18) (KWKLFKKIGIGAVLKVLTTGLPALIS-NH2) were compared for antibiotic activity on reference and multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Significant differences for both peptides were observed on their inner membrane interaction and inhibition by environmental factors, supporting the use of CA(1-8)M(1-18) as a potential alternative to PXB against ACINETOBACTER:
