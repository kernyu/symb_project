Twelve heavily pretreated, perinatally infected adolescents in virological failure were treated with a combination of raltegravir, r-darunavir and etravirine, as part of an expanded access program in France. After a 12-month median follow-up, viral load was <400 copies/ml in 11 (<50 in six). No grade > 2 side effects were recorded. Additional data and marketing authorizations are awaited, but preliminary results in adolescents with extensive multidrug resistant virus are encouraging.
