Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is an i.v. antibiotic active against serious Gram-positive infections. Its unique dual mode of action means that the potential for resistance development is expected to be low. To determine the incidence of in vitro emerging resistance in worldwide clinical studies, susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin was measured for baseline pathogens and corresponding on- or post-study isolates from 880 evaluable patients. In comparative studies of community-acquired pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and nosocomial pneumonia, the incidence of emerging resistance was low (1 of 453; 0.22%; 95% CI: 0. 01-1.4%). Resistance development occurred in only one pathogen (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). In noncomparative studies, six instances (1.8% of 338 evaluable cases; 95% CI: 0.7 to 4.0%) of emerging resistance (all vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium) were confirmed, accompanied by therapeutic failure in four cases. Molecular typing did not confirm the identity of one pair of strains. Overall, the incidence of emerging resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was low.
