The antimicrobial activity of various antibiotics against clinical bacterial isolates recovered from patients with infectious diseases at the medical facilities in the Kanto region between March and September 2006 was evaluated. A total of 1030 clinical isolates were available for susceptibility tests: 420 aerobic Gram-positive organisms, 520 aerobic Gram-negative organisms, 30 anaerobic Gram-positive organisms and 60 anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Antimicrobial susceptibility data for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae isolates from pediatric and adult patients were analyzed separately. Panipenem (PAPM), imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), biapenem (BIPM), doripenem (DRPM), cefozopran (CZOP), cefepime (CFPM), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) were used as test antibiotics. PAPM, IPM and DRPM exhibited excellent in vitro antibacterial activities against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, with all isolates exhibiting a MIC of < or =0.06 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, PAPM demonstrated the strongest antibacterial activity among the carbapenems with a MIC range of < or =0.06 to 0.12 microg/mL. Against Enterobacteriaceae, MEPM showed the strongest antibacterial activity, and PAPM had comparable activity to IPM. Against the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species, the MICs for the cephems were high, however, those for the carbepenems were low. Against H. influenzae, PAPM had comparable activity to IPM. With respect to anaerobes, each of the carbapenems tested demonstrated almost the same strong antibacterial activity. In conclusion, 13 years has passed since PAPM was launched in 1993, PAPM still maintains potent antibacterial activity and is considered an effective antimicrobial agent for various types of infectious diseases.
