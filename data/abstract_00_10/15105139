We report on the development of a new SYBR Green I-based plate assay for analyzing the activities of antimalarial drugs against intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum. This assay is considerably faster, less labor-intensive, and less expensive than conventional radiotracer (e.g., [3H]hypoxanthine and [3H]ethanolamine)-based assays or P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase activity-based assays. The assay significantly improves the pace at which antimalarial drug discovery efforts may proceed.
