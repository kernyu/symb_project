Screening by ofloxacin disk was carried out on 1158 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae in order to investigate the in vitro bacteriostatic activity of penicillin G, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, telithromycin, linezolid, pristinamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin against ofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae strains. It was concluded that these new antimicrobial agents could be useful for the treatment of pneumococcal infections caused by penicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. pneumoniae, and would represent a valid therapeutic option for patients allergic to beta-lactams, should they prove to be potent in vivo.
