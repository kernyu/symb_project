Redistribution of virions from extrahepatic reservoirs with resultant reinfection of the graft is a serious complication after liver transplantation for hepatitis B-related liver disease. Prophylaxis of hepatitis B virus recurrence is a major issue in these patients. With the introduction of passive immunoprophylaxis and the development of antiviral drugs, liver transplantation has evolved as an established therapy of hepatitis B-induced end-stage liver failure. However, even under indefinite monoprophylaxis, a significant percentage of patients develop reinfection due to a high mutation rate of the hepatitis B virus. Progress, especially in the field of antiviral therapy, has opened new strategies, including combination prophylaxis and therapy, which further improve outcome. On the other hand, the broad use of antiviral drugs brings about new problems such as resistance formation prior to liver transplantation. In addition, due to the high costs of hepatitis B immunoglobulin alternatives such as prophylaxis with nucleoside analogs or vaccination are increasingly being investigated.
