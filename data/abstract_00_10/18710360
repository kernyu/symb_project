BACKGROUND: Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor with high specificity for HIV-1 protease formulated with ritonavir. Numerous clinical trials have shown that lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is highly effective as a component of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens for HIV-1 infection. OBJECTIVE: In this article we provide an overview of the properties of LPV/r and the experience with its use in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. METHODS: We reviewed the literature and selected the most important published articles on LPV/r and the latest posters/communications presented in conferences, with particular attention to the clinical efficacy and tolerability of LPV/r in HIV-1 infected patients. CONCLUSION: LPV/r is highly effective as a component of HAART regimens for HIV-1 infection. There is considerable experience with the drug in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. In general, LPV/r is well tolerated and its high genetic barrier to resistance favours long-term efficacy.
