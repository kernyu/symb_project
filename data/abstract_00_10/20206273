We report the growth, innate immune response, and disease resistance in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) challenged with Streptococcus iniae after feeding with diet enriched with Zooshikella sp. strain JE-34 three different concentration i.e. Low (3.4 x 10(4), n = 50), medium (3.5 x 10(6), n = 50), and high (3.4 x 10(8), n = 50) cfu ml(-1) supplemented diets, the changes were monitored on weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. With all diets the innate immune parameters, such as superoxide anion production, phagocytic and lysozyme activity were not enhanced on week 1 and 4. On the other hand, all tested immune parameters in the treated groups significantly enhanced after 8th week; the weight gain significantly increased after 4th week in fish fed with enriched diets. The mortality in olive flounder after administration with high concentration diet showed 25%. With low and medium enriched diets the mortality was 40% and 35%, respectively. In the infected untreated group mortality was 85% while there was no mortality in the control group. The results suggested that Zooshikella sp. strain JE-34 enriched diets could be used to enhance the innate immune response and disease resistance of P. olivaceus against S. iniae.
