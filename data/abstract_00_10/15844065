BACKGROUND: Few data exist on the efficacy of the long-acting tetracyclines doxycycline and minocycline against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. METHODS: The medical records of 24 patients with serious tetracycline-susceptible MRSA infections who were treated with doxycycline or minocycline were reviewed. A review of the literature on the use of these antibiotics for treatment of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection was also performed. RESULTS: Complicated skin and skin-structure infections were most common (67%). Clinical cure was achieved in 20 (83%) of 24 patients in our case series. Both drugs were well-tolerated. The review of the literature on a total of 85 patients with S. aureus infection revealed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Long-acting tetracyclines may be a reasonable treatment alternative for patients with certain types of MRSA infection.
