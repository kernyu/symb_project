Interleukin-12 (IL-12) has been shown to enhance cellular immunity in vitro and in vivo. The beneficial roles of IL-12 as a DNA vaccine adjuvant have been commonly observed. Here the impact of IL-12 complementary DNA (cDNA) as an adjuvant for a human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E7 DNA vaccine is investigated in a mouse tumour model. Coinjection of E7 DNA vaccine with IL-12 cDNA completely suppressed antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses, leading to a complete loss of antitumour protection from a tumour cell challenge. In addition, antigen-specific antibody and T helper cell proliferative responses were also suppressed by IL-12 cDNA coinjection. This inhibition was observed over different IL-12 cDNA doses. Furthermore, separate leg injections of IL-12 and E7 cDNAs suppressed antigen-specific CTL and tumour protective responses, but not antibody and T helper cell proliferative responses, suggesting different pathways for suppression of these two separate responses. Further knockout animal studies demonstrated that interferon-gamma and nitric oxide are not directly associated with suppression of antigen-specific antibody responses by IL-12 cDNA coinjection. However, nitric oxide was found to be involved in suppression of antigen-specific CTL and tumour protective responses by IL-12 cDNA coinjection. These data suggest that coinjection of IL-12 cDNA results in suppression of E7-specific CTL responses through nitric oxide, leading to a loss of antitumour resistance in this DNA vaccine model. This study further shows that the adjuvant effect of IL-12 is dependent on the antigen types tested.
