This review discusses the role that nitric oxide (NO) and its congeners play on various stages in the pathophysiology of Escherichia coli and Salmonella infections, with special emphasis on the regulatory pathways that lead to high NO synthesis, the role of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in host resistance, and the bacterial molecular targets and defense mechanisms that protect enteric bacteria against the nitrosative stress encountered in diverse host anatomical sites. In general, NO can react directly with prosthetic groups containing transition metal centers, with other radicals, or with sulfhydryl groups in the presence of an electron acceptor. Binding to iron complexes is probably the best characterized direct reaction of NO in biological systems. The targets of RNS are numerous. RNS can facilitate oxidative modifications including lipid peroxidation, hydroxylation, and DNA base and protein oxidation. In addition, RNS can inflict nitrosative stress through the nitrosation of amines and sulfhydryls. Numerous vital bacterial molecules can be targeted by NO. It is therefore not surprising that enteropathogenic bacteria are armed with a number of sensors to coordinate the protective response to nitrosative stress, along with an assortment of antinitrosative defenses that detoxify, repair, or avoid the deleterious effects of RNS encountered within the host. NO and NO-derived RNS play important roles in innate immunity to Salmonella and E. coli. Enzymatic NO production by NO synthases can be enhanced by microbial and other inflammatory stimuli and it exerts direct antimicrobial actions as well as immunomodulatory and vasoregulatory effects.
