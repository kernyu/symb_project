A strain of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii that caused a 26% mortality rate in a French epidemic was characterized and compared with an antibiotic-susceptible strain of A. baumannii. The multiresistant strain carries many of its antibiotic-resistance genes on an 86-kb region, whereas the susceptible strain lacks these genes in a homologous region. Characterization of this multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strain highlights the limited options for current therapy and raises concerns for future treatment options in an era in which few novel antibiotics are being developed.
