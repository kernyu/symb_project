This paper presents an overview of studies on novel strategies for the rational design of antifungal agents of low toxicity and overcoming the multidrug resistance (MDR) of fungi. This goal was achieved both due to the introduction of a novel target, glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, as well as to the recognition of molecular basis of selectivity of action of amphotericin B derivatives.
