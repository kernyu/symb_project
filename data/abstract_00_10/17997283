By the 1960s and 1970s, problems in the antibacterial treatment of infections had begun to emerge. Previously active antibacterials were being compromised by the development of resistance. Beta-lactamase production was identified in isolates of staphylococci, and, amongst others, in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The discovery of the potent beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, and its protective effect on amoxicillin, a semi-synthetic penicillin with good oral absorption and potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, was thus of great importance in the treatment of bacterial disease. Following preliminary clinical studies in bronchitis and urinary tract infections, amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy was investigated in a wide range of infections and proved to demonstrate a high level of clinical efficacy. These results supported the launch of amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) in 1981 for use in upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections and obstetric, gynaecological and intra-abdominal infections.
