H(2)O(2) is an unavoidable cytotoxic by-product of aerobic life. Dpr, a recently discovered member of the Dps protein family, provides a means for catalase-negative bacteria to tolerate H(2)O(2). Potentially, Dpr could bind free intracellular iron and thus inhibit the Fenton chemistry-catalyzed formation of toxic hydroxyl radicals (H(2)O(2) + Fe(2+) --> (.)OH + (-)OH + Fe(3+)). We explored the in vivo function of Dpr in the catalase- and NADH peroxidase-negative pig and human pathogen Streptococcus suis. We show that: (i) a Dpr allelic exchange knockout mutant was hypersensitive ( approximately 10(6)-fold) to H(2)O(2), (ii) Dpr incorporated iron in vivo, (iii) a putative ferroxidase center was present in Dpr, (iv) single amino acid substitutions D74A or E78A to the putative ferroxidase center abolished the in vivo iron incorporation, and (v) the H(2)O(2) hypersensitive phenotype was complemented by wild-type Dpr or by a membrane-permeating iron chelator, but not by the site-mutated forms of Dpr. These results demonstrate that the putative ferroxidase center of Dpr is functionally active in iron incorporation and that the H(2)O(2) resistance is mediated by Dpr in vivo by its iron binding activity.
