The diversity of Salmonella serotype Virchow organisms causing human salmonellosis in a Spanish region over 1990-1996 was studied by genetic and phenotypic procedures. Isolates showing identical DNA fingerprintings (ribotypes, RAPD-, REP- and ERIC-types) were clustered into the same lineage. Eight lineages were defined, of which only one caused diseases throughout the studied period. Eleven phage types (PTs) were represented, the most frequent being PTs 8, 19, 31, throughout the study period, and PT4a only during 1994. Class I integrons with variable regions of 1000-, 1600-, and 2300-bp in size were respectively present in 24, 3 and 5 multiresistant isolates; 43.5% of isolates were susceptible to antimicrobials, the rest were grouped into 17 R-profiles, including from one up to eight resistances. Plasmids could be recovered from 71.5% of isolates and grouped into 25 plasmid profiles (with 1-7 plasmids each); a 3.6 kb cryptic-plasmid and a 60 kb virulence-plasmid were those most frequently found. Phage type, presence and size of integrons, and resistance profile were used to differentiate 39 clones. During the period studied 135 cases of Virchow salmonellosis were identified; 93 were apparently sporadic whereas the remainder were associated with four outbreaks. Infants under 1 year constituted the most frequent age group, with 30 gastroenteritis and two septicaemia episodes. In the four outbreaks, different clones falling into the prevalent lineage were implicated but each clone was involved in only one outbreak.
