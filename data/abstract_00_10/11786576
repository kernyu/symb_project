PURPOSE: To evaluate prospectively the feasibility and efficacy of early intensive therapy, including intensified cytoreductive chemotherapy (CT) and high-dose CT (HDCT) followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT), in patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease (HD) who failed to respond completely or relapsed after initial treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 533 eligible patients with newly diagnosed stage IIIB-IV HD enrolled in the H89 trial, all 157 patients with induction failure (IF) (n = 67), partial response (PR) of less than 75% (n = 22), or relapse (n = 68) were included in this study. Planned salvage therapy included mitoguazone, ifosfamide, vinorelbine, and etoposide monthly for two to three cycles followed by high-dose carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan with ASCT. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 50 months, the 5-year survival estimates were 30%, 72%, and 76% for the IF, PR, and relapse groups, respectively (P =.0001), 71% for the 101 patients given HDCT, and 32% for the 48 patients treated without HDCT (P =.0001). Multivariate analysis using time-dependent Cox model indicated that B symptoms at progression, salvage without HDCT, and chemoresistant disease before HDCT were significantly associated with shorter overall survival. CONCLUSION: Early intensive therapy improves the outcomes of patients with advanced HD who failed to respond completely to initial treatment and those who relapsed with adverse prognostic factors. However, for patients with IF and chemoresistant disease, this approach remains unsatisfactory.
