Several representative amphiphilic cationic quinine-derived have been synthesized and evaluated against methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This is the first reported antibacterial activity of this class of compounds. In vitro the minimal inhibitory concentration values of the best compound Q7 ranged from 0.4 to 1.6 microg/mL (MBC<3.2 microg/mL).
