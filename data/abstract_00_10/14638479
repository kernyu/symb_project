Peritoneal dialysate fluid (PDF) is a bacteriostatic medium that compromises the antibacterial activity of cell wall-active agents. By use of an in vitro static model, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), and Streptococcus sanguis were exposed to daptomycin at concentrations of 10, 30, and 100 mg/liter, cefazolin at 125 mg/liter, and vancomycin at 25 mg/liter in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth or Todd Hewitt Broth (for S. sanguis) and PDF at pHs of 5.5 and 7.4. The pH had no effect on antibacterial activity. Neither cefazolin nor vancomycin produced a bactericidal or a bacteriostatic effect versus MRSA, MSSA, MSSE, or S. sanguis in PDF, while all concentrations of daptomycin were bactericidal against all organisms in PDF. Daptomycin did not exhibit concentration-dependent activity in PDF. Daptomycin appears to be a promising agent for use in peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, producing bacterial kill to a greater extent and at a higher rate than cefazolin or vancomycin in PDF.
