The practice of giving prophylactic antibiotics to patients at the time of urinary catheter insertion, change or removal is variable since guidelines for their use have yet to be established. The use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent urinary catheter-related infections and the possibility of bacteraemia and septicaemia, despite a lack of evidence for their efficacy, is a matter of concern in light of the reported overuse of, and increased resistance to, antibiotics. This article describes an audit of, and increased resistance to, antibiotics. This article describes an audit conducted in one trust to establish the current practice of antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary catheter procedures. The audit confirmed that in 60% of the recorded catheter procedures, patients were given antibiotics, usually gentamicin. Variations in gentamicin prophylaxis were revealed, including differences in the timing of administration relative to the catheter procedure. This audit revealed that intramuscular gentamicin was given simultaneously with the procedure or after the procedure in a number of cases, suggesting that on these occasions "prophylaxis" was suboptimal.
