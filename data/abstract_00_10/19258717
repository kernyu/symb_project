OBJECTIVE: Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) play a critical role in antiviral defense. To better understand pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha and ribavirin combination therapy resistance, we examined the STAT expression in the liver. METHODS: We immunostained Phospho-STAT1 (P-STAT1) and Phospho-STAT3 (P-STAT3) in 59 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected liver tissues and compared the expression of these STATs proteins and the clinicopathological factors. RESULTS: The number of P-STAT1 observed correlated significantly with the body mass index (BMI; p = 0.03) and homeostatic model assessment (p = 0.007). The number of P-STAT3 observed correlated significantly with the ALT level (p = 0.002) and platelet count (p = 0.002). The number of P-STAT1 nuclei in the sustained virological response (SVR) group was significantly larger than in the non-SVR group (p = 0.003). On multivariance analysis, the number of P-STAT1 nuclei (p = 0.004) and age (p = 0.016) were significant predictors of SVR. CONCLUSIONS: P-STAT1 in the liver tissue prior to IFN therapy correlated with an increased BMI and increased insulin resistance, and might be a useful predictor of HCV clearance by IFN therapy. On the other hand, P-STAT3 might play a critical role in the hepatocellular response against inflammatory damage.
