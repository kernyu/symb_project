Antimony resistance is frequently encountered during treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and the differences are well characterized by inadequate IFN-gamma dominant type-1 protection mechanisms. The part played by Leishmania parasites derived from antimony treated patients in the outcome of an immune response largely remains to be investigated. In the present study we observed that macrophages of BALB/c mice infected with antimony non-responder (SAG-NR) isolates had a greater amastigote burden than antimony responder (SAG-R) isolates. Later it was observed that antigen from SAG-NR and R L. donovani isolates elicit different cytokine responses in peritoneal blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with VL. The production of IFN-gamma by T-cells in VL patients increased in response to Leishmania derived from responder patients but this response within same T-cells was lower when sensitized from Leishmania from a non-responder VL patient. On the other hand, IL-4 and IL-10 expression was increased when primed with parasites from non-responder VL source. Such a differential pattern of cytokine expression by the same T-cell population produced to Leishmania from different donors, needs further exploration.
