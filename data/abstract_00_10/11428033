[figure: see text] Bogorol A (1), a novel peptide antibiotic active against MRSA and VRE, has been isolated from cultures of a marine Bacillus sp. collected in Papua New Guinea. The structure of bogorol A was elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic analyses and chemical degradation. Bogorol A illustrates a new structural template for "cationic peptide antibiotics".
