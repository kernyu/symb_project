Patient enrolment in the 'Non-antibiotic versus antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary-tract infections' (NAPRUTI) study was started in September 2005. In this study of women with recurrent urinary-tract infections we aim to investigate the effect of 12 months of non-antibiotic prophylaxis in comparison with antibiotic prophylaxis on the rate of recurrence of urinary-tract infections and the development of antibiotic resistance. The study consists of two interlinked, randomised, clinical non-inferiority trials. In one trial, 280 premenopausal women will receive either cranberry capsules (twice daily 500 mg) or standardised antibiotic therapy (once daily 480 mg trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). In the other trial, 280 postmenopausal women will receive either oral lactobacilli (twice daily a capsule with > 10(9) colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14) or standardised antibiotic therapy. Non-inferiority of non-antibiotic prophylaxis would be attractive given its potential to reduce the prevalence of microbial resistance to antibiotics significantly.
