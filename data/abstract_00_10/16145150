Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were obtained from 24 patients between March and May 2004 at the Centre Hospitalier de Polynesie Francaise, Tahiti, French Polynesia. The isolates were multidrug resistant, produced the carbapenemase OXA-23, and belonged to a single clone presenting several subtypes, suggesting an endemic situation. This study further illustrates the global spread of this kind of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
