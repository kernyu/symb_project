The paper presents an analysis of causes of relapse of gastric and duodenal peptic ulcers based on review of 2120 case records of patients from the Ukrainean-German gastroenterological centre over the period six months--two years. Chief causes of relapse of gastric and duodenal peptic ulcer are identified, such as incomplete course of eradication therapy; failure on the part of the patients to keep to the physician's orders, which fact suggests to us that there has not been achieved the necessary "compliance"; resistance to the therapy treatments administered, in the first place, to metronidazole (36%), development of gastroestrophagitis reflux.
