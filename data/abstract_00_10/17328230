The treatment of bacterial infections is increasingly complicated by the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents, as well as by the emergence of new pathogens with the potential for rapid global spread. Thus, there is a critical need for novel antibacterial agents and new strategies to advance the drug discovery process. In the post-genomic era, comparative genomics, functional genomics and proteomics will play important roles in identifying new enzyme targets for the discovery of novel antibacterial agents. This review will discuss bacterial enzyme targets, specifically focusing on enzymes involved in fatty acid and cell wall biosynthesis.
