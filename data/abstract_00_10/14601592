HIV-1 isolates from 200 untreated patients recruited in 2001 and 2002 in the south part of Vietnam and particularly in Ho Chi Minh City were sequenced in the RT, protease, and env genes. Out of 200 isolates 198 belonged to CRF01_AE while only one subtype B and one intersubtype (B-CRF01_AE) recombinant could be observed. Of the isolates 6.5% had major resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs.
