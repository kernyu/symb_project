This study determined the postantibiotic effect (PAE) of ABT-773 versus that of amoxicillin-clavulanate against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The PAEs of ABT-773 and amoxicillin-clavulanate ranged from 2.3 to 6.0 h and 0 to 2.2 h against S. pneumoniae and from 2.7 to 9.1 h and 0 to 0.8 h against H. influenzae, respectively.
