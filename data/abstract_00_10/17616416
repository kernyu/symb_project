Bacterial blood culture results of 292 privately owned cats presented to the Clinic for Small Animal Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich with signs of sepsis were evaluated retrospectively. Of the blood cultures, 23% were positive. In 88%, a single bacterial species was isolated. Of all bacterial isolates, 45% were Gram-positive, 43% were Gram-negative, and 12% were obligate anaerobes. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae, obligate anaerobic species, Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species. Of the cats with positive blood cultures, 32% were pretreated with antibiotics. Of all bacterial isolates, 77% were susceptible to enrofloxacin, 69% to chloramphenicol, 67% to gentamicin, and 64% to amoxycillin clavulanic acid. Only enrofloxacin reached an in vitro efficacy of more than 70% against Gram-positive and more than 74% against Gram-negative bacteria.
