An extremely infrequent episode of nasopharyngeal actinomycosis associated with squamous adenocarcinoma occurred in an HIV-infected male patient with a previous diagnosis of AIDS, treated with combined antiretroviral therapy taken with insufficient adherence, such that a satisfactory immune system recovery (as expressed by a CD4 lymphocyte count persistently above 400 cells/mcl), contrasted with a low-level persistence of detectable HIV viraemia, and enlarged genotypic resistance mutations. Interestingly, a number of local and specific risk factors for both infectious and neoplastic disorders were recognized by healthcare staff (tobacco smoke, long-term inhalatory substance abuse, in particular cocaine, and semi-professional mushroom-truffle hunting, including evaluation by systematic smelling). Despite appropriate and timely diagnostic assessment carried out with repeated, combined computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fiberoptic rhinoscopy with biopsy and histopathologic studies, the final diagnosis of a combined dual infectious-neoplastic pathology occurred only after a demolishing surgical intervention and subsequent pathology studies. Despite proper antimicrobial therapy, and an associated radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy schedule, rapid dissemination of multiple secondary lesions to the brain rapidly led to our patient's death. The imaging and histopathological diagnostics of the dual illnesses of our HIV-infected patient, and its therapeutic and outcome features, are presented and discussed on the basis of the evidence from the available literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first described case of actinomycosis associated with a local, underlying squamous cell adenocarcinoma of the same ear, nose, and throat district in either HIV-infected or HIV-non-infected subjects.
