Based on antibiotic prescribing data from 2003, dermatologists account annually for 8-9 million prescriptions for oral antibiotics, and 3-4 million prescriptions for topical antibiotics.

The following article discusses the perspectives of the authors related to the potential therapeutic benefits and ecologic implications ("ecologic mischief") of topical antibiotic therapy for specific indications encountered in ambulatory dermatology practice.
