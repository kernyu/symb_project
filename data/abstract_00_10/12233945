The use of both vancomycin and gentamicin in the treatment of suspected or documented neonatal infections, while routine, is a challenge for bedside and advanced practice nurses caring for neonates in intensive care units. A review of the background information surrounding neonatal infections as well as the history, intended use, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin and gentamicin is presented with the goal of aiding in proper treatment with these two medications. Specific attention is given to doses in special situations, means of drug monitoring, strategies for avoiding antibiotic resistance, alternative medication choices, and areas for future investigation.
