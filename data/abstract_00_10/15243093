Mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) have been associated with quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (QRNG). Since diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests for gonococci are now in frequent use, molecular detection of QRNG could facilitate surveillance in the absence of culture. Here we describe a real-time molecular assay for detecting QRDR mutations in gonococci.
