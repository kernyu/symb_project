The current success in treatment of surgical site infections may be jeopardized by the continued emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria common to these infections. The effectiveness of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci may decrease as more cases of VISA emerge. No currently available antimicrobial is consistently effective against certain strains of VRE and the potential emergence of VRSA. Orthopaedic surgeons soon may be in the undesirable position of having to eradicate organisms resistant to all available antibiotics. Several new antibiotics show promising activity and may be useful against these multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, as the history of bacterial resistance has taught us, it likely only will be a matter of time until these organisms adapt mechanisms of resistance to these new drugs. The key then lies, as it always has, in preventive measures. Surgeons, and all physicians, must adhere to the precautionary guidelines recently set forth by the CDC and HICPAC. Chief among these guidelines is the elimination of inappropriate antibiotic usage, especially inappropriate vancomycin use.
