We evaluated the efficacy of an ointment containing bacitracin, polymyxin B, and gramicidin for the eradication of colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 11 medical patients, 10 (91%) of whom had previously failed a 1-week course of topical mupirocin. Mupirocin resistance was documented in 5 (45%) of 11 patients. Successful decolonization was achieved in 9 (82%) of 11 patients (based on 2 months of follow-up).
