NO is produced by macrophages through activation of the inducible enzyme NOS and its production is triggered as an antiviral and antitumoral immune mechanism. Replication of Marek's disease herpes virus (MDV) is inhibited by NO in vitro. MDV induces T-lymphomas in the chicken and a genetic resistance to tumor development has been linked to the B21 major histocompatibility complex. During the first initial week of viral replication after inoculation of the highly virulent RB-1B MDV strain, histocompatible B21/B21 chickens developed strong iNOS expression and NO production capacity in the spleen, in parallel with strong systemic NO production in the serum. Comparable NO response was not seen with the vaccinal strain HVT. In contrast, reduction in spleen macrophage number and delay in iNOS gene expression was observed in genetically susceptible B13/B13 chickens after MDV infection, in addition to suppression of IFN-gamma-inducible NO production. However, vaccination with HVT 3 days before RB-1B inoculation restored strong iNOS gene expression in the spleen 1 week later and inducible NO production 3 weeks later. Following the pattern of iNOS gene expression, early strong expression of cytokines with powerful iNOS-inducing activity such as IFN-gamma and CC chemokines from the MIP family (MIP-1beta, K203) was observed in genetic resistance and resistance acquired after vaccination with HVT. In conclusion, resistance to MDV appeared preferentially linked in both types of resistance to the early establishment of cytokine induction characteristic of a Th1 immune response, thus favoring the development of an early and strong NO response.
