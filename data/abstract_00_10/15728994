Through generally curable, tuberculosis (TB) is becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB is a consequence of monotherapy, insufficient drug therapy and national TB control programs. The present study was designed to reveal the resistance to major antimicrobial drugs (isoniazid [INH], streptomycin [SM], ethambutol [EMB], and rifampicin [RIF]) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from the respiratory specimens of TB patients in Duzce, Turkey. A total of 62 TB patients (46 male, 16 female; age: 17 - 75 mean: 42 +/- 15.9) were included in the study; 52 (83.8%) were new cases and susceptible to all anti-TB drugs, while 10 (16.2%) were previously treated cases. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by the proportion method in Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Fifty-two of the 62 (83.8%) isolated M. tuberculosis strains were found to be susceptible to all drugs, and 7 (11.3%), 5 (8%), and 3 (4.8%) were resistant to SM, INH, and RIF, respectively; 3 (4.8%) were MDR. There were no EMB-resistant strains. The results of this study show the presence of drug-resistant and MDR strains of TB at Duzce in the northwest part of Turkey.
