The aim of the study was to assess the presence of the microbes in peritoneal fluid of women in reproductive age. An investigation was performed on the group of 144 women operated laparoscopically in Division of Reproduction. The bacteria were cultured from 77 fluids (53.5%). The most common bacteria were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (34.1%) and Propionibacterium acnes (19.3%). In our group of patients 88 strains of bacteria were isolated. Sensitivity to antibiotics differed in many points. This situation does not allow to prepare any universal scheme of antibiotic therapy. We stress the necessity of assessing the type of bacteria and antibiotic resistance before the treatment get started. It seems to be especially important in pelvic pain syndrome and in pelvic inflammatory disease when operative procedure is necessary for bacteria isolation.
