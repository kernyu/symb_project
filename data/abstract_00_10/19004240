The antibacterial activities of five antibiotics, three brands of Ofloxacins (Obenasin, Floxavid and Drovid) and two brands of Ciprofloxacins (Uroxin and Siprosan), and five commonly used disinfectants (Lysol, Dettol, Purit, Roberts and Wex-cide) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. were investigated. The growth inhibitory effect of both the antibiotics and disinfectants were determined using paper disk diffusion method and well-in-agar technique respectively. The highest mean zone of growth inhibition (19.3 mm) was given by Drovid on Streptococcus spp., while the smallest (7.0 mm) was by Floxavid on P. aeruginosa. Lysol had the highest mean zone of growth inhibition (18.0 mm) on Streptococcus spp. while P. aeruginosa and Bacillus spp. had no zone of growth inhibition with Roberts at 100-fold dilution. All the isolates were also resistant to Wex-cide. The test organisms were found to be significantly susceptible to the routinely used antimicrobials tested. However, there is the need for continuous surveillance for the detection of emerging resistance pattern.
