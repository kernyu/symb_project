Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in liver regeneration and resistance to acute injury. However its chronic activation participates in the progression of liver disease, including fibrogenesis and malignant transformation. Hepatobiliary disease represents a constant feature in the clinically relevant Fechm1pas/Fechm1pas genetic model of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). Similarly, chronic administration of griseofulvin to mice induces pathological changes similar to those found in patients with EPP-associated liver injury. We investigated the hepatic expression of the EGFR and its seven most relevant ligands in Fechm1pas/Fechm1pas mice bred in three different backgrounds, and in griseofulvin-induced protoporphyria. We observed that the expression of amphiregulin, betacellulin and epiregulin was significantly increased in young EPP mice when compared to aged-matched controls in all genetic backgrounds. The expression of these ligands was also tested in older (11 months) BALB/cJ EPP mice, and it was found to remain induced, while that of the EGFR was downregulated. Griseofulvin feeding also increased the expression of amphiregulin, betacellulin and epiregulin. Interestingly, protoporphyrin accumulation in cultured hepatic AML-12 cells readily elicited the expression of these three EGFR ligands. Our findings suggest that protoporphyrin could directly induce the hepatic expression of EGFR ligands, and that their chronic upregulation might participate in the pathogenesis of EPP-associated liver disease.
