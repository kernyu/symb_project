Salmonella enterica isolates (n = 182) were examined for mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE. The frequency, location, and type of GyrA substitution varied with the serovar. Mutations were found in parC that encoded Thr57-Ser, Thr66-Ile, and Ser80-Arg substitutions. Mutations in the gyrB quinolone resistance-determining region were located at codon Tyr420-Cys or Arg437-Leu. Novel mutations were also found in parE encoding Glu453-Gly, His461-Tyr, Ala498-Thr, Val512-Gly, and Ser518-Cys. Although it is counterintuitive, isolates with a mutation in both gyrA and parC were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin than were isolates with a mutation in gyrA alone.
