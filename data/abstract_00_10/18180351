In this study, we investigated the clonal emergence of daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from a patient with leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome. The resistance mechanism in these strains is independent of either equivalent point mutations previously described for Staphylococcus aureus or daptomycin inactivation mechanisms identified in soil bacteria.
