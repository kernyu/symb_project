A total of 853 isolates of Salmonella serotype Typhi recovered from patients with typhoid fever who were admitted to a major infectious disease hospital in Cairo, Egypt, from 1987 through 2000 underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing to determine multiple-drug resistance. The observed resurgence of chloramphenicol susceptibility (P=.002) may suggest reuse of this drug for the treatment of typhoid fever in Egypt.
