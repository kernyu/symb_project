Expression of eight transporter genes of Escherichia coli K-12 and its DeltaacrAB mutant prior to and after induction of both strains to tetracycline resistance and after reversal of induced resistance were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. All transporter genes were overexpressed after induced resistance with acrF being 80-fold more expressed in the DeltaacrAB tetracycline-induced strain.
