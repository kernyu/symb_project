The use of highly antiretroviral therapy (HAART) significantly reduced morbidity and mortality by inhibition of virus replication. Even though long-term side effects are not fully known, this antiviral strategy has revolutionized the care of HIV-infected patients and is widely used in industrial countries. Until now, a variety of metabolic side effects, such as hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, have been described. These metabolic alterations of antiretroviral therapy increase the cardiovascular risk profile of HIV-infected patients. It could be expected, that the increased cardiovascular risk profile in combination with long-term survival of this patient population, will increase the diagnostics and therapy of coronary diseases of HIVinfected patients in the next years. The present article (1) contains the case report of a 39-year-old HIV-infected male with an acute myocardial infarction, and (2) gives an overview about arteriosclerosis and coronary events in HIV-infected patients and the impact of antiretroviral therapy.
