Stable resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCIMB 10421 was obtained by step-wise exposure to gradually increasing concentrations of chlorhexidine diacetate (CHX). Repeated exposure to a proposed "residual" (sub-MIC) concentration of CHX also created stable resistance. Resistance was also developed by a single exposure to the "residual" concentration of CHX, but this was unstable. Similar experiments with Escherichia coli and CHX or cetylpyridinium chloride resulted in no significant increase in resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the CHX-resistant P. aeruginosa cultures showed no cross-resistance, although some of the cultures were resistant to benzalkonium chloride.
