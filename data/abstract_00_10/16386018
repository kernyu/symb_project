Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen, especially in immunocomprimised patients and those hospitalized in intensive care units. After the first isolation of A. baumannii strains from the bronchial aspirates of two patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital as a pure culture, screening studies were performed to define possible source(s). A. baumannii strains isolated from bronchial aspirates and blood cultures of the patients in ICU were collected as a possible part of the outbreak. A total of 23 screening samples collected from equipment (7), hands (4) and gloves (2) of the staff, and from ten different body regions of the patients in the ICU were cultured. Antimicrobial susceptibility test of the isolates was performed by the standardized disk-diffusion method. All isolates were subtyped by antibiogram, arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing methods. A total of 26 A. baumannii strains including eight clinical and 18 screening isolates were identified. All isolates were susceptible only to meropenem, tobramycin, and imipenem. There was at least a 96% resistance rate to the other antibiotics tested. Antibiogram typing showed that 24 of the 26 isolates were epidemiologically related, two were unique. AP-PCR yielded two types, one of which had 21 isolates, the other had five. PFGE fingerprinting revealed that all isolates were clonally related, including four closely related and 22 indistinguishable strains. Based on the results of PFGE which has been accepted as a reference method it can be concluded that A. baumannii strains isolated from our intensive care unit originated from a single type of strain.
