Antibiotic susceptibility test of Mycobacterium leprae still relies on the time consuming methods based on the growth of M. leprae in the mouse footpad. Thus, the establishment of a rapid, simple and reliable method for the detection of drug-resistant M. leprae is one of the most urgent subjects in the treatment of leprosy patients. Recently, many data on the mutation of specific genes correlating with drug resistance have been accumulated. Application of these data permit the establishment of new gene diagnostic methods for drug susceptibility test of leprosy. In this paper, the method using the low density oligonucleotide array that enables the detection of base substitutions involved in resistance against anti-leprosy drugs on a single platform was discussed. The low density oligonucleotide array described in this paper will open the new perspectives in terms of patient management for leprosy with low cost requirement.
