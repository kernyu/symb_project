A strain of Plasmodium falciparum from Peru was adapted to splenectomized Aotus nancymaae and Aotus vociferans monkeys. The Peru 134/CDC strain of P. falciparum was shown to be resistant to treatment with chloroquine in monkeys and partially resistant to mefloquine and malarone. Genetic mutations in crt, dhfr, dhps, and cytochrome b genes conferring drug resistance were also determined for this Peruvian strain of P. falciparum.
