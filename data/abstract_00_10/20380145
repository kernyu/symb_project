Introduction of a new antimicrobial agent as a drug--for treatment of infections or as a disinfectant and antiseptic, may result in the occurrence of resistance mechanisms against this agent among microorganisms. Two disinfectants of different composition--Incidin Plus for surface disinfection and Sekusept Plus for medical devices disinfection, both containing glucoprotamin as the active substance, were investigated in this study in order to analyze their antimicrobial activity. Standard bacterial and fungal strains recommended by European Standards, established by European Standardization Committee for testing bactericidal and fungicidal activity of chemical disinfectants were used in the study. Furthermore, 60 clinical bacterial strains with different susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics, mostly multiresistant, isolated from different specimens from hospitalized patients were analyzed. In addition, 184 fungal clinical strains isolated from hospitalized patients and outpatients were also included in this study. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated according to EN 1040:2005 --using bacterial strains and according to EN 1275:2005--using fungal strains. Glucoprotamin proved to be a very effective and rapidly acting bactericidal and fungicidal agent. Low concentration of glucoprotamin--0.5% showed to be very effective (1 min) against clinical bacterial isolates. Incidin Plus was also very effective (5 min) against clinical fungal isolates.
