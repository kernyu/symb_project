Respiratory tract infections remain among the most common clinical problems worldwide. Pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs can be caused by infection with bacteria, viruses, and other organisms. Pneumonia management has been challenged by the widespread distribution of antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the commonest cause of community acquired pneumonia. Experimental models of pneumonia have played a crucial role for testing the efficacy of antimicrobial agents as well as for gaining a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis. These models have also received increased attention as tools for deriving pharmacodynamic data and for determining the clinical significance of drug resistance.
