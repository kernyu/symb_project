BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tumor patients have an increased risk of nosocomial infection due to hypoimmunity. Infection may affect antitumor therapies and even lead to death. This study aimed to investigate the susceptible factors, the distribution and drug resistance of the pathogens from tumor patients who suffered from nosocomial infection. METHODS: Clinical records of 952 infected patients in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University during 2006-2007 were reviewed. The infection rate, pathogen spectum and drug resistance of nosocomial infection were analyzed with EXCEL8.0 and SPSS10.0 software. RESULTS: Among the 952 patients, pathogens were detected in 794 patients, with a rate of 83.4%. Of the 794 patients, 321 (40.4%) had gram-negative bacilli (GNB) infection (mainly caused by Escherichia coli), 265 (33.4%) had fungi infection (mainly caused by Candida albicans), and 208 (26.2%) had gram-positive cocci (GPC) infection (mainly caused by staphylococcus and streptococcus species). According to drug sensitivity and resistance test, GNB were sensitive to imipenem and amikacin, but strongly resistant to ampicillin with a rate of >90%; GPC were sensitive to vancomycin, but highly resistant against ampicillin; the fungi were sensitive to amphotericin B, voriconazole and flucytosine, but less sensitive to fluconazol. CONCLUSIONS: GNB comprises the majority of pathogens separated from the hospitalized tumor patients in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University from 2006 to 2007. Rational use of antibiotics based on drug sensitivity test could reduce fungi infection and drug resistance, therefore, help to prevent and control nosocomial infection effectively.
