The ability of bacteria to procure, sometimes rearrange, and evince acquired DNA continues to impress us-even more so if this genetic plasticity involves the sequestering of antibiotic resistance genes. The acquisition of genes in bacteria is often facilitated by transposons, integrons and archetype insertion elements. Recently however, a new element, 'orf513', has been increasingly associated with class 1 integrons. Moreover, these 'complex' class 1 integrons can potentially mediate resistance to chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and tetracycline and may carry a range of beta-lactamase genes as well as the qnrA gene. Elements such as 'orf513' demonstrate IS91-like characteristics and will mobilize adjacent DNA via a process called rolling circle replication, and thus we have renamed them 'insertion sequence CRs' (ISCRs) to appropriately reflect their structure-function properties. In this article, we provide a brief description of these new and clinically important mobile elements, and how they are able to mobilize antibiotic resistance genes.
