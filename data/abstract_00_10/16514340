PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In contrast to patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia or mechanically ventilated patients at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia is a relatively new clinical entity that includes a spectrum of adult patients who have close association with acute care hospitals or reside in chronic care settings that increase their risk for pneumonia caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Multi-drug-resistant pathogens include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter species. New guidelines for the management and prevention of hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America were published in 2005 and are highlighted in this article. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent data indicate that types of multi-drug-resistant pathogens may vary in different healthcare settings, and that individuals infected with multi-drug-resistant pathogens are more likely to receive inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, which may result in poorer outcomes in terms of patient morbidity, mortality and increased length of hospital stay. SUMMARY: This review highlights key points in the new recommendations and principles for initiating, de-escalating and stopping antibiotic therapy in individuals with healthcare-associated pneumonia. Widespread implementation of these guidelines is needed in healthcare institutions in order to reduce patient morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.
