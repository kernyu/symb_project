The characteristic feature of HCV infection is the presence of both humoral and cellular immune response. In spite of the immune activation the host is unable to eradicate the virus. Spontaneous resolution of chronic infection is exceedingly rare--it is estimated at 0.6% per year. The currently available combination therapies with alpha interferon and ribavirin are effective in limited groups of patients. Factors involved in the mechanism(s) whereby HCV establishes and maintains its persistence are not well understood. The high genetic variability of HCV allows the virus to passively evade the immune system. Data obtained from experiments with cell culture expressing HCV proteins suggest that viral persistency is a multifactorial mechanism. Several viral genes impair cellular functions involved in immune responses.
