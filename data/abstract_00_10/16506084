Data are presented on antimicrobial resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptoco-ccus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis collected in Japan during years 1-3 (1999-2002) of the Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin (PROTEKT) surveillance study. In addition to the standard panel of PROTEKT antimicrobial agents, eight other agents often used in Japan also were tested against these isolates. The majority (30%-55%) of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae isolates were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, whereas most (>70%) S. pyogenes isolates came from patients with tonsillitis/pharyngitis. Penicillin and macrolide resistance were high among isolates of S. pneumoniae, averaging 30.9%-44.5% and 77.2%-79.9%, respectively, across all centers over the 3 study years; the highest occurrences were reported among pediatric patients aged 0-2 years. The erm(B) genotype accounted for >50% of all erythromycin-resistant isolates each study year. S. pyogenes isolates were highly susceptible to most antimicrobial agents except the macrolides and tetracycline. beta-Lactamase production among H. influenzae isolates range was 8.5%-9.7% per annum. A total of 9 beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant isolates were collected during the study. Almost all (>95%) M. catarrhalis isolates were beta-lactamase positive each year. Telithromycin was highly active against all pathogens examined in this study during all 3 years.
