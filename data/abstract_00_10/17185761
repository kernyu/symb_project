Resistance to oxazolidinone antibiotics, including linezolid, in Gram-positive bacteria is mediated by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 23S ribosomal RNA. A G2576U change (encoded by a G2576T mutation in the rRNA genes) is found in most resistant clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci; a variety of changes have been found in resistant mutants selected in vitro. Pyrosequencing can be used to detect SNPs known to confer oxazolidinone resistance, including the G2576T change. Most bacteria have more than one rRNA gene copy and Pyrosequencing can also be used for allele quantification, i.e., to estimate the proportions of mutant vs wild-type alleles. The number of mutated rRNA gene copies correlates roughly with the level of oxazolidinone resistance displayed by resistant isolates. This chapter summarizes the Pyrosequencing assays that have been developed in our laboratory for analyzing oxazolidinone-resistant enterococci and staphylococci.
