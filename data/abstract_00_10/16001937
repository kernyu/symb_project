OBJECTIVES: Estimate the incidence and epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Tuberculosis (TB), analyzing the influence of factors such as: HIV infection, immigration, chronic diseases and styles of life. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients who have diagnosed of active TB (microbiological results positive) and latent tuberculosis (Mantoux positive) during the year 2001 in the Gregorio Maranon Hospital. The variables include epidemiological, microbiological, clinical and therapeutic features. RESULTS: We registered 78 patients with TB at hospital, with estimated incidence in health area of 11, 14 cases per 100,000 habitants. The mean age of were 41.98 years; with 43.6% HIV infected patients and 9% immigrants. The sputum was the sample most used for the microbiological diagnosis, we detected resistance in 30% of samples analyzed. The HIV infected patients had more frequent TB from reactivation (p=0,016). The primary site of disease was pulmonary (78%). One pulmonary infiltrate was more frequent in the thoracic X-ray. The 56% of our HIV infected patients had normal thoracic X-ray (p <0,05). The treatment more common was with four drugs and the 75% of our patients fulfilled the treatment; the HIV infected patients leaves the treatment more frequent. The global mortality was 9%. CONCLUSIONS: Actually, in Madrid, the persons with HIV infection, injection drug abuse, immigration and elders in residential home were higher risk of infection for TB. For strict control of disease is need early diagnosis and supervision of treatment .
