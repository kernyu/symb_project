Viral genomic analysis has been developed recently, and is utilized in clinical practice. The genotype of HB virus has the most important clinical implication, and in Japan, genotype C shows worse prognosis than genotype B. Basic core promoter (BCP) mutation is associated with hepatic fibrosis, and HBe antigen seronegativity is frequently observed after lamivudine administration than wild type. Polymerase domain B mutation was shown to be associated with lamivudine resistance concomitantly with domain C mutation. In the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b infection, peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy was introduced, and this combination therapy has been shown to induce 50% sustained virological response (SVR). To predict the virological response to combination therapy, monitoring viral decline provides the most important information. Real-time PCR is expensive, therefore, highly sensitive core antigen quantitation is valuable in clinical practice. When patients treated by combination therapy achieve a 2 log drop in HCV antigen until twelve weeks, they are estimated to have obtained 75% SVR by monitoring the amount of serum core antigen.
