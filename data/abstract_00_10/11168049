OBJECTIVE: To collect and analyze data on susceptibility of methicillin-resistant staphylococci to evernimicin and other antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Recent clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci from 33 laboratories in North America, Europe and South Africa were investigated. RESULTS: Of the antimicrobial agents tested, evernimicin had the lowest MIC90s for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.75 and 1.0 mg/L, respectively). Resistance to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin was widespread, with higher levels of resistance in North America than in other regions. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility surveys help to determine the antimicrobial activity of new agents. Ciprofloxacin- and erythromycin-resistant staphylococci were prevalent throughout all regions.
