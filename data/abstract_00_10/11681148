BACKGROUND: There is a resurgence of pulmonary tuberculosis worldwide, due to increase in air travel, decrease in resources in health control, as well as the AIDS pandemic. As pulmonary tuberculosis was not common in Australia, family physicians are facing a new challenge. The following is to highlight some principles in tuberculosis treatment. OBJECTIVE: This article revisits some of the basic principles of treatment of tuberculosis in order to maximise management. DISCUSSION: The tubercle bacillus has been capable of developing resistance to antituberculosis drugs for some time, making multiple drug therapy mandatory. Antituberculosis drugs on the other hand can be toxic and commonly cause gastro-intestinal upset. The patient has to take many tablets a day for many months. By informing patients of the side effects, compliance, which is the key issue to successful therapy, is enhanced.
