The in vitro activity and cross-resistance pattern of the purine analogues cladribine and fludarabine and the pyrimidine analogue cytarabine on leukemic cells from 170 patients with AML was evaluated using a bioluminescence assay. In in vivo mimicking concentrations, cladribine (50 nmol/L) and fludarabine (2 micromol/L) were more cytotoxic than cytarabine (0.5 micromol/L). The cytotoxic effect of fludarabine correlated weakly to cytarabine (r = 0.37, P < 0.001). The cytotoxic effect of cladribine correlated better to cytarabine (r = 0.49, P = 0.0002) but best to fludarabine (r = 0.82, P < 0.001). There was an absence of correlation between either cladribine or fludarabine and daunorubicin (0.2 micromol/L). Of 45 highly Ara-C-resistant samples, cladribine exerted high or intermediate effect in 54% and fludarabine in 52%. These in vitro data indicate that cladribine and fludarabine are active drugs in the treatment of AML. The cross resistance to cytarabine was not complete, and the drugs can be valuable either as alternatives to Ara-C or in combination therapy for treatment of leukemia resistant to standard therapy.
