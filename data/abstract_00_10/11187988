At the recent years considerably increased the role of Enterobacter spp as causes of nosocomial sepsis in different intensive units. It is determined of their possibilities to change quick antibiotic resistance especially to third generation cephalosporins and wide insemination of the environment. During the period from 29.10.1997 to 30.12.1997 in Neonatal intensive care unit--Pleven have been registered 9 cases of nosocomial sepsis caused by Enterobacter aerogenes. The clinic picture run with shock, temperature instability, hyperbilirubinemia, mottling respiratory insufficiency, I/T ratio > 0.2. Thrombocytopenia. Detection of the pathogen organisms present wide antibiotics resistance to cephalosporins. The microbiological control of the environment have been isolated Enterobacter spp from neonatal intensive unit, delivery room, unit for healthy newborn. The persistence of Enterobacter infections is a result of low supply of household linen, detergents, single-used products and widely used of cephalosporins, insufficient staff and overpopulation with patients.
