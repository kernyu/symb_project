Twenty six years have passed since the first cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were recognized in the U.S. Since that time, over 25 million people have died worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1.1 million individuals in the U.S. are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with or without AIDS. With the advent of effective antiretroviral treatment strategies, HIV infection has now become a chronic disease requiring lifelong therapy. Despite the advances made in treatment, drug resistance, long-term adverse effects, and high adherence requirements continue to represent challenges to patients and clinicians. This overview will provide a summary of current antiretroviral drugs, treatment strategies, and novel therapeutic agents presently in development.
