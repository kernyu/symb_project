OBJECTIVE: To analyze the strains of bacteria in burn infection and their resistance to antibiotics in our burn unit in the recent years. METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from specimens from the wounds, venous lines, blood, urine and feces of the hospitalized burn patients from January 2003 to December 2005 to analyze the vicissitude of bacteria and their drug resistance. RESULTS: The number of Gram-negative bacteria (372 strains) was larger than Gram-positive ones (292 strains). Staphylococcus aureus (accounting for 16.7%) was predominant among Gram-positive bacteria, among which methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 82.5%. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 12.5%, and Escherichia coli accounted for 11.1%. The drug resistant ESPL-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 60.8% and 42.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance to antibiotics is a serious problem in a burn unit, calling for monitoring the vicissitude of bacteria strains and antibiotics sensitivity in order to control bacterial infection and dissemination.
