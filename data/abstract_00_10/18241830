PURPOSE: To report a series of patients in whom infectious scleritis developed after vitreoretinal surgery. DESIGN: Interventional case series of four patients. METHODS: Medical records of patients at a single institution in whom infectious scleritis developed after vitreoretinal surgery were reviewed. RESULTS: In three patients, infectious scleritis developed after 20-gauge pars plana vitrectomy, and in one patient, infectious scleritis developed after a scleral buckling procedure. Three cases were had positive culture results; the identified organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two cases and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in one. The fourth patient did not have culture results but responded rapidly to empiric treatment with moxifloxacin. In one patient, surgically induced necrotizing scleritis subsequently developed. CONCLUSIONS: Although infectious scleritis is an uncommon complication after vitreoretinal surgery, it should be a considered cause in patients with persistent postoperative pain and inflammation.
