The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics of tuberculous peritonitis (TP) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients. In a retrospective review of the medical records of a single tertiary hospital between 1988 and 2006, 15 patients met the diagnostic criteria TP and liver cirrhosis. For comparison, we randomly selected 3 cirrhotic patients with SBP caused by Escherichia coli for each cirrhotic patient with TP. Compared to SBP, TP in cirrhotic patients was more frequently associated with extra-peritoneal tuberculosis (TP vs SBP: 53.3% vs 0%), an insidious onset (> or =2 weeks; 60% vs 2.2%), and Child-Pugh classification class B at onset (80% vs 8.9%) (p<0.05). Compared to SBP, TP was associated with lower white blood cell count in ascites (TP vs SBP: 2.0+/-2.2 x 10(3)/mm(3) vs 7.2+/-7.5 x 10(3)/mm(3)), a higher proportion of mononuclear leukocytes (lymphocytes and monocytes) in ascites (88.9+/-9.5% vs 16.6+/-15.3%), higher protein concentration in ascites (3.1+/-1.7 g/dl vs 1.2+/-0.3 g/dl), and higher adenosine deaminase activity in ascites (62.3+/-31.8 U/l vs 6.9+/-3.1 U/l) (p<0.05). TP should be suspected in cirrhotic patients with relevant clinical manifestations and characteristics of ascites.
