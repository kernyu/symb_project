The effect of tannic acid (TA), gallic acid (GA), propyl gallate (PA) and ellagic acid (EA) on DNA damage in human lymphocytes induced by food mutagens [3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido (4,3-b) indole (Trp-P-2) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimadazo (4,5-b) pyridine (PhIP) or H2O2 was evaluated by using single-cell electrophoresis (comet assay). The toxicity of these tested compounds (0.1-100 microg/ml) on lymphocytes was not found. These compounds did not cause DNA strand breaks at lower concentrations of 0.1-10 microg/ml. At a concentration of 100 microg/ml, TA and GA exhibited slight DNA damage, whereas PA and EA showed no DNA strand breaks. TA and its related compounds decreased the DNA strand breaks induced by Trp-P-2, PhIP or H2O2 at concentrations of 0.1-10 microg/ml. DNA repair enzymes endonuclease III (Endo III) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycoslase (FPG)] were used to examine the levels of oxidised pyrimidines and purines in human lymphocytes induced by H2O2. All the compounds at 10 microg/ml can reduce the level of FPG sensitive sites. However, only EA inhibited the formation of EndoIII sensitive sites. The results indicated that these compounds can enhance lymphocytes resistance towards DNA strand breaks induced by food mutagens or H2O2 in vitro.
