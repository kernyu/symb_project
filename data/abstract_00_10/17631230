Older adults receive care from various settings, including acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, group homes, outpatient primary care, specialty clinics, and home. In these various settings, older adults are exposed to pathogens, which makes them "vectors" that transport pathogens from one setting to another and makes them vulnerable to care fragmentation. These health care settings face unique challenges that require individualized infection control programs. Infection control programs should address: surveillance for infections and antimicrobial resistance, outbreak investigation and a control plan for epidemics, isolation precautions, hand hygiene, staff education, and employee and resident health programs.
