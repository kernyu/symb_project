During reverse transcription, the positive-strand HIV-1 RNA genome is converted into a double-stranded DNA copy which can be permanently integrated into the host cell genome. Recent analyses show that HIV-1 reverse transcription is a highly regulated process. The initiation reaction can be distinguished from a subsequent elongation reaction carried out by a reverse transcription complex composed of (at least) heterodimeric reverse transcriptase, cellular tRNA(lys3) and HIV-1 genomic RNA sequences. In addition, viral factors including Tat, Nef, Vif, Vpr, IN and NCp7, cellular proteins, and TAR RNA and other RNA stem-loop structures appear to influence this complex and contribute to the efficiency of the initiation reaction. As viral resistance to many antiretroviral compounds is a continuing problem, understanding the ways in which these factors influence the reverse transcription complex will likely lead to novel antiretroviral strategies.
