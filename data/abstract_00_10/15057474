Ten Escherichia coli strains isolated from five different aquatic environments representing three distinct geographical regions of India showed significantly high levels of tolerance to the inorganic form of mercury, i.e., mercuric chloride (HgCl(2)). MRD14 isolated from the Dal Lake (Kashmir) could tolerate the highest concentration of HgCl(2), i.e., 55 microg/mL, and MRF1 from the flood water of the Yamuna River (Delhi) tolerated the lowest concentration, i.e., 25 microg/mL. All ten strains revealed the presence of a plasmid of approximately 24 kb, and transformation of the isolated plasmids into the mercury-sensitive competent cells of E. coli DH5alpha rendered the transformants resistant to the same concentration of mercury as the wild-type strains. Mating experiments were performed to assess the self-transmissible nature of these promiscuous plasmids. The transfer of mercury resistance from these wild-type strains to the mercury-sensitive, naladixic acid-resistant E. coli K12 (F(-) lac(+)) strain used as a recipient was observed in six of the nine strains tested. Transconjugants revealed the presence of a plasmid of approximately 24 kb. An evaluation of the mechanism of mercury resistance in the three most efficient strains (MRG12, MRD11, and MRD14) encountered in our study was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy (CV-AAS), and it was noted that resistance to HgCl(2) was conferred by conversion of the toxic ionic form of mercury (Hg(++)) to the nontoxic elemental form (Hg(0)) in all three strains. MRD14 volatilized mercury most efficiently.
