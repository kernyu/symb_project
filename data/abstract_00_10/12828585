BACKGROUND: This is a retrospective study on the efficacy and safety of arbekacin (ABK), an aminoglycoside antibiotic, for acquired staphylococcal infection in the neonatal intensive care nursery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 29 infants treated with ABK in a tertiary care neonatal center. They were 23-39 (median 28) weeks' gestation, 530-3334 (median 930) grams at birth, and 3-157 (median 17) days of age. Diagnosis of staphylococcal infection was made by clinical signs and laboratory findings. Sensitivity of the isolated organisms to ABK was tested by the microliquid dilution method. Serum ABK level was monitored to achieve the therapeutic range during the treatment. Effectiveness was defined by improving clinical signs and laboratory findings within 3 days. Effectiveness was studied in relation to type of infection and other antibiotics administered. Auditory brainstem response and serum creatinine changes were studied for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity assessment, respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (93.1%) cases of infection were attributed to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and two (6.9%) were attributed to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The rate of in vitro sensitivity to ABK was 85.2% for MRSA and 100.0% for CNS. The overall clinical effeciveness rate was 79.3% (23/29) with no difference associated with types of infection. Combination of ABK with sulbactam/ampicillin showed greater effectiveness (100.0%) than with other antibiotics (64.3%) (P < 0.05). There was no abnormal auditory brainstem response or serum creatinine change associated with ABK treatment. CONCLUSION: ABK is an effective and safe antibiotic for the treatment of acquired staphylococcal infection in the neonatal intensive care nursery.
