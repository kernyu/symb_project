Emerging trends in invasive candidiasis are notable for a dramatic increase in infections due to non-albicans Candida species. An increasing number of immunocompromised patients at risk from fungal infections, an overall greater acuity of illness in the hospitalized patients, particularly those in the critical care units, escalating rates of broad-spectrum antibiotic usage, and wide utilization of azoles as prophylaxis have probably contributed towards the changing epidemiology of invasive candidiasis. Given the inherent decreased susceptibility of many of the non-albicans Candida species to currently available antifungal agents, these evolving trends have far-reaching clinical relevance.
