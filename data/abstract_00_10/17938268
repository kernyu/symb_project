The bacterial cytosine deaminase (CD) gene, associated with the 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) prodrug, is one of the most widely used suicide systems in gene therapy. Introduction of the CD gene within a tumor induces, after 5FC treatment of the animal, a local production of 5-fluorouracil resulting in intratumor chemotherapy. Destruction of the gene-modified tumor is then followed by the triggering of an antitumor immune reaction resulting in the regression of distant wild-type metastasis. The global effects of 5FC on colorectal adenocarcinoma cells expressing the CD gene were analyzed using the proteomic method. Application of 5FC induced apoptosis and 19 proteins showed a significant change in 5FC-treated cells compared with control cells. The up-regulated and down-regulated proteins include cytoskeletal proteins, chaperones, and proteins involved in protein synthesis, the antioxidative network, and detoxification. Most of these proteins are involved in resistance to anticancer drugs and resistance to apoptosis. In addition, we show that the heat shock protein Hsp90beta is phosphorylated on serine 254 upon 5FC treatment. Our results suggest that activation of Hsp90beta by phosphorylation might contribute to tumor regression and tumor immunogenicity. Our findings bring new insights into the mechanism of the anticancer effects induced by CD/5FC treatment.
