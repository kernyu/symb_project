Helicobacter pylori are found attached to mucous cells of the human stomach or under the mucous layer. Models mimicking the in vivo situation may be more suitable for H. pylori MIC determinations than traditional agar dilution methods. Megraud et al. (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 1991, 35, 869-72) developed a model for measuring the susceptibility of attached and free-floating H. pylori. We have modified this model so that free-floating and attached H. pylori are treated in a more similar manner, before and after incubation with antibiotic, and performed additional controls to ensure H. pylori and tissue culture cells are not detrimentally affected and maintain their viability during the course of the experiment. We found only 10% of plate-grown H. pylori were competent for attachment to HEp-2 cells; however, all progeny of attached bacteria remained adherent. Killing curves were performed using 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/L amoxycillin, and 0, 0.0025, 0.0075 and 0.01 mg/L clarithromycin. H. pylori divided at concentrations <or= 0.01 mg/L amoxycillin and <or= 0.0025 mg/L clarithromycin. Contrary to the previous study, using our modified method we found that HEp-2 adherent and freefloating H. pylori are equally susceptible to amoxycillin (strains 26695, CCUG18943, CCUG19104 and CCUG19110) and clarithromycin (strain 26695). Therefore, we find no evidence that attachment of H. pylori to eukaryotic cells increases their resistance to antibiotics compared with non-attached bacteria. Nonetheless, these results confirm confidence in traditional MIC studies when a comparison is made between susceptible and resistant strains.
