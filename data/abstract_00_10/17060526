Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a risk factor for fatal pneumococcal infection. Nonsusceptibilty to quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D) was absent from 105 non-SCD-associated pneumococcal isolates but was present in 33/148 (22%) SCD-associated isolates. One-third of the isolates harbored a known resistance mechanism. Q-D is not optimal for use for the treatment of pneumococcal infection in SCD patients.
