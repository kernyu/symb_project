Drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is present in Vietnam. We assessed the in vivo sensitivity of P. falciparum to halofantrine in two villages in the southern part of central Vietnam. Halofantrine (8 mg/kg x 3 doses) was administered to 37 patients with either P. falciparum (n = 32) or mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax malaria (n = 5). End points were parasite sensitivity or resistance (RI/RII/RIII) determined by parasite clearance, persistence, or recurrence during 28 days of follow-up. By day 28, 31 (93.9%) of 33 (95% confidence interval = 79.8-99.2%) patients were sensitive. Two patients had recurrent P. falciparum parasitemia on days 14 and 21. Halofantrine effectively treated uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in these Vietnamese patients.
