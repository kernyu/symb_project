Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors (PIs) are important components of many highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens. However, development of phenotypic and/or genotypic resistance can occur, including cross-resistance to other PIs. Development of resistance takes place because trough levels of free drug are inadequate to suppress preexisting resistant mutant variants and/or to inhibit de novo-generated resistant mutant variants. There is thus a need for new PIs, which are more potent against mutant variants of HIV and show higher levels of free drug at the trough. We have optimized a series of substituted sulfonamides and evaluated the inhibitors against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV type 1 (HIV-1), including viruses with mutations in the protease gene. In addition, serum protein binding was determined to estimate total drug requirements for 90% suppression of virus replication (plasma IC(90)). Two compounds resulting from our studies, designated DPC 681 and DPC 684, are potent and selective inhibitors of HIV protease with IC(90)s for wild-type HIV-1 of 4 to 40 nM. DPC 681 and DPC 684 showed no loss in potency toward recombinant mutant HIVs with the D30N mutation and a fivefold or smaller loss in potency toward mutant variants with three to five amino acid substitutions. A panel of chimeric viruses constructed from clinical samples from patients who failed PI-containing regimens and containing 5 to 11 mutations, including positions 10, 32, 46, 47, 50, 54, 63, 71, 82, 84, and 90 had mean IC(50) values of <20 nM for DPC 681 and DPC 681, respectively. In contrast, marketed PIs had mean IC(50) values ranging from 200 nM (amprenavir) to >900 nM (nelfinavir).
