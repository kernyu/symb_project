Three patients with central nervous system aspergillosis due to azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus (associated with a leucine substitution for histidine at codon 98 [L98H] and a 34-base pair repeat in tandem in the promoter region) are described. The patients were treated with combination therapy or with polyenes, but all patients died. Azole resistance significantly complicates the management of aspergillosis by delaying the initiation of adequate therapy and because effective alternative antifungal drugs are lacking.
