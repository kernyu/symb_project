We demonstrate using an in vitro pharmacodynamic model that the likelihood of selection of Escherichia coli mutants resistant to a fluoroquinolone was increased when the initial size of the bacterial population, exposed to fluoroquinolone concentrations within the mutant selection window, was increased.
