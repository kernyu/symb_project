In the last decade, two main strategies have been employed in the prevention of catheter-related infections: the creation of anti-adhesive biomaterials using physicochemical methods, and the incorporation of antimicrobial or antiseptic agents into current polymer biomaterials. There has been limited success with the first approach. Intravascular catheters and cuffs with an antimicrobial coating have been developed in recent years. Nevertheless, preventive strategies should avoid the use of therapeutic antibiotics. Exposure to antimicrobial agents could favor the development of resistance or the expression of genes responsible for biofilm formation. The use of these catheters should be restricted to situations where the rate of infection is high despite adherence to other strategies that do not incorporate antimicrobial agents. Better knowledge of the pathogenesis of catheter-related infections will facilitate the design of new devices that avoid the use of antimicrobial agents and decrease the risk of associated bloodstream infections. This could include the use of 'biospecific polymers' coated with anti-adhesive molecules or the use of agents which might block the expression of genes controlling biofilm formation for the most prevalent pathogens.
