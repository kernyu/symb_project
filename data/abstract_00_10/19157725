Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen in domestic ruminants. The main objective of this study was to determine the similarity of epidemiologically unrelated S. aureus isolates from bovine, ovine, and caprine hosts regardless the locus of isolation (nares and udder). By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, seven major pulsotypes were identified among 153 isolates recovered from 12 different regions of France as well as from Brazil, the USA and Belgium. Typing of the accessory gene regulator (agr) and capsular (cap) serotype was carried out on all the isolates and revealed the predominance of agr I and III and of cap8 regardless the ruminant host species. Screening for methicilin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was carried out by disk diffusion and revealed a prevalence of only 3.2% of MRSA among the strains tested. These results suggest the existence of a host rather than tissue specificity among S. aureus isolates colonising the ruminant species and suggest a limited transmission of those isolates between large (bovine) and small (ovine-caprine) ruminants. The agr class and cap types correlated with pulsotype clusters rather than with a specific host species. Antimicrobial resistance appears not to have contributed to the predominance of any given genotypes, and MRSA prevalence appears very low in ruminant isolates.
