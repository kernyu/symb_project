Sodium Antimony Gluconate (SAG) is currently used worldwide as the first-line drugs for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) since 1940s. Unfortunately, the resistance of Leishmania parasite to this drug is increasing in several parts of the world. The mechanism of drug resistance in clinical isolates is still not very clear. Earlier, we have established a differentiation between six clinical isolates as sensitive and resistant on the basis of their sensitivity to SAG in vitro and in vivo as well as expression of proteophosphoglycan contents. In this preliminary study, we have further analyzed these isolates on the basis of their genetic diversity, molecular variance and phylogenetic structure using for the first time, a fingerprinting approach--amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Altogether 2338 informative AFLP bands were generated using 10 selective primer combinations. Percentage of polymorphism was 55.35%. A number of unique AFLP markers (217) were also identified in these strains. It was deduced that a higher rate of variations occurred among Leishmania clinical isolates which indicate the shifting of drug sensitive nature of parasite towards resistant condition.
