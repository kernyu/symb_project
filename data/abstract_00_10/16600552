OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to assess the prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in France. METHOD: Two hundred fifty-four strains identified in 1,079 nasal samples from voluntary individuals were analyzed in 2002. An antibiogram (especially measuring the inhibition diameter of cefoxitine) and screening by oxacillin (6 mug/ml) allowed the identification of strains resistant to betalactams. The resistant phenotype was confirmed by amplification of the mecA gene by PCR. The distribution of strains was compared to the resistance to various antibiotics and especially to cotrimoxazole, macrolides, aminosides, and the mechanisms of resistance were determined. RESULTS: Eleven methicillin-resistant strains were detected in 254 carriers (4.33%), or 1% of the total population studied. CONCLUSION: Complementary tests (detection of the Panton-Valentine toxin, pulsed field electrophoresis) will be necessary to finish strain characterization. It can already be stated that compared to previous studies, community-acquired MRSA carriage is weak in France.
