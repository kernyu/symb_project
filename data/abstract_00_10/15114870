Based on the ability to attach to polymeric surfaces, the formation of biofilms was determined in 5 wild-type strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus warneri). Using modified Christensen method, minimum regrowth concentration (MRC) of piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoperazon, ceftazidim, cefepim, meronem, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and amikacin for Gram-negative and of ampicillin-sulbactam, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, clindamycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin for Gram-positive bacteria was estimated in trypticase-soy broth medium after a 1-d growth on polystyrene microtiter plates. Adherent bacterial populations exhibited reduced antimicrobial susceptibility, which was not shown in submerged cultures. Our results indicate that MRC can predict therapeutic outcome of antibiotic treatment better than the minimum inhibitory concentration tests commonly used.
