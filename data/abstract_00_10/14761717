We report a retrospective review of all cases of Staphylococcus lugdunensis bacteremia identified during a period of more than 10 years (January 1990 to May 2002) in a large medical center. Twenty-one cases occurred over that period; 20 cases were available for review. In six instances, the organism appeared to be clinically significant and was most commonly related to a vascular line infection. No deaths, secondary suppurative complications, prolonged bacteremia, or prolonged fever appeared to be caused by S. lugdunensis in our experience. Twenty-five percent of our isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, including oxacillin.
