Helicobacter pylori, one of the most commonly encountered human pathogens, has been recognized in more than half of adults and children with chronic nonspecific gastritis, and nearly all children with peptic ulcer disease demonstrate antral infection with H. pylori. A high prevalence and early colonization of H. pylori infection in childhood was described in developing countries in contrast to developed countries. The current diagnostic methods include histology, microbiological culture, urease activity detection, polymerase chain reaction, and stool antigen detection. The infection often presents with nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain but may remain asymptomatic. The treatment modality options are multiple; however, the association of a proton-pump inhibitor and two antibiotics for 1 or 2 weeks gives the best eradication rates. Drug resistance is a growing problem in this microorganism and new therapeutic options are currently limited.
