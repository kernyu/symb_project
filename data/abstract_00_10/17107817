MgMfs1, a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) gene from the wheat pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola, was identified in expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries. The encoded protein has high homology to members of the drug:H(+) antiporter efflux family of MFS transporters with 14 predicted transmembrane spanners (DHA14), implicated in mycotoxin secretion and multidrug resistance. Heterologous expression of MgMfs1 in a hypersensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain resulted in a strong decrease in sensitivity of this organism to a broad range of unrelated synthetic and natural toxic compounds. The sensitivity of MgMfs1 disruption mutants of M. graminicola to most of these compounds was similar when compared to the wild-type but the sensitivity to strobilurin fungicides and the mycotoxin cercosporin was increased. Virulence of the disruption mutants on wheat seedlings was not affected. The results indicate that MgMfs1 is a true multidrug transporter that can function as a determinant of pathogen sensitivity and resistance to fungal toxins and fungicides.
