AIM: To evaluate the effect of combination treatment with the interferon (IFN) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) on several fibrotic indices in patients with refractory chronic hepatitis C (CHC). METHODS: Perindopril (an ACE-I; 4 mg/d) and/or natural IFN (3 MU/L; 3 times a week) were administered for 12 mo to refractory CHC patients, and several indices of serum fibrosis markers were analyzed. RESULTS: ACE-I decreased the serum fibrosis markers, whereas single treatment with IFN did not exert these inhibitory effects. However, IFN significantly augmented the effects of ACE-I, and the combination treatment exerted the most potent inhibitory effects. The serum levels of alanine transaminase and HCV-RNA were not significantly different between the groups, whereas the plasma level of transforming growth factor-beta was significantly attenuated almost in parallel with suppression of the serum fibrosis markers. CONCLUSION: The combination therapy of an ACE-I and IFN may have a diverse effect on disease progression in patients with CHC refractory to IFN therapy through its anti-fibrotic effect.
