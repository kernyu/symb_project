Previously considered solely as the laboratory contaminants and normal flora of skin in man, coagulase negative Staphylococci are now a major cause of nosocomial and opportunistic infections. This study was conducted at IGIMS, Patna to find out the coagulase negative Staphylococcus isolates from urine and their antimicrobial resistance. In a period of ten months, the relative frequency of main coagulase negative Staphylococci were as follows--Staphylococcus epidermidis-45.90%, Staphylococcus saprophyticus 34% and Staphylococcus haemolyticus-8.50%. others were 11.60%. most of the Staphylococcus saprophyticus was isolated from young female patients suffering from uncomplicated acute cystitis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was mainly from patients with indwelling catheters and complicated cases. Staphylococcus saprophyticus showed the highest sensitivities to all the antimicrobials whereas Staphylococcus haemolyticus had the highest resistance rates. 66.6% of staphylococcus epidermidis and 60% of staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to oxacillin, whereas only 10% of staphylococcus saprophyticus resistant and 90% were sensitive to it. As is in the emerging state, vancomycin resistance was very less but in future it may cause a major problem to treat these cases. So this area needs further exploration.
