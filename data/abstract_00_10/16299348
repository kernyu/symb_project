Laz, a lipid-modified azurin of the human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, is involved in defense against oxidative stress and copper toxicity; laz mutant strains are hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide and copper. The N. gonorrhoeae laz mutant also has decreased survival in an ex vivo primary human ectocervical epithelial assay.
