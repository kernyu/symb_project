Fifty three strains of C. difficile recovered from the stools of 13 patients with clinical C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) were analyzed for the presence of the ermB gene, for toxigenicity and fingerprinting profile by PCR based assays. Forty five percent of the isolates were resistant to clindamycin and positive for the ermB gene. All clindamycin resistant isolates were ermB positive and belonged to the same fingerprinting group, suggesting clonal spread. These preliminary results suggest that clindamycin resistant isolates may be common etiologic agents of CDAD in Sweden.
