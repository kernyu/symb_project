Cellular senescence may be an antioncogenic event. Bcl-2 is a product of the oncogene, bcl-2, but it may also participate in cellular senescence. To investigate the role of Bcl-2, we analyzed the level of Bcl-2 during aging of normal human fibroblasts by immunoblot analysis and found that its level was highly suppressed in four normal senescent fibroblast strains. This result suggests that senescent cells are more sensitive to induction of death than young cells. Nevertheless, senescent cells showed more resistance to death induced by hydrogen peroxide than young cells, according to LDH assay. Because the balance among antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins is an important factor for the determination of cell death, we examined levels of other Bcl-2 family and apoptosis-regulating proteins, but observed no reasonable change to explain the resistance. During the course of the death induction experiment, we obtained results showing that growth-arrested cells were also resistant to death, and this was further confirmed by a BrdU-labeling experiment. As senescent cells are stopped permanently in the G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle, our data strongly suggest that this is the cause of resistance to death in senescent cells.
