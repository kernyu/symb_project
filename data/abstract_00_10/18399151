OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genotype of blaADC which was a kind of AmpC produced by Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), isolated through the detection of 28 similar strains among children. METHODS: 28 strains of AB were collected and isolated from the Pediatrics clinic during 2006, and were identified through bacteria and susceptibility test using Vitex-32 automicroscan GNI and GNS cards. The genotype of blaADC was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and them sequenced. RESULTS: 3 of the 28 strains of AB showed multi-drugs resistance, with a positive rate of 10.71%. blaADC was discovered in 17 of the 28 strains and the positive rate was 60.71%. All the 28 strains of AB were resistant to Cefoxitin. blaADC positive strains were all sensitive to Ampicil/Sulbactam, and only one of them was resistant to Piperacillin/Tazobactan. There were no blaADC genes discovered in the strains that were resistant to Ampicil/Sulbactam or Piperacillin/Tazobactan. There were changes of amino acids on the site 4, 242, 342 and 376 in the sequence of blaADC of No.2 strain, comparing to gi /7258342/ emb /CAB77444. 1/ in GenBank. CONCLUSION: Above 60% of the AB isolated in children were carrying blaADC while a strain was collected from them at random. When they were undertaken nucleotide sequence analysis, significant difference was found from the others that landed in GenBank, which identified itself as new subtype.
