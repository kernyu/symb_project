Darunavir is a nonpeptidic protease inhibitor recently approved for the treatment of antiretroviral therapy-experienced patients. It has potent in vitro activity against viral isolates that are resistant to currently licensed protease inhibitors. In randomized clinical trials with optimized background regimens, it has shown virologic and immunologic responses superior to comparator-based regimens.
