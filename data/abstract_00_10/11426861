During the period between 1987 and 1997, various surveillances of the antibiotic resistance of B. fragilis group isolates revealed that practically all the isolates tested were susceptible to imipenem, metronidazole and chloramphenicol; very few isolates (2.5%) exhibited resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. However, similarly as in some southern European countries, the percentages of the isolates that were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and clindamycin were high throughout this period, and the resistance to cefoxitin increased from 6% to 16%. In 2000, isolates with intermediate or high resistance to imipenem and isolates with increased MICs to metronidazole were emerging among the clinical isolates of B. fragilis. The presence of the cfiA gene was demonstrated by PCR in 7 of 242 isolates (2.9%); 2 of them with high MICs to carbapenems harboured the IS942 element immediately upstream of the resistance genes. In the 2 B. fragilis isolates with increased MICs to metronidazole, the nim gene could be detected by PCR. The IS1186 element was found in these isolates upregulating the metronidazole resistance gene.
