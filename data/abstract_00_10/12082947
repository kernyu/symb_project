The use of fluconazole against yeast infections eradicates susceptible but promotes naturally resistant candida strains as C glabrata and C krusei. C albicans dominated in blood cultures taken at the Karolinska Hospital during the years 1989-2001. There was no trend towards an increase of Candida non-albicans. Restrictive use of fluconazole may explain why the balance between different Candida species with varying susceptibility to fluconazole has not shifted.
