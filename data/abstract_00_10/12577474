The activities of lipid peroxidation and the antioxidative defence systems, the content of nitric oxide metabolites, an erythrocyte resistance to peroxide hemolysis in rats exposed to ethanol and hypoxic training were studied. We also evaluated the detoxicant capacity of the liver by 4-aminoantipyrine clearance. It was established that an effect of ethanol was accompanied by the disturbances in the oxygen-dependent metabolic reactions if the liver in different organs and systems. The results have confirmed the expediency of using the hypoxic training in the complex treatment of the chronic alcohol intoxication.
