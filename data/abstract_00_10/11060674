The therapeutic use of oral cephalosporins to treat infectious diseases continues to challenge clinicians; many attempts have been made over recent years to improve the efficacy and spectrum of these anti-infectives. Many oral cephalosporins are in development and include cefdinir, cefprozil, cefetamet pivoxil, cefcapene pivoxil, cefcanel daloxate hydrochloride in Phase II trials, S-1090 in Phase III trials and the novel compounds E1100, E1101 and BRL-57347. Differences between these drugs are sometimes subtle and the improvement over existing compounds modest, although recent cephalosporins have shown greater activity against Gram-negative bacterial infections. A better knowledge of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interrelationships of existing oral cephalosporins is demanded for a more rational use of these compounds and to avoid the subsequent development of resistance. Perhaps with such an approach, the perceived need for new cephalosporins will diminish.
