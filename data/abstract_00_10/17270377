Post-surgical meningitis and/or ventriculitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria may be difficult to treat due to the emergence of multiresistant strains. Two patients with multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii central nervous system infection, successfully treated with either intravenous and/or intraventricular colistin are presented. Unresolved issues such as dose and duration of intraventricular colistin are discussed.
