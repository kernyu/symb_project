Serratia marcescens is a frequent nosocomial isolate and is associated with a variety of clinical sources, including blood, urine and sputum, and can cause significant infection. Infections can be difficult to treat due to its resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents. An investigation of a population of 30 clinical strains revealed the presence of a class 2 integron among nine of the isolates, which represents the first isolation of this integron in Serratia species. This integron contained the gene cassettes dfrA1, sat1 and aadA1, conferring resistance to trimethoprim, streptothricin and streptomycin/ spectinomycin, respectively. One of these isolates also carried a class 1 integron identified by sequence analysis as containing the open reading frames aacC1 (encoding gentamicin resistance), ORFX, ORFY and aadA1. Polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the presence of the qac epsilon delta1 and sul1 markers, which are common among class 1 integrons.
