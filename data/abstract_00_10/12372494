A series of N-alkylated and aminomethylated derivatives of chloroorienticin B, a vancomycin-related glycopeptide antibiotic, were synthesized. Doubly-modified derivatives having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic substituents exhibited potent antibacterial activity against MRSA and VRE along with considerable water-solubility.
