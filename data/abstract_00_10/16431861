OBJECTIVES: Prevalence of single quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR) mutations in Streptococcus pneumoniae was studied from nine institutions over 5 years to track the incidence of single QRDR mutations. METHODS: All 1106 levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci (MICs < or = 2.0 mg/L) identified from 1112 total isolates (99.5% susceptibility) in TRUST 3 (1999), TRUST 5 (2001) and TRUST 7 (2003) surveillance studies from the same nine hospitals in nine states were screened for QRDR mutations. Using pyrosequencing, the strains were screened for mutations corresponding to hot spots Asp-78, Ser-79 and Asp-83 in ParC; Asp-80, Ser-81 and Glu-85 in GyrA; Asp-435 in ParE and Asp-435 in GyrB. DNA sequencing of QRDRs was performed to confirm mutations. RESULTS: No QRDR mutations were found in any of the isolates with levofloxacin MICs < or = 0.5 mg/L and no gyrA or gyrB QRDR mutations were found in any of the screened isolates (MICs < or = 2 mg/L). Four single-step QRDR mutants with the following amino acid substitutions were found: ParE Asp-435 to Asn (isolated in 1999 in Colorado); ParC Asp-83 to Asn (isolated in 2001 in Kentucky); ParC Ser-79 to Phe (isolated in 2003 in Indiana) and ParC Ser-79 to Tyr (isolated in 2003 in California). These non-clonal strains had levofloxacin MICs of 1 mg/L and were non-susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC 2-4 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Overall prevalence of single QRDR mutations in levofloxacin-susceptible S. pneumoniae with MICs of < or = 2 mg/L was 0.4% (4/1106) and has remained <1% within nine institutions over 5 years (1999-2003).
