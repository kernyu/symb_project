OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reversal effect of multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by glutathione (GSH) detoxifcation system in K562/A02 cell line by neferine and erythromycin. METHODS: Cellular GSH concentration was examined by biochemical analyses with DTNB. RESULTS: Cellular GSH concentration in K562/A02 cell line [(137.34 +/- 33.10) mg/mgprot] was higher than that in K562 cell line [(73.38+/-10.02) mg/mgprot] (P < 0.05), and 1.87-fold greater in K562/A02 cell line compared with that in K562 cell line. Cellular GSH concentration in K562/A02 cell line treated with Nef10 mg/L, EM100 mg/L, Nef10 mg/L + EM100 mg/L, and VRP5 mg/L for 2 days [(69.01 +/- 15.99) mg/mgprot, (70.57 +/- 11.93) mg/mgprot, (65.74 +/- 13.37) mg/mgprot, and (70.86 +/- 16.16) mg/mgprot, respectively] decreased than that in K562/A02 cell line without drugs (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Increase of cellular GSH concentration was one of the MDR mechanisms in K562/A02 cell line. Decrease of cellular GSH concentration may be one of the MDR reversal mechanisms in K562/A02 cell line by neferine and erythromycin.
