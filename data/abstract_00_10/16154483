BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for 5 to 6 million medical consultations in the United States each year. Worldwide, an estimated 20% to 30% of women aged 20 to 40 years have at least 1 episode of the most common type of UTI (uncomplicated cystitis) in their lifetime, with Escherichia coli being the causative pathogen in 80% of cases. Antibacterial activity in urine has been shown to be correlated with outcomes of uncomplicated cystitis. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to determine urinary concentrations and ex vivo bactericidal activity of sustained-release (SR) amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2000/125 mg against intermediately resistant and resistant strains of E coli over 72 hours and compare them with those of a susceptible strain. This study also investigated whether urinary concentrations obtained after dosing cover E coli strains categorized as intermediately resistant and resistant based on current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly NCCLS) breakpoints in uncomplicated cystitis. METHODS: This Phase I, open-label, noncomparative study in healthy male volunteers was conducted at the Pharmacology Unit, Autonoma University, Madrid, Spain. Subjects received a single oral dose of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2000/125 mg SR. The amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MICs were 8/4 microg/mL (susceptible), 16/8 microg/mL (intermediately resistant), and 32/16 and 64/32 microg/mL (resistant). Urine samples were collected before (baseline; time 0) and at the following intervals: 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-16, 16-24, 24-36, 36-48, 48-60, and 60-72 hours after dosing. Killing curves with urine samples were performed with initial inocula of approximately 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and bactericidal activity (defined as >3 log(10) CFU/mL and >99.9% reduction in bacterial counts) was calculated as the difference between log(10) initial inoculum and log(10) CFU/mL after 4 hours of incubation of each sample. RESULTS: Twelve volunteers were included (mean [SD] age, 24.83 [5.64] years; mean [SD] height, 175.75 [7.56] cm; and mean [SD] weight, 73.55 [9.19] kg). No statistically significant differences between the activities in the 12-16-hour interval compared with baseline were found in any of the strains tested. Bactericidal activity against the susceptible and intermediately resistant strains (MICs 8/4 and 16/8 g/mL, respectively) was obtained up to 8 hours after dosing. Bactericidal activity against the resistant strains (MICs 32/16 and 64/32 microg/mL) was obtained in the 2-4-hour interval. CONCLUSIONS: In this Phase I study in healthy volunteers, urinary concentrations after dosing with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2000/125 mg SR showed bactericidal activity against the amoxicillin-susceptible and intermediately resistant strains of E coli.
