The authors report 2 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. One case consisted in occult bacteremia due to a 19A serotype in a child who had received 3 doses and a booster dose of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar). The 2nd case was pneumococcal meningitis due to a 10A serotype. The incidence of nonvaccine serotypes is increasing, notably the 19A serotype. They must be closely monitored because of the high antimicrobial resistance of certain strains.
