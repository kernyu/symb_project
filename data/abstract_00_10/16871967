The aim of this study was to evaluate a frequency of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from clinical specimens obtained from patients hospitalized in different hospital wards (SP ZOZ) in Nidzica from 01. 09. 2000 to 31. 12. 2003. During over three years 716 Staphylococcus aureus strains were cultured out of 15517 clinical specimens supplied to the Bacteriological Laboratory of SP ZOZ in Nidzica. S. aureus strains were isolated from 4.6% of examined samples. Samples were collected from patients hospitalized in all wards (five wards). Analysis of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of identified S. aureus strains was performed. Seventy strains (9.8%) were metihicillin-resistant (MRSA). One hundred twenty four strains (17.3%) revealed inducible resistance to macrolides, linkosamides and streptogramins B (MLS, mechanism). The greatest activity in vitro against clinical S. aureus strains showed glycopeptide antibiotic--vancomycin (100% of susceptible strains). Clinical S. aureus strains isolated from patients of hospital in Nidzica are in the majority susceptible to antibiotics/chemotherapeutics, except of penicillin. Percentage of methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) is not high (<10). Nevertheless, constant monitoring of a drug susceptibility of nosocomial S. aureus strains is important, considering the necessity of control of current epidemiological and therapeutic situation.
