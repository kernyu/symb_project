OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in antibiotic sensitivity of Gram negative bacilli infections among emergency patients in large hospitals in Beijing during 2005 to 2007. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all the identified strains of Gram negative bacilli, and their sensitivity to antibiotic obtained in the emergency departments of 5 top first-class hospitals in Beijing for recent 3 years. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred and eighty-five strains of Gram negative bacilli had taken 64.62% of all, the priority 5 of which were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.89%), Escherichia coli (19.91%), Acinetobacter baumanii (17.59%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.05%) and Staphylococcus maltophilia (3.94%). The sensitivity of commonly used antibiotics plummeted greatly in recent 3 years, especially carbapenems, cephalosporins and quinolones. The resistance of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 17.30%, 22.53%, 31.92% respectively. The resistance of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii was 13.87%, 12.09%, 23.56% respectively. CONCLUSION: Infectious bacteria in emergency departments in Beijing top first-class hospitals tend to show the characteristics of hospital infection. In recent years, the sensitivity of bacilli to antibiotic has dropped greatly. The situation of antibiotics resistance might be depressed.
