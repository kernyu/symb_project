Over the past decade, antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a major public-health crisis. Common bacterial pathogens in the community such as Streptococcus pneumoniae have become progressively more resistant to traditional antibiotics. Salmonella strains are beginning to show resistance to crucial fluoroquinolone drugs. Community outbreaks caused by a resistant form of Staphylococcus aureus, known as community-associated meticillin (formerly methicillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, have caused serious morbidity and even deaths in previously healthy children and adults. To decrease the spread of such antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the community, a greater understanding of their means of emergence and survival is needed.
