The in vitro activity of posaconazole against Candida species isolated from blood cultures and the influence of incubation time was studied and compared with that of fluconazole. A total of 112 isolates were studied: 32 Candida albicans, 33 C. parapsilosis, 17 C. tropicalis, 8 C. glabrata, 8 C. guilliermondii, 3 C. famata, 2 C. lusitaniae, 1 C. lipolytica, 1 C. inconspicua, 1 C. lambica, 3 Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 1 Blastoschizomyces capitatus, 1 Geotricum spp. and 1 Pichia omheri. The MIC was obtained using the M27-A microdilution method described by the NCCLS for Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans. The species most susceptible to posaconazole were C. parapsilosis (MCI90 0.016 mg/l), C. guilliermondii (MIC90 0.12 mg/l), C. glabrata (MCI90 0.5 mg/l) and Candida spp. (MCI90 0.25 mg/l). However, this azole did not improve the activity of fluconazole against C. tropicalis (MIC90 8 mg/l) and C. albicans (MCI90 mg/l). The time of reading was important in the detection of resistance, as the number of strains resistant to fluconazole or posaconazole was higher at 48 hours than at 24 hours for C. albicans and C. tropicalis. All the other species of Candida were susceptible at both reading times.
