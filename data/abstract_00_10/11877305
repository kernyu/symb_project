Campath-1H (alemtuzumab) is the most effective monoclonal antibody in single-agent use in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with reported response rates of 33% to 70%. Combination therapy is now the conventional treatment for most hematologic malignancies. Monoclonal antibody treatments may sensitize tumor cells to subsequent chemotherapy. We report the combination of Campath-1H with fludarabine in patients with CLL refractory to each agent used singly. Six patients who had received a median of 8 courses of fludarabine (range, 4-10 courses) and 16 weeks of Campath-1H (range, 8-32 weeks) were treated. Five patients responded, including one who had a complete response by National Cancer Institute criteria. The responses observed were better in each patient than responses after each agent used singly. Complete morphologic bone marrow responses were seen in 3 patients, including eradication of disease measured by sensitive flow cytometry in 2. Campath-1H combined with fludarabine is a highly promising novel therapy for refractory CLL.
