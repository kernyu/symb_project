PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of ferrule preparation length on the fracture resistance after simulated surgical crown lengthening and after forced tooth eruption of endodontically-treated teeth restored with a carbon fiber-reinforced post-and-core system. METHODS: 40 extracted endodontically-treated mandibular first premolars were decoronated 1.0 mm coronal to the buccal cemento-enamel junction. The teeth were divided randomly into five equal groups. The control group had no ferrule preparation (Group A). Simulated crown lengthening provided ferrule preparations of 1.0 mm (Group B) and 2.0 mm (Group C). Simulated forced tooth eruption provided ferrule preparations of 1.0 mm (Group D) and 2.0 mm (Group E). After restoration with a carbon fiber post-and-core system, each root was embedded in an acrylic resin block from 2.0 mm apical to the margins of a cast Ni-Cr alloy crown, and loaded at 150 degrees from the long axis in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/minute until fracture. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey HSD tests, and Fisher's exact test, with alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: Mean failure loads (kN) for Groups A, B, C, D and E were: 1.13 (SD = 0.15), 1.27 (0.18), 1.02 (0.11), 1.63 (0.14) and 1.92 (0.19), respectively. Significant differences were shown for the effects of treatment method and ferrule length, with significant interaction between these two sources of variation (P < 0.0001). Increased apical ferrule preparation lengths resulted in significantly increased fracture resistance for simulated forced tooth eruption (P < 0.0001), but not for simulated crown lengthening (P > or = 0.24).
