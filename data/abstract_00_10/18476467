Cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus R9/80 resistant to gramicidin S and actinomycin D were investigated. The strain was isolated after passages of a previously isolated strain of S. aureus with resistance to gramicidin and definite changes in the cell walls, a medium with increasing concentrations of actinomycin being used for the passages. The data on the study of the cell walls of the strain with the double resistance were compared with the results of the investigation of the cell walls of the strain susceptible to gramicidin, the gramicidin resistant strain (initial for strain R9/80) and the actinomycin adapted strain that also showed changes in the cell walls. The cell walls of the resistant strains had no significant changes in the peptidoglycane and glucosamine levels, as well as in the peptidoglycane amino acid composition. Teichoic acids of all the strains had different levels of substitution of ribite by D-alanine (a factor influencing the negative charge of teichoic acids and the wall at large). It was noted that all the strains resistant to the tested antibiotics had lower levels of teichoic acids in the cell walls. The resistant cells showed some increase of the lipid component in the walls: from 1.6% in the susceptible strain to 2.1-2.9% in the resistant cells. The main trend of the changes in the resistance development was revealed to be the thickening of the cell wall and its consolidation. The development of resistance to gramicidin, actinomycin and to both the antibiotics provoked respectively a 2.4-, 4- and 5.4-fold increase of the content of the main cell component. i.e. peptidoglycane in the cell biomass. The barrier role of the cell walls in the resistant strains and their ability to bind the antibiotic is discussed.
