Rapid, accurate and inexpensive methods are essential to detect drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and allow timely application of effective treatment and precautions to prevent transmission. The proportion method, the MTT and Alamar Blue redox methods, and the D29 mycobacteriophage assay, were compared for their ability to detect resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin. When tested against a panel of known M. tuberculosis strains, the redox methods and the D29 assay showed good sensitivity and specificity compared to the proportion method, suggesting that they could be useful alternatives for identifying multidrug resistance in M. tuberculosis.
