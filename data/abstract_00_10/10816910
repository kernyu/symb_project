Anthelmintic-resistant gastrointestinal nematodes represent the major problem in controlling of parasites of small ruminants in central Europe. This article gives a brief update on the prevalence of resistant populations in sheep and goat farms in Europe. New data on the selection and spread of anthelmintic resistance are reported and recommendations are given for minimising further increases in the incidence of resistant populations. New strategies which may play a role in integrated control programs in the future, e.g. vaccination and the development of nematode-resistant breeds of animals or of nematophagous fungi are briefly discussed.
