Different inanimate samples collected from surgery wards and general operation theatre (GOT) as well as animate samples from surgery personnel were subjected to aerobic culture with the aim of identifying source of infections in surgical cases. The pattern of aerobic bacteria with antibiotic susceptibility isolated from those samples were reported in the present study. Out of 91 such samples, 53 and 26 were from different locations in general wards and OT respectively and 12 were comprising of hand swabs, throat swabs and nasal swabs from surgery personnel. Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 34 samples having Pseudomonas spp. (18/34) in the top of the list followed by Esch. coli (14). Among the Esch.coli isolates resistance to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and doxycycline were 78.7%, 71.4% and 57.1% respectively, whereas sensitivity to aztreonam, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were 100%, 85.8%, 78.7% and 71.4% respectively. Ceftriaxone yielded intermediate sensitive results in 21.4% strains. Isolates of Pseudomonas spp. also showed very high sensitive results to aztreonam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone (94.7%, 94.7% and 84.2% respectively). Ciprofloxacin and gentamicin were sensitive in 68.4% and 57.9% respectively. Susceptibility pattern showed well correlation with clinical response in infected cases.
