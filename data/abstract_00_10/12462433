We describe a patient with early post-surgical infective endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, who was unsuitable for surgical reintervention and who failed standard antistaphylococcal therapy, but was successfully cured with a sequential regimen including quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid.
