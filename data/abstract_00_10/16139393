The reaction of ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, [NH4{S2CN(CH2)4}], with SnCl2, [Sn(C6H5)2Cl2], [Sn(C6H5)3Cl], [Sn(C4H9)2Cl2] and [Sn(C6H11)3Cl] produced in good yield the compounds [Sn{S2CN(CH2)4}2Cl2] (1), [Sn{S2CN(CH2)4}2Ph2] (2), [Sn{S2CN(CH2)4}Ph3] (3), [Sn{S2CN(CH2)4}2 n-Bu2] (4) and [Sn{S2CN(CH2)4}Cy3] (5). The complexes were characterised by infrared, multinuclear NMR (1H, 13C{1H} and 119Sn{1H}) and 119Sn Mossbauer spectroscopies. In addition, the crystal structure of 4 was determined by X-ray crystallography. The in vitro antifungal activity of the tin(IV) complexes as well of the ligand was performed on human pathogenic fungi, Candida albicans, in concentrations of 0.025; 0.050; 0.100; 0.200; 0.400; 0.800; 1.600 and 3.200 mM. The microorganism presented resistance to the dithiocarbamate ligand and all tin(IV) complexes tested were actives. The highest activity was found for compounds 1 and 4.
