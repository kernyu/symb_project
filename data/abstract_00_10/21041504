Eight rifampin-resistant streptococci of the mitis group were identified at the species level by using a concatenated 16S rRNA gene-sodA-rpoB-hlpA sequence. Characterization of their rpoB alleles showed single amino acid changes involved in rifampin resistance. Comparison of RpoB sequences from pneumococcal recombinant isolates, viridans isolates, and type strains revealed a species-specific amino acid signature, which allowed it to be ascertained that recombinant RpoBs were originated in genetic interchanges with Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis.
