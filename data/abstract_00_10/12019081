The in vitro activities of ravuconazole and voriconazole were compared with those of amphotericin B, flucytosine (5FC), itraconazole, and fluconazole against 6,970 isolates of Candida spp. obtained from over 200 medical centers worldwide. Both ravuconazole and voriconazole were very active against all Candida spp. (MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited [MIC(90)], 0.25 microg/ml; 98% of MICs were < or 1 microg/ml); however, a decrease in the activities of both of these agents was noted among isolates that were susceptible-dose dependent (fluconazole MIC, 16 to 32 microg/ml) and resistant (MIC, > or = 64 microg/ml) to fluconazole. Candida albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC(90) of both ravuconazole and voriconazole, 0.03 microg/ml), and C. glabrata was the least susceptible species (MIC(90), 1 to 2 microg/ml). Ravuconazole and voriconazole were each more active in vitro than amphotericin B, 5FC, itraconazole, and fluconazole against all Candida spp. and were the only agents with good in vitro activity against C. krusei. These results provide further evidence for the spectrum and potency of ravuconazole and voriconazole against a large and geographically diverse collection of Candida spp.
