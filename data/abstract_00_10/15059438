OBJECTIVE: To analyze the use of antibiotics and the drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the burn ward of our hospital in the past 11 years, so as to optimize the use of antibiotics in the future. METHODS: Bacterial epidemiology during 1991-2001 in our burn ward was investigated. The change of the drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed by defined daily dose (DDD) of antibiotics in adult patients and by the ranking of antibiotic administration days. RESULTS: (1) Staphylococcus aureus (10.53%-34.40%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (75.66%-11.47%) were dominant in our burn ward. (2) Predominant antibiotics used included Penicillin, Amikacin, Vancomycin, Imipenem and Ceftazidime. (3) There was increasing drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to the following antibiotics ranking in following order: Piperacillin (41.57%-100.00%), Imipenem (36.36%-98.46%), Ceftazidime (23.46%-97.85%), Amikacin (13.16%-100.00%) and ciprofloxacin (6.90%-100.00%). CONCLUSION: There was increasing drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to all antibiotics, which might be related to antibiotic abuse.
