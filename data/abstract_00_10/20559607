The human and material costs of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy are high. This study was designed to search for a rapid, simple and effective antimicrobial susceptibility test capable of identifying the best treatment strategy against microorganisms causing hospital infections showing resistance or reduced susceptibility to the more traditional antibiotics. The tests compared were the E-test, an automated test (Wider) and broth microdilution ( as the reference test), to determine the susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and daptomycin of clinical isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin resistant coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococccus spp. The E-test and Wider methods showed good agreement with the reference method indicating their reliability for routine susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci against vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and daptomycin. Notwithstanding, when faced with a serious enterococcal infection, the MIC of daptomycin should be more accurately determined using a reference technique such as broth microdilution.
