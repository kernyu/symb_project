The purpose of our study was to assess the prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides among the isolates responsible for bloodstream infections and to describe the epidemiology of these isolates. CoNS isolates from bloodstream infections were collected and characterized by analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and restriction fragment length polymorphism using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The medical records of patients with positive cultures and trends in glycopeptide use were reviewed to determine the effect of previous antibiotic treatment on the susceptibility profile of these organisms. The crude incidence of CoNS bacteraemia was 0.51 per 1000 days of hospitalization. The 15 (28.8%) strains identified as having decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin by the reference method were all hospital-acquired and displayed 13 different DNA patterns. The relative risk of harbouring strains with decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin was 3.55 among patients previously treated with vancomycin (confidence interval 95%: 2.15-5.85). The teicoplanin consumption in our institution was constant and represented about 27% of the glycopeptide consumption in daily defined doses. The implementation of programmes aiming to reduce the unnecessary use of glycopeptides should have a significant impact on the reduced-susceptibility rate because strains probably become resistant as a result of antibiotic pressure.
