Among bloodstream methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from adult patients in a single hospital, susceptibility to co-trimoxazole increased progressively from 31% in 1988 to 92% in 1997 (p<0.0001). If also observed in other institutions, these findings should encourage the performance of a clinical trial of sufficient size to compare co-trimoxazole to vancomycin in treating MRSA infections.
