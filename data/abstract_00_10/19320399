OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to correlate the antibiotic consumption rates with the antibiotic resistance rates of uropathogens in Lagos University Teaching Hospital. METHODOLOGY: Urine specimens obtained over 18 months (between January 2005 and June 2006) were processed for microscopy culture and sensitivity, and records of antibiotics dispensed during the same periods were reviewed. Significant bacteriuria was performed by the standard loop method. Isolation and identification of organisms was by standard laboratory methods. The antibiotic consumption calculator of Monnet (ABC calc version 3) was used to classify the antibiotics into ATC classes and to calculate the numbers of daily defined doses. The 6-monthly antibiotic resistance and consumption rates were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. For analysis, the period of study was divided into three. RESULTS: Except for co-trimoxazole the rates of consumption of all antibiotics were higher in the second period than the first period of the study and highest in the 3rd period for ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime. This correlated with an increase in the rates of resistance for some antibiotics during the 2nd and 3rd periods. While a steady increase in consumption of ciprofloxacin correlated with a steady increase in the resistance rates from the 1st to the 3rd periods, a steady increase in consumption of ceftazidime was associated with an increased resistance rate from the 2nd to 3rd periods. CONCLUSION: Increased consumption of the antibiotics tested, most noticeably, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime correlated with increased resistance rates. There is need for urgent interventions like formulation of antibiotic policies and education of staff on the appropriate use of antibiotics to reduce the development of resistance.
