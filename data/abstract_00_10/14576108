Mutations in the pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes have been associated with chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. Ten and five mutations, respectively, have been identified in these genes from chloroquine-resistant parasites worldwide. Mutation patterns in pfcrt revealed that chloroquine resistance evolved independently in southeast Asia, South America, and Papua New Guinea. However, the evolution of chloroquine resistance in the rest of the Pacific region is unclear. In this study, we examined sequence polymorphisms in these genes in isolates from Morong, Philippines, and compared them to known chloroquine resistance sequences. Two novel mutations, A144T and L160Y, were identified outside of the 10 known mutations in pfcrt in Morong isolates. These novel mutations were identified only in parasites with K76T and N326D but without the common A220S mutation found in most chloroquine-resistant isolates. This represents a unique chloroquine resistance allelic type (K76T/A144T/L160Y/N326D) not previously found elsewhere in the world. One Morong isolate also had an additional C72S mutation, whereas only one isolate possessed an allelic type typical of chloroquine resistance in Asia. Parasites with the novel pfcrt allelic types were resistant to chloroquine in vitro and were unresponsive to verapamil (0.9 microM) chemosensitization, similar to chloroquine-resistant parasites from South America and Papua New Guinea. These results suggest that chloroquine resistance evolved independently in the Philippines and represents a second chloroquine resistance founder event in the South Pacific.
