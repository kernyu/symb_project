FACTS: Among the 280 strains studied, 106 were sensitive to beta-lactams, 92 were beta-lactamase producers, and 82 non-producers of beta-lactamase had reduced sensitivity to beta-lactams. QUESTION: The results of this study illustrate the complexity of characterizing the phenotypic resistance of H. influenzae and raises the question of which in vitro susceptibility tests best identify resistance.
