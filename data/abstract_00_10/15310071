Conserved motifs such as the nucleotide-binding site (NBS) were found in many characterized plant disease resistance genes. Based on the NBS domain, resistance gene analogs have been isolated in our previous study and were used as probes to screen a soybean (Glycine max) cDNA library. A full-length cDNA, KR4, was isolated by screening the library and rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. Sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA was 3818 bp in length and the open reading frame coded for a polypeptide of 1211 amino acids with an NBS and five leucine-rich repeats domains, which were identified by Pfam protein analysis. Sequence alignment showed that KR4 was similar to 12 protein of tomato. Southern analysis indicated that the KR4 gene had low copies in soybean genome and it was mapped on the molecular linkage group E. Its expression was also investigated and it was found that KR4 was induced by exogenous salicylic acid and responded upon infection of soybean mosaic virus strain N3.
