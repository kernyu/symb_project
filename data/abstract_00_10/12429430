Cellular immune responses to specific Schistosoma japonicum recombinant and native antigens were investigated in a defined study population of 155 individuals in the Philippines, where data collected from a 3-year observation of exposure, infection and reinfection pattern were used to categorically classify putative 'resistant' and 'susceptible' individuals. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of individuals enrolled in the study, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine (IFN-gamma, IL-5 and IL-10) production in response to defined recombinant antigens (97 kDa paramyosin, 22 kDa tegumental antigen, 37 kDa glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 14 kDa fatty acid binding protein and 28 kDa gluthathione-S-tranferase) and native antigen soluble worm antigen preparation (SWAP) were measured. Cellular responses to the recombinant and SWAP antigens suggest that Th1 type of response appear to be important in predicting resistance in this population. Of the five recombinant antigens tested, rPMY induced significant levels of IFN-gamma. The production of IL-10, a Th2-type cytokine was strongly implicated in immune regulation. Of importance was the evidence found for SWAP and rPMY induced IFN-gamma responses in predicting 'resistance'. It was noted that these associations were significant even after the effect of age and sex were accounted for in a multivariate analysis.
