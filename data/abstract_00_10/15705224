Protein malnutrition can adversely affect all tissues. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that protein deprivation influences gastric ulcer formation, as well as metabolism and organ growth, in rats. In the present study, there was a significant reduction in the body and organ weight of rats fed a low-protein diet (P<0.001). Malnourished rats were less susceptible to ulceration of the gastric mucosa in ethanol and indomethacin models of acute gastric ulcers when compared with rats fed a normoproteic diet (17 % protein). Mucus production and prostaglandin E2 formation increased in malnourished rats, possibly explaining the lower number of acute ulcers in these animals. Pylorus ligature altered gastric juice composition (increased pH and gastric volume, and decreased total acid concentration) in the animal group fed a low-protein diet compared with the group fed a diet containing 17 % protein (P<0.05). The gastric mucosa was more damaged in malnourished rats than in normal rats evaluated for 14 d after acetic acid injection (P<0.001). Malnourished rats exhibited resistance to acute gastric lesions, owing to an increase in prostaglandin GE2 release and mucus secretion, which protected their gastric mucosa. This phenomenon was not seen in subchronic gastric ulceration.
