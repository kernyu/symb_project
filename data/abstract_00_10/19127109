Since its first isolation in 1997, vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) has been a clinical concern because it may lead to treatment failure. Up to the present, there were two reports of clinical VISA cases in Korea. We now report two additional cases of VISA with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 microg/mL. The first patient was a 59 yr-old man who had undergone total hip replacement arthroplasty in 1999 due to avascular necrosis of femur heads. He had recurrent episodes of infected hip caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and was treated with vancomycin. He underwent replacement operation of prosthesis. Cultures of joint fluid and joint tissue grew S. aureus. Vancomycin MIC as determined by a broth microdilution method was 4 microg/mL for the both isolates. The patient was treated with high enough doses of vancomycin to maintain serum trough concentrations at 20-25 microg/mL for 52 days and was discharged. The second patient was a 57 yr-old man with diabetes. He lost consciousness from drinking. After recovery of consciousness, he was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. MRSA and Acinetobacter baumannii were cultured from sputum and the patient was treated with vancomycin and meropenem. During hospitalization, bed sores developed in his ankle and back. A wound culture from the sore grew S. aureus with vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. Since infection was localized, systemic antibiotics did not seem necessary, and the patient was transferred to another hospital for isolation and management.
