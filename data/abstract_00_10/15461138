Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) is a cysteine-rich cationic low molecular weight antimicrobial peptide, which exhibits a broad range of antimicrobial activity without observed acquired resistance. In this work, multiple copies of the hBD-2 gene were linked in tandem and the expression of the multiple joined genes in two fusion expression system, pET28a(+) and pGEX-4T-2, was examined. Using plasmid pET28a(+) with one, two, and four copies of the hBD-2 gene, the expressed level was relatively low, whereas much higher with plasmid pGEX-4T-2, and the fusion products, most of which in insoluble form, account for approximately 26% of the total insoluble cellular proteins.
