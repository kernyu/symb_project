This paper reviews the present state of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the zoonotic bacteria Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, and in Escherichia coli from chickens and turkeys. For Salmonella, the frequencies and patterns of AMR vary depending on time, region, serovar, the particular farm, layers versus broilers, and the antimicrobial agent. There is usually a higher frequency of AMR in Salmonella from turkeys compared with Salmonella from chickens. Clonal and horizontal transmission of AMR occur and there is concern about the spread of transmissible plasmids that encode extended spectrum cephalosporinases. Resistance to fluoroquinolones is generally low. For Campylobacter, resistance to tetracycline is usually at moderate to high frequency, resistance to quinolones/fluoroquinolones varies from low to high, and resistance to macrolides is usually low. There are high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance in some countries. Avian pathogenic E. coli are often highly resistant, especially to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfonamides. Plasmid-mediated resistance is common. High levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin have been reported from China. Commensal E. coli from poultry have similar patterns of resistance but at lower frequencies. Integron associated resistance occurs commonly in Salmonella and E. coli but has not been detected in Campylobacter.
