To elucidate the combined effect of surfactants and antituberculous drugs, the surfactant myrastimine was tested. Two series of sputum cultures with multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) strains were made. The experimental results confirmed that myramistine noticeably enhanced the sensitivity of multidrug-resistant MBT strains to antituberculous agents. The use of endobronchial and intracavernous myramistine in combination with antituberculous agents to patients with destructive pulmonary tuberculosis caused by multidrug-resistant MBT strains reduced the latter's resistance to antibiotics, cured tubendobronchitis in most patients, created conditions for obliteration of the cavernous cavity. Positive changes are noted in the first 4 months after the initiation of therapy, which can prepare patients for surgical treatment more rapidly.
