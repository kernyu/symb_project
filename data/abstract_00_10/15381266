Isolates of Streptococcus suis serotype 7 from diseased pigs in Denmark were characterized by ribotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), MIC-determinations and detection of resistance genes. Forty-one different ribotype profiles were found among the 103 isolates and could be divided into two main clusters. No obvious relationship between ribotypes and the clinical origin of the isolates could be observed. Fifty-four isolates, including all 24 isolates belonging to the main ribotype profile were examined by PFGE and 50 different profiles were found. A high frequency of resistance to erythromycin (41%), tetracycline (24%) and streptomycin (28%) was observed. Furthermore, almost all isolates (101) were resistant to sulphamethoxazol. Most isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim and trimethoprim + sulphonamides. The tet(M) gene was found among 11 (44%) and the tet(O) gene in six (24%) of 25 tetracycline resistant isolates. The tet(L) and tet(S) genes were not detected in any isolates. The erm(B) gene was detected in 39 (93%) of 42 erythromycin resistant isolates.
