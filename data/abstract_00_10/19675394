BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Cholera is endemic in Chandigarh and its surrounding areas. This retrospective study was undertaken over a period of nine years (January 1999-December 2007) from a tertiary care hospital in north India to understand the changing epidemiology aspects and antibiotic resistance patterns in Vibrio cholerae isolates. METHODS: A total of 277 isolates of V. cholerae were included in the study. V. cholerae was identified by standard microbiological procedures. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed by disc diffusion method and isolates phage typed. RESULTS: All the isolates were identified as V. cholerae O1 biotype El Tor serotype Ogawa; phage 27 was the predominant type. Men were more commonly affected with maximum number in the age group 0-5 yr. Majority of the isolates were resistant to furazolidone but sensitive to gentamicin and cefotaxime. Resistance pattern to amoxycillin was variable. Three isolates were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin. All the patients presented during June-October coinciding with the monsoon season and a majority were from suburbs. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The emergence of resistance amongst V. cholerae especially towards ciprofloxacin may significantly influence the control strategies in future outbreaks. Phage 27 remained the predominant type in all the years. Continuous surveillance with regard to drug resistance, early detection and a strong regional commitment may help contain the disease.
