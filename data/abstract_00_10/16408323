The benzimidazole fungicides thiabendazole and carbendazim, and the imidazole fungicide prochloraz-Mn, were tested for their efficacy in controlling cobweb disease of mushrooms caused by two Cladobotryum isolates. Isolate 202A was benzimidazole-sensitive in vitro and cobweb growth on the casing was well controlled by both benzimidazole fungicides in cropping experiments. Carbendazim also controlled the development of spotting symptoms much more effectively than thiabendazole. A second isolate (192B1) was benzimidazole-resistant and was highly resistant to thiabendazole in vitro but it showed some sensitivity to carbendazim in vitro at moderate to high concentrations. Despite this, carbendazim did not control disease symptoms in cropping experiments, confirming that isolate 192B1 is cross-resistant to other benzimidazole fungicides. Both isolates showed some sensitivity to prochloraz-Mn in vitro. This fungicide gave between 45% and 65% control of cobweb growth on the casing caused by either 202A or 192B1 but gave no control of spotting symptoms. Reducing the fungicide application volume did not give enhanced disease control. The emergence of benzimidazole resistance reduces the value of benzimidazoles in the control of mushroom pathogens. However, the lack of effective alternatives means they continue to have utility in cases where pathogens are still sensitive but this requires regular monitoring of pathogen populations for resistance.
