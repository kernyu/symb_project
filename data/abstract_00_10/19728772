We have analyzed the total metagenomic DNA from both human oral and fecal samples derived from healthy volunteers from six European countries to determine the molecular basis for tetracycline and erythromycin resistance. We have determined that tet(M) and tet(W) are the most prevalent tetracycline resistance genes assayed for in the oral and fecal metagenomes, respectively. Additionally, tet(Q), tet(O), and tet(O/32/O) have been shown to be common. We have also shown that erm(B), erm(V), and erm(E) are common erythromycin resistance genes present in these environments. Further, we have demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of the Tn916 integrase in the oral metagenomes and the Tn4451 and Tn1549 integrase genes within the fecal metagenomes.
