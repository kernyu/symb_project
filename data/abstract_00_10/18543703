A retrospective study was conducted during 32 months; from 1 May 2003 to 30 December 2005 in haematology department. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the anti retroviral therapy 157 patients receiving antiretroviral treatment for at least a twelve month-period and presenting AIDS symptoms based on revised CDC criteria were included. The average number of initial T4 lymphocytes is 133/mm3 (extremes 1 and 385) and the initial plasmatic average viral load, quantified in 96 patients is 214,000 copies (extreme 30,000 et 999,000) The initial antiretroviral combinations were as follows: ZDV or D4T + LMV + NVP (59.2%); ZDV or D4T + LMV + EFV (28.7%), ZDV or D4T + LMV + IDNV (8.9%); ZDV or D4T + DDI + NVP (3.2%). The results of the study are: observance rate during the first 12 months (84%), antiretroviral therapy taken irregularly (10.8%), early submission of therapy (5.2%), weight gain after 24 months: +18 kgs, clinical response globally positive. The immune response is characterised by an average increase of 353/mm3 of CD4 after 24 months. Among 96 patients tested, the plasmatic viral load was undetectable in 71% of cases after a 12 month-follow up. Mild adverse drug effects have been noticed, represented by cutaneous and nervous toxicity anaemia and digestive disorders due to indinavir These therapeutic results confirm the importance of the antiretroviral therapy in the improvement of the quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients but a concern remains on the possible drug resistance still not documented.
