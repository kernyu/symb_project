The control of antibiotic resistance presents a complex and multifaceted challenge. Professional societies, governments and international agencies, including the WHO, have identified a strategy that emphasizes the importance of microbiological surveillance, monitoring antibiotic use, prudent prescribing, education of healthcare professionals and the public and encouraging the development of new drugs and other technologies. The flow of new classes of antibiotic has substantially declined at a time when resistance rates and new problems have increased significantly. The decline in prescribing rates, the emphasis on the use of generics, the multiple hurdles to be negotiated with licensing authorities and reimbursement agencies are in part responsible. In addition, the failure of genomic-based drug development to show a return on investment has compounded this problem. With this background, a number of organizations have made efforts to raise these concerns with governments, academia, funding agencies and other relevant parties. The Specialist Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance recognized the need to address the technology gap. A European Union Intergovernmental Conference was organized on behalf of the UK Department of Health entitled 'Antibiotic resistance - action to promote new technologies' in December 2005. The conference gathered together delegates from academia, industry, funding agencies, healthcare management, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, European Directorates and representatives of Member States. Its recommendations have been published.
