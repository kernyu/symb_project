Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are the most prevalent nonfermentative bacterial species isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. A surveillance study of 65 laboratories in the United States from 1998 to 2001 found >90% of isolates of P. aeruginosa from hospitalized patients to be susceptible to amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam; 80 to 90% of isolates to be susceptible to cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem; and 70 to 80% of isolates to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. From 1998 to 2001, decreases in antimicrobial susceptibility (percents) among non-intensive-care-unit (non-ICU) inpatients and ICU patients, respectively, were greatest for ciprofloxacin (6.1 and 6.5), levofloxacin (6.6 and 3.5), and ceftazidime (4.8 and 3.3). Combined 1998 to 2001 results for A. baumannii isolated from non-ICU inpatients and ICU patients, respectively, demonstrated that >90% of isolates tested were susceptible to imipenem (96.5 and 96.6%) and meropenem (91.6 and 91.7%); fewer isolates from both non-ICU inpatients and ICU patients were susceptible to amikacin and ticarcillin-clavulanate (70 to 80% susceptible); and <60% of isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, or levofloxacin. From 1998 to 2001, rates of multidrug resistance (resistance to at least three of the drugs ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and imipenem) showed small increases among P. aeruginosa strains isolated from non-ICU inpatients (5.5 to 7.0%) and ICU patients (7.4 to 9.1%). From 1998 to 2001, rates of multidrug resistance among A. baumannii strains isolated from non-ICU inpatients (27.6 to 32.5%) and ICU patients (11.6 to 24.2%) were higher and more variable than those observed for P. aeruginosa. Isolates concurrently susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to both imipenem and meropenem accounted for 89.8 and 91.2% of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates, respectively, studied from 1998 to 2001. In conclusion, for aminoglycosides and most beta-lactams susceptibility rates for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were constant or decreased only marginally (</=3%) from 1998 to 2001. Greater decreases in susceptibility rates were, however, observed for fluoroquinolones and ceftazidime among P. aeruginosa isolates.
