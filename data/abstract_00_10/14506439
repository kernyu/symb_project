INTRODUCTION: During a pneumococcal septicemia, the direct revelation of bacteria on a blood smear is rare and has been mainly described in splenectomised patients. OBSERVATION: A 62 year-old non-splenectomised man suffering from myeloma died, a few hours after his admission to emergency department, from a fulminant pneumococcemia, the diagnosis of which had been rapidly evoked on the examination of a blood smear showing numerous Gram positive diplococci. COMMENTS: This observation highlights the potential severity of pneumococcal infections in patients suffering from altered humoral immunity and the diagnostic interest, in this case, of a systematic routine blood smear permitting rapid initiation of appropriate treatment.
