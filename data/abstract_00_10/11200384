Iatrogenic meningitis following lumbar puncture is a rare event. We present a 52-y-old man who developed symptoms of meningitis within 12 h after spinal anaesthesia. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures grew Streptococcus salivarius partially resistant to penicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient was successfully treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin and left the hospital with minor sequelae. A literature review of 60 cases revealed the median age of the patients to be 44 y. The median incubation period was 24 h. Most cases occurred after spinal anaesthesia (n = 27), myelography (n = 20) and diagnostic lumbar puncture (n = 5). Organisms were isolated in 52 cases, and streptococcal species were responsible for 33 (63%) of them. An upward trend in resistance of S. viridans isolates is cause for concern and may change empirical treatment strategies. Death was reported in 3 cases (5%) and was associated with Pseudomonas and staphylococcal isolates. The recognition of this entity and the importance of proper infection control measures are underlined.
