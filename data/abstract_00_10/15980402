Eighty-five extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from a Slovak hospital have been studied. SHV-2a was predominant, but other variants have been detected, namely, SHV-5, SHV-12, TEM-12, TEM-15, and TEM-132, which differed from TEM-1 by amino acid substitutions R164H, E240K, and I173V and had kinetic properties similar to those of TEM-28.
