Treatment failure after preceding protease inhibitors (PI) is often due to resistance mutations. Our objective was to evaluate amprenavir (APV) in pre-treated patients and to correlate it with pre-existing mutations. - Fourty five patients were entered in an open label prospective study (6/99-12/2000). Pre-treatment was 6.2 years +/- 2.4 (2-11.3) and included a mean of 4.13 nucleosides (RTIs) and 2.73 PIs. Genotypic resistance testing was performed prior to the switch. APV dose was 1200 mg/d in combination with ritonavir (RTV) boosting (2 x 100mg) and 2 x 1200 mg/d in 6 patients without RTV. Co-medication was selected based on treatment history and results of genotypic testing. - The median duration of treatment at analysis was 34 weeks. Plasma viral load (VL) average at baseline was 4.6 log subset 10 +/- 08. After 24 weeks the mean VL reduction was 1.4 log subset 10 +/- 1.2 3.86-0.40s). A VL reduction of >1.5 log subset 10 was found in 16/45 patients (36%), 21/45 (47%) patients achieved a VL <400 cp/ml, and 12/45 (27%) a VL < 50 cp/ml. CD4 cells increased from a mean baseline of 208/microl +/- 185 to 318/microl +/- 253. Fourty percent (18/45) of patients had a CD4 gain of more than 100 cells/microl. Genotypic resistance determination showed PI mutations in 87% of patients tested. The average number of mutated codons was 4.54. Three of 4 patients with I84V mutation did not achieve an undetectable VL. - Our findings demonstrate that APV and APV/RTV plus two additional antiretrovirals has a good virological and immunological success rate in pre-treated patients. Presence of more than two APV resistance mutations was associated with treatment failure.
