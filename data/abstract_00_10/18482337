In an attempt to design novel anti-TB drugs, the target chosen is the enzyme 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), which is an attractive target since it is present in microorganisms but not in humans. The existing drugs for this target are the sulfa drugs, which have been used for about seven decades. However, single mutations in the DHPS gene can cause resistance to sulfa drugs. Therefore, there is a need for the design of novel drugs. Based on the recently determined crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) DHPS complexed with a known substrate analogue, and on the crystal structures of E. coli DHPS and Staphylococcus aureus DHPS, we have identified a dipeptide inhibitor with the sequence WK. Docking calculations indicate that this peptide has a significantly higher potency than the sulfa drugs. In addition, the potency is 70-90 times higher for M.tb DHPS as compared to that for the pterin and folate-binding sites of key human proteins. Thus, the designed inhibitor is a promising lead compound for the development of novel antimycobcaterial agents.
