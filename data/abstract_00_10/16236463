Nine 2-arylbenzofurans isolated from Morus species were tested for their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among these compounds, chalcomoracin (a leaf phytoalexine of mulberry tree) exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against MRSAs (MICs 0.78 mug/ml).
