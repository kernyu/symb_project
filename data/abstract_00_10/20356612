In an effort to find antimalarial drugs, a systematic in vitro evaluation on a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum (FcB1) was undertaken on sixty plant extracts collected in French Guiana. The ethyl acetate extract obtained from the root barks of Symphonia globulifera exhibited a strong antiplasmodial activity (97% at 10 microg/ml). The phytochemical investigation of this extract led to the isolation of nine polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol (PPAPs) compounds and two oxidized derivatives. All compounds showed antiplasmodial activity with IC(50)s ranged from 2.1 to 10.1 microM. A LC/ESI-MS(n) study performed on polyprenylated benzophenones previously isolated from Moronobea coccinea provided a reliable method for their detection in the extract and structural elucidation.
