OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisplatin plus gemcitabine in persistent or recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian and primary peritoneal cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Eligible, consenting subjects with measurable disease and one prior platinum-based regimen, but no prior gemcitabine, were to receive intravenous cisplatin followed by gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 every 28 days. RESULTS: Between December 2000 and March 2003, 59 patients were enrolled from 24 institutions; two were ineligible. During the first stage of accrual, 27 subjects received cisplatin 30 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 750 mg/m2. In the second stage, gemcitabine was reduced to 600 mg/m2 because of hematologic toxicity at the higher dose. There were 4 complete and 5 partial responses for an overall response rate of 16% (9/57). Thirty-one women (54%) had stable disease. Median time to progression was 5.4 months. Overall survival was 14.9+ months. Grade 4 toxicities were hematologic, except one cutaneous reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin plus gemcitabine, in the doses and schedule employed, has modest activity in this patient population.
