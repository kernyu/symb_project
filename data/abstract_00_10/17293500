Commercial turkey flocks in North Carolina have been found to be colonized frequently with Campylobacter coli strains that are resistant to several antimicrobials (tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and ciprofloxacin/nalidixic acid). Such strains have been designated multidrug resistant (MDR). However, the population structure of MDR C. coli from turkeys remains poorly characterized. In this study, an analysis of multilocus sequence typing (MLST)-based sequence types (STs) of 59 MDR strains from turkeys revealed that the majority of these strains corresponded to one of 14 different STs, with three STs accounting for 41 (69%) of the strains. The major STs were turkey specific, and most (87%) of the strains with these STs were resistant to the entire panel of antibiotics mentioned above. Some (13%) of the strains with these STs were susceptible to just one or two of the antibiotics in this panel. Further subtyping using fla typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with SmaI and KpnI revealed that the major MDR STs corresponded to strains of related but distinct subtypes, providing evidence for genomic diversification within these STs. These findings suggest that MDR strains of C. coli from turkeys have a clonal population structure characterized by the presence of a relatively small number of clonal groups that appear to be disseminated in the turkey production system. In addition, the observed correlation between STs and the MDR profiles of the microbes indicates that MLST-based typing holds potential for source-tracking applications specific to the animal source (turkeys) and the antimicrobial resistance profile (MDR status) of C. coli.
