This study analysed the mechanisms involved in the acquisition of resistance to quinolones in mutants obtained in vitro of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis. Two nalidixic acid-resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations, MIC>256 mg/l), ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC 0.5 mg/l) clinical isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis with a mutation at amino acid codon Ser-83 of the gyrA gene were grown on plates containing increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin. The increase in MIC to ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin was totally or partially associated with over-expression of an AcrAB-like efflux pump. In addition, unidentified mechanism(s) may have been involved in the increased MIC to these antimicrobials. This study demonstrated that AcrAB-like efflux pumps appear to play a relevant role in the increase in MIC to some quinolones although, other, as yet undefined, mechanisms may be involved.
