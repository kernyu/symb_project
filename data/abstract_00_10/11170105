BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance (MDR) is mediated by the drug resistance proteins, the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and P-glycoprotein, both of which confer resistance by the active efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs from the cell. Reduced Fas (CD95/APO-1) expression and resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis have also been correlated with P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR. METHODS: We investigated cell surface Fas expression (using anti-Fas monoclonal antibody DX2.1) in a series of MRP-expressing drug-resistant leukemia sublines, and P-glycoprotein-expressing leukemia sublines, and their susceptibility to apoptosis induced by anti-Fas treatment (CH-11 monoclonal antibody). Caspase-3 activation was detected by Western blot and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining of cells. RESULTS: Fas expression was not reduced in either the MRP- or P-glycoprotein-expressing drug-resistant cell lines, although expression was reduced by 15% in one low-level drug-resistant subline. Expression of MRP or P-glycoprotein did not confer resistance to caspase-3 activation or to anti-Fas-induced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: MDR mediated by the drug transport proteins MRP and P-glycoprotein does not correlate with resistance to Fas-mediated cell death or resistance to caspase-3 activation.
