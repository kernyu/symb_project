Ninety-two clinical microbiologists, infectious disease clinicians and clinicians with an interest in the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) participated in an interactive session concerning the management of acute uncomplicated lower UTI. The antibacterials considered most appropriate as first-line agents were trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole, pivmecillinam, nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones. The current level of usage of fluoroquinolones for lower UTIs was, however, considered inappropriate by most delegates from a 'societal perspective', in terms of spread of resistance and potential impact on the environment.
