A prospective, randomized pilot study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent ceftazidime in ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Ceftazidime was administered either as a 3 g/day continuous infusion (CI) or an intermittent infusion (II) of 2 g every 8 h. In addition, all patients received concomitant once-daily tobramycin. The demographics of the evaluable patients (n = 35) were similar between the groups: age (years), CI 46 +/- 16, II 56 +/- 20; Apache score, CI 14 +/- 4, II 16 +/- 6; time (days) from admission to diagnosis, CI 9 +/- 6, II 9 +/- 6. Clinical efficacy, defined as cure/improvement was similar between groups [n (%), CI 16/17 (94), II 15/18 (83)], while microbiological response was also comparable [n (%), CI 10/13 (76), II 12/15 (80)]. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all isolates were measured throughout the treatment course; there was no development of resistance during therapy for either regimen. While limited clinical data exist, our results suggest that the use of ceftazidime by CI administration maintains clinical efficacy, optimizes the pharmacodynamic profile and uses less antibiotic compared with the standard 2 g every 8 h intermittent dosing regimen.
