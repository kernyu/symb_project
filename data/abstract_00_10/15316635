A 68 year old man presented with urethritis and a purulent discharge, carrying the tentative diagnosis of gonorrhea. He had already been treated with multiple antibiotics. Microbiological investigation revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a relatively frequent Gram-negative bacteria in hospitals, which can cause several nosocomial diseases such as pneumonia, wound infections and urogenital infections. Therapy can be difficult because of frequent antibiotic resistance. Guided by sensitivity studies, the patient was successfully treated with gyrase inhibitors. Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urogenital infections in ambulatory patients are extremely rare and usually not associated with a gonorrhea-like discharge.
