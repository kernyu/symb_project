Sixty rifampin (RIF)-resistant and 75 RIF-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Shandong Province, China, were analyzed for rpoB gene mutations and genotyped. Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) genotype 223325173533 was overrepresented among RIF-resistant isolates. MIRU combined with IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis as the second-line genotyping method may reflect epidemiologic links more reliably than each method alone.
