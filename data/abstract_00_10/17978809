The in vitro antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant Propionibacterium acnes of kaempferol isolated from the Impatiens balsamina alone and in combination with erythromycin or clindamycin antibiotics was investigated. The antibiotic combination effect against antibiotic-resistant P. acnes was studied by checkerboard test. Kaempferol and quercetin demonstrated antibacterial activities against P. acnes. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for both compounds were < or =32 ug/ml and < or =64 ug/ml for clindamycin-sensitive and-resistant P. acnes, respectively. The four combination formulations (kaempferol and either erythromycin or clindamycin; quercetin and either erythromycin or clindamycin) exhibited a synergic inhibition of P. acnes growth. The combination of kaempferol with quercetin showed an indifferent effect. The combination of clindamycin with kaempferol or quercetin showed a greater synergic effect than that of erythromycin with kaempferol or quercetin. Thus, these combinations demonstrated the potential to treat acne.
