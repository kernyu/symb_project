Chronic ethanol consumption dysregulates glucose and lipid homeostasis, is associated with insulin resistance, and alters serum levels of adipokines including adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, the mechanisms involved in these chronic ethanol-induced pathologies are not fully understood. Adipose tissue has been implicated as an important contributor to chronic ethanol-induced disease states and, therefore, the effects of chronic ethanol feeding in rats on adipocytes has been investigated. Three major functions of the adipocyte include glucose transport, adipokine secretion, and triglyceride breakdown via lipolysis. Included in this chapter are protocols for studying the effect of chronic ethanol feeding on these adipocyte functions.
