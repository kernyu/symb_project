Recent bacteriological data concerning pyelonephritis mainly focus on sensitivity to antibiotics and virulence factors. Epidemiologically, and regardless of age and sex of the patients, E. coli remains the most often isolated pathogen. Only 55% of E. coli strains (43% if isolated during a nosocomial infection) are sensitive to amoxicillin. Resistance to parenterally administered third generation cephalosporins remain exceptional. Fluoroquinolones remain very active, particularly in community-acquired infections (>95% sensitive strains). P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and enterococci are mainly isolated during nosocomial infections or in patients with a history of previous hospital admissions. Adhesion factors to urothelial cells are of uppermost importance in the pathogenesis of urinary infection. Adhesins G borne by fimbriae P are mainly concerned. Also, hemolysin is very often present in strains responsible for pyelonephritis. As to the search for these factors in the diagnosis of pyelonephritis, particularly in children, further studies are needed. The choice of antibiotherapy not only rests upon antibiogram data, but also upon pharmacological characteristics of the antibiotic.
