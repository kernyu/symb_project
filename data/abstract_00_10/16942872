A library of hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs) and analogues were synthesized using solid-phase synthesis technique. These compounds were screened for antibacterial against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (11 strains) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) (4 strains). Dihydrocaffeoyl analogues showed activity against VRSA which were better than the reference drugs, vancomycin and oxacillin. These compounds also exhibited antibacterial activity against MRSA, which were more potent than oxacillin.
