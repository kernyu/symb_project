OBJECTIVE: To study the phenotypic and genotypic resistance to Fluoroquinolones in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) isolated in Jiangsu province of China. METHODS: In-vitro, susceptibility testing of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against ninety-five clinical isolates were determined by agar dilution method. Detection of mutation in the gyrA and parC genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and sequence analysis. RESULTS: The clinical isolates demonstrated 100% resistance to ciprofloxacin. Based on gyrA and parC mutations, 18 types could be categorized among the 54 isolates. Based on the same gyrA mutations,isolates with high MIC appeared to have had more mutations in parC gene. CONCLUSION: The status of resistance to ciprofloxacin in NG was quite serious, and ciprofloxacin treatment for the treatment of NG infections in Jiangsu province should not be recommended. The results from this study suggested that mutations in the parC gene had contributed to the development of high Fluoroquinolone resistance in NG.
