The in vitro susceptibilities of 266 isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae determined by the agar dilution method showed that 6% of isolates were nonsusceptible to penicillin and 46% was resistant to erythromycin. Of the erythromycin-resistant isolates, 86.3% had the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance phenotype (constitutive MLS, 85.5%; inducible MLS, 0.8%) and 13.7% had the M phenotype.
