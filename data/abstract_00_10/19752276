We assessed the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin ceftaroline against Enterococcus faecalis in time-kill experiments and in a rabbit endocarditis model with simulated human dosing. Ceftaroline was more active than either vancomycin or linezolid against vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant isolates of E. faecalis.
