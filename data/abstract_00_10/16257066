ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters comprise a large paralogous protein family and several confer drug resistance. Ivermectin (IVM) is the only drug approved for treatment of onchocerciasis and is a substrate for some ABC transporters. Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence that IVM selects on some ABC transporter genes in Onchocerca volvulus and other parasitic nematodes. The onchocerciasis control programs rely on community based treatment with IVM each year to reduce morbidity and decrease parasite transmission. This appears to be imposing selection pressure on O. volvulus. A half-size ABC transporter cDNA has previously been reported for O. volvulus, however, the full length gene has not been previously characterized and investigated for possible selection by IVM. Genes under selection may be identified by patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and a loss of genetic polymorphism at physically linked loci. Twelve genetic markers spanning the full gene were examined in O. volvulus from non-treated and IVM treated populations in Ghana. Analysis of the genomic organization of the half-size ABC transporter (OvPLP) indicates that it spans approximately 3.8 kb comprising nine exons. Worms from treated people showed a reduction in gene diversity, a loss of genetic polymorphism at several markers, a selection for specific alleles, and a reduction in the number of regions in LD; these effects were more pronounced as treatment increased. These changes suggest that IVM is imposing selection pressure on this gene. The region between transmembrane domains four and five may be a useful marker for IVM selection in O. volvulus.
