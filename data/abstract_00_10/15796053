Prevention of hospital-acquired infection is the most important strategy to control infection in terms of the well being of patients and the medical economy. Infection control in hospitals is carried out by the action against hospital-based infection, for which clinical laboratory functions, such as surveillance and outbreak investigation, should be primary responsible. Therefore, it is essential for clinicians to have clinical laboratory rapidly detect pathogenic organisms and provide new and update information on appropriate antibiotics and clinical isolates. It is also desirable for clinical laboratory to collaborate with infection control team (ICT) and link nurse, and provide them with useful information on on-going infection.
