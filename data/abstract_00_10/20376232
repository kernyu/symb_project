Gene therapy is a field of Biomedicine. With the advent of gene therapy in dentistry, significant progress has been made in the control of periodontal diseases and reconstruction of dento-alveolar apparatus.Implementation in periodontics include:-As a mode of tissue engineering with three approaches: cell, protein-based and gene delivery approach.-Genetic approach to Biofilm Antibiotic Resistance.Future strategies of gene therapy in preventing periodontal diseases:-Enhances host defense mechanism against infection by transfecting host cells with an antimicrobial peptide protein-encoding gene.-Periodontal vaccination.Gene therapy is one of the recent entrants and its applications in the field of periodontics are reviewed in general here.
