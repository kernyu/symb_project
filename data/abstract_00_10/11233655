BACKGROUND: Pyoderma gangrenosum complicates inflammatory bowel disease in 2-3% of patients and often fails to respond to antibiotics, steroids, surgical debridement or even colectomy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart analysis of 11 consecutive steroid-refractory pyoderma patients (5 ulcerative colitis, 6 Crohn's disease) referred to our practice and then treated with intravenous cyclosporine. Pyoderma gangrenosum was present on the extremities in 10 patients, the face in 2, and stomas in 21. At initiation of intravenous cyclosporine, bowel activity was moderate in 3 patients, mild in 4, and inactive in 4. All patients received intravenous cyclosporine at a dose of 4 mg/kg/d for 7-22 days. They were discharged on oral cyclosporine at a dose of 4-7 mg/kg/d. RESULTS: All 11 patients had closure of their pyoderma with a mean time to response of 4.5 days and a mean time to closure of 1.4 months. All seven patients with bowel activity went into remission. Nine patients were able to discontinue steroids, and nine were maintained on 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine. One patient who could not tolerate 6-mercaptopurine had a recurrence of pyoderma. No patient experienced significant toxicity. CONCLUSION: Intravenous cyclosporine is the treatment of choice for pyoderma gangrenosum refractory to steroids and 6-mercaptopurine should be used as maintenance therapy.
