During 1999-2000 a total of 4131 faecal specimens were collected and analysed at the medical centre St. Camille at Ouagadougou. Eight hundred and twenty-six (8.0%) grew significant bacteria. Escherichia coli (35%), Salmonella spp. (15%) and Shigella spp. (10%) were most frequently isolated. A large number of E. coli strains were resistant to aminopenicillins (>90%) and cotrimoxazole (80%); for Yersinia spp the resistance was 80 and 25%, respectively. Norfloxacin was the most active antibiotic but was rarely used. The study showed that it is necessary to create antibiotic-resistance surveillance centres in developing countries so that therapy may be appropriate and the spread of antibiotic resistance to other developed countries via increased emigration may be reduced.
