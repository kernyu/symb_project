In this mini review we summarize recent studies from our laboratory, which show the involvement of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in cell cycle signaling. We demonstrate 4-HNE induced apoptosis in various cell lines is accompanied with c-Jun-N-terminal kinase and caspase-3 activation. Cells exposed to mild, transient, heat or oxidative stress acquire capacity to exclude intracellular 4-HNE at a faster rate by inducing hGST5.8 which conjugate 4-HNE to GSH, and RLIP76 which mediates the ATP-dependent transport of the GSH-conjugate of 4-HNE. The cells preconditioned with mild transient stress acquire resistance to H(2)O(2) and 4-HNE induced apoptosis by excluding intracellular 4-HNE at an accelerated pace. Furthermore, a decrease in intracellular concentration of 4-HNE achieved by transfecting cells with mGSTA4-4 or hGSTA4-4 results in a faster growth rate. These studies strongly suggest a role of 4-HNE in stress mediated signaling.
