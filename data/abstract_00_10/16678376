We report here a case of osteoarticular infection associated with Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus aureus. The 3-year-old child presented osteoarthritis associated with toxic shock syndrome, which was complicated by thrombosis, pneumonia, and diaphysitis, despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. Osteitis associated with toxinogenic S. aureus is rarely described. This case highlights the need of early and aggressive surgical treatment, in addition to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
