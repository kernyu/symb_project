Florfenicol resistance was analyzed in 230 enteric pig isolates collected between 1998 and 2006. PCR, plasmid profiling, Southern blot hybridization, and a mixed-broth conjugation assay suggested the intra- and interspecies plasmid-mediated transfer of florfenicol resistance among the isolates that exhibited MICs for florfenicol between 4 to 128 mg/liter.
