Malaria is a major vector-borne disease in India. Based on vast geographic areas with associated topographic and climatic diversity, the variable malaria epidemiology in India is associated with high parasite genetic diversity and rapidly evolving drug resistance, differential distribution of vector species and emerging insecticide resistance and underlying human genetic diversity and past evolutionary histories. Further, changing climatic patterns have possibly changed malaria epidemiology to a great extent. The outcome of these changes is an increased incidence of Plasmodium falciparum over the P. vivax malaria in recent years. Accordingly, the drug and insecticide application policy in India has changed too. The above facts and associated rapid shifting trend of malaria epidemiology makes India a hot-spot for malaria research.
