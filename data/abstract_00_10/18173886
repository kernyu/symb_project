Drug-resistant tuberculosis is an increasing problem worldwide. There are few reports of drug susceptibility patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from cases of tuberculous meningitis. A 5-year retrospective study aimed at analysing the drug susceptibility profile of M. tuberculosis isolated from tuberculous meningitis cases was conducted. A total of 366 isolates were analysed. Among these, 301 (82.2%) were sensitive to all the four primary drugs tested, while 65 (17.8%) showed resistance. There were 46 (12.5%) isolates resistant to isoniazid (INH), while 9 (2.4%) demonstrated multidrug resistance. These data suggest that multidrug resistance in tuberculous meningitis is not yet a serious problem. However, a periodic review is required to ascertain the global incidence of drug-resistant tuberculous meningitis.
