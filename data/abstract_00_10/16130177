In the past 25 years, the worldwide AIDS epidemic has grown such that roughly 38 million people were estimated to be living with the disease worldwide at the end of 2003. The introduction of antiretroviral-based therapies, beginning in 1987, has enabled many to live with HIV as a chronic, rather than terminal, disease. However, the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains highlights the continued need for new therapies with novel modes of action. In 2003, the FDA and EMEA approved enfuvirtide (Fuzeon), a 36 amino acid peptide derived from the natural gp41 HR2 sequence, as the first HIV fusion inhibitor. T-1249, a 39 amino acid fusion inhibitor, is active against viruses that develop resistance to enfuvirtide. The development of FIs and the processes to manufacture enfuvirtide and T-1249 on an unprecedented scale for peptide therapeutics are presented. Synthetic routes based on a combination of solid phase peptide synthesis and solution phase fragment condensation as well as the analytical controls necessary to insure a robust process are discussed.
