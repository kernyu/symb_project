We analyzed the possible causes of imipenem (IPM) resistance in multidrug-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii. Comparison of the outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles of two genomically related strains (Ab288 [IPM sensitive] and Ab242 [IPM resistant]) indicated the conspicuous loss of a 29-kDa polypeptide in the Ab242 strain. No carbapenemase activity was detected in any of these strains. The treatment of Ab288 with sodium salicylate resulted in IPM resistance and the loss of the 29-kDa OMP. In addition, IPM-resistant clones of Ab288 which were selected by repetitive culturing in increasing concentrations of this antibiotic also showed the absence of this 29-kDa OMP.
