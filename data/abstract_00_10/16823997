Approximately 70% of health care associated pathogens are resistant to one or more antibiotics. Experts maintain that most antimicrobial-resistant pathogens develop from antibiotic overuse and inappropriate antibiotic selection or treatment duration. Up to 70% of long-term care residents receive at least one course of an antimicrobial agent during a one-year period. Four types of infections occur most often among long-term care residents: urinary tract, respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue, and gastrointestinal tract, and outbreaks are common. Diagnostic uncertainty, failure to recognize fever's clinical manifestation in the elderly, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and bacterial colonization contribute to antibiotic overuse. Recent infection control guidelines recommend more targeted antibiotic utilization review. Recommendations are presented for implementing antibiotic utilization programs. Hand washing and other measures, such as droplet precautions, are discussed. Economic disincentives surrounding antimicrobial research are highlighted.
