Alkylating agents and purine analogues have been the mainstays of therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) for decades. The past decade witnessed the general clinical use of monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab, both as single agents and in combination regimens with cytotoxic drugs, for previously untreated and relapsed CLL. First-line chemoimmunotherapy regimens combining rituximab and purine analogues have greatly improved initial response rates and progression-free survival. Despite these advances in first-line therapy, patients with CLL invariably experience relapse and often acquire high-risk chromosomal abnormalities, such as del(11q22) and del(17p13), which result in resistance to current therapies. Patients who are refractory to fludarabine-based therapy have a median survival of <1 year. Therefore, new agents with novel mechanisms of action are needed for the treatment of patients with relapsed CLL, particularly for patients with high-risk genetic features. Recent clinical studies have examined the tolerability and efficacy of several novel agents in relapsed CLL: (1) the alkylator bendamustine, (2) the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol, (3) the immunomodulating drug lenalidomide, (4) the bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide oblimersen, and (5) the Bcl-2 small-molecule inhibitor obatoclax. While these agents have demonstrated exciting clinical activity against genetically high-risk CLL, they have also induced toxicities that have not been commonly observed with previous CLL therapies. The most notable toxicities have been tumor lysis syndrome and tumor flare, which are potentially serious or even fatal complications of these new therapies. Thus, further studies are needed to define these agents' biologic mechanism(s) of action, clinical activity, and safety.
