We set out to determine whether nasal swab isolates can identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and guide therapy in skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). Among hospitalized patients admitted to a general medicine service with SSTI, specificity and positive predictive value for MRSA in nasal swab isolates were 100%; sensitivity was 55%. Thus, positive nasal swab cultures may help identify MRSA colonization and guide antimicrobial therapy for SSTI when wound cultures cannot be obtained.
