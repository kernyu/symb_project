Truncated aminoglycoside-coenzyme A bisubstrate analogues were efficiently prepared using a convergent approach where the amine and the thiol are coupled in one pot with the addition of a linker, without the need for protecting groups. These derivatives were tested for their effect on the activity of the resistance-causing enzyme aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase Ii, and key structure-activity relationships are reported. Moreover, one of the inhibitors is able to block aminoglycoside resistance in cells expressing this enzyme.
