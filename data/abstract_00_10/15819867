Between February 1997 and December 2002, 3340 hospitalised patients yielded samples positive for Proteus mirabilis, of whom 45 (1.3%) were colonised/infected by P. mirabilis producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The gross incidence of patients colonised/infected by ESBL-producing P. mirabilis was 1.61/10(5) days of hospitalisation, with 20% of isolates being collected from patients in urology wards, most frequently (53.3%) from urine samples. Seventeen (37.7%) of the 43 isolates were obtained from samples collected within 48 h of hospitalisation, indicating that they were community-acquired. Isoelectric focusing assays and sequencing identified the TEM-24, TEM-92 and TEM-52 ESBLs. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed eight pulsotypes (I-VIII), with the two most common pulsotypes, IV and VI, comprising ten (23.3%) and 12 (26.6%) isolates, respectively. These pulsotypes were considered to represent epidemic strains and spread in various wards of the hospital.
