The authors studied the effect of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutation on virologic response to treatment with ZDV or stavudine (d4T) each in combination with lamivudine and indinavir. Viral genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 RNA at study entry and concerned 155 patients previously treated with ZDV, didanosine, or zalcitabine and enrolled in the NOVAVIR (Agence National de Recherche sur le SIDA [ANRS] 073) trial. Three virologic responses were investigated: early response (<50 copies/mL at week 24), late response (<500 copies/mL at week 80), and virologic failure (two HIV-1 RNA >5000 copies/mL). Patients were classified as resistant or susceptible to ZDV according to the ANRS algorithm. Plasma viral RNA from 123 of 155 patients had two or more ZDV resistance mutations. The number of ZDV resistance mutations was positively correlated with the duration of prior antiviral therapy (p <.001). At week 24, 74% and 77% of patients with virus classified as resistant were responders in the d4T and ZDV arm, respectively. Similar results were found at week 80. Virologic failure was reached in 7 of 24 patients with virus classified as susceptible and in 26 of 131 patients with resistant virus (p =.29). In the ZDV arm, patients classified as resistant had longer times to virologic failure than those classified as susceptible (p =.003). In conclusion, sustained virologic response despite presence of ZDV resistance mutations implies that these mutations do not preclude an early and durable response to treatment with a potent three-drug regimen in these patients. Patients susceptible to ZDV had lower median mean corpuscular volumes and lower random indinavir levels, suggesting that adherence was the main reason for failure.
