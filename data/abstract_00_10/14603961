The current threat in tuberculosis treatment lies on the fact of emergence of strains resistant to two most antituberculous drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. Drug resistance to TB may be classified as primary and acquired. Causes of drug resistance are inefficient administration of effective treatment, poor case handling, use of sub-standard drugs, ignorance of healthcare workers, etc. Multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) prevalence (median) in new case is highest (14.1%) in Estonia. Studies undertaken in different regions in India by Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC) during 1997-2000 revealed acquired MDR-TB resistance levels of 25-100%. The key to successful prevention of the emergence of drug resistance remains adequate case finding, prompt and correct diagnosis and effective treatment of infective patients.
