Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health problem due to the lack of new drugs in the market and also due to the advent of multidrug resistant strains (MDR). This disease affects around 8 million people and kills almost 3 million people each year and it is estimated that there are 1 billion infected with TB worldwide. Due to this problem fluoroquinolones have attracted much attention as the new class of anti TB drugs due to their fewer toxic side effects, improved pharmacokinetic properties and extensive and potent activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including resistant strains. In this present review we report fluoroquinolones as a promising new class of anti TB.
