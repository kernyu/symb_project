GOALS: To assess the resistance of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin in Turkey. BACKGROUND: Recent studies have emphasized the remarkable reduction in H. pylori eradication rates. Resistance to clarithromycin is the most important factor affecting the success of H. pylori eradication therapies. STUDY: The study involved 110 consecutive adult dyspeptic patients infected with H. pylori. Resistance to clarithromycin was studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction method on gastric biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 56 (50.9%) were male and mean age (+/-SD) was 45.1+/-13.1 years. Overall, 53 (48.2%) patients were found to be resistant to clarithromycin. Resistance to clarithromycin was not statistically associated with age, sex, previous macrolide use, residence (urban/rural), education status, and presence of peptic ulcer. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of resistance to clarithromycin was found to be markedly high. This result may explain the recently reported low success rates of H. pylori eradication therapies with clarithromycin.
