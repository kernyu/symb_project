Candida septicaemia with multidrug resistance is an uncommon event in preterm neonates. We present an extremely low birth weight infant (gestational age of 27 weeks, birth weight of 980 g) who developed congenital Candida parapsilosis septicaemia. Because the fungus was resistant both to amphotericin B and fluconazole, caspofungin was chosen for therapy. The fungus was successfully eradicated without any clinical or laboratory adverse effects.
