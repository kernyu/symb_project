Among antiretroviral therapies available for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection, protease inhibitors (PI) are the most promising molecules. Yet they are likely to induce the emergence of resistance mutations in viral strains, which as a consequence can affect their efficacy. Boosting has improved PI's efficacy by increasing their half-life and trough concentration. Boosted PI are hence, especially relevant for the treatment of patients with virological failure. Moreover, using boosted PI as first line treatment could avoid the appearance of viral mutations in case of virological failure. Indeed, boosted PI are more rapidly cleared from blood circulation than unboosted PI. Their concentrations rapidly drop and cross the range of sub-inhibitory drug concentrations i.e. the zone of highest selective pressure, thus limiting the risk of viral mutations.
