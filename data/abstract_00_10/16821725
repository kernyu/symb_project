To confirm if anaerobic G+-components are those responsible for the function of colonization resistance, obligate anaerobic G+- and G- -bacteria from normal dominant microbiota of human feces were isolated from three successive collections and then used in in vitro assays for antagonism against two enteropathogenic bacteria. The production of inhibitory diffusible compounds was determined on supplemented BHI agar and MRS agar media for G- - and G+-bacteria, respectively. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Shigella sonnei were used as indicators. G+-bacteria presented a higher overall antagonistic frequency against both pathogenic bacteria (57 and 64 % for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and S. sonnei, respectively) when compared to G+-microorganisms but with a quite elevated variation between volunteers (0-100 %) and collection samples (40-72 and 40-80 % for S. enterica sv. Typhimurium and S. sonnei, respectively). On the other hand, only three among 143 G- -isolates tested showed antagonistic activity. The results showed that, at least in vitro, obligate anaerobic G+-components of the dominant human fecal microbiota present a higher potential for antagonism against the enteropathogenic models tested than do G- -bacteria.
