The purpose of the present study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance among Streptococcus pyogenes in Bavaria, Germany. Five hundred and forty isolates of S. pyogenes were collected from patients with tonsillopharyngitis. Of these, 425 isolates were obtained from children and 115 from adult patients. All isolates were tested for susceptibility to macrolides, clindamycin, penicillin and 10 other commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents, using broth microdilution tests. All isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, amoxicillin and cephalosporins; 16.1% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline. MIC(90) values of erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and josamycin were 16, 4, 16 and 0.5 mg/L. The overall resistance rate of S. pyogenes to erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin was 13.3%. All isolates resistant to erythromycin were also resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin, and vice versa. Erythromycin resistance rates were higher in adult patients (19.1%) than in children (11.8%). The resistance rate to josamycin was only 1.5%, a value similar to that of clindamycin (1.1%). Among the 72 erythromycin-resistant isolates the M phenotype of macrolide resistance predominated (78%), while percentages of cMLS(B) (8%) and iMLS(B) (14%) phenotypes were low. Of the iMLS(B) strains (n = 10), the majority were of the subtype C (n = 8). The M phenotype was associated with a low, and the iMLS(B)-C phenotype with a high, rate of resistance to tetracycline. Conclusively, present data point to rising macrolide resistance among S. pyogenes in Bavaria.
