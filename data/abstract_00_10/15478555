Forty-nine adolescents with active pulmonary tuberculosis were followed up to assess the biological chip test for the detection of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT). Rifampicin resistance (rpo B gene mutation) was detected in 22 (44.9%) patients. Disseminated processes were detected in a larger proportion of the patients with rifampicin resistance than in those with MBT susceptibility (63.6 and 40.7%, respectively (p < 0.05). Comparison of the data on MBT resistance and susceptibility, which had been obtained by bacteriological studies (nutrient medium cultuvations) and the biological chip test, revealed their agreement in 50% of the cases. A response could be showed after 2-3 months in the former case and after 2-3 days in the latter case. With the biological chip test, the resistance of MBT to rifampicin was additionally established in 38.7% of the patients with negative cultivation tests on admission and during therapy. Follow-ups have demonstrated that MBT resistance to rifampicin preserves longer with the biological microchip test than that with nutrient medium cultivation.
