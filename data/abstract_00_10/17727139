Current data, although incomplete, suggest that pediatric administration of a fluoroquinolone, especially the best-studied ciprofloxacin, is safe. However, many experts have raised concerns regarding the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens such as pneumococcus if more children are treated with fluoroquinolones. Examination of the available data suggests that these concerns remain valid. Therefore, most experts continue to advise against expanded pediatric use of fluoroquinolones, except in those selected clinical situations where the benefits clearly outweigh the risks of therapy and there are few other antibiotic choices.
