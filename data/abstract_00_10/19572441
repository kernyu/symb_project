Although guidelines for the treatment of HIV-infected patients recommend triple drug antiretroviral therapy, because of the toxicity of these regimens, the complexity of treatment and its costs, other therapeutic options are desirable. Several clinical trials have shown that lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) as a simplification strategy in antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients who maintain suppression of viral replication while receiving conventional treatment regimens is safe and is associated with less toxicity than that due to prolonged exposure to protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogs. The present review summarizes the main results of the various retrospective studies on LPV/r as a simplification strategy of antiretroviral therapy in daily clinical practice.
