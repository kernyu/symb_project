BACKGROUND: Prior abacavir (ABC) or didanosine (ddI) therapy can result in the L74V/I or K65R mutation in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Preexisting K65R may have an impact on the treatment response to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). METHODS: An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) assay was developed to detect K65R with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.5%. RESULTS: Among baseline plasma samples from 63 treatment-naive patients, no K65R was detected by AS-PCR. Among baseline samples from 154 treatment-experienced patients, 8 had K65R and 44 had L74V/I by population sequencing. Low-level K65R was detected in an additional 11 patients by AS-PCR, 3 of whom subsequently developed full K65R. Baseline K65R correlated with absence of thymidine analog mutations (TAMs; P = 0.003) and use of ABC or ddI (P = 0.004). Patients with full or low-level K65R at baseline or with L74V/I showed a diminished TDF response. Multivariate analyses confirmed that multiple TAMs, K65R, and L74V/I were independent predictors of diminished TDF response. CONCLUSIONS: Prior therapy with ABC or ddI can result in a population genotype that shows K65R or L74V/I but does not reveal low-level K65R present in some patients. Subsequent treatment intensification with TDF resulted in a poor virologic response and may result in expansion of the preexisting K65R mutant.
