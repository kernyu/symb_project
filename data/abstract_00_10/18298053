The bla(PER-1) presence was sought by PCR in 289 ceftazidime resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated at Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (Turkey) between 1998 and 2003. PER-1 production rates were 32.3, 33.9, 14.9 and 37.9% in the 1998-2000 period, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. bla(PER-1) was detected in 46.2 and 35.9% of ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. ERIC-PCR results revealed that dissemination of two endemic clones for both P. aeruginosa (X and Y) and A. baumannii (A and B) was responsible for the high prevalence. Results of the conjugation tests and plasmid curing experiments suggested that bla(PER-1) was located on the chromosome in the representative strains. It was also shown for the first time that bla(PER-1) in a clinical isolate was associated with class-1 integron which could facilitate dissemination of bla(PER-1) among bacteria.
