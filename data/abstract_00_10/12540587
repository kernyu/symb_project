We employed gentamicin-sensitive and -resistant derivatives of Escherichia coli in a macrophage phagocytosis assay that compared lambda bacteriophage and gentamicin as extracellular bactericidal agents. Colony counts and direct microscopic examination of phagocytized E. coli supported the conclusion that gentamicin entered macrophages, even at low concentrations, and contributed to their bactericidal activity. Also, two E. coli strains differing in the ability to express the adhesin of type 1 pili (FimH) were distinguishably different in intracellular survival when lambda was used as the extracellular killing agent but were indistinguishable when gentamicin was employed.
