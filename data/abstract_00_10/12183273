Parachlamydia acanthamoeba are intracellular bacteria of amoebae and are considered potential etiological agents of human pneumonia. We have determined the in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities of two strains (strain Bn(9) and Hall's coccus) in Acanthamoeba polyphaga. The two strains were susceptible to tetracyclines, macrolides, and rifampin, but resistant to fluoroquinolones.
