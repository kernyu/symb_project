Three phenylethanoid glycosides, forsythoside B (1), phlinoside C (2) and verbascoside (3), were isolated from the methanol extract of the leaves of Phlomis lanceolata, an Iranian medicinal plant, by reversed-phase preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the structures of these compounds were elucidated conclusively by ultraviolet (UV), mass spectrometry (MS) and a series of 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. The antibacterial properties of 1-3 against five multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains of Staphylococcus aureus have been assessed by the rapid and robust microtitre-plate-based serial dilution method. While compounds 1 and 3 showed considerable activities against all five strains, compound 2 was inactive at the test concentrations.
