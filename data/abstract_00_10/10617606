We reported that the positive charge of Arg(70) is mandatory for tetracycline transport activity of Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H(+) antiporter (TetA(B)) (Someya, Y., and Yamaguchi, A. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 9385-9391). Arg(70) may function through a charge-pairing with a negatively charged residue in close proximity. Therefore, we mutated Asp(66) and Asp(120), which are only two negatively charged residues located close to Arg(70) in putative secondary structure of TetA(B) and highly conserved throughout transporters of the major facilitator superfamily. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that Asp(66) is essential, but Asp(120) is important for TetA(B) function. Surprisingly, when Asp(120) was replaced by a neutral residue, the R70A mutant recovered tetracycline resistance and transport activity. There was no such effect in the Asp(66) mutation. The charge-exchanged mutant, R70D/D120R, also showed significant drug resistance and transport activity (about 50% of the wild type), although the R70D mutant had absolutely no activity, and the D120R mutant retained very low activity (about 10% of the wild type). Both the R70C and D120C mutants were inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide. Mercuric ion (Hg(2+)), which gives a positive charge to a SH group of a Cys residue through mercaptide formation, had an opposite effect on the R70C and D120C mutants. The activity of the R70C mutant was stimulated by Hg(2+); however, on the contrary, the D120C mutant was partially inhibited. On the other hand, the R70C/D120C double mutant was almost completely inactivated by Hg(2+), probably because the side chains at positions 70 and 120 are bridged with Hg(2+). The close proximity of positions 70 and 120 were confirmed by disulfide cross-linking formation of the R70C/D120C double mutant when it was oxidized by copper-(1,10-phenanthroline). These results indicate that the positive charge of Arg(70) requires the negative charge of Asp(120) for neutralization, probably for properly positioning transmembrane segments in the membrane.
