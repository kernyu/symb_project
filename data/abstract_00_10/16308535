The long-term treatment of herpesvirus infections with current antivirals leads to the development of drug-resistant viruses. Because currently available antivirals finally target the viral DNA polymerase, mutant resistant to one drug often shows cross-resistance to other drugs. This evidence highlights the need for the development of new antivirals that have the different viral targets. Recently, high-through-put screening of large compound collections for inhibiting specific viral enzymes, or in vitro cell culture assay, has identified several new antivirals. These include the inhibitors of helicase/primase complex, terminase complex, portal protein and UL97 protein kinase. This review will focus on these new compounds that directly inhibit viral replication.
