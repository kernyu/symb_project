INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility of the principle anaerobic pathogens involved in dentoalveolar infection, to 13 oral antibiotics, and to assess the value of each antibiotic in the management of the infection. METHODS: A total of 800 isolates from patients with dentoalveolar infection (Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, Porphyromonas species and Peptostreptococcus micros) were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefcapene, cefdinir, erythromycin, azithromycin, telithromycin, minocycline, levofloxacin, clindamycin, and metronidazole using an agar dilution method. RESULTS: Although the majority of Fusobacterium strains were resistant to erythromycin, azithromycin, and telithromycin, the remaining antibiotics demonstrated a high level of antimicrobial activity. P. micros and Porphyromonas species exhibited high susceptibility to all antibiotics tested in this study. In the case of Prevotella species, resistance to amoxicillin occurred in 34% of isolates and all of these resistant strains were found to produce beta-lactamase. Susceptibility of Prevotella strains to cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefcapene, cefdinir, erythromycin, azithromycin, and minocycline was found to correlate with amoxicillin susceptibility. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, telithromycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole exhibited high antimicrobial activity even against amoxicillin-resistant strains of Prevotella species. CONCLUSION: Amoxicillin would still be advocated therefore as being a suitable first-line agent, while reduced susceptibility of Prevotella strains remains a matter of concern with penicillins. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, clindamycin, and metronidazole are useful alternatives in combating the anaerobic bacteria involved in dentoalveolar infection.
