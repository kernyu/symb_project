AIMS: To determine the effects of fresh and freeze-dried extracts of Allium sativum on the physiology and morphology of Candida albicans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhibition of growth in glucose-yeast extract-peptone was measured using a multiwell plate reader. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy investigations indicated loss of structural integrity. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of extracts was employed to separate and quantify putative inhibitory sulphur-containing components. CONCLUSIONS: Fresh garlic extract has a greater efficacy than garlic powder extract as indicated both by its effects on morphology and inhibition of growth. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen C. albicans is sensitive to garlic; resistance to the broad spectrum of active principles present is unlikely so that its anticandidal effects may provide an important alternative route to chemotherapy.
