Breast milk is an important factor in the initiation, development, and composition of the neonatal gut microbiota. In a previous study, the authors isolated lactic acid bacteria from milk of healthy mothers. Since some of the identified isolates belonged to the genus Lactobacillus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the probiotic potential of 2 Lactobacillus gasseri and 1 Lactobacillus fermentum strains. Different assays, including survival to conditions simulating those existing in the gastrointestinal tract, production of antimicrobial compounds, adherence to intestinal cells, production of biogenic amines, degradation of mucin, enzymatic profile, and pattern of antibiotic resistance, were performed. Globally, the results showed that the probiotic potential of lactobacilli isolated from milk of healthy mothers is, at least, similar to that of the strains commonly used in commercial probiotic products. This fact, together with the presence of prebiotic substances, indicates that breast milk is a natural synbiotic food.
