Nosocomial pneumonia is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients. A study was carried out to determine the incidence, common bacterial etiologic agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility, and outcome of such pneumonia in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary care center. In Surgical ICU (SICU) 176 patients required mechanical ventilation for more than 72 hours. A total of 39 (22.1%) of these patients developed nosocomial bacterial pneumonia as determined by microbiological assays. Endotracheal aspirate cultures detected a single bacterial isolate in 22 (56.4%) patients while two and three organisms were isolated from 10 (25.6%) and 7 (17.9%) patients respectively. Fifty three (84.1%) of a total of 63 isolates were Gram negative bacilli. The most frequently encountered pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter species among the Gram negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus among the Gram positives. Resistance of bacterial isolates varied from 24 to 90% against commonly used antibiotics. Amikacin had the best profile, with 14% to 55% resistance against various isolates. Twenty three (59%) of 39 patients with pneumonia expired in the ICU. P. aeruginosa (25.6%) and K. pneunmoniae (17.9%) were the predominant isolates in these patients. Nosocomial pneumonia with high mortality is a frequent occurrence in mechanically ventilated patients in our ICU setting. Gram negative organisms with high levels of antimicrobial resistance are the most common isolates. Regular surveillance and monitoring of changes in antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens and appropriate therapeutic measures are likely to reduce the mortality in these patients.
