We evaluated the antifungal activities of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole in 70 Cryptococcus neoformans strains obtained from cerebrospinal fluid from AIDS patients and 40 C. neoformans strains isolated from the environment. Four clinical isolates were identified as C. neoformans var. gattii. The susceptibility test was done using a broth microdilution method according to NCCLS M27-A2. Range minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for C. neoformans clinical isolates were 0.06-1.0 microg/mL for amphotericin B, 0.125-8 microg/mL for fluconazole, 0.03-0.5 microg/mL for itraconazole and 0.03-0.25 microg/mL for voriconazole. C. neoformans environmental isolates showed range MICs 0.015-0.125 microg/mL, 0.25-2.0 microg/mL, 0.007-0.125 microg/mL and 0.03-0.25 microg/mL for amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole respectively. The MICs results obtained from clinical and environmental isolates showed similar pattern of susceptibility and no resistance has been found in our isolates.
