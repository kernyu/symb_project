HIV-1 non-subtype B viruses are predominant worldwide. At least 9 different HIV-1 group M subtypes and 14 circulating recombinant forms differ from one another by 10-15% in their pol gene, which includes the coding regions for the viral protease and reverse transcriptase (RT), the current targets of antiretroviral drugs. Inter-subtype genotypic diversity includes polymorphism at amino acid residues known to be related to drug resistance in HIV-1 subtype B. Whether polymorphism alters protease and RT function, drug susceptibility, or clinical response to treatment, is unclear. Worldwide dissemination of non-subtype B viruses and increasing availability of antiretroviral drugs in the developing world will expand drug use and the likelihood of drug resistance in non-subtype B viruses. In this review we define and characterize inter-subtype RT and protease polymorphism, and examine the evidence for genotypic and phenotypic differences between HIV-1 subtypes as well as the potential for different clinical responses and evolution of drug resistance among non-B infected individuals.
