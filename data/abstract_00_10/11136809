In a retrospective 10-year analysis of 3,536 patient-unique isolates, Acinetobacter baumannii imipenem susceptibility declined from 98.1 (1990) to 64.1% (2000), and ciprofloxacin susceptibility decreased from 50.5 to 13.1%. Imipenem median zone diameters decreased from 27. 7 (1997) to 18.8 mm (2000). No outbreaks were detected. Two clusters were identified for 41 strains genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, but imipenem resistance was not clonal.
