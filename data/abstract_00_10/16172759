Due to the fact that the number of multiresistant microorganisms which cause cystitis is increasing, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens that cause urinary tract infection in women and determine antimicrobial susceptibility. We analyzed 442 urine samples from June 2002 to August 2003. Identification through biochemical and enzymatic assays, and the antibiogram by Disk diffusion method were performed. Out of these samples, 78 were positive for urinary tract infection (17.6%). Escherichia coli were the microorganisms that most frequently caused infections (67.9%). Gram-negative bacteria exhibited resistance to amoxicillin in 74.6% of the cases. Most were ceftazidime and gentamicin sensitive. Gram-positive bacteria were resistant in 72.7% of the samples to ampicillin, and they were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin and linezolid sensitive. It was concluded that investigation of bacterial resistance is necessary to provide information for new therapeutic options.
