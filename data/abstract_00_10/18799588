We screened a panel of R5X4 and X4 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains for their sensitivities to AMD3100, a small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist that blocks HIV-1 infection via this coreceptor. While no longer under clinical development, AMD3100 is a useful tool with which to probe interactions between the viral envelope (Env) protein and CXCR4 and to identify pathways by which HIV-1 may become resistant to this class of antiviral agents. While infection by most virus strains was completely blocked by AMD3100, we identified several R5X4 and X4 isolates that exhibited plateau effects: as the AMD3100 concentration was increased, virus infection and membrane fusion diminished to variable degrees. Once saturating concentrations of AMD3100 were achieved, further inhibition was not observed, indicating a noncompetitive mode of viral resistance to the drug. The magnitude of the plateau varied depending on the virus isolate, as well as the cell type used, with considerable variation observed when primary human T cells from different human donors were used. Structure-function studies indicated that the V1/V2 region of the R5X4 HIV-1 isolate DH12 was necessary for AMD3100 resistance and could confer this property on two heterologous Env proteins. We conclude that some R5X4 and X4 HIV-1 isolates can utilize the AMD3100-bound conformation of CXCR4, with the efficiency being influenced by both viral and host factors. Baseline resistance to this CXCR4 antagonist could influence the clinical use of such compounds.
