Transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family commands the entire type I interferon (IFN) system from induction of IFNs to diverse IFN responses, thereby providing a principal basis for host resistance against pathogens. However, the family has various additional roles. Regulating the development of the immune system, IRFs shape the establishment and execution of innate and adaptive immunity. IRFs also regulate growth and differentiation of many cell types, thus playing a role in leukemia and other cancers. In addition, evidence indicates that IRFs confer antiviral mechanisms not directly ascribed to the IFN system. This review deals with the diverse roles of IRFs in host defense and discusses the molecular mechanisms by which they regulate target gene transcription.
