The combination of vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotic synergistically is known to act on vancomycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VSSA). But some MRSA with the antagonism in the combination of vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotic was identified in Japan. We called the MRSA "beta-lactam antibiotic-induced vancomycin-resistant MRSA (BIVR)", to distinguish it from hetero-VISA. The percentage of hetero-VISA isolated in Japan that Hiramatsu et al. reported in The Lancet in 1997 was that of "candidate-hetero-VISA" because it did not satisfy the criteria for detection of hetero-VISA that they proposed. Therefore, except for Mu3, a strictly defined hetero-VISA strain has never been detected in Japan. However, BIVR is certainly detectable in Japan. We performed a retrospective study of BIVR in 189 MRSA strains isolated from blood between 1978 and 1999 at the same institution. To performed a retrospective study, 189 MRSA strains were divided such as 1978-1984 (45strains), 1985-1989 (45strains), 1990-1994 (49strains), 1995-1999 (50strains). MIC90 of anti-MRSA drugs according to above chronological transition were 2, 2, 2, 1 as vancomycin, 2, 1, 1, 1 as teicoplanin, and 8, 8, 1, 1 microgram/mL as arbekacin, respectively, and then the detection rate of BIVR was 2.2, 2.2, 6.1, 10.4%, respectively. The BIVR detection rate in MRSA isolated from blood at 14 institutions was 14.8% (12/81) in 1999-2002, and that of non-blood was 4.6% (42/905) (p < 0.001; chi 2-t examination). Of particular importance is that the percentage of BIVR isolated from blood is higher than that from non-blood, and the detection rate of BIVR from blood increases annually.
