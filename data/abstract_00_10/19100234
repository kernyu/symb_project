Chronic hepatitis B virus infection affects approximately 10% of HIV-infected patients. There are an estimated 4 million patients with HIV/HBV coinfection. HIV infection has a deleterious effect on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B and increases the risk of progression to cirrhosis and terminal liver disease. Since the widespread use of highly active antiviral therapy (HAART), liver disease has emerged as one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients. Therefore, all patients with HIV/HBV coinfection should be evaluated for treatment of hepatitis B, independently of the CD4 lymphocyte count. Six drugs are currently authorized for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: standard interferon-alpha (2a and 2b), pegylated interferon alpha-2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine. Other drugs with activity against HBV, such as tenofovir and emtricitabine, are used for the treatment of HIV infection. In patients not requiring HAART, treatment of hepatitis B should preferably consist of drugs without activity against HIV, such as pegylated interferon or adefovir. In contrast, in patients requiring HAART, a combination of drugs with activity against both viruses should be used, such as lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir, with the aim of achieving maximal viral suppression and avoiding the development of resistance. Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection require periodic clinical and virological monitoring. Patients with cirrhosis should undergo ultrasonography and alphafetoprotein determination every 6 months for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
