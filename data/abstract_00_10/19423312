The Herpesviridae includes at least eight viral species pathogenic for humans, responsible for a wide variety of clinical symptoms. The lack of an effective vaccine and the moderate to high toxicity of the available synthetic anti-herpes compounds emphasises the need for new inhibitors. Several Phyllanthus genus (Euphorbiaceae) members have been widely used in traditional medicine and their biological properties have been intensely studied. In this study we investigated the in vitro antiviral activity of the Cuban-endemic plant Phyllanthus orbicularis H.B.K. against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) reference strains and clinical isolates with different sensitivities to acyclovir. The inhibitory activity on Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication was also investigated. The selectivity indexes (SI) found for Ph. orbicularis aqueous extract ranged from 8.7 to 37.6. Studies on the antiviral mechanisms involved revealed that the drug acted at early stages of herpesvirus replication, possibly by producing a virucidal effect, although further inhibition of intracellular replication events could not be ruled out.
