In Candida albicans, calcineurin mediates tolerance to azole antifungal drugs, survival in serum, and virulence. In this study, we examined 24 Candida isolates from liver transplant recipients receiving a calcineurin inhibitor as a component of their immunosuppressive therapy. We were unable to detect a difference in susceptibility to calcineurin inhibitors in combination with fluconazole, serum, or calcium in these isolates.
