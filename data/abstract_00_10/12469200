Angiogenic factors are major causes of tumor progression in hematological malignancies, particularly multiple myeloma, as well as solid tumors. The introduction of thalidomide as an anti-angiogenic agent in myeloma treatment has demonstrated the importance of angiogenic factors in the progression of myeloma. However, the direct effects of angiogenic factors, particularly VEGFs, hypoxia, and thalidomide, on myeloma cells are not been documented. In this study, we demonstrate increased expression and production levels of VEGF in myeloma compared to non-myelomatous hematological lines, resistance to hypoxia and enhancement of VEGF-A production by hypoxia in myeloma, and direct growth inhibition of myeloma cells due to apoptosis and G1 arrest caused by TNFalpha upregulation induced by thalidomide. These findings may encourage the clinical use of anti-angiogenic agents for their cytostatic effects and the prevention of progression.
