In order to explore the clinical significance and risk factors for true bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) other than Staphylococcus epidermidis, a retrospective cohort study of 160 patients with at least one blood culture positive for non- epidermidis CNS was performed. True bacteremia was diagnosed in 32 (20%) of the patients. On multivariate analysis the following factors were associated with true bacteremia: (i) more than one positive blood culture, (ii) presence of a central venous catheter, and (iii) methicillin resistance. The results of this study indicate that non- epidermidis CNS can cause significant bloodstream infections.
