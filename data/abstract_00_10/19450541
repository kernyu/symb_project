Antibiotics acting on bacterial membranes are receiving increasing attention because of widespread resistance to agents acting on other targets and of potentially improved bactericidal effects. Oritavancin is a amphiphilic derivative of vancomycin showing fast and extensive killing activities against multi-resistant (including vancomycin insusceptible) Gram-positive organisms with no marked toxicity towards eukaryotic cells. We have undertaken to characterize the interactions of oritavancin with phospholipid bilayers, using liposomes (LUV) and supported bilayers made of cardiolipin (CL) or phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) and phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), all abundant in Gram-positive organisms. Changes in membrane permeability were followed by the release of calcein entrapped in liposomes at self-quenching concentrations, and changes in nanoscale lipid organization examined by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Oritavancin caused a fast (<5 min) and complete (>95%) release of calcein from CL:POPE liposomes, and a slower but still substantial (50% in 60 min) release from POPG:POPE liposomes, which was (i) concentration-dependent (0-600 nM; [microbiologically meaningful concentrations]); (ii) enhanced by an increase in POPG:POPE ratio, and decreased when replacing POPG by DPPG. AFM of CL:POPE supported bilayers showed that oritavancin (84 nM) caused a remodeling of the lipid domains combined with a redisposition of the drug and degradation of the borders. In all the above studies, vancomycin was without a significant effect at 5.5 microM. Electrostatic interactions, together with lipid curvature, lipid polymorphism as well of fluidity play a critical role for the permeabilization of lipid bilayer and changes in lipid organization induced by oritavancin.
