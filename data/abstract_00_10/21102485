AIM: to investigate the potential effects of chronic ethanol intake on protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) and the insulin receptor signaling pathway in rat skeletal muscle. METHODS: rats received ethanol treatment at a daily dose of 0 (control), 0.5 (group L), 2.5 (group M) or 5 gxkg(-1) (group H) via gastric gavage for 22 weeks. In vivo insulin sensitivity was measured using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Expression of PTP1B in skeletal muscles was examined at both the mRNA (real-time PCR) and protein (Western blot) levels. PTP1B activity was assayed with a p-nitrophenol phosphate (PNPP) hydrolysis method. Changes of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle were analyzed with Western blotting. RESULTS: the activity and expression of PTP1B were dose-dependently elevated 1.6 and 2.0 fold in the skeletal muscle by ethanol, resepctively, at the doses of 2.5 and 5 gxkg(-1)xd(-1). Total IRbeta and IRS-1, as well as their phosphorylated forms, were decreased by ethanol at the two higher doses. Moreover, chronic ethanol consumption resulted in a significant inhibition of the association between IRS-1 and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and reduced levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: chronic ethanol intake at 2.5 and 5 xkg(-1)xd(-1) sufficient doses can down-regulate the expression of IRbeta, P-IRbeta, and IRS-1, as well as the phosphorylated forms of IRS-1 and Akt, in rat skeletal muscle, possibly through increased PTP1B activity.
