Based on the structural information of biomacromolecule-aminoglycoside complexes, a series of kanamycin B analogues were rationally designed and synthesized. A convenient approach to the construction of kanamycin derivatives, in which the C4'-position on ring I of neamine moiety was modified, was developed. Most synthetic analogues exhibited good to excellent antibiotic activity against some typical drug-resistant bacteria. The disclosed results suggested that the C4'-position of aminoglycosides such as kanamycin may be an ideal site for modification to gain new modifying enzyme-resistant aminoglycoside antibiotics.
