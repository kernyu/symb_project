To assess the spread and genetic characteristics of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene-carrying Staphylococcus aureus in Bangladesh, we investigated 59 strains (49 isolates from clinical specimens and 10 isolates colonized in the nasal cavities of medical staff), including 26 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. The PVL gene was detected only in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains (7 clinical strains and 2 colonizing strains). PVL gene-positive MSSA strains were found to belong to coagulase serotypes III or VI and were classified into sequence types ST88 (CC88), ST772, and ST573 (CC1) by multilocus sequence typing, and agr types 2 or 3. These types were different from those determined for MRSA (coagulase serotypes I and IV, ST240 and ST361, and agr type 1). PVL gene-positive MSSA possessed a larger number of virulence factor genes than MRSA, although they were susceptible to more antimicrobials. These findings suggest that the PVL gene is distributed to limited populations of S. aureus clones with specific genetic traits that are distinct from MRSA in Bangladesh, but genetically close to CA-MRSA clones in the CC1 lineage reported in the United States and European countries.
