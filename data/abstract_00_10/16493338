In the absence of prophylaxis, there is an elevated risk of virus recurrence after liver transplantation required because of chronic hepatitis B. Regardless of prophylaxis, the risk of recurrence is associated with pre-graft viral load. Long-term prophylaxis by hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) significantly reduces the risk of recurrence, especially if there was no pre-graft viral replication. Use of antiviral agents such as lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, and entecavir, control HBV replication in patients with decompensation of cirrhosis while awaiting transplantation and in patients with HBV recurrence post-graft. The risk of emergence of resistant strains limits the use of these antiviral agents. The choice of one or several combined antiviral agents depends on their resistance profiles. Combining antiviral agents and HBIG after transplantation can reduce the risk of HBV recurrence to less than 10%, even in patients with viral replication pre-graft. If there was no detectable viral load pre-graft, withdrawal of HBIG should be considered at some point, while continuing an antiviral agent or after anti-HBV vaccination.
