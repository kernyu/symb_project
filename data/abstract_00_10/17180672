The origin of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium) harboring the Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI1), which was detected for the first time in the mid-1980s is unknown. In this study, we performed microarray genomotyping of four multidrug-resistant SGI1 positive strains and found that unlike the S. typhimurium LT2 strain, the multidrug-resistant strains lacked genes STM0517-0529 allowing the utilization of allantoin as a sole nitrogen source. We extended this observation by PCR screening of additional 120 S. typhimurium field strains and found that this locus was absent in all SGI1 positive and also in 24% of SGI1 negative strains, which were proposed to be the original recipients of SGI1. To prove this hypothesis, we compared the STM0517-0529 negative strains (with or without the SGI1) by PFGE and PCR prophage typing and found that 8 out of 11 of the SGI1 negative strains and 17 out of 22 SGI1 positive strains were of identical PFGE pattern and PCR prophage pattern, while this specific pattern was never observed among STM0517-0529 positive strains. We therefore propose that a lineage of the S. typhimurium DT104 sensitive strain first lost the ability to metabolize allantoin and then acquired SGI1.
