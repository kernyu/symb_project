Potent in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been difficult to achieve with previously reported DNA binding antibacterials. Herein, we describe an efficient access to a focused library of new analogues yielding compounds with improved activity in a mouse peritonitis model. The most potent molecules (14 and 19) exhibit efficacy against MRSA at ED50 values of approximately 1 and approximately 5 mg/kg, respectively, and display excellent in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant S. aureus.
