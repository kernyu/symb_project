OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to reduce hybrid layer degradation created with simplified dentine adhesives by using two different methods to condition the dentine surface. METHODS: A smear-layer was created on flat dentine surfaces from extracted human third molars with a 180-grit/SiC-paper. Dentine specimens were conditioned before bonding with the following procedures: 37% H(3)PO(4); H(3)PO(4)/0.5% NaOCl; 0.1M EDTA; 0.1M EDTA/0.5% NaOCl. Two etch-and-rinse adhesives: (Scotchbond 1XT or Optibond Solo Plus) were applied and light-cured. Composite build-ups were constructed. The bonded teeth were sectioned into beams, stored in distilled water (24h) or 12% NaOCl solution (90 min) and finally tested for microtensile bond strengths (microTBS). Additional dentine surfaces were conditioned and bonded as previously described. They were prepared for a pulpal-micropermeability confocal microscopy study and finally observed using confocal microscopy. RESULTS: microTBS results revealed that both adhesives gave high bond strengths to acid-etched dentine before, but not after a 12% NaOCl challenge. Bonds made to acid-etched or EDTA-treated dentine plus dilute NaOCl, gave high microTBS that resisted 12% NaOCl treatment, as did EDTA-treated dentine alone. A confocal micropermeability investigation showed very high micropermeability within interfaces of the H(3)PO(4), etched specimens. The lowest micropermeability was observed in H(3)PO(4)+0.5% NaOCl and 0.1M EDTA groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of dilute NaOCl (0.5%) after acid-etching, or the conditioning of dentine smear layers with 0.1M EDTA (pH 7.4) produced less porous resin-dentine interfaces. These dentine-conditioning procedures improve the resistance of the resin-dentine bond sites to chemical degradation (12% NaOCl) and may result in more durable resin-dentine bonds.
