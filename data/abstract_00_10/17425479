Tipranavir (TPV) is a novel non-peptidic protease inhibitor (PI). It binds strongly and selectively to the HIV-1 protease, is orally administered twice daily, boosted with low doses of ritonavir, and shows a favourable resistance profile. In the two registrational trials, named RESIST 1 and 2, TPV/ritonavir 500/200 mg b.i.d., along with an optimised antiretroviral backbone, provided better virologic responses than controls receiving standard of care ritonavir-boosted PI-based regimens. A total of 21 mutations at 16 protease codons have been shown to impact on TPV susceptibility and response rates. The TPV mutation score includes L10V, I13V, K20M/R/V, L33F, E35G, M36I, K43T, M46L, I47V, I54A/M/V, Q58E, H69K, T74P, V82L/T, N83D and I84V. Viruses containing eight or more of these mutations are generally resistant to the drug. TPV use is associated with an excess of grade 3/4 liver enzyme elevations compared with other ritonavir-boosted PIs, and the potential for drug-drug interactions is relevant and must be considered when prescribing TPV.
