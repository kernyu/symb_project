Mutation in any of five key amino acid residues (at positions 26, 27, 30, 31 and 34) within the M2 protein of influenza A viruses leads to resistance against the amantodine class of anti-influenza drugs. In this study, a pyrosequencing method was described to rapidly detect established five molecular markers of resistance to M2 blockers, amantadine. The residues L26, V27, A30, S31 and G34 in the M2 protein were targeted for pyrosequencing, and 94 avian influenza viruses were used to perform the amantadine resistance analysis. Our results showed that most of avian influenza viruses were amantadine resistant, Mutations V27I and S31N were founded in these isolates.
