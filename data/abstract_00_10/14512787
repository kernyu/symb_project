Malignant melanoma cells have been reported to be highly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapeutic drug resistance, we examined the role of the Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bax in cell death in the melanoma cell line G361 following stimulation with cisplatin (CDDP) or dacarbazine (DTIC). Trypan blue dye exclusion showed that both CDDP and DTIC induced death of G361 cells. Apoptotic and necrotic cell death could be distinguished by flow cytometry using combined staining with annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD). CDDP-induced cell death at a low concentration (0.6 micro g/ml) was mainly due to apoptosis (annexin V+/7-AAD-), while a mixture of apoptosis and secondary necrosis (annexin V+/7-AAD+) was found at a high concentration (6 micro g/ml). DTIC at the concentrations used induced only apoptosis. CDDP-induced apoptosis and secondary necrosis were accompanied by activation of caspase-3 and modulation of Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bax. On Western blotting Bax was seen to be upregulated with concomitant downregulation of Bcl-2. Flow cytometry, which enables measurement of protein at the single-cell level, revealed that Bcl-2+/Bax- cells were decreased, with a slight concomitant rise in Bcl-2-/Bax+ cells on stimulation with CDDP. These findings suggest that the chemotherapeutic agents CDDP and DTIC induce apoptosis and/or secondary necrosis depending on dose, probably involving the modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins.
