OBJECTIVES: The introduction of non-medical prescribing in the UK has provided opportunities and challenges for pharmacists to help ensure prudent use of antimicrobials. The objective of this research was to explore pharmacists' perceptions of the feasibility and value of pharmacist prescribing of antimicrobials in secondary care in Scotland. METHODS: Pharmacists' perceptions were explored using focus groups in five Scottish regions representing (a) urban and rural areas and (b) district general hospitals and large teaching centres. Senior hospital pharmacists, both prescribers and non-prescribers, working in specialities where antimicrobials are crucial to patient management, were invited to participate. A topic guide was developed to lead the discussions, which were audio-recorded and transcribed. The framework approach to data analysis was used. KEY FINDINGS: Six focus groups took place and some emerging themes and issues are presented. Pharmacists believed that the feasibility of antimicrobial prescribing is dependent upon the patient's clinical condition and the area of clinical care. They identified potential roles and opportunities for pharmacist prescribing of antimicrobials. Perceived benefits included giving patients quicker access to medicines, reducing risk of resistance and better application of evidence-based medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists feel they have a good knowledge base to prescribe and manage antimicrobial treatment, identifying possible opportunities for intervention. Roles within a multidisciplinary antimicrobial team need to be clearly defined.
