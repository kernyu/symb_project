Resistance to ciprofloxacin has generally remained low in the UK. A low rate of resistance development in vitro has been suggested for the newer fluoroquinolones such as grepafloxacin and trovafloxacin. Levofloxacin is likely to have a pattern of development of resistance similar to that of ofloxacin. Resistance problems with ofloxacin are being reported in the USA, but it is unclear whether similar problems will arise with levofloxacin. Restrained quinolone use, surveillance of pathogen susceptibility and control of cross-infection with resistant clones remain important strategies for managing fluoroquinolone resistance.
