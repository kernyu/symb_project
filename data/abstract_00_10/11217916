A set of 18 structurally diverse antifolates including pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, methotrexate, aminopterin and trimethoprim, and 13 pyrrolo[2,3-d pyrimidines were studied using four-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (4D-QSAR) analysis. The corresponding biological activities of these compounds include IC50 inhibition constants for both the wild type, and a specific mutant type of Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Two thousand conformations of each analog were sampled to generate a conformational ensemble profile (CEP) from a molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) of 100,000 conformer trajectory states. Each sampled conformation was placed in a 1 A cubic grid cell lattice for each of five trial alignments. The frequency of occupation of each grid cell was computed for each of six types of pharmacophore groups of atoms of each compound. These grid cell occupancy descriptors (GCODs) were then used as a descriptor pool to construct 4D-QSAR models. Models for inhibition of both the 'wild' type and the mutant enzyme were generated which provide detailed spatial pharmacophore requirements for inhibition in terms of atom types and their corresponding relative locations in space. The 4D-QSAR models indicate some structural features perhaps relevant to the mechanism of resistance of the Plasmodium falciparum DHFR to current antimalarials. One feature identified is a slightly different binding alignment of the ligands to the mutant form of the enzyme as compared to the wild type.
