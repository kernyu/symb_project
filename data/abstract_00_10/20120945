Influenza, especially pandemic influenza, poses great threat to health and humans life of. Due to the antigenic drift and shift of the influenza virus, there is a constant requirement to accurately adjust contents of the vaccine to current subtype of the virus. As there is always a long period of time between the moment of detection of a new kind of influenza virus till a new vaccine is produced, the only protection for the people are antiviral drugs. Some examples of antiviral compounds that can be used in treatment in near future have been presented. A review of the researches on the substances that are active against influenza viruses has been carried out and their mechanism of action was described. We have taken into account the chemical compounds that seem to be active in the process of virus adsorption; hemagglutinin and neuraminidase inhibitors; M2 ion channel blockers; polymerase, endonuclease, transcriptase, proteine kinase and signaling cascade inhibitors. The potential of oligonucleotide antiviral therapeutics and the substances that are extracted from different plants were presented. The future direction of research were shown.
