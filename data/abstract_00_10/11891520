Respiratory tract infections are one of the most common problems prompting visits to the emergency department. Although many are the result of self-limited viral illnesses, these infections may result in substantial morbidity and, rarely, mortality. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment can reduce morbidity and largely prevent mortality. Careful selection of antimicrobial agents is essential to maximize benefit and prevent overuse, which contributes to the emergence of antibiotic resistance.
