BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance of Helicobacter pylori is the main reason for eradication failure. We have studied the feasibility of a commercial transport medium for cultural recovery and subsequent drug susceptibility testing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March to December 2000, 79 consecutive gastric biopsies, positive in a rapid urease test, were transferred into a commercial transport medium and sent within 24 hours from the district hospital to the microbiological laboratory for culture and susceptibility testing. A commercial agar plate and an in-house Wilkins-Chalgren agar plate were used for culture. Susceptibility data were compared with data collected from 1992 to 2003 in the University Hospital of Zurich. RESULTS: Cultural recovery and susceptibility testing of H. pylori was successful in 55 of 79 patients. In 17 cases cultural recovery failed because of technical problems (n = 14), long transport time (n = 1) and unknown reason (n = 2). Failure of susceptibility testing (n = 7) was mainly due to fungal overgrowth. Resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin was found in 15 (27%) and in 12 patients (22%), respectively; resistance to amoxicillin was not observed. Five patients (9%) showed resistance both to metronidazole and to clarithromycin. Eradication therapy failed in all patients with macrolide resistance. Resistance rates were higher in females than in males; 30% vs 12% for clarithromycin and 33% vs 20% for metronidazole. Resistance to metronidazole was significantly lower in Swiss patients (15%) than in non-Swiss patients (39%). CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance data can reliably be obtained by sending the biopsy specimen in a commercial transport medium to a microbiological laboratory. This is especially important after eradication failure. Resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin is highly prevalent and more common in women and non-Swiss patients.
