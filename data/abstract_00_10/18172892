BACKGROUND: Glyphosate tolerance is a dominant trait in modern biotech crops. RESULTS: A gene encoding a glyphosate-tolerant EPSP synthase (aroA(1398)) from bacterial strain ATX1398 was cloned and characterized. The protein is initiated at a GTG translational start codon to produce a protein that provides robust glyphosate resistance in Escherichia coli (Mig) Cast & Chalm. The aroA(1398) protein was expressed and purified from E. coli, and key kinetic values were determined (K(i) = 161 microM; K(m)(PEP) = 11.3 microM; k(cat) = 28.3 s(-1)). The full-length enzyme is 800-fold more resistant to glyphosate than the maize EPSP synthase while retaining high affinity for the substrate phosphoenol pyruvate. To evaluate further the potential of aroA(1398), transgenic maize events expressing the aroA(1398) protein were generated. T(0) plants were screened for tolerance to glyphosate sprays at 1.3x commercial spray rates, and T(1) plants were selected that completely resisted glyphosate sprays at 1x, 2x and 4x recommended spray rates in field trials. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that aroA(1398) is a suitable candidate for conferring glyphosate tolerance in transgenic crop plants.
