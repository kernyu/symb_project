Development of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of exposure of microorganisms to antimicrobial agents. Although emergence of resistance cannot be prevented, it can be retarded by minimizing use of antimicrobial agents and avoiding selection of relatively resistant pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains caused by exposure to tissue concentrations that confer a competitive advantage. Most attention in veterinary medicine has focused on the emergence of resistance in food-borne pathogens, with relatively little attention being devoted to small companion animals, despite the frequent use of antimicrobial agents in these animals, evidence that resistance is emerging, and potential for transfer of resistance between companion animals and people. To retard further emergence of resistance in small companion animals, it is imperative that surveillance programs be instituted to monitor development of resistance.
