The MIC of vancomycin was determined for all S. aureus strains isolated during 1997 in one hospital. MIC values for most isolates were in the range of 0.5-2 mg/l. In 18 strains, MIC was = 6 mg/L. All these strains were MRSA. Recently described VISA strains possessed MIC values for vancomycin equal or higher than 8 mg/l and such strains were not detected in the investigated group. Although strains with MIC = 6 mg/l are not VISA, but they are candidate for reduced vancomycin susceptibility, e.g. during therapy in compromised patients. Analysis of DNA of these strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that 15 of them shared a significant similarity, allowing to place them in the same group. The comparison data of phage patterns as well as antibiotic resistance patterns strongly suggest that all these strains were derivatives of a single clone.
