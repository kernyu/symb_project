Sinus infections, often viral, are a common reason for physician visits. The multiplicity of clinical presentations makes its diagnosis difficult. The problem is to recognize bacterial infection without additional testing, except in cases of treatment failures, complications or relapse. Patients with signs suggestive of rhinosinusitis fall into one of four basic clinical situations: common colds, 'doubtful' rhinosinusitis, apparent acute maxillary bacterial rhinosinusitis, and complications. Anterior rhinoscopy may help confirm diagnosis. Current bacterial epidemiology is based on the results of clinical studies, microbial ecology, and samples taken in cases of treatment failure. The two bacteria isolated most frequently are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, both of which pose resistance problems. Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are isolated less often. The dominant issue in management of acute rhinosinusitis is whether to use antibiotic or symptomatic treatment. For viral infections, antibiotic therapy is useless and highly inadvisable. For 'doubtful' infections, symptomatic treatment is likely to lead to recovery. The use of non-recommended antibiotics also increases the risk of selection of resistant bacteria. When bacterial rhinosinusitis is strongly suspected, recourse to antibiotic treatment is recommended in view of the benefits in this situation (AFSSAPS 2005). This treatment is probabilistic, should be decided at the end of the consultation, and follows the AFSSAPS guidelines.
