Community-acquired bacterial meningitis are due, in most of the cases, to S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. These two pathogenes are concerned by antibiotic resistance phenomenons. S. pneumoniae is developing resistance in some countries, including France. The recommended empirical treatment is nowadays a third-generation cephalosporin, combined with vancomycin if there is a risk of Penicillin resistant pneumococcus. Non-antibiotic drugs are now validated and very useful adjunctive treatment.
