BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation, is emerging as a potential adjunct in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. By potentiating the activity of abacavir, MMF may improve antiviral efficacy. However, it may also lead to myelosuppression, such as was seen in patients taking hydroxyurea-containing regimens. PURPOSE: To assess the safety of MMF as adjunctive therapy for HIV infection. METHOD: Eighteen HIV-positive outpatients, given MMF (500 mg po bid) on a compassionate basis as part of their salvage therapy, were monitored for adverse effects. RESULTS: Five patients discontinued MMF between 26-68 days of follow-up due to adverse effects likely related to other factors. Among the remaining 13 patients, no new clinically significant cytopenias occurred over 107-154 days of follow-up. Three patients exhibited decreases in CD4 counts, despite decreases in plasma HIV-1 RNA. CONCLUSION: Short-term follow-up suggests that MMF (500 mg po bid) does not cause lymphocyte suppression. However, further studies are ongoing to determine its safety and efficacy profile in HIV infection.
