The multicopy var gene family encoding the variant surface antigen Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 is highly diverse, with little overlap between different P. falciparum isolates. We report 5 var genes (varS1-varS5) that are shared at relatively high frequency among 63 genetically diverse P. falciparum isolates collected from 5 islands in the West Pacific region. The varS1, varS2, and varS3 genes were localized to the internal region on chromosome 4, approximately 200 kb from pfdhfr-ts, whereas varS4 and varS5 were mapped to an internal region of chromosome 7, within 100 kb of pfcrt. The presence of varS2 and varS3 were significantly correlated with the pyrimethamine-resistant pfdhfr genotype, whereas varS4 was strongly correlated with the chloroquine-resistant pfcrt genotype. Thus, the conservation of these var genes is the result of their physical linkage with drug-resistant genes in combination with the antimalarial drug pressure in the region.
