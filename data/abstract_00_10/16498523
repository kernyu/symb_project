The aim of the present study was to determine the serotype distribution and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance among Salmonella enterica strains isolated from patients with diarrhea in Crete, Greece, during a 5-year period (2000-2004). Among the 401 S. enterica isolates recovered, serotype Enteritidis was the most prevalent (66.6%), followed by serotype Typhimurium (14.2%). The rates of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were 8.5, 7, 0.7, 5.4, 14.2, 2.7 and 2.7%, respectively. A marked decrease in resistance was observed during the study period. Resistance and multidrug resistance was most common in serotype Typhimurium. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production observed in one strain of S. enterica serotype Virchow and the reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility detected in 2.7% of the isolates studied are causes of concern.
