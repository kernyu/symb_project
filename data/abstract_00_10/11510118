The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 499 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 31.3% and Gram-negative bacteria as 68.7%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. The increase of low-susceptible strains which was noticed in the former year showed a slight recovery in this year. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was also strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA. However, MSSA and MRSA showing low susceptibilities were detected in one strain each (MIC: 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively). Carbapenems showed high activities against Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. Meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Quinolone resistant E. coli decreased in this year compared with those in the last year, that percentage was less than 5%. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. MEPM and carumonam (CRMN) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. On the other hand, one strain of K. pneumoniae showing resistance to cefaclor (CCL) and one strain of P. mirabilis showing low susceptibility to most of cephems were detected. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90s of carbapenems were 8 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 16 micrograms/ml.
