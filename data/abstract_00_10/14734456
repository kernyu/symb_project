PURPOSE: Increased bone marrow angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are of adverse prognostic significance in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). VEGF, a soluble circulating angiogenic molecule, acts via receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGF receptor 2. SU5416 is a small molecule VEGF receptor 2 inhibitor. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Adult patients with advanced MM were entered on a multicenter phase II study. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (median age 69, range 39-79), median 4 (0-10) lines of prior therapy, 14 with prior thalidomide therapy, received SU5416 at 145 mg/m(2) twice weekly i.v. for a median of two 4-week cycles (range 0.2-9). Grade 3/4 toxicities were rarely observed; the most frequent was thrombocytopenia (12%). Mild-to-moderate toxicities included nausea (63%), headache (56%), diarrhea, vomiting (both 37%), and fatigue (33%). There were three thromboembolic episodes and five cases of new onset hypertension. Two (7%) patients did not complete the first 4-week cycle of therapy because of adverse events (pneumonia and headache). There were no objective responses. Four patients had disease stabilization for >/==" BORDER="0">4 months. A decrease in median VEGF plasma levels was observed in patients with stable disease (n = 7) compared with patients with progressive disease (n = 5). Overall median survival was 42 weeks (range 3-92+). CONCLUSIONS: Although SU5416 had minimal clinical activity, signs of biological activity (decrease in plasma VEGF levels) suggest that angiogenic modulation may be of value in patients with MM.
