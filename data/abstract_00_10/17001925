We studied the aerobic bacterial isolates from bile and their susceptibilty pattern in patients with biliary tract disease. Samples of bile collected during endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) and surgery, were inoculated on standard media. Bacterial identification and susceptibility were done by standard techniques. A total of 209 samples were cultured, out of which 128 samples showed growth. Total number of isolates obtained was 221. Poly-microbial infection was detected in 67 patients. Predominant aerobic bacterial isolates obtained were Escherichia coli 30% (67), Klebsiella species 23.98% (53), Enterococcus species 12.21% (27). Multi-drug resistance was noted in 57%. Higher resistance rate was noted among Gram negative bacilli for ampicillin (92.4%), cephalexin (82.46%), ciprofloxacin (68.42%), piperacillin (64.33%). Sensitivity to meropenem was 90.64% and amikacin was 76.61%. Gram positive bacteria showed high resistance to gentamicin (39.53%). Sensitivity to ampicillin was 86.05% and penicillin was 81.4%. Vancomycin and teicoplanin showed 100% sensitivity. From our study we conclude that E. coli, Klebsiella species and Enterococcus species are common pathogens infecting biliary tract. Poly-microbial infection and multi-drug resistance warrants culture and sensitivity to guide antimicrobial therapy. We recommend combination of amikacin and ampicillin for empirical therapy at our institution.
