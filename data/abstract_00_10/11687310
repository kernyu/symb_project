Fluconazole susceptibility was tested in 385 clinical yeast isolates (285 Candida albicans, 38 C. glabrata, 31 C. tropicalis, 31 other Candida subsp.) using the agar disk diffusion test. Yeasts were collected from specimens obtained from outpatients (69) and inpatients (intensive care unit: 79 isolates, major burn unit: 31 isolates, hematology ward: 45 isolates, gynecology ward: 67 isolates, other wards: 94 isolates). Three hundred and fifty-six (92%) yeast isolates showed to be susceptible, 18 (5%) were susceptible dose-dependent, and 10 (3%) were resistant to fluconazole. Of the resistant group, 3 isolates were C.albicans, while seven were Candida non-albicans (2 C. rugosa, 2 C. humicola, 1 C. tropicalis, 1 C. ciferrii, 1 C. glabrata). The disk-diffusion method was easy to perform and there were no difficulties in the interpretation of inhibition zone diameters. Fluconazole maintained a good activity against Candida spp despite its extensive use for the prophylaxis and treatment of fungal infections.
