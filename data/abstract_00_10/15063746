SelS is a newly identified selenoprotein and its gene expression is up-regulated in the liver of Psammomys obesus after fasting. We have examined whether SelS is regulated by glucose deprivation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in HepG2 cells. Glucose deprivation and the ER stress inducers tunicamycin and thapsigargin increased SelS gene expression and protein content several-fold in parallel with glucose-regulated protein 78. The overexpression of SelS increased Min6 cell resistance to oxidative stress-induced toxicity. These results indicate that SelS is a novel member of the glucose-regulated protein family and its function is related to the regulation of cellular redox balance.
