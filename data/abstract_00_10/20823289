A multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate recovered in Australia produced a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. Molecular investigations revealed the first identification of the bla(NDM-1) metallo-beta-lactamase gene in that country. In addition, this E. coli isolate expressed the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase CTX-M-15, together with two 16S rRNA methylases, namely, ArmA and RmtB, conferring a high level of resistance to aminoglycosides.
