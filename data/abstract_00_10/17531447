Third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) antimicrobials are the drugs of choice for treatment of salmonellosis in children. Salmonella isolated in the USA are assayed by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) for resistance to antimicrobials including first-, second- and third-generation cephalosporins. From 1999 to 2003, 34,411 Salmonella were isolated from animals in the USA, of which 10.9% were found to be resistant to ceftiofur, a 3GC used in animals, whilst only 0.3% were resistant to ceftriaxone, a 3GC used in human medicine. Ceftiofur resistance rose from 4.0% in 1999 to 18.8% in 2003. Isolates from diagnostic laboratories had higher levels of resistance (18.5%), whereas levels in isolates from on-farm (3.4%) and slaughter (7.1%) sources were lower. Animals with a higher than average proportion of resistant Salmonella included cattle (17.6%), horses (19.2%) and dogs (20.8%). Levels in turkeys (6.8%), chickens (7.1%), eggs (3.6%) and swine (4.6%) were lower. Resistance varied between Salmonella serotypes. A few serotypes had significantly high levels, e.g. S. Newport was 70.4% ceftiofur resistant. Resistance was predominantly associated with bla(CMY-2)-encoding plasmids. These data suggest that the acquisition of resistance plasmids and the spread of specific serotypes harbouring these plasmids are driving the observed resistance to ceftiofur in Salmonella animal isolates.
