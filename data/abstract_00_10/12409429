A comparison of antimicrobial susceptibility data of species of the Bacteroides fragilis group for 1989-1990 and 1998-1999 studies showed statistically significant increases or decreases in in vitro activity. Overall significant increases in resistance were noted for ampicillin-sulbactam and clindamycin, while significant decreases in resistance were noted for ertapenem and cefoxitin. Susceptibilities to piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, and trovafloxacin remained virtually the same for the two studies. Importantly, a change in the rates of isolation of the various species showed the B. fragilis species comprised 58% of the isolates in 1989 to 1990 and 45% of the isolates in 1998 to 1999. This change in rates of isolation of B. fragilis versus non-B. fragilis species had an overall effect on susceptibility data.
