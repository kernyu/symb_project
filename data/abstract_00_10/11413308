Mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase and protease that confer resistance to antiretroviral agents are usually accompanied by a reduction in the viral replicative capacity under drug-free conditions. Consequently, when antiretroviral treatment is interrupted in HIV-1-infected patients harboring drug-resistant virus, resistant quasi-species appear to be most often replaced within several weeks by wild-type virus. Using a real-time PCR-based technique for the selective quantification of resistant viral sequences in plasma, we have studied the kinetics of the switch from mutant to wild-type virus and evaluated the extent to which minority populations of resistant viruses not detected by genotyping persist in these individuals. Among 12 patients with viruses expressing the V82A or L90M resistance mutation who had undergone a 3-month interruption of therapy and for whom conventional genotyping had revealed an apparent total reconversion to wild-type virus, minority populations expressing these mutations, representing 0.1 to 21% of total virus, were still detectable in 9 cases. Kinetic studies demonstrated that viruses expressing resistance mutations could be detected for >5 months after the discontinuation of treatment in some patients. Most of the minority resistant genomes detected more than 3 months after the interruption of therapy carried only part of the mutations present in the resistant viruses prior to treatment interruption and appeared to result from the emergence of existing strains selected at earlier stages in the development of drug resistance. Thus, following the interruption of treatment, viral populations containing resistance mutations can persist for several months after the time when conventional genotyping techniques detect only wild-type virus. These populations include viral strains with only some of the resistance mutations initially present, strains that presumably express better fitness under drug-free conditions.
