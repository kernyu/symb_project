The discovery of CCR5 as a HIV-1 co-receptor unfolded the cryptic and complicated process of HIV-1 cellular entry and has provided more than a few entry steps as possible modalities for effective viral intervention. The proof-of-principle has already been established for the use of entry inhibitors against HIV-1 and there is a cautious optimism that several CCR5 inhibitors might soon be added to our armamentarium for therapy of HIV-1 infection.
