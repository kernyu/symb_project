This study characterized HIV-1 among antiretroviral-naive populations presenting recent infection (RI) or long-standing infection (LSI). Sera collected from January 1999 to December 2001 at an anonymous HIV testing site in Santos, Brazil, were submitted to serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion (STARHS). The STARHS methodology uses a combination of a sensitive and a less sensitive version of an anti-HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and specimens found to be positive on the sensitive EIA and negative on the less sensitive EIA are considered to represent RI. HIV-1 V3 and pol regions of those with RI and LSI were compared. Antiretroviral resistance was defined solely by genotypic analysis. Ninety samples were evaluated representing those taken from an original cohort of 345 individuals, for whom adequate samples were available. Of 90 HIV-positive individuals, 25 presented RI. Cumulatively, 36.8% of those with RI and 25% of those with LSI presented resistance to at least one antiretroviral class. In the pol and V3 regions, 47% and 53% of those with RI presented clade B viruses and B/F recombinant viruses, respectively, whereas 56.2%, 41.7%, and 2.1% of those with LSI harbored clades B, B/F, and clade C viruses, respectively. Primary resistance and the prevalence of B/F recombinants was high in this population. Monitoring HIV-1 genetic diversity is important for developing vaccines and treatment strategies.
