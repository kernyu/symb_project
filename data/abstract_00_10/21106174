In the European Union, antimicrobials are administered to animals as veterinary drugs. Monitoring of antimicrobial resistance of zoonotic and indicator bacteria were implemented at the European level during the last decade. This methodology can be applied for emerging bacteria observed at a national level to provide data for a risk characterization towards a risk analysis. Tools for monitoring antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine are developed and need to be harmonized at the European level. Development of antimicrobial resistance for veterinary pathogens must be managed to maintain their efficacy in animal health. Engagement of veterinarians and professionals of animal production is on going to preserve efficacy of antimicrobials in human and animal medicine.
