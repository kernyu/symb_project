PURPOSE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of long-term posaconazole in HIV-infected patients with azole-refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis and/or esophageal candidiasis. METHOD: In this noncomparative, open-label study, participants received oral posaconazole 400 mg twice daily (bid) for 3 months. Enrolled patients (N = 100) included 60 from a previous 1-month acute study of posaconazole and 40 posaconazole-naive participants. Participants with a clinical response could be followed untreated for up to 1 month afterwards. Participants who relapsed during follow-up, showed improvement at the end of 3 months of treatment (EOT), or were cured but likely to benefit from further therapy could continue on posaconazole 400 mg bid for up to 12 months. RESULTS: In the modified intent-to-treat population, clinical response (cure or improvement) occurred in 85.6% (77/90) at EOT. The results were similar in the previously treated participants and the posaconazole-naive participants, 88.1% (52/59) and 80.6% (25/31), respectively. Posaconazole was well-tolerated, showing a similar safety profile during the 3-month study period and during suppressive therapy. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event was vomiting (4/100, 4%) during the early follow-up period (on or before day 105) and elevated hepatic enzymes (3/51, 6%) during the long-term follow-up (after day 105). CONCLUSION: Oral posaconazole 400 mg bid demonstrated long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy, offering a long-term, suppressive treatment option for HIV-infected participants with azole-refractory mucosal candidiasis.
