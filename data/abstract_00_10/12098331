A facile synthesis of 7-alkylamino- and 7-cycloalkylaminotetracycline derivatives has been accomplished using an in situ generated aminostannane precursor. This procedure is advantageous in that it allows the concise synthesis of a number of unreported tetracycline derivatives that are cumbersome to prepare through traditional methods. These compounds are crucial to understanding structure activity relationships in the D-ring of tetracycline-type antibiotics and the acquired efflux resistance mechanism to this class of antibiotics.
