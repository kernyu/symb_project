Juvenile triclabendazole-resistant liver flukes, Fasciola hepatica, were incubated in vitro with 10 microg/ml of the sulphoxide metabolite of the experimental fasciolicide, compound alpha [5-chloro-2-methylthio-6-(1-naphthyloxy)-1H-benzimidazole], for 6 and 18 h. Following treatment, the specimens were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and tubulin immunocytochemistry. The SEM results revealed a posterior-directed disruption comprised predominantly of swelling and blebbing of the tegument; these changes were more severe and extensive after the longer 18-h incubation. Along with swelling of the tegument and blebbing, the TEM results also revealed swelling of the mitochondria and basal infolds. A decrease in the number of both T1 and T2 secretory bodies was observed in the syncytium and cytoplasmic connections after the 18-h treatment. The circular muscle bundles were also disrupted, in that the organisation of the muscle fibres was irregular and the total number of muscle fibres was reduced. The immunocytochemical studies revealed no significant disruption to the distribution of tubulin immunoreactivity within the tegumental syncytium, the cytoplasmic connections or the associated tegumental cells. The results indicate that alpha.SO is capable of disrupting the tegument of 4-week-old triclabendazole-resistant liver flukes, though the morphological changes were not associated with any significant differences in tubulin immunostaining.
