The copper resistance determinant copARZ, which encodes a CPx-type copper ATPase efflux protein, a transcriptional regulator, and a putative intracellular copper chaperone, was functionally characterized for the phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. These genes are transcribed as an operon, and their expression is induced in response to increasing copper and silver ion concentrations in a copR-dependent fashion. Analysis of the copARZ promoter revealed a putative CopR binding box located within the spacer of the -35 and -10 promoter motifs. In vitro, purified CopR could specifically bind to the box. The inactivation of the copARZ operon or copZ reduces the level of resistance to copper but not to other metal ions. Also, the copARZ operon mutant shows increased sensitivity to the superoxide generators menadione and plumbagin. In addition, the loss of functional copZ does not affect the ability of copper ions to induce the copARZ promoter, indicating that CopZ is not involved in the copper-sensing mechanism of CopR. Altogether, the results demonstrate a crucial role for the copARZ operon as a component of the copper resistance machinery in A. tumefaciens.
