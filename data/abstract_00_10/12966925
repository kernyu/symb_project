The plasmid composition of the Plectonema boryanum Gom. Cyanobacterium, strain CALU 465, was analyzed. A small pSM1 plasmid, size 1.5, was chosen for genetic engineering. The physical map, constructed for the plasmid, was used to create the pSTS series, i.e. vector construction for the P. boryanum cyanobacterium. A method was selected and tested for the introduction of the vector into host cells. The needed orientation of pSM1 cyanobacterium plasmid within the vector as well as a possible role of its separate elements in inheriting the construction by host were defined.
