The aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility of 976 bacterial isolates from nosocomial infections to cefepime and 9 other antibiotics used in the treatment of hospitalised patients. Bacterial strains were mainly derived from wound and soft tissue infections, sputum, abscesses and blood. The most prevalent etiologic agents were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), Escherichia coli (13.8%), Staphyloccocus aureus (9.7%, Acinetobacter baumannii (9.12%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.38%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%). The most susceptible to cefepime were strains of K. pneumoniae (98.62%), E. coli (98.52%) and E. cloacae (98.19%) including those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. The degree of susceptibility to cefepime was equal to that of imipenem. A. baumannii was the least susceptible species (67.42%). This study indicate that cefepime may play an important role in therapy of nosocomial infections in particular caused by Enterobacteriace.
