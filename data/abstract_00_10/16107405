The objectives of this study were to determine antimicrobial resistance patterns of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from bovine clinical mastitis cases and to subtype the strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique based on coagulase gene polymorphism. Two hundred sixty-five S. aureus isolates collected from individual animals in different herds (n = 235) from 1995 to 2004 were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, oxacillin, oxytetracycline, enrofloxacin, kanamycin-cephalexin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole using the agar disc diffusion test. Strains were also tested for beta-lactamase production. A total of 29.8% of the strains were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. The highest resistance was observed in 63.3% of the strains against beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin and ampicillin. Oxytetracycline resistance was observed in 27.9% of the strains, either alone or in combination with beta-lactams. No resistance was detected for amoxicillin-clavulanate, oxacillin, enrofloxacin and kanamycin-cephalexin. beta-Lactamase production and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics were usually correlated. Resistance against beta-lactams increased from 43.5% in 1995 to 58 to 77% from 1999 to 2004. One hundred twenty-five strains were examined for coagulase gene polymorphism. The isolates were subtyped into 4 types by coagulase gene-based PCR. A predominant 1000-bp PCR product was observed in 60.8% of the isolates typed. The results indicate that a few coagulase gene types of S. aureus are responsible for the majority of bovine clinical mastitis cases in one province of Central Anatolia region, Turkey.
