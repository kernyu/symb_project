There is an urgent need for fresh approaches to the treatment of bacterial infections because of the changing patterns of infectious disease and the emergence of bacterial strains resistant to current antibiotics. Modification of the cell phenotype to sensitize bacteria to components of the hosts' immune system or to previously ineffective antibiotics could prevent the emergence of the resistant genotype. In addition, the use of light-activated antibacterial agents and lytic bacteriophage specific for key pathogens should be considered as safe and inexpensive alternatives to conventional treatment regimens for certain non-systemic infections.
