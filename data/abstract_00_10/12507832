Using the chequerboard titration method, the activity in combination of beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was investigated against 24 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates resistant to these antibiotics. Synergy was detected with one or more antimicrobial combinations against 15 of 24 (63%) isolates and partial synergy was detected with one or more combinations against all 24 isolates. No antagonism was seen with any combination. Ceftazidime and cefepime with aztreonam, amikacin and isepamicin showed synergy or partial synergy against 12-20 (50-80%) isolates. Imipenem and meropenem with amikacin and isepamicin showed synergy or partial synergy against eight to 12 (33-50%) isolates. The results of this study indicate that against P. aeruginosa, synergy may occur between beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides although the strains are resistant to the individual antibiotics.
