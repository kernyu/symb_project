Bacterial resistance to established classes of antibiotics in clinical use is continuing to increase, making the need for new agents that can be used to treat the newly multi-drug resistant organisms steadily more urgent. Cephalosporins have been a successful group of antibiotics since they were first introduced to combat drug-resistant organisms, including staphylococci. The history of cephalosporins has emphasised an improvement of their stability towards beta-lactamases, thus expanding their spectrum of activity against important Gram-negative pathogens. New cephalosporins that have potent activity against multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant pneumococci have recently entered clinical development. At least two of these, BAL-5788 and S-3578, also have Gram-negative activity, which is comparable to that of the third-and fourth-generation cephalosporins, making them broad-spectrum agents that could be used in hospital infections where methicillin-resistant staphylococci is likely to be present.
