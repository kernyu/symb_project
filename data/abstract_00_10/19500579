The therapeutic mainstay against the protozoan parasite Leishmania is still based on the antiquated pentavalent antimonials, but resistance is increasing in several parts of the world. Resistance is now partly understood in laboratory promastigote isolates, but the mechanism leading to drug resistance in amastigote isolates is lagging behind. Here we describe a comparative proteomic analysis of a genetically related pair of antimonial-sensitive and -resistant Leishmania infantum axenic amastigote strains. The proteomics screen has highlighted a number of proteins differentially expressed in the resistant parasite. The expression of the protein argininosuccinate synthetase (ARGG) was increased in the drug resistant mutant while a decrease in the expression of the kinetoplastid membrane protein (KMP-11) correlated with the drug resistance phenotype. This proteomic screen highlighted several novel proteins that are putatively involved in resistance to antimonials.
