Since multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major cause of failure in cancer chemotherapy, we report a microfluidic approach combined with the same-single-cell analysis to investigate the modulation of MDR, manifested as the inhibition of drug efflux. A microfluidic chip that was capable of selecting and retaining a single multidrug-resistant cancer cell was used to investigate drug efflux inhibition in leukemia cell lines. Three advantages of the microfluidic-based same-single-cell analysis (dubbed as SASCA) method have been revealed. First, it readily detects the modulation of drug efflux of anticancer compounds (e.g., daunorubicin) by MDR modulators (e.g., verapamil) among cellular variations. Second, SASCA is able to compare the different cellular abilities in response to drug efflux modulation based on the drug transport kinetics of single cells. Third, SASCA requires only a small number of cells, which may be beneficial for investigating drug resistance in minor cell subpopulations (e.g., cancer "stem" cells).
