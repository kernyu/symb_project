Drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, adverse reactions, caused by antituberculous drugs, as well as suppressed cellular immunity are responsible for lower efficiency of treatment. To improve the results of treatment in patients with tuberculosis in the intensive phase, the authors used glutoxim, a representative of thiopoeitins. Glutoxim treatment was performed in 73 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (a study group). A control group comprised 45 patients. The course of therapy with glutoxim, 60 mg/day, was 52 days. The study group was characterized by a rapider cessation of intoxication symptoms, the higher rates of bacterial isolation cessation, and decay cavity-closure. At the end of an intensive treatment, there was abacillarity in 64 (86.7%) patients from the study group and in 32 (71.1%) control patients; decay cavity closure was observed in 60 (88.3%) and 29 (70.8%) patients, respectively (p < 0.05).
