Central nervous system infections involving vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) are infrequently described and pose significant therapeutic difficulties, because these organisms are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. We describe the use of intrathecal quinupristin/dalfopristin to treat a VREF-associated infection in a neuro--surgical patient.
