The resistance of Ureaplasma urealyticum to antibacterials, isolated from 804 patients from the outpatient clinic of the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Hangzhou, China, from March to June over six consecutive years (1999-2004) was reviewed. The quinolone resistance-determining region of six strains of U. urealyticum was analyzed. The level of resistance to doxycycline, josamycin, tetracycline, azithromycin, clarithromycin and pristinamycin was below 20% and did not change during the study period. The rate of resistance to fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) was much greater than these (>50%) and has increased since 1999. The rate of resistance to Erythromycin decreased from 63.9% in 1999 to about 20% from 2000 onwards. The widespread use of fluoroquinolones had led to high resistance rates in U. urealyticum and the emergence of quinolone resistance. Analysis of the gene sequence of topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase suggested a role for the topoisomerase IV ParE subunit in fluoroquinolone-resistant U. urealyticum.
