Control of AIDS requires development of special therapeutic strategies in order to reduce the level of monocyte/macrophage HIV infection, to prevent spread of HIV within the monocyte/macrophage reservoir, to maintain a therapeutically effective drug concentration in sanctuaries such as the brain and to overcome the problem of cellular resistance mechanisms. A popular approach towards this end has been the development of prodrugs of anti-HIV drugs. This review covers the different strategies devised for the design of prodrugs of anti-HIV agents with emphasis on the recent findings in this field of research. Thus, prodrugs of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) including, 5'-O carboxylic ester derivatives, 5'-O- monophosphate analogues, macromolecular derivatives, prodrugs of purine nucleosides, prodrugs of acyclic nucleosides, homo and hetero dinucleotides, prodrugs of non-classical nucleoside analogues, boranophosphate triesters of NRTIs, and prodrugs of protease inhibitors including acyl-substituted prodrugs, prodrugs with increased water solubility, monophosphate prodrugs, and conjugates of HIV protease inhibitors with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor through spontaneously cleavable linkers, constitute the subject of this review.
