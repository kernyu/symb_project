New vaccines and drug treatments are needed for tackling the neglected diseases (NDs) of poor countries. These diseases are associated with high levels of mortality and/or morbidity, but lack appropriate vaccines and drug treatments because of bacterial resistance, toxicity, long-treatment protocols, problems with administration or because none are available. Current initiatives directed at research and development (R&D) of NDs are being led predominantly by the governmental, inter-governmental and private not-for-profit sectors implemented by way of public-private partnerships. Push and pull mechanisms targeted at the pharmaceutical industry have also been proposed as another way to stimulate R&D of NDs; however, these should be viewed with some caution. Stimulating R&D for NDs is important as part of a wider long-term public health strategy and must be addressed simultaneously with resolving more immediate problems of access to medicines and health system sustainability in less developed countries.
