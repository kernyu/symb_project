We investigated the mechanism of resistance to genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection in mice transfected with the murine alpha-1 interferon (IFN-alpha1) transgene. In situ transfection of mice with the IFN-alpha1 transgene resulted in an elevation in an IFN-responsive gene, RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), but not 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS), in vaginal tissue. Coupled with the finding that mice lacking a functional PKR pathway were no longer resistant to genital HSV-2 infection following transfection with the IFN-alpha1 transgene in comparison to wild-type mice or mice lacking a functional OAS pathway, these results suggest that PKR is the dominant antiviral pathway activated by the IFN-alpha1 transgene.
