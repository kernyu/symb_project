OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding adefovir to lamivudine therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients resistant to Ramivudine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 17 studied patients, 7 had chronic active HBV infection and 10 were posttransplant with HBV infection (9 with de novo HBV). They received lamivudine plus adefovir therapy for 2 years. We assessed reductions in serum HBV-DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, loss of HBeAg (in HBeAg+ cases), and HBsAg clearance. RESULTS: A virological response, as defined by HBV-DNA below the cut off by hybridization, was observed in 12 (70.6%) patients and loss of HBeAg in 4 (44.4%) of the 9 initially HBeAg-positive cases. A biochemical response, defined as a decreased serum ALT to the normal range, occurred in 4 (26.7%) patients. Median serum creatinine increased in 3 of 15 (20%) patients, excluding those on hemodialysis. There were two noteworthy cases of sustained HBsAg seroconversion with adefovir (11.8%): one patient with de novo HBV infection posttransplantation and positive hepatitis C virus-RNA serology, and one patient with decompensated HBV cirrhosis in whom viral replication ceased, making him eligible for transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, adefovir is an effective rescue therapy that broadens the existing range of options for patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B infection, particularly those with decompensated cirrhosis awaiting a liver graft, and those with recurrent posttransplantation HBV. The relatively small biochemical response seen in these patients may be attributable to the high prevalence of concomitant hepatitis C virus infection (41%).
