The presence of hypermutator Pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated with poorer lung function in patients at the Adult West Midlands CF Unit. Mucoid isolates were more likely to be hypermutators. The presence of resistant mutant subpopulations was associated with hypermutator phenotype but was not good enough to be used as a test for this phenotype.
