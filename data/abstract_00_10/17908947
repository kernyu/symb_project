This study compared the ability of telavancin to the ability of cefazolin and vancomycin to eliminate staphylococci from peritoneal dialysis fluid by using a static in vitro model to simulate the conditions of peritoneal dialysis. The results showed that telavancin exhibited statistically significantly better kill (P < 0.05) against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
