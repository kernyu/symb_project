The percentage of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients in the United States maintained on continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) therapy is decreasing. Complications from CPD therapy, including peritonitis, may be the reason for the decline. Improvements in CPD technology and a better understanding of the risk factors that predispose patients to the development of peritonitis have been responsible for a decline in the rate of peritonitis. Yet peritonitis remains a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality and the overall outcome of peritonitis is not acceptable. Factors that have limited our ability to lessen the impact of peritonitis include a lack of data on dosing antibiotics in patients on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) therapy, a lack of knowledge concerning the biology of bacterial biofilm, and the development of resistance to the current prophylactic antibiotic protocols. Further studies are needed concerning the optimal management of the peritoneal catheter and whether it is feasible to resume CPD therapy after catheter removal.
