Syk has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in oxidative stress signaling in B cells. Here we report that Syk is required for the activation of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-Akt survival pathway in B cells exposed to oxidative stress. Phosphorylation and activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt were markedly increased in B cells treated with H(2)O(2). In Syk-deficient DT40 cells treated with low doses of H(2)O(2) (10-100 microm), Akt activation was considerably reduced. Pretreatment with wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase-specific inhibitor, completely blocked the Syk-dependent Akt activation. Following stimulation by low doses of H(2)O(2), a significant increase in PI 3-kinase activity was found in wild-type but not in Syk-deficient cells. These findings suggest that PI 3-kinase mediates Syk-dependent Akt activation pathway. Furthermore, viability of Syk-deficient cells, after exposure to H(2)O(2), was dramatically decreased and caspase-9 activity was greatly increased compared with that of the wild-type cells. These results suggest that Syk is essential for the Akt survival pathway in B cells and enhances cellular resistance to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.
