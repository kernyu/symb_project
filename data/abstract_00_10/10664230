UNLABELLED: Although a range of antiretroviral drugs are available for use in children, the appropriate paediatric regimen remains unclear. In a survey to investigate policies and practices relating to the therapeutic management of children infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a postal questionnaire was sent to a named paediatrician in 70 major HIV centres in 13 European countries in early 1998. A total of 64 paediatricians (91%) responded. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis was found to be routine in all centres, although considerable variation existed regarding the time of starting and stopping therapy. Prophylaxis for fungal infections and recurrent bacterial infections was common, with cytomegalovirus prophylaxis being less frequent. Although most centres (89%) used all five currently available nucleoside analogues (ziduvodine, lamivudine, stavudine, didanosine, zalcitabine), there was considerable variability regarding the availability of protease inhibitors. Most respondents delayed initiation of antiretroviral therapy until evidence of disease progression was apparent. The initial prescription of 38% of clinicians was triple therapy and that of 57% prescribed double therapy. Policies varied regarding the modification to regimens in response to disease progression and emergence of side effects and drug resistance. Clinical practice was informed by a number of sources, including centre-specific and national guidelines. Most respondents affirmed the need for European guidelines. CONCLUSION: Approaches to the therapeutic management of paediatric human immunodeficiency virus infection differ across Europe.
