AIM: To investigate the effect of starvation, surface attachment and growth in a biofilm on the susceptibility of Aureobasidium pullulans to the biocides 2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (OIT) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). METHODS AND RESULTS: Fluorescence loss from a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transformed strain was used to monitor real-time loss in viability as previously described in situ in 96-well plates. Exponential phase, yeast-like (YL) cells were settled in the bottom of the wells as a low-density monolayer (LDM) and were susceptible to all biocide concentrations (25-100 mug ml(-1)). The exponential phase YL cells were either starved for 48 h in suspension or starved for 48 h as LDMs in the wells. Starvation in both cases led to a small reduction in susceptibility to the biocides. In contrast, 48-h biofilms grown in malt extract broth showed an apparent lack of susceptibility to 25 and 50 mug ml(-1) OIT and to 25-100 mug ml(-1) NaOCl. However, when the OIT concentration was increased to compensate for the higher cell density in the biofilm, the biofilms were found to be equally susceptible to the LDM. CONCLUSIONS: Starvation of A. pullulans YL cells either in suspension or as attached LDM resulted in a decrease in susceptibility to low concentrations of both OIT and NaOCl while the apparent reduced susceptibility of mature biofilms was due to the increase in biofilm cell density rather than true biofilm resistance per se. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Monitoring fluorescence loss from the GFP-transformed strain of A. pullulans can be used as a fast and reliable method for monitoring cell death in real time as a response to biocide and antimicrobial challenge.
