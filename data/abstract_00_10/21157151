BACKGROUND: Susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus aureus often requires cumbersome supplementary tests. MicroScan Pos Breakpoint Combo Panel Type 28 (PBC28) (Siemens, USA) includes cefoxitin screening to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), inducible clindamycin resistance detection (ICD), and determination of low-range minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin (0.5-16 microg/mL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of PBC28 in comparison with that of Pos Combo Type 1A (PC1A) (Siemens). METHODS: From December 2009 to March 2010, 500 non-duplicate clinical isolates of S. aureus were tested with PC1A and PBC28. Categorical agreements (CA) between the interpretations of the 2 panels were estimated. The presence of the mecA gene was determined by PCR, and double-disk diffusion test (D-test) was performed on the isolates resistant to erythromycin but susceptible or intermediately resistant to clindamycin. Ninety-six isolates representing various vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were tested in parallel with repeat PBC28, broth macrodilution, and epsilometer test (E test). RESULTS: The CA was 99.3% with a very major error (VME) of 0.2%, major error (ME) of 0.1%, and minor error (mE) of 0.4% in total. PBC28 showed 100% CA for 1 isolate with vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL and 35 isolates (7.0%) with MIC of 2 microg/mL. However, only 15, 27, and 35 isolates with vancomycin MIC of 2 microg/mL showed 100% CA in repeat PBC28, broth macrodilution, and E test, respectively. PC1A and PBC28 detected all 314 mecA-positive isolates. Among the 63 isolates tested with the D-test, 58 (92.1%) were positive, and the results were 100% concordant with those of ICD. CONCLUSIONS: PBC28 can be appropriate susceptibility testing of S. aureus, including MRSA detection and ICD. However, the lower-range vancomycin MIC test was not reproducible enough to reliably differentiate MIC of 2 microg/mL from MIC </= 1 microg/mL.
