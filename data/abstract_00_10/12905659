OBJECTIVE: To establish a model of Candida biofilm and to explore its characteristics, ultrastructure, influences by saliva and serum, and sensitivity to antifungal agents. METHODS: Evaluations of the in vitro growth kinetics, influences by saliva and serum, and sensitivity to antifungal agents of Candida biofilm were performed with the abated tetrazolium salt XTT method on a 96-well microtire petri dish. The ultrastructure of Candida biofilm was observed under Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM). RESULTS: The bioactivity of Candida biofilm increased with culturing time and serum could obviously increase the action of biofilm. The Candida biofilm was significantly resistant to routine antifungal agents. CONCLUSION: The Candida cells adhered in biofilms are significantly different in morphology from those in suspension and are resistant to routine antifungal agents such as Amphotericine B, Fluconazole and Itraconazole.
