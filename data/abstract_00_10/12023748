PURPOSE/METHOD: To point out that acanthamoeba keratitis can show therapeutical resistance to dibrome propamidine isethionate (Brolene). We have a late diagnosis case of corneal melting on a bilateral acanthamoeba keratitis. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: We performed corneal graft in one eye and found histopathological evidence of acanthamoeba. There was relapse in the graft in spite of Brolene treatment and good results when we changed to polyhidroxy methylbigunide (PHMB). In case of therapeutical Brolene resistance, PHMB can be an adequate alternative (Arch Soc Esp Oftalmol 2002; 77: 279-282).
