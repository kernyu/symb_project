Saquinavir is an HIV protease inhibitor (PI) which, formulated as a hard-gel capsule (HCG), was the first drug of its class to become available for the treatment of patients with HIV infection. The limited bioavailability of this drug was responsible for a reduced number of prescriptions when new PI were available. Since 1997, combination therapy with ritonavir has improved the pharmacokinetics parameters resulting in a better clinical benefit. Saquinavir (HGC) monotherapy is not yet recommended. Soft gel capsule (SGC) has improved biodisponibility. Efficacy of SQV has been shown in clinical studies in first and second line of treatment with PI. Resistance profile is favorable considering the low level of cross resistance with other PI. Better knowledge of saquinavir could help giving back a place to this drug in the anti HIV arsenal.
