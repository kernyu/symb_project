Bacterial resistance to antibiotics, particularly to multiple antibiotics, is becoming a cause for significant concern. The only really viable course of action to counter this is to discover new antibiotics with novel modes of action. We have recently implemented a new antisense-based chemical genetic screening technology to accomplish this goal. The discovery and antibacterial activity of coelomycin, a fully substituted 2,6-dioxo pyrazine, illustrates the application of the Staphylococcus aureus fitness test strategy to natural products discovery.
