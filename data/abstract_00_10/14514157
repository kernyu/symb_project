Pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from a human urine specimen. This unusual human pathogen showed a mucoid colony with a modest haemolysis and typical biochemical characteristics. API 20E and API 20NE identified the bacterium as Pasteurella spp. and P. haemolytica, respectively. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of P. haemolytica in human urine.
