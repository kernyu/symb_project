For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is refractory for both platinum-based chemotherapy and docetaxel, no standard regimen has yet been established. We conducted a phase I study of a combination of vinorelbine and gemcitabine as third-line chemotherapy for refractory NSCLC to determine both the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD). Twenty patients with NSCLC refractory for both platinum and docetaxel were enrolled, and all patients were eligible for this phase I study. Cohorts of three to seven patients received vinorelbine at doses ranging from 20 to 25 mg/m(2), and gemcitabine at doses ranging from 600 to 1000 mg/m(2), on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. The dose-limiting toxicities were treatment delay, serum gammaGTP elevation, diarrhea and cerebral infarction, which were resolved without serious sequela, and there was no treatment-related death. The MTD was vinorelbine at 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m(2) and the RD was vinorelbine at 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine at 800 mg/m(2). The median overall survival time was 6.8 months for all 20 patients eligible. As third-line chemotherapy, the combination of vinorelbine and gemcitabine was feasible and promising for NSCLC which is refractory for both platinum and docetaxel.
