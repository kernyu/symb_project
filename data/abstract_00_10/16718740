Anti-cholinesterase resistance is in many cases caused by modified acetylcholinesterase (MACE). A comparison was made of toxicological data and AChE activity gathered from 21 field populations and nine laboratory strains of houseflies, Musca domestica L., to elucidate the best way of generating data to provide advice for management strategies and gathering information for resistance risk assessment on the organophosphates azamethiphos and dimethoate and the carbamate methomyl, which have been the primary insecticides used against adult houseflies in Denmark. Cluster analysis was performed and > 2000 houseflies were assigned to one of three phenotypes based on total acetylcholinesterase activity as well as inhibition by azamethiphos, methomyl or omethoate. A cluster, i.e. a phenotype, with high total AChE activity and high sensitivity to azamethiphos and less sensitivity to inhibition by methomyl and omethoate was shown to be linked to methomyl resistance. It was not possible to define any clusters that could be linked to azamethiphos or dimethoate resistance. The five mutations V180L, G262A, G262V, F327Y and G365A causing anticholinesterase resistance in houseflies were all identified in the Danish housefly strains. The data are very heterogeneous, and a correlation of molecular genetic background and resistance of phenotypes is not obvious with the available data.
