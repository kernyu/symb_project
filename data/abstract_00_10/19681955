Staphylococcus aureus of sequence type 398 has emerged in Europe, North America and Asia, and has typically been associated with livestock and their human contacts. We analysed two Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-negative t034-ST398 isolates from humans in contact with pigs and two t034-ST398 PVL-positive isolates from two unrelated, adopted Chinese children, using multistrain microarrays to determine genomic variability between the two sets of isolates. The ST398 isolates clearly belong to the same lineage when compared to other clonal lineages. However, the four isolates cluster into two distinct groups corresponding to differences in epidemiology based on mobile genetic elements and resistance patterns, suggesting that the two groups are epidemiologically distinct.
