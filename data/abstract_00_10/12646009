Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents is of growing concern to public health officials worldwide. The concern includes infections acquired in hospitals, community infections acquired in outpatient care settings, and resistant foodborne disease associated with drug use in food-producing animals. In the United States, a significant source of antimicrobial-resistant foodborne infections in humans is the acquisition of resistant bacteria originating from animals. The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) goal in resolving the public health impact arising from the use of antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals is to ensure that significant human antimicrobial therapies are not compromised or lost while providing for the safe use of antimicrobials in food animals. The FDA's approach to the problem is multipronged and innovative. The strategy includes revision of the pre-approval safety assessment for new animal drug applications, use of risk assessment to determine the human health effect resulting from the use of antimicrobials in food animals, robust monitoring for changes in susceptibilities among foodborne pathogens to drugs that are important both in human and veterinary medicine, research, and risk management.
