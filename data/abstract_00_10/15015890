Both thalidomide and intermittent high-dose dexamethasone are agents with established activity against multiple myeloma. We summarized our experience with thalidomide alone, and then in combination with dexamethasone, for groups of patients with myeloma resistant or relapsing despite standard treatments. Criteria of response were based on greater than 50% reduction of serum myeloma protein and/or greater than 75% reduction of Bence Jones protein for patients treated with thalidomide alone and greater than 75% reduction of serum myeloma protein and/or greater than 90% reduction of Bence Jones protein for those who received thalidomide with dexamethasone. Among patients with resistant or relapsing disease treated with a combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone, 47% of patients achieved remission with significant prolongation of survival for responsive patients. Among patients in stable partial remission after intensive therapy who received the same program, myeloma protein was reduced further by greater than 90% in 52% of patients who had not received prior thalidomide/dexamethasone. Side effects were frequent, mild and reversible, and often preventable. Our program of thalidomide/dexamethasone was a safe and effective combination for patients with resistant or relapsing disease, or as consolidation of partial remission after intensive therapy.
