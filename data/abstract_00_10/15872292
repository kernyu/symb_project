Twenty-four community isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes resistant to ciprofloxacin and susceptible to levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin were studied. Sequence determination of the quinolone resistance-determining regions in the gyrA and parC genes revealed a T/G mutation in parC leading to a Ser79Ala substitution in ParC. All isolates were of the emm type 6, and 18 and 2 of them were indistinguishable or closely related, respectively, on the basis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
