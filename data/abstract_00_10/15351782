Despite the fact that major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator (CIITA) has been known to be involved in Th1/Th2 balance in addition to its major role as a master regulator for the expression of MHC class II genes, the exact role of CIITA in Th1/Th2 balance is still controversial. To investigate whether the Th1/Th2 balance could be modulated by T cell specific expression of CIITA, we generated CIITA-transgenic mice, in which the CIITA expression is controlled by the distal promoter of p56lck, resulting in constitutive expression of CIITA predominantly in peripheral T cells. Naive CD4+ T cells from CIITA-transgenic mice exhibited a low level of IFN-gamma secretion as well as impaired Th1 polarization in vitro, while IL-4 secretion was enhanced under Th2 condition. In addition, the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a prototype of Th1-mediated disease, was repressed in CIITA-transgenic mice. Resistance to EAE was correlated with reduced production of IFN-gamma in response to MOG35-55, while the proliferation of MOG35-55 -specific T cells was not affected in CIITA-transgenic mice. Together, these data demonstrate that overexpression of CIITA in T cells inhibits Th1 differentiation and function, suggesting that the expression of CIITA in T cells might play a role in the regulation of the Th1/Th2 balance during the T cell lineage commitment.
