For 95 protease inhibitor-experienced HIV-1-infected patients, the genotypic inhibitory quotient (GIQ; trough level/number of mutations) was calculated for lopinavir. Three different sets of mutations showed equal predictive value. However, the use of cumulative numbers of mutations for calculation of the GIQ showed significantly better association with the virological response. Furthermore, the predictive value of the GIQ was no different from that of the number of mutations alone.
