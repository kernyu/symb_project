As part of a study identifying plasmids in Campylobacter, we isolated and sequenced two novel cryptic plasmids from an agricultural isolate of Campylobacter coli. The larger of the two plasmids, p3384, is 3316 bp in length and has a G+C content of 31.18%. A typical origin of replication consisting of five iterons was observed directly upstream of the first of three putative ORFs. The smaller plasmid, p3386, is 2426 bp in length and has a G+C content of 26.22%. Of the three putative ORFs detected on p3386, one shared homology with a putative protein from Campylobacter upsaliensis. The unique sequence of p3386 makes it attractive for further study concerning the evolutionary relationship of this plasmid to other Campylobacter plasmids, and to other Campylobacter isolates.
