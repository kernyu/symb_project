Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative, nonmotile aerobic bacterium that has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii is difficult to treat with antibiotics, and treatment failure in infected patients is of great concern in clinical settings. To investigate proteome regulation in A. baumannii under antibiotic stress conditions, quantitative membrane proteomic analyses of a clinical MDR A. baumannii strain cultured in subminimal inhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and imipenem were performed using a combination of label-free (one-dimensional electrophoresis-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) and label (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) approaches. In total, 484 proteins were identified, and 302 were classified as outer membrane, periplasmic, or plasma membrane proteins. The clinical A. baumannii strain DU202 responded specifically and induced different cell wall and membrane protein sets that provided resistance to the antibiotics. The induction of resistance-nodulation-cell division transporters and protein kinases, and the repression of outer membrane proteins were common responses in the presence of tetracycline and imipenem. Induction of a tetracycline resistant pump, ribosomal proteins, and iron-uptake transporters appeared to be dependent on tetracycline conditions, whereas beta-lactamase and penicillin-binding proteins appeared to be dependent on imipenem conditions. These results suggest that combined liquid chromatography-based proteomic approaches can be used to identify cell wall and membrane proteins involved in the antibiotic resistance of A. baumannii.
