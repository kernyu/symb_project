The occurrence and antibiotic resistance of enterococci, especially Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, in milk, beef, and chicken in Gaborone, Botswana, were studied. Enterococci were isolated from these sources with the use of bile esculin agar and identified with API 20 Strep kits. Antibiotic resistance was determined by the disk diffusion method. The antibiotics tested were vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and cephalothin. Among the 1,467 enterococci isolated from the samples, E. faecalis (46.1%) and E. faecium (29.0%) were found to be the predominant species. Other enterococcal species made up 25% of the isolates. More than 96 and 97% of the E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates, respectively, were found to be resistant to ampicillin. Almost 34, 27.3, and 22.4% of the E. faecalis isolates from milk, beef, and chicken, respectively, were also resistant to cephalothin. The percentages of E. faecium isolates that were found to be resistant to cephalothin were 32.8, 16.9, and 17.3% for milk, beef, and chicken, respectively. Resistance to vancomycin was widespread. It was found that 18.8, 7.8. and 13.1% of the E. faecalis isolates from milk, beef, and chicken samples, respectively, were resistant to vancomycin. In contrast, 32.8, 24.7, and 30.7% of the E. faecium isolates from milk, beef, and chicken samples, respectively, were resistant to vancomycin. Isolates that were resistant to multiple drugs were found in relatively large numbers.
