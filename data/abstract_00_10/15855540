In Portugal erythromycin resistance of 26.6% (n = 352) remained constant during 1998 to 2003, however in 1998 the MLS(B) phenotype dominated (85%), whereas in 2003 the M phenotype prevailed (77%). A decline in T12/emm22 MLS(B) isolates could partially explain the drop in this phenotype, but the rise of the M phenotype was not due to clonal expansion.
