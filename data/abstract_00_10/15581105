Onchocerciasis, which is caused by filarial nematodes, affects roughly 18 million people in tropical Africa and is a major cause of morbidity, with a serious sociomedical impact. Although the present onchocerciasis control strategy comprising antifilarial chemotherapy and vector control is successful, it is associated with logistic problems due to the prolonged treatment duration. Furthermore, fears of drug resistance are on the increase. New approaches involving the use of antibiotics aimed at endobacteria living in symbiosis with filariae appear promising. Recent trials with tetracycline indicate a significant impact on worm viability.
