Frequencies of spontaneous mutation from inducible resistance to constitutive resistance were determined for the four clinical isolates of erythromycin-resistant enterococci, including one isolate with ermB gene and three clinical isolates with ermA gene. The rate of ermB mutation was higher than that of ermA mutation by more than 10 fold. Sequence analysis of the regulatory regions of erm genes revealed that mutation type of ermB was just point mutation, by contraries the mutation type of ermA was either deletion or tandem duplication. These results showed distinct characteristics in mutation patterns of ermB and ermA.
