The therapeutic use of DNA gyrase inhibitors, mainly quinolone antibacterials, has proven to be a tremendous success story in the treatment of bacterial infections. The rapid changes in quinolone research and development in recent years have produced several new quinolones: moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin and des-6-fluoroquinolone antibacterials. These newly developed compounds are equal or superior to existing ones in their potency, spectrum of activity, pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. The recent discovery of non-fluoroquinolones and 2-pyridone antibacterials represents yet additional progress in the search for novel DNA gyrase inhibitors. Although these two classes of compounds are either in the discovery or early development phase, they extend the possibilities of establishing new structure-activity relationships and new chemotypes for DNA gyrase inhibition.
