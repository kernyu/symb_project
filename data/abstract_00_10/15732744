The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is increasing and is exacerbated by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. The standard short-course regimen used for the treatment of tuberculosis is likely to be ineffective against MDR-TB, leading to the need for second-line drugs. In such situations, drug susceptibility testing (DST) is necessary to select an appropriate treatment regimen. In this study, DST of 99 MDR-TB strains isolated in Thailand was performed using a drug-impregnated disc method. The results showed that 94.95% of the strains were susceptible to amikacin and kanamycin, 90.91% to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, 85.86% to para-aminosalicylic acid, and 78.79% to ethionamide.
