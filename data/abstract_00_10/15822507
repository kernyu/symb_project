A retrospective multicentric study was carried out over a period of 2 years (1999-2000). 2659 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from 4 university hospitals (Charles Nicolle Hospital, Pediatric Hospital and National Centre of Bone Marrow Transplantation in Tunis, Habib Bourguiba Hospital in Sfax). Epidemiological profile and antibiotic susceptibility were analysed. All bacteria were identified by conventional methods and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed according to CA-SFM guidelines. The strains were recovered essentially from surgical wards (33%) and intensive care units (22%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated mainly from pus (36%), urine (32%) and respiratory samples (18%). 25% of strains were resistant to ticarcilline, 18% to cefsulodine, 9% to ceftazidime, 14% to imipenem and amikacin and 25% to ciprofloxacin. Moreover, the resistance rates varied from hospital to hospital and from unit to another. The resistant strains were isolated particularly from urology and intensive care units: respectively 62% and 39% for ticarcilline; 26% and 13% for ceftazidime. The acquired resistance to b-lactams seems largely due to penicillinase production. The frequency of resistance to ceftazidime was the lowest and seems associated to chromosomal cephalosporinase over production.
