BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are cephalosporinases that confer resistance to a wide variety of oxyimino cephalosporins and create serious therapeutic problems. Although ESBLs have been reported with increasing frequency in Korea, their prevalence and genotypic distribution in Daejeon remain unknown. This study was designed to evaluate the occurrence and genotypic distributions of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in Daejeon. METHODS: We tested a total of 427 isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae at Chungnam National University Hospital during the period from March to September 2006. ESBL production was determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ESBL confirmatory test; minimum inhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the broth dilution method. The ceftazidime or cefotaxime resistance of the ESBL-producers was transferred to azide-resistant E. coli J53 by conjugation. Searches for ESBL genes were performed by PCR amplification, and the genotypes of ESBLs were determined by direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplified products. The pIs of ESBL were determined by isoelectric focusing. RESULTS: The proportion of ESBL-producers was 10% of the E. coli and 28% of the K. pneumoniae isolates. The prevalence of ESBL-positive isolates was 60% in the intensive care units and 18.7% in the general wards. The most prevalent ESBL genotype in E. coli isolates was bla(CTX-M) and in K. pneumoniae was bla(SHV-12). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates producing SHV-12 or CTX-M-type ESBLs are widespread in Daejeon.
