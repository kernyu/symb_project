In Africa malaria parasites are increasingly developing resistance to the 3 affordable and tolerable drugs: chloroquine, amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Alternative products are much more expensive and more toxic. A malaria disaster is looming. On the contrary, in Vietnam a disaster appears to have been averted. Data on malaria epidemiology, on the mosquito, the parasite and the host, man, give insight into the differences and the possibilities of control. Artemisinin derivatives can play an important role in malaria control, also in Africa. Without improvement of care which will require considerable investment and attention, the prospects are bleak.
