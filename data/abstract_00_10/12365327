Susceptibility of 350 strains of staphylococci, isolated from pregnant women, puerperal and newborns and of 170 strains, isolated from obstetrical hospital environment at the region with high risk of radiation after accident was determined. The tested bacterial strains were the following: 56--Staphylococcus aureus, 152--S. epidermidis, 142--S. saprophyticus, isolated from women and newborns; strains isolated from hospital environment included 120 strains of S. saprophyticus and 50 strains E. coli. The tested antimicrobial factors were the following: 22 antibiotics, 2 bioantibiotics of the breast milk and blood (lysozyme, betalysin) not separated from the substrate and tested on test-cultures of M. luteus and B. subtilis, and 5 desinfectants. Analysis was performed by common disk-diffusion method and by contact method elaborated before. High resistance of staphylococci to many antibiotics, bioantibiotics and disinfectants was demonstrated. The resistance is considered to be due to high radiation background because it is much higher than resistance frequency of the similar strains isolated at the safe areas. The resistance to antimicrobial factors was higher among the opportunistic and saprophyte staphylococci along with appearance of pathogenic factors and activation of persistence properties.
