We describe the synthesis and activities of a series of pseudopeptides containing an N-aryl-N'-hydroxyalkyl hydrazide core structure to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus protease and viral replication. Of the series, compound Hmb-Leu-N(Bzl)-N(CH2-CH-OH)-rPro-Boc (24) displayed the greatest inhibitory potency (IC50 < 1 microM) and exhibited enzymatic resistance and stability in vitro.
