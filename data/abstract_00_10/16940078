Proton pump inhibitor treatment of clindamycin-treated mice elevated the gastric pH and facilitated the establishment of colonization of the large intestine by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (75 to 80%, versus 20 to 25% for saline-treated controls) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (90%, versus 30% for saline-treated controls). These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which proton pump inhibitor therapy could contribute to the dissemination of nosocomial pathogens.
