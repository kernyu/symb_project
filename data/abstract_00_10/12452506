Klebsiella pneumoniae is medically the most important organism of the Klebsiella species. It is responsible for a significant proportion of hospital-acquired infections including septicemias, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and soft tissue infections especially in the immunocompromised hosts such as the neonate. The hands of healthcare workers and the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized infants serve as reservoirs for the transmission of the organism and are responsible for multiple hospital outbreaks. In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of outbreaks caused by multidrug resistance K. pneumoniae organisms or the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae. The problems associated with extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms include difficulties in accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing, limited treatment options and increased morbidity and perhaps mortality. Hence, prevention through implementation of strict infection control guidelines, effective hand washing and judicious use of antimicrobials such as third generation cephalosporins is important to effectively reduce the morbidity associated with this infection.
