Twenty-four strains of non-toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae biotype gravis from the throats of patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis were assayed for susceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin using determination of MIC, MBC and time-kill curves. There were no differences between the MICs of penicillin for susceptible and tolerant strains. All but one strain had penicillin MBCs > or = 2 mg/L. Seventy-one per cent (17/24) of the strains were tolerant to penicillin. In contrast, all strains were susceptible to erythromycin (MIC < or = 0.016 mg/L). These aspects should be considered when choosing the therapy for treating non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae pharyngitis/tonsillitis.
