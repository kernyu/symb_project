An increasing number of families, including children and the elderly, are seeking more adventurous travel in exotic parts of the world. Holiday destinations now include once-remote regions such as subSaharan Africa and New Guinea. This increase in visits to tropical and subtropical regions, combined with widespread chloroquine-resistant malaria, now places millions of Western travelers at risk of infection annually. At least 30,000 travelers from industrialized countries are reported to contract malaria each year and approximately 1 in 100 travelers who acquire Plasmodium falciparum malaria will die.
