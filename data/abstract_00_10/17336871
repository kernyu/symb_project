Infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in LTCF residents. For medical directors, infection prevention and control programs in LTCFs need to be proactive in identifying potential infectious disease threats and implementing appropriate infection control practices. Improving the initial evaluation of infections, the use of antimicrobial agents, and the implementation of hand hygiene and infection control precautions should be key focus areas for medical directors in order to prevent infections and control antibiotic resistance.
