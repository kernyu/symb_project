In 1997, a cluster of multiresistant invasive serogroup 19 pneumococcus infections, including two fatalities, was reported in Washington State. Further investigation identified other cases. Fourteen Washington Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, four from Alaska, and eight isolates from eastern Canada with reduced penicillin susceptibility (MIC of > or =1 microg/ml) were included in the study. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with ApaI, SacII, and SmaI restriction enzymes and IS1167 and mef restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern analysis were performed. Twenty of the 26 isolates had identical or related PFGE patterns, with two or all three enzymes, and identical or related IS1167 RFLP patterns, indicating that they were genetically related. These 20 isolates contained the mef gene conferring erythromycin resistance and had identical mef RFLP patterns. The PFGE and RFLP patterns were distinct from those of six multiresistant clones previously described and suggest that a new multiresistant clone has appeared in Washington, Alaska, and eastern Canada. This newly characterized clone should be included in the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network.
