OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to determine the prevalence of bacteremia diagnosed in an emergency department (ED), the susceptibility of microorganisms to antibiotics, and the impact on therapeutic management. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was made on patient features, microbiological ecology, susceptibility to antibiotics, and modalities of antimicrobial therapy in the Georges Pompidou European hospital ED of Hopital, between 1 November 2001 and 30 June 2002. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and thirty two blood cultures were obtained from 1069 patients. The rate of positive cultures was 12%, but only 8.7% (n = 125) were proved as true bacteremia. The most frequently identified organisms were: Enterobacteriaceae (n = 63, 39.4%) with a predominance of Escherichia coli (n = 48, 30%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 16, 10%). Forty two cases of pyelonephritis and 34 of prostatitis both due to E. coli were diagnosed. 76.5% of these were resistant to amoxicillin, 64.7% to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 11.8% to ciprofloxacin, and 44% to cotrimoxazole. No resistance to third generation cephalosporin was detected in E. coli isolates. Fourteen S. pneumoniae pneumonia cases were diagnosed. 57.1% of isolates presented with a decreased susceptibility to penicillin (CMI > 0.1 mg/l). Susceptibility to amoxicillin and cefotaxim was 85.7% and 92.9% respectively. Blood culture was the only exam available for bacterial diagnosis in 51.5% of true bacteremia. 1.6% of blood cultures from ED samples had an impact on therapeutic management. CONCLUSIONS: Blood culture is a relevant exam for the diagnosis of infection in patients admitted to the ED.
