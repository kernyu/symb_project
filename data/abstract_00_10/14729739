OBJECTIVES: The potential therapeutic role of meropenem combined with sulbactam against a clinical endemic isolate of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Ab-153, was investigated. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility of Ab-153 to various drugs was studied by the agar dilution method and Etest strips. The antibacterial activity of meropenem and sulbactam were investigated by a time-kill study in vitro and further examined for therapeutic efficacy in vivo in a murine model. RESULTS: In the time-kill study, at a concentration of 0.5 x MIC (4 mg/L) of meropenem, 1 x MIC (8 mg/L) of sulbactam and both in combination, only the combination demonstrated bactericidal effects and there was at least a 5 log(10) reduction in bacterial colony counts after 48 h, compared with either drug alone. BALB/c mice infected with 2.1-2.6 x 10(7) cfu of Ab-153 were treated with 20 mg/kg meropenem every 8 h, 40 mg/kg sulbactam every 8 h or both in combination. The survival rate of mice in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the meropenem-treated or sulbactam-treated group (87% versus 35%, P = 0.0004; 87% versus 30%, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Meropenem in conjunction with sulbactam can exhibit more potent antimicrobial activity against Ab-153 than meropenem or sulbactam alone.
