BACKGROUND: Data concerning the effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens based in antibiotic susceptibility testing are scanty in children. AIMS: To identify the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori strains isolated from Portuguese children in 1999-2003; to evaluate eradication rate after antibiotic susceptibility testing-based treatment; and to identify factors associated with resistance and eradication outcome. METHODS: Included were 109 children with a gastric biopsy culture positive for H. pylori. First treatment (amoxicillin, omeprazole and clarithromycin or metronidazole) was guided by susceptibility testing (E test), and eradication was assessed by [C]urea breath test. RESULTS: Strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and tetracycline; 39.4% were resistant to clarithromycin, 16.5% to metronidazole and 4.5% to ciprofloxacin. No significant association was found between resistance and sex, age, clinical status, gastritis scores, H. pylori density scores and genotype. Clarithromycin resistance was significantly associated with European origin [odds ratio (OR), 3.9], previous H. pylori empiric therapy (OR 2.8) and amoxicillin minimal inhibitory concentration, > or =0.016 (OR 6.0). Eradication rate after susceptibility-based treatment was 74.7% (59 of 79; 95% confidence interval, 65.9-82.9), and a significant association was found between eradication failure and presence of resistance to 1 or more antibiotics (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of H. pylori antibiotic resistance was high in the studied population. The modest therapeutic success of clarithromycin and metronidazole susceptibility-based regimens suggests that in addition to resistance, other factors may be involved. The need of susceptibility-based treatment studies in children and of antimicrobial resistance surveillance in high prevalence areas for H. pylori are emphasized.
