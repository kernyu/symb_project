Multiple myeloma (MM) is an as-yet incurable B-cell malignancy. Increased survival in vitro is a hallmark of MM cells, implying that a therapeutic potential may lie in circumventing antiapoptotic signals. We have previously reported that interferons (IFNs) sensitize MM cells to Fas/CD95-mediated apoptosis. In the present study, we explore the mechanism underlying this effect. In a wide screening of apoptosis-related genes, Apo2L/TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-related apoptosis inducing ligand) and Fas were identified as IFN targets. Sensitization to Fas-mediated apoptosis by IFNs was not affected by blocking Apo2L/TRAIL, suggesting that Apo2L/TRAIL is not a key mediator in this process. In contrast, we found that an elevated Fas expression was functionally linked to increased susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis. This was further supported by the finding that IFN treatment enhanced Fas-mediated caspase-8 activation, one of the earliest signaling events downstream receptor activation. In addition, IFN treatment attenuated the interleukin 6 (IL-6)-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), interfering with a known survival pathway in MM that has previously been linked with resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our results show that IFN-induced up-regulation of Fas sensitizes MM cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis and suggest that attenuation of Stat3 activation may be a potentially important event in this process.
