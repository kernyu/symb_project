An effort was undertaken to replace a community of sheep endoparasites that had been classified as resistant to levamisole and albendazole with a community of more susceptible parasites using a dilution approach that could be integrated into the management of a commercial flock. For this study, pastures on this sheep farm were divided into two areas: north and south. Strategically timed anthelmintic treatments combined with pasture management reduced to nondetectable levels the endemic community of anthelmintic resistant parasites in this flock and on these pastures by early summer. A group of 102 ewes, lambs, and rams were experimentally infected with third stage larvae from the more susceptible community of parasites. These sheep then seeded the south pastures with the new parasite community, while sheep on the north pastures maintained the endemic resistant community. Despite its insensitivity as a technique for detecting anthelmintic resistance, fecal egg count reduction tests at the end of the grazing season indicated that the more susceptible parasites were present on the south pastures while resistant parasites were present on the north. The following grazing season, similar protocols were used to introduce the more susceptible parasites onto the north pastures. At the end of the grazing season, fecal egg count reduction tests indicated that the new community of parasites had become established on both groups of pastures of the farm.
