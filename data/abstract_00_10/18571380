Macrolide monotherapy is currently recommended as first-line treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in penicillin-intolerant/allergic individuals in the UK. However, resistance rates among the commonest cause, Streptococcus pneumoniae, now exceed 10% in the UK and a review of alternative agents is therefore timely. This review considers the relative merits of two agents, doxycycline and moxifloxacin, which are candidates to replace macrolides for second-line therapy of non-severe CAP.
