In nine strains of Enterococcus, frequency of resistance gene transfer from MRSA caring gene acc(6')-aph(2") was investigated. Transfer was inducted in broth at 44 degrees C for 24 h. Presence of acc(6')-aph(2") gene was confirmed by PCR method. Frequency of gene transfer was the highest for strains Enterococcus faecalis isolated from humans (0.13), significant lower for Enterococcus avium (0.007) and the lowest for strains of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from animals (0.004).
