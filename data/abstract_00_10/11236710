In summary, as the SHEA/IDSA Joint Committee on Prevention of Antimicrobial Resistance suggested, it should be easier to prevent the acquisition of resistance than to respond after the problem is extensive. We have taken that approach in the measures undertaken and outlined above. Our lower rates of resistant microorganisms are, in part, due to this, but also due to the diligent use of antibiotics by the medical staff-largely in avoiding empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy when not needed. Our formulary is not restrictive but new antibiotics are not added unless there is a proven niche. The most appropriate and effective antibiotic at our hospital for Streptococcus pneumoniae is penicillin, for Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin, for Staphylococcus aureus, nafcillin, for a severe Escherichia Coli infection, gentamicin, and for Pseudomonas aeurginosa, gentamicin and ceftazidime. Our efforts are to maintain this favorable situation for our patients and clinicians. Additionally, we will continue to explore and implement new avenues of prevention, with an emphasis on optimal antibiotic utilization, toward the goal of protecting our patients and health care workers from resistant bacteria.
