PURPOSE: Moxifloxacin, a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone (FQ), was compared to levofloxacin, a third-generation FQ, for preventing FQ-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (FQrMRSA) endophthalmitis in a rabbit model. METHODS: Three regimens of topical treatments (moxifloxacin 0.5%, levofloxacin 0.5%, and saline) were tested to prevent endophthalmitis. For each regimen, drops were instilled every 15 min for 1 h into the left eyes of 15 rabbits. After anesthesia, 2 x 10(4) cfu of FQrMRSA was injected into the aqueous. One drop of treatment was given immediately, and another four drops were applied over 24 h. At 24 h, the eyes were clinically graded for endophthalmitis. After the rabbits were sacrificed, the aqueous and vitreous were tapped for bacterial colony counts. RESULTS: Topical moxifloxacin (12/15, 80%) significantly (P=0.0001) prevented clinical endophthalmitis in more rabbits than levofloxacin (2/15, 13%) or saline (2/15, 13%). The total median clinical score for moxifloxacin treatment (1.0) was significantly (P=0.0004) lower than that for levofloxacin (20.0) or saline (23.0). Culture-negative eyes were less frequent for levofloxacin (8/15, 53%) and saline (1/15, 7%) treatments than for moxifloxacin treatment (12/15, 80%). CONCLUSION: This in vivo study indicates that moxifloxacin, a fourth-generation FQ, may be more effective than levofloxacin, a third-generation FQ, in preventing experimental FQrMRSA. endophthalmitis.
