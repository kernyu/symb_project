50% Ethanolic extracts of various parts of 16 medicinal plants were evaluated for potential activity against clinical isolates and WHO strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Activity was calculated as percentage inhibition in comparison with penicillin and ciprofloxacin and strains were categorised as less sensitive, sensitive or highly sensitive to the extracts. The extracts caused differential inhibition of N. gonorrhoeae, with greater inhibition of the MDR strains. Among the extracts tested, 60% exhibited high activity whereas 20% showed moderate activity and 20% had little activity against N. gonorrhoeae.
