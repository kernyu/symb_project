Bangladesh faces increasing levels of chloroquine resistance, and drug sensitivity to sulfadoxine-pyremethamine is already compromised. Therefore, the Ministry of Health recently changed the national treatment guidelines to artemisinin-based combination therapies. The purpose of this study was to determine the baseline therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine used as a six-dose regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Sixty-seven patients were enrolled in the study; the cure rate in a 42-day follow-up after an adjustment by polymerase chain reaction was 94.3%. The treatment led to rapid fever (mean +/- SD = 25.82 +/- 12.14 hours) and parasite (30.36 +/- 19.43 hours) clearance. These data suggest that artemether-lumefantrine is a highly efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Bangladesh.
