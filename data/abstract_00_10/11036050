The influence of vancomycin and flavophospholipol (FPL) on the transfer rate of conjugative plasmids harboring the vancomycin resistance operon vanA was determined in several clinical and animal isolates of Enterococcus faecium. FPL significantly inhibited the frequency of transfer of conjugative VanA plasmids up to 70-fold. Vancomycin had no significant effect on the transfer rate of VanA plasmids.
