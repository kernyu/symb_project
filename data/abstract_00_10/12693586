The efficacy and safety of Artecom were assessed in an open randomized trial in adults presenting with acute, uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Thailand. Three hundred and fifty-two patients were randomly enroled at the ratio of 2:1 into group A:B and received Artecom (group A) and the standard combination of artesunate and mefloquine (group B) respectively. All patients had rapid initial clinical and parasitological responses. There were no significant differences in fever clearance time and parasite clearance time between the two groups. The 28-day cure rates were high as 97% in both groups. Artecom was effective and well-tolerated as artesunate-mefloquine, the current treatment in this area of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum malaria.
