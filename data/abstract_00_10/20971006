Novel artemisinin-quinoline hybrid-dimers were synthesized from dihydroartemisinin and different aminoquinolines at elevated temperatures (90-110 degrees C). All compounds were obtained as the beta-isomers and were tested against both chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Hybrid-dimer 8 showed the highest antiplasmodial activity, inheriting the optimum chain length of three carbon atoms.
