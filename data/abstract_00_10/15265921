IL-23 and IL-12 are heterodimeric cytokines which share the p40 subunit, but which have unique second subunits, IL-23p19 and IL-12p35. Since p40 is required for the development of the Th1 type response necessary for resistance to Toxoplasma gondii, studies were performed to assess the role of IL-23 in resistance to this pathogen. Increased levels of IL-23 were detected in mice infected with T. gondii and in vitro stimulation of dendritic cells with this pathogen resulted in increased levels of mRNA for this cytokine. To address the role of IL-23 in resistance to T. gondii, mice lacking the p40 subunit (common to IL-12 and IL-23) and mice that lack IL-12 p35 (specific for IL-12) were infected and their responses were compared. These studies revealed that p40(-/-) mice rapidly succumbed to toxoplasmosis, while p35(-/-) mice displayed enhanced resistance though they eventually succumbed to this infection. In addition, the administration of IL-23 to p40(-/-) mice infected with T. gondii resulted in a decreased parasite burden and enhanced resistance. However, the enhanced resistance of p35(-/-) mice or p40(-/-) mice treated with IL-23 was not associated with increased production of IFN-gamma. When IL-23p19(-/-) mice were infected with T. gondii these mice developed normal T cell responses and controlled parasite replication to the same extent as wild-type mice. Together, these studies indicate that IL-12, not IL-23, plays a dominant role in resistance to toxoplasmosis but, in the absence of IL-12, IL-23 can provide a limited mechanism of resistance to this infection.
