Obesity with insulin resistance and alcohol are the most frequent causes of steatohepatitis. This work investigates the contribution of bioactive TNF and Th1 type cytokines in a mouse model of steatohepatitis induced by FAT alone or FAT+EtOH and endotoxin. The extent of liver injury and cytokine activation induced by endotoxin in chronic FAT-fed mice, FAT+EtOH-fed mice, or mice fed standard chow were analyzed. Endotoxin administration to either FAT-fed or FAT+EtOH-fed mice increased serum ALT and AST compared to standard chow mice. Immunoreactive TNF was strongly activated by LPS in FAT-fed and FAT+EtOH-fed mice which presented the highest levels, but low levels were found in standard chow mice. In contrast, bioactive TNF was only present in serum of FAT-fed and in particular the highest levels were found in FAT+EtOH-fed mice. Moreover, soluble TNFR2 but not TNFR1 was found in lower amounts in serum of FAT+EtOH-fed mice compared to FAT-fed mice. Steatohepatitis was associated with increased IL-6, IFN-gamma, and iNOS mRNA and proteins. Data show that a moderately FAT diet and low-dose EtOH concur to generate steatohepatitis and TNF liver expression after LPS. In this model, changes in the regulation of TNF are associated with increased expression of IL-6, IFN-gamma, and iNOS.
