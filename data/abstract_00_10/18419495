BACKGROUND: Emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance may limit the benefits of antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings. The prevalence of resistance was assessed among patients from KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, following failure of their first highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. METHODS: Genotypic resistance testing was performed on plasma virus samples from patients who experienced virologic failure of their first HAART regimen at 2 clinics in KwaZulu Natal. Clinical and demographic data were obtained from medical records. Regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with > or =1 significant drug resistance mutation. RESULTS: From January 2005 through August 2006, a total of 124 antiretroviral-treated adults who experienced virologic failure were enrolled. The predominant subtype was HIV-1C. Virus samples from 83.5% of participants carried > or =1 significant drug resistance mutation. Dual-class drug-resistant virus was present in 64.3% of participants, and 2.6% had virus with triple-class drug resistance. The most common mutation was M184V/I (64.3% of patients); K103N was present in virus from 51.3%, and V106M was present in virus from 19.1%. Thymidine analog resistance mutations were found in virus from 32.2% of patients, and protease resistance mutations were found in virus from 4.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Antiretroviral drug-resistant virus was detected in >80% of South African patients who experienced failure of a first HAART regimen. Patterns of drug resistance reflected drugs used in first-line regimens and viral subtype. Continued surveillance of resistance patterns is warranted to guide selection of second-line regimens.
