Seventy-four Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from China were subjected to drug susceptibility testing using ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampin, and ofloxacin. The results revealed that the presence of embB mutations did not correlate with ethambutol resistance but was associated with multiple-drug resistance, especially resistance to both ethambutol and rifampin.
