There are currently few data on drug resistance in Aspergillus, but the recent development of susceptibility tests have made it possible, to some extent, to study resistance in azoles and polyenes. This paper reviews the limited data available. The increased incidence of aspergillosis and the introduction of newer drugs make it important to continue to monitor closely trends in antifungal drug resistance.
