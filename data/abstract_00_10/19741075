Twenty-two human extraintestinal isolates (11 from blood) and three isolates recovered from patients with diarrhea were genetically characterized as Aeromonas aquariorum, a novel species known only from ornamental fish. The isolates proved to bear a considerable number of virulence genes, and all were resistant to amoxicillin (amoxicilline), cephalothin (cefalotin), and cefoxitin. Biochemical differentiation from the most relevant clinical species is provided.
