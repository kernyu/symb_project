AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the interactions between 5-amino-8-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (ANQ) and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: The compound ANQ display antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. During incubation with 50 microg ml(-1) of ANQ, an unusual reduction reaction takes place and leads to the isolation of 2,3-dihydro-5-amino-8-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (ANQ-H(2)), fully characterized by means of (13)C-NMR and (1)H-NMR, plus infrared, UV-visible and mass spectroscopy. Oxygen uptake by S. aureus cells was inhibited by ANQ, but in a significantly minor extent by ANQ-H(2). CONCLUSIONS: The ability of S. aureus to reduce the double bond at C2-C3 of the ANQ is a unusual behaviour for biological transformation of naphthoquinones. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This uncommon reaction may provide valuable understanding of the S. aureus regarding to the antimicrobial effect and the acquisition of resistance to naphthoquinones.
