Acne is one of the most prevalent diseases in dermatology: Millions of people worldwide experience this distressing condition. To determine the appropriate therapeutic strategy, there is a strong need for a standardized classification system of acne. The exact molecular mechanism of action of isotretinoin is not completely understood; however, oral isotretinoin targets simultaneously at all major mechanisms of acne pathogenesis. Various mass media reports about the risk of teratogenicity and depression from isotretinoin usage as well as the creation of intense prevention programs have created an obstacle to the use of the most active available drug against acne, presenting isotretinoin as a very dangerous regimen. According to recommendations of several international experts, which we share, oral isotretinoin may be prescribed not only to patients with severe disease but indications should be broadened to also include patients with less severe forms of acne, especially in cases with scarring, significant psychologic stress, or failure to respond to conventional therapy.
