The organizing committee of the Russian Interregional Association for Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobial Chemotherapy invited an international delegation of representatives, including nine BSAC members, to contribute to their ninth congress in Moscow at the end of May 2007. The event demonstrated the value of comparing experience in the context of an educational meeting and how efficient organization can overcome potential communication problems when simultaneous audio and slide translations are used to best effect.
