Antimalarial drug resistance is forcing newly developed pharmaceuticals into widespread use at an accelerating pace. To have the greatest public health impact, new pharmaceuticals will need to be deployed effectively in sub-Saharan Africa. Achieving effective antimalarial drug deployment over the short- to medium-term will require an appreciation of how drugs are currently used in Africa and the development of innovative approaches to optimize that use. Over the long-term, fundamental changes in the way that drugs are deployed will probably be required. There are many new strategies and initiatives that, to a greater or lesser degree, will influence how drugs are used. These influences may have a positive or negative effect on reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. The concept of analyzing and monitoring programmatic effectiveness allows for a more holistic understanding of these influences and allows for more unbiased, evidence-based decision making related to drug policy and deployment.
