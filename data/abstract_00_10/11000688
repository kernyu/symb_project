Tuberculous otitis media is a rare cause of chronic suppurative infection of the middle ear and mastoid. Patients typically have chronic tympanic membrane perforation and ear discharge associated with progressive, profound hearing loss, and resistance to antibiotic treatment. Diagnosis is often delayed by a low clinical suspicion, thus leading to complications such as irreversible hearing loss and facial nerve paralysis. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen reveals tuberculous changes. The disease is treated with antituberculosis agents.
