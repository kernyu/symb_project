Sepsis in experimental animals and humans has been associated with perturbed immune response. A major event contributing to the decrease in immune functions in septic disorders seems to be the inadequate balance of cytokines mediating the interactions between the innate and adaptive immune systems. We previously observed that a cyclic peptide derived from the Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF), which partially protect mice from endotoxic shock lethality, has the ability to modulate cytokine secretion in vitro. We herein examined the effects of the LALF(31-52) peptide in an experimental model of Gram-negative peritoneal sepsis and analyzed the cytokine gene expression in the spleen and liver of peptide-treated mice. The prophylactic administration of LALF(31-52) abrogated the systemic TNF-alpha response, reduced organ damage and increased the survival of infected mice. Histological examination of spleen and liver in peptide-treated mice showed prevention of tissue damage induced by the high dose of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This treatment modulates the cytokine gene expression in these tissues, stimulating IL-2, IL-12 and IL-13 mRNA synthesis, while IL-4 and IL-10 mRNA expression was not modified. This cytokine profile induced by the LALF-derived peptide seems to be favorable for host resistance against Gram-negative bacteria acute infection. In addition, peptide treatment was effective after the initiation of the systemic inflammatory response, promoting a significant increase in mice survival. These results further demonstrate the immunomodulatory potential of LALF(31-52) and are relevant for the design of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for acute bacteria infection and sepsis, especially for preventing or ameliorating host immunity defects in these disorders.
