Streptococcus pneumoniae causes various human infections such as meningitis, septicemia, otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Antibiotic resistance has already been reported with increasing frequency worldwide and is spreading. The earliest studies on pneumococcal antibiotic resistance go back to the late 1980s in Turkey. The resistance patterns have elevated with stepwise increments since then. By the beginning of 2005, approximately 40% of pneumococci were resistant to penicillin and nearly one-fifth of resistant isolates present high-level penicillin resistance. This proves that penicillin is still a good alternative for nonmeningeal infections. In addition, no ceftriaxone resistance have been reported in local Turkish studies, but cefuroxime, a second-generation cephalosporin, was recorded to have (10.8-20%) resistance rates. The most frequently assessed antibiotics other than penicillin in Turkish studies include erythromycin (4-19.4%), chloramphenicol (2-10%), clindamycin (2.5-13%) and tetracycline (13-28.6%) and all have various resistance profiles. On the other hand, nearly all or almost all of the isolates evaluated in Turkish studies are susceptible to rifampicin, quinolones, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin and telithromycin. All these non-beta-lactam antibiotics except the tetracyclines are within acceptable limits of empirical approaches. Tetracycline must be used cautiously. In addition, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole cannot be prescribed in probable pneumococcal infections since more than half of the isolates are nonsusceptible.
