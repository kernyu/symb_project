Urinary tract infection is a common condition worldwide; responsible for significant morbidity in both hospitalized and community patients. The laboratory records, for microbial isolates of infected urine and their susceptibility profiles for the years 1999 and 2003 were retrospectively reviewed and compared. In 2003, there was a significant decline in recovery ofCitrobacter spp compared to 1999. Conversely, the proportion of K pneumoniae, E coli and Enterococci increased dramatically in 2003, in both practices. For Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis, rates of isolation were increased in 2003, in hospital practice and community practice, respectively. Significant changes in antimicrobial susceptibility were also evident. A greater proportion of isolates from both practices were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, ceftazidime and cotrimoxazole in 2003 when compared to 1999. With respect to E coli, there were significant increases in prevalence of resistance to cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The overall resistance rate for norfloxacin remained relatively low and was unchanged for E coli. Continued surveillance of uropathogen resistance trends is important and this information should be communicated to clinicians. The feasibility of using the fluoroquinolones as a first line of therapy in urinary tract infection should be considered.
