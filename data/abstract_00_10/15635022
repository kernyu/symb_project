We described the baseline polymorphism of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) protease gene from 94 treatment-naive patients and the longitudinal follow-up of 17 protease inhibitor-treated patients. Compared to the HIV-2 consensus sequences, baseline polymorphism involved 47 positions. Substitutions selected under treatment were observed at positions corresponding to HIV-1 resistance mutations as well as at positions of currently unknown impact on HIV-1.
