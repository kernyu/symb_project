With the implementation of programs to control lymphatic filariasis and soil-transmitted helminths using broad spectrum anthelmintics, including albendazole and ivermectin, there is a need to develop an in vitro assay for detection of drug resistance. This report describes an in vitro assay for measuring the effects of ivermectin and benzimidazoles on the motility of larvae of the hookworm species Ancylostoma ceylanicum, A. caninum, and Necator americanus, and Strongyloides species including Strongyloides stercoralis, and S. ratti. A dose-response relationship was demonstrated with each of the parasite species, with distinct differences observed between the various species. In pilot field testing of the assay with N. americanus larvae recovered from human fecal samples, a dose-response relationship was observed with ivermectin. While the assay has demonstrated the ability to determine drug responsiveness, its usefulness in resistance detection will require correlation with the clinical outcome among individuals infected with parasite strains showing different drug sensitivities.
