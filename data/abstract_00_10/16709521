A 58-year-old man with warm-antibody-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) refractory to prednisolone, azathioprine, splenectomy, rituximab and combination chemotherapy, and with unacceptably high transfusion requirement, was treated with alemtuzumab. After a cumulative dose of 883 mg of alemtuzumab, the AIHA remitted completely, with normalization of hemoglobin and transfusion-independence. The major side effect was reactivation of cytomegalovirus, which was controlled with intravenous and oral ganciclovir. This case showed that alemtuzumab might be of use in therapy-refractory AIHA.
