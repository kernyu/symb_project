Pain is one of the most common reasons for admission to hospital for patients suffering from AIDS. Pain and other symptoms very often cover depressive episodes. Pain induced by AIDS therapy represents a progressive problem and induces the necessity to alter the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Of HIV-infected people 90% complain of headaches. Headache may result from opportunistic infections, from side-effects of HAART or from the HIV in the CNS itself but also the high burden of idiopathic headaches must be considered. Up to 20% of all neuropathies in HIV-infected people are caused by HAART. In most cases changing of HAART is necessary. Problems of interactions between HAART and the substances used for pain therapy via the cytochrome P450 system represents a special therapeutic problem during HAART in order to avoid development of resistance by the HIV.
