Etravirine (ETR) has demonstrated efficacy in patients with multiple prior treatments with prior virological failure and resistance mutations to various families of antiretroviral drugs. Most of the evidence concerning this drug has been drawn from the DUET studies, consisting of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials with identical designs that included 1,200 patients. These trials showed that ETR obtained a superior virological and immunological response to placebo, reducing the incidence of hospital admissions and progression to AIDS/death. The most frequent adverse effect was rash, which was generally mild to moderate and required treatment discontinuation in only 2%. There were no differences in gastrointestinal, liver or lipid toxicities compared with the placebo arm. Because of the recent development of new drugs, effective regimens are now available for multi-treated patients. The TRIO study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of one of the regimens most widely used today (ETR/raltegravir/darunavir/r) with excellent virological and immunological response (86% of viral load < 50 copies and CD4 +108 at 48 weeks) and excellent tolerance. ETR is effective and well tolerated and is the first non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that allows the sequential use of drugs in this family, due to its high genetic barrier compared with firstgeneration NNRTI. Moreover, its long half-life allows once daily administration in patients requiring a QD regimen.
