Antibiotic resistance of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria remains a major challenge for clinicians treating HAP. Since the recent release of linezolid and QD, treatment options for resistant gram-positive bacteria have improved. The development of new substances continues and it is hoped that some of them will be available soon. Investigation has centered on gram-positive bacteria, although multiresistant gram-negative pathogens, such as A haumanii, S maltophilia, and resistant P aeruginosa, are of major clinical relevance. New treatment options are unfortunately not in sight. No antibiotic, however, is a miraculous magic wand against resistant bacteria. The bugs are smart; they have been on this world far longer than humans. Regardless of how innovative the mechanism of action of new substances is, resistance will emerge. The solution is certainly not a nihilistic approach leading to a fearful restriction in the use of new substances. No antibiotic, regardless of its potency, can free the clinician from keeping the difficult balance between individual undertreatment and general overtreatment.
