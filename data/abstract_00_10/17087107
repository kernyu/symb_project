A 16-year-old adolescent presented with fever, lethargy and vomiting associated with mild dehydration. This was followed less than 24-hours later by loss of consciousness, seizures and clinical brain death. She had no prior medical illness, no hospital or frequent antibiotic exposure. There was no evidence of soft tissue or skin infection. Management included intravenous fluids, ampicillin and cefotaxime parenterally, dexamethasone, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Her neurologic examination remained unchanged with areflexia, flaccid paralysis and fixed pupils. Post-mortem examination revealed an eight-centimetre right fronto-parietal lobe brain abscess. Cultures were positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although formerly a nosocomial pathogen affecting debilitated patients in the hospital setting, S aureus that is methicillin resistant is emerging as a community acquired pathogen affecting previously well patients.
