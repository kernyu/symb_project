We report the first case of Penicillium marneffei infection in a Greek bisexual man who is a frequent traveler to China. Penicilliosis and AIDS were diagnosed and antifungal treatment plus highly active antiretroviral therapy were administered successfully. In nonendemic areas travel history, clinical suspicion and laboratory alertness are critical for infection management.
