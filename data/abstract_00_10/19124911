Since 2004, Georgia the first among Eastern European countries ensured universal access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Laboratory monitoring of HAART using CD4 count, viral load (VL) and HIV genotypic resistance testing was carried out in according with National HIV/AIDS Treatment Guidelines. Georgia the first among former Soviet Union countries implemented HIV genotypic resistance testing in HIV clinical care. The present paper reports on successful application of laboratory tools in routine clinical care for the early detection of HIV drug resistance. For genotypic resistance testing the TruGene HIV-1 Genotyping Kit (Bayer HealthCare LLC, Tarrytown, NY) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. Analysis included 45 patients with virologic failure. Of them 34 (75.5%) had at least one resistant mutation. Dual-class drug resistance was found in 30 (66.7%) patients. One (2.2%) patient carried triple-class resistance mutations. Median number of resistant mutations was 2. Most commonly detected NRTI mutation was M184/V/I (68.9%). G190S/A was the most frequent NNRTI mutation (42.2%), followed by K103N (28.9%). All patients with drug resistance mutations were switched to a second line regimens. Analysis of virologic and immunological outcomes among 23 patients who had at least two follow-up measurements of CD4 and VL after resistance test, showed statistically significant decrease in VL by 2.5 log(10) and mean gain of 181 cells/mm(3) in CD4 count by the last available measurement. Routine monitoring of VL and subsequent use of HIV drug resistance testing allowed for early identification of HIV drug resistance, reducing the opportunity for mutations to accumulate. Routine use of sophisticated laboratory methods for HAART monitoring has beneficial impact on clinical outcomes and should be used as part of the strategy to combat resistance.
