AIMS: This study investigates the effects of biguanides during encystment of Acanthamoeba castellanii. METHODS AND RESULTS: A non-nutrient encystment system was used to investigate the changes in the levels of sorption (uptake) of three non-cysticidal concentrations (10, 20 and 50 microg ml(-1)) of chlorhexidine diacetate (CHA) and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) as well as their effects on viability and leakage of pentose sugars during the first 36 h of encystment. Trophozoites treated with CHA or PHMB were more sensitive and generally sorbed more of each biocide than cysts. During encystment, the largest increases in resistance developed between 18 and 36 h for both biguanides with the resistance emerging to biguanide concentrations of 10 or 20 microg ml(-1) between 18 and 24 h. At 50 microg ml(-1) resistance emerged between 24 and 36 h. There was a general decrease in biocide sorption during encystment between 0-24 and 0-21 h for CHA and PHMB, respectively, at a concentration of 50 microg ml(-1). The greatest decline in biguanide-induced pentose leakage was between 0 and 12 h. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that during encystment some of the changes in the susceptibility to CHA or PHMB may be related to decreases in the levels of biocide sorption, which is limited by the developing cyst wall. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: During encystation, changes occur in biguanide sensitivity. The physical barrier of the cyst wall may be an important factor in limiting biocide sorption.
