Increasing resistance among the key pathogens responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, has the potential to limit the effectiveness of the antibacterial agents available to treat these infections. Moreover, there are regional differences in the susceptibility patterns observed and, as treatment is usually empirical, choosing an effective treatment can be challenging. Telithromycin, the first ketolide to be approved for clinical use, offers an activity profile that covers the key respiratory pathogens including penicillin- and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. In a pooled analysis of three large controlled clinical trials involving patients with acute maxillary sinusitis, the bacteriological efficacy of 5- or 10-day treatment with telithromycin and 10-day treatment with comparators was evaluated. Telithromycin administered as a once-daily 800 mg dose for 5 days achieved eradication rates of 91.8, 87.5 and 92.9% for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, respectively. Bacteriological eradication of 8/10 and 12/14 isolates of S. pneumoniae resistant to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively, was also reported following 5-day treatment with telithromycin. The clinical efficacy of this regimen was equivalent to that of a 10-day regimen of telithromycin or standard 10-day courses of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or cefuroxime axetil. Telithromycin 800mg given for 5 days was well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events being of mild or moderate intensity. These data suggest that telithromycin provides effective first-line therapy for use in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis in a short and convenient once-daily dosage regimen.
