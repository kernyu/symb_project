This is a prospective study spanning a period of six months where stools of 400 diarrhoeic children and 100 non-diarrhoeic children aged 0-5 years were screened for Aeromonas hydrophila and other enteric pathogens. Out of the 400 diarrhoeic stools only three (0.75%) were positive for Aeromonas hydrophila while none was positive in the control group. No other enteric pathogen was isolated from these positive samples, indicating that Aeromonas hydrophila is responsible for their diarrhoea. Continuous surveillance of this agent of diarrhoea in this environment will further reveal any threat the organism may poise in the nearest future.
