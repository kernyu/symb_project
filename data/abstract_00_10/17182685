Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant worldwide health problem with limited therapeutic options. A number of novel, small molecular inhibitors of HCV replication are now entering early clinical trials in humans. Resistance to small molecular inhibitors is likely to be a significant hurdle to their use in patients. A systematic assessment of combinations of interferon and/or novel anti-hepatitis C virus agents from several different mechanistic classes was performed in vitro. Combinations of inhibitors with different mechanisms of action consistently demonstrated more synergy than did compounds with similar mechanisms of action. These results suggest that combinations of inhibitors with different mechanisms of action should be prioritized for assessment in clinical trials for chronic hepatitis C virus infection.
