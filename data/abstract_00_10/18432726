Macrophages have been shown to produce interferons (IFNs) that exert an antiviral effect--resistance to the cytopathic effect (CPE) of viral infection--on sensitive cell types such as fibroblasts. In some cases, IFN levels in macrophage supernatants may be below the limits of detection but still may be sufficient to confer antiviral activity on macrophages. This unit provides an assay for the qualitative demonstration of the presence or absence of endogenous IFN production in murine macrophages by measuring the resistance of macrophages to the CPE of infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).
