This study was performed to determine the susceptibility of 50 C. difficile strains isolated from faecal samples of children suspected to antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) to antimicrobial agents: metronidazole, vancomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloksacin, gatifloksacin and imipenem. The all C. difficile strains were sensitived to metronidazole and vancomycin. Twenty six per cent of strains were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin (MLS(B) type resistance). Resitance to ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin and imipenem was detected in 98%, 8%, 8% and 30% of C. difficile strains, respectively.
