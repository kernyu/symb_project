Diminished survival due to hepatitis B has been observed after renal transplantation (RT). Lamivudine, a second-generation nucleoside analogue, has been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients with normal renal function. Numerous clinical experiences with lamivudine after RT have been recently published. Despite numerous shortcomings, all of these reports have shown encouraging results. The rate of clearance of HBV viremia ranged between 67% and 100%, and the frequency of ALT normalization was between 50% and 100% with lamivudine use. Even patients with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, a serious form of HBV-related liver disease with ominous course, have been successfully treated with lamivudine. Lamivudine therapy significantly improved the survival of HBsAg positive renal allograft recipients. However, numerous issues concerning the treatment of hepatitis B after RT remain unclear: the optimal time to initiate lamivudine, the appropriate duration of antiviral therapy after RT, and the role for pre-transplantation liver biopsy. Also, the management of lamivudine resistance remains a concern for physicians. Clinical trials are under way.
