Current treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C consists of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The application of viral kinetics is currently allowing treatment to be optimized by varying the length of treatment to 24 weeks for genotypes 2 and 3 and 48 weeks for the remaining genotypes. Thus, patients with genotype 1, with a low viral load, and rapid virological response (RVR) obtain a high RVS with 24 weeks' treatment. In contrast, slow responders may benefit from 72 weeks' treatment. Patients with genotypes 2 and 3 can also benefit from regimens designed according to viral kinetics. Higher doses and more prolonged periods have been tested in non-responders to current treatment, although for many, the only option is to wait for a new generation of drugs. Maintenance therapy with low-dose interferon to prevent cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma is currently being evaluated.
