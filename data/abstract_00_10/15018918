We have identified BM212 as a lead compound among a series of pyrrole derivatives with good in vitro activity against mycobacteria and candidae. First studies led us to synthesize some pyrrole compounds in which the thiomorpholine fragment was present. Some compounds revealed very active and these findings prompted us to prepare new pyrrole derivatives 2-15 in the hope of increasing the activity. The microbiological data showed interesting in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria.
