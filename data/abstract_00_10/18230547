From the second semester of 2002 to the end of the first semester of 2005, a total of 2544 bacterial strains were isolated from the blood stream of patients with clinical sepsis and bacteremia hospitalized in six University Hospitals in the Slovak Republic. Almost 30% of strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS), about 14% were Staphylococcus aureus and, of the Gram-negative bacteria, up to 9% were Klebsiella pneumoniae. All CONS, S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. strains were found to be still susceptible to vancomycin, but the resistance of CONS and/or S. aureus to macrolides and fluoroquinolones dramatically increased during the period of this study. Among Gram-negative bacteria, increasing levels of resistance to higher generation cephalosporins, to fluoroquinolones resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. to meropenem was recorded, which is alarming. The results were periodically submitted to cooperating hospitals with proposals for rationalizing the prophylactic and general use of indicated antibiotics as well as for improving hospital hygiene measures and anti-epidemic practices.
