Tipranavir (Aptivus) is a selective nonpeptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) that is used in the treatment of treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 infection. Tipranavir is administered orally twice daily and must be given in combination with low-dose ritonavir, which is used to boost its bioavailability. The durable efficacy of tipranavir, in combination with low-dose ritonavir (tipranavir/ritonavir 500 mg/200 mg twice daily), has been demonstrated in well designed trials in treatment-experienced adults infected with multidrug-resistant strains of HIV-1. In treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 infection receiving an optimized background regimen, viral suppression was greater and immunological responses were better with regimens containing tipranavir/ritonavir than with comparator ritonavir-boosted PI-containing regimens. The efficacy benefit appeared to be more marked in patients receiving two fully active drugs in the regimen, with the combination of tipranavir/ritonavir and enfuvirtide (for the first time) appearing to be the most successful. Although tipranavir is generally well tolerated, clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, and intracranial haemorrhage have been associated with the drug. Tipranavir also has a complex drug-interaction profile. Thus, tipranavir, administered with ritonavir, is an effective treatment option for use in the combination therapy of adults with HIV-1 infection who have been previously treated with other antiretroviral drugs.
