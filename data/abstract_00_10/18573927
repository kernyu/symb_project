Candida biofilm formation is common during infection and environmental growth. We tested the impacts of three biocides (ethanol [EtOH], H(2)O(2), and sodium dodecyl sulfate) on Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata biofilms. Higher concentrations of the biocides were required for efficacy against biofilms than for efficacy against planktonic controls. A combination study with two biocides (EtOH and H(2)O(2)) and fluconazole demonstrated that the combination had enhanced efficacy.
