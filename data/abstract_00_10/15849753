RNase L is responsible for the 2-5A host defense system, an RNA degradation pathway present in cells of higher vertebrates that functions in both the antiviral and anticellular activities of interferon. The activity of RNase L is tightly regulated and is exerted only in the presence of 2-5A. The postulated mechanism of its regulation is as follows: the N-terminal half ankyrin-repeat domain masks the C-terminal half nuclease domain in the absence of 2-5A. On binding 2-5A at the ankyrin-repeat domain, RNase L forms a homodimer and removes the ankyrin-repeat domain from the nuclease domain to become the active form. A conformational change in the ankyrin-repeat domain is a key step in this hypothetical mechanism, but there is as yet no evidence for such a change. To clarify the events induced by 2-5A binding, we established procedures for expression and purification of the ankyrin-repeat domain of human RNase L. Fluorescence spectra of the protein showed clear difference in the presence and absence of 2-5A. The alterations in the spectra supported conformational changes of the protein. Time-resolved anisotropy measurements indicated that 2-5A binding led to a significant decrease in the rotational radius of the protein. In addition, 2-5A provided the domain with resistance to protease digestion as a result of a conformational change. These results indicated that the ankyrin-repeat domain of RNase L constricts its structure by binding of 2-5A. This observation suggests a revised model of the 2-5A-induced activation of RNase L.
