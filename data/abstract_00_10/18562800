Invasion mechanisms of pathogens and counteracting defense mechanisms of plants are highly diverse and perpetually evolving. While most classical studies of plant defense have focused only on defense-specific factor-mediated responses, recent work is beginning to shed light on the involvement of non-stress signal components, especially growth and developmental processes. This shift in focus links plant resistance more closely with growth and development. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of how pathogens manipulate host developmental processes and, conversely, of how plants deploy their developmental processes for self-protection. We conclude by introducing our recent work on UNI, a novel R protein in Arabidopsis which mediates cross-talk between developmental processes and defense responses.
