The routine use of antibiotics as growth promoters is no longer acceptable, but there is a continuing requirement to treat infection occurring in herds or flocks and often it is necessary to treat all animals regardless of whether or not they are infected. To minimise the risk of the development of resistant strains the mode of treatment should be carefully considered in order to prevent the transfer of low levels of antibiotics to uninfected animals. Suitable veterinary input into the course of treatment should reduce the chance of transfer of resistant strains or resistance mechanisms to human strains of microorganisms.
