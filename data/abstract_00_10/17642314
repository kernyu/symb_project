The aim of the study was to evaluate the aminoglycoside resistance of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients. To the examination 35 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 18 of non-fermentative bacteria were included. Resistance to aminoglycosides (gentamicin (G), netilmicin (Nt), tobramycin (T), amikacin (A), kanamycin (K), neomycin (N)) was established by disk diffusion method. Interpretation of enzymatic mechanisms was performed by Livermore. The most common enzymes AAC(6')I were found in Enterobacteriaceae group (mostly in E. cloaceae and P. mirabilis) and AAC(3') and in non-fermentative bacteria: AAC(6')I in P. aeruginosa and APH(3')VI and AAC(3')I in A. baumanii. The most frequent phenotype was resistance to six antibiotics (G, Nt, T, A, K, N) Resistance rates were high for gentamicin (>70 %) in both groups and amikacin (88,89 %) in non-fermentatives.
