Continuing from our ongoing effort in modifying aminoglycoside antibiotics with the goal of counteracting drug resistant bacteria, we have further derivatized pyranmycin, a neomycin class aminoglycoside antibiotic, with modifications at O-6 and N-1 positions. The revealed SAR results demonstrated that the antibacterial activity of pyranmycin can be modulated by different acylic substituents at O-6. Among these results, the 6-O-aminoethyl derivative, JT050, showed effective activity against resistant strain Escherichia coli (pTZ19U-3) and E. coli (pSF815), which provides insight into further structural modifications.
