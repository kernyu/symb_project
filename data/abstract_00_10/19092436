Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has been commonly known to be found in hospital or healthcare settings; however, increased prevalence within the community has posed a concern to providers with treatment management and costs. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections typically present as skin and soft tissue infections but do not respond to typical skin and soft tissue infection treatment. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus can also lead to more serious systemic infections, even in the healthy individual.

Assessment, diagnosis, education, and treatments must be appropriate and meet the needs of the individual. Therefore, this article provides current assessment and treatment recommendations through a typical case study.
