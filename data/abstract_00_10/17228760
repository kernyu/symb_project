PURPOSE: To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and postantibiotic effect (PAE) of antibiotic eyedrops against various isolates from infectious keratitis samples. METHOD: MIC and postantibiotic bactericidal effect (PABE)/postantibiotic fungicidal effect (PAFE) after 4 min of exposure to nine antibacterial eyedrops or four antifungals were examined using 100 clinical isolates collected by the National Surveillance of Infectious Keratitis in Japan in 2003. RESULT: The PABEs of tobramycin and micronomicin sulfate showed better results than other drugs, and the other drugs demonstrated various PABEs depending on the bacterial strains; in particular most drugs showed low PABE against Serratia marcescens. There were no significant differences between PABEs of methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci. Also there was no statistical correlation between MIC and PABE of Staphylococci. All the antifungals demonstrated low PAFE against Candida spp. CONCLUSION: PABE/PAFEs vary among species of microorganisms, and since they have no relation with the usual MIC, various other factors, including species of isolates, actual clinical effects, and prevention of drug-resistance induction, should be considered in the selection of drugs.
