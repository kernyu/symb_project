OBJECTIVE: To investigate extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) production in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Shanghai, and compare the resistant rates of ESBLs-producing strains and non-ESBLs-producing strains to 11 antibiotics. METHODS: Double-disk synergy test was used to detect ESBLs in 1,026 strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae; Kirby-bauer agar diffusion method was used to judge drug sensitivity. RESULTS: 34.31% of strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae were considered ESBLs producers by double-disk synergy test. The prevalences of ESBLs in isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae were 37.40%, 30.21% and 41.82% respectively. Except Imipinem and Cefmetazole, the resistant rates of ESBLs-producing strains to other 9 antibiotics were much higher than that of non-ESBLs-producing strains(P < 0.01). The resistant rates of Imipinem to ESBLs-producing strains were the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ESBLs in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Shanghai was high; it is necessary for clinical laboratory to detect ESBLs in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae routinely. The resistant rates of ESBLs-producing strains to most antibiotics were high. Imipinem and Cefmetazole were the effective antibiotics to infections caused by ESBLs-producing strains.
