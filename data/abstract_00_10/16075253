The physiologic process of wound healing is impaired and prolonged in pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy. Due to profound immunosuppression, wound infection can easily spread and act as the source of sepsis. Referring to in vitro studies, which confirmed the antibacterial potency of special honey preparations against typical isolates of nosocomially acquired wound infections (including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci) and considering the encouraging reports from other groups, Medihoney has now been used in wound care at the Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital, University of Bonn for 3 years. Supplemented with clinical data from pediatric oncology patients, this article reviews the scientific background and our promising experience with Medihoney in wound care issues at our institution. To collect and analyze the available experience, we prepare an internet-based data documentation module for pediatric wound care with Medihoney.
