Streptogramins are polypeptide antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis by the prokaryotic ribosome. Gram-positive organisms are susceptible to streptogramins, while most gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant. We have found a genomic fragment from a Yersinia enterocolitica isolate with an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide similar to the virginiamycin acetyltransferases found in various plasmids from gram-positive bacteria. The susceptible Escherichia coli strain DB10 was transformed to resistance to the type A streptogramins and to mixed (A + B) streptogramins upon introduction of a plasmid containing that gene. In addition, we showed streptogramin acetylating activity in vitro dependent on the presence of the Y. enterocolitica sat gene. Southern blot hybridization experiments showed that the sat gene was present in all the Y. enterocolitica isolates examined. These data together show that the gene in the Y. enterocolitica chromosome encoded an active streptogramin acetyltransferase. The deduced sequence of the Y. enterocolitica Sat protein was close to those of sat gene products found in gram-positive bacteria and cyanobacteria, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.
