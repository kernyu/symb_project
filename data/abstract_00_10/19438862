BACKGROUND: Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are malignancies characterized by a clonal T-cell infiltrate involving the skin. CTCLs often show resistance to conventional antineoplastic chemotherapy. Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine analogue which has shown efficacy and a favourable safety profile in solid tumours and haematological malignancies. OBJECTIVES: We report a multicentre retrospective study of 23 patients who received gemcitabine for advanced-stage CTCL and emphasize the high incidence of serious unusual adverse events. METHODS: We collected data from 23 patients with refractory CTCL (14 mycosis fungoides, six Sezary syndrome and three other CTCL). Gemcitabine was given weekly within a 21- or 28-day schedule. Response was evaluated after three and six cycles of chemotherapy. For each patient, all adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients who received at least three cycles of gemcitabine, 10 achieved a response (62.5%). Only five patients reached the sixth cycle of treatment and four still had a favourable response. Haematological toxicity was recorded in 15 cases with severe grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in seven patients (30%) and six serious infections (26%). Other serious adverse events were observed in six cases (26%): one haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, one severe capillary leak syndrome, one acute heart failure related to cardiac arrhythmia, two bullous and erosive dermatitis, and one recurrent influenza-like syndrome with altered general condition. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the early efficacy of gemcitabine in advanced-stage CTCL. However, our results contradict the safety profile of gemcitabine previously reported and underline the high incidence of severe complications including visceral and cutaneous involvement.
