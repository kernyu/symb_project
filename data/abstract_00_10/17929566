Current understanding of the involvement of salicylic acid (SA) in the formation of plant resistance has been reviewed. SA acts as a signal molecule in the SA-dependent pathway. The so-called salicylate burst observed in tissues of plants after stress increases their resistance. The mechanism whereby SA induces plant resistance depends on the ability of this compound to inhibit the enzymes of the antioxidant system of plants, which results in the accumulation of active oxygen species and expression of defense genes.
