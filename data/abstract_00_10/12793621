Pneumonia is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek emergency care. It is a challenging infection in that the spectrum of illness ranges from the nontoxic patient appropriate for outpatient antibiotics to the critically ill patient requiring intensive care hospitalization. Current data and diagnostic technology provide the emergency physician with the tools for an appropriately rapid evaluation and consideration of the differential diagnosis. Key critical thinking and application of published findings allow for intelligent empirical antibiotic treatment and risk stratification for the best disposition. Although antibiotic-resistant organisms increasingly are being identified, patients continue to benefit from early institution of standard ED treatment. Coverage for atypical organisms improves patient response and outcome. Finally, identification and treatment of the complications of pneumonia and accompanying sepsis must be considered by the ED physician when evaluating critically ill patients.
