Antituberculous drugs for current therapy of multidrugs resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are limited. The in vitro susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) as well as MDR-TB with other antibiotic drugs were determined in order to find alternative drugs for the treatment of MDR-TB. Forty-seven MDR-TB and 62 MTB of clinical isolates were tested against levofloxacin and ofloxacin. The MDR-TB at the MIC90 of levofloxacin and ofloxcain were 1 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Of these MTB, the MIC90 of both drugs were 0.5 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml, respectively. It seemed that levofloxacin MICs of both MDR-TB and MTB were one dilution less than ofloxcin. The promising activity of ofloxacin and levofloxacin against MDR-TB and MTB suggest that both drugs could be used as second-line drugs for MDR-TB or as a good alternative antituberculous drug for patients who have intolerance to the first line drug.
