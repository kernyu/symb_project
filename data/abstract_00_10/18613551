A study was conducted during January 2003 through August 2005, at two community health centers in south Jakarta, Indonesia, to detect nontyphoidal Salmonella infections in children with diarrhea. A total of 814 rectal swab samples were collected, of which 56 (6.9%) were positive for Salmonella. Among the serovars detected, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was found most frequently in 32.1% of all Salmonella isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using eight antibiotics showed 5.6% to 66.7% of Salmonella serovars resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. However, all serovars were susceptible to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.
