The aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance to fracture of endodontically treated teeth with flared canals restored with different post and core restorations under static and cyclic fatigue loadings. Sixty human maxillary central incisors were used. Two main groups (non-ferrule and 1-mm ferrule) were divided into three types of restoration: custom cast post-and-core (MPC), resin composite post-and-core (RCP), and resin composite core in combination with prefabricated carbon fiber post (FRC). Half of each group was subjected to a static loading test, and the other to a cyclic fatigue test. FRC exhibited a significantly higher number of load cycles than the other groups, and MPC showed the highest failure load among the tested groups. However, all FRC and MPC specimens demonstrated unfavorable root fractures. The results of this study suggested that RCP prepared with 1-mm ferrule was the most desirable restoration for structurally compromised roots, as relatively strong resistance to cyclic fatigue and fracture was revealed--given that all RCP specimens demonstrated favorable root fracture.
