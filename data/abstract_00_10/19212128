This report illustrates that the beta-androstenes are indeed able to upregulate the host immune response to a level that enables the host to resist lethal infection by viruses or bacteria. These agents consist of a subgroup of steroids, which also mediates a rapid recovery of hematopoietic precursor cells after whole-body lethal radiation injury. In vivo, the androstenes increase the levels of the Th1 cytokines such as IL-2, IL-3, and IFN. Similar to hydrocortisone, they suppress inflammation, but without immune suppression, and have a role in the maintenance of the Th1/Th2 balance and immune homeostasis.
