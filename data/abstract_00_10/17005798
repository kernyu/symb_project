The case is reported of a patient with cavitary sarcoidosis complicated by an aspergilloma caused by an itraconazole-resistant strain of Aspergillus fumigatus, who was treated with voriconazole. The authors suggest that susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains is of value during long-term therapy with itraconazole, and that voriconazole may be a good option for treatment of patients infected with itraconazole-resistant strains of A. fumigatus.
