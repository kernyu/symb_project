Salicylate was shown to increase the frequency at which a fusidic acid-susceptible strain of Staphylococcus aureus underwent mutation to become fusidic acid-resistant. These fusidic acid-resistant mutants had alterations in spectinomycin and kanamycin resistance levels indicative of mutations in fusA, the gene that encodes elongation factor-G, the target of fusidic acid.
