In industrialized countries, highly active antiretroviral therapy has resulted in significant reductions in morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV/AIDS. At the same time, the management of the HIV-infected individual has become exceedingly complex due to the increasing number of antiretroviral medications and resistance to them. New medications are needed that are effective against the drug-resistant virus. The key advances in the management of HIV/AIDS as seen through the eyes of a front-line HIV physician who has been actively involved in patient care, clinical drug trials and as an educator for the past 15 years will be discussed.
