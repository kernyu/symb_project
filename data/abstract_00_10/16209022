The present-day problems in tuberculosis control are associated with a difficulty in detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) in due time and in determining its drug sensitivity by conventional microbiological assays. The determination of the drug sensitivity of MBT takes much time from 2 weeks to 3 months, which fails to initiate and perform specific therapy timely. Molecular genetic techniques, including biochip analysis, yield results in 24-48 hours, which solves the problem of choosing and initiating adequate antibacterial therapy in the shortest possible time after tuberculosis is diagnosed. To assess the situation associated with the prevalence of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, by using the biochip analysis, the authors have examined 501 patients with tuberculosis who live in the Kyrghyz Republic. Drug resistance has been found in 40.3% of the examinees. At the same time, their primary and secondary drug resistance is 25.7 and 61.8%, respectively. In tuberculosis patients living in Kyrghyzstan, rifampicin resistance of MBT is more frequently due to mutations in 531 (59.2%), 526 (20.8%), and 516 (8.0%) codons in the rpoB gene.
