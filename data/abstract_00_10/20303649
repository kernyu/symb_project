The present study was undertaken to estimate the therapeutic benefit to down-regulate the MUC4 mucin for reversing chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer (PC) stem/progenitor cells and their progenies. The results have revealed that MUC4 mucin is overexpressed in CD133(+) and CD133(-) pancreatic cells (PCs) detected in patient's adenocarcinoma tissues while no significant expression was seen in normal pancreatic tissues. The gain- and loss-of-function analyses have indicated that the overexpression of MUC4 in PC lines is associated with a higher resistance to the anti-proliferative, anti-invasive and apoptotic effects induced by gemcitabine. Importantly, the treatment of the MUC4-overexpressing CD18/HPAF-Src cells with gemcitabine resulted in an enrichment of the side population (SP) cells expressing CD133 while the total PC cells including non-SP cells detected in MUC4 knockdown CD18/HPAF-shMUC4 cells were responsive to the cytotoxic effects induced by gemcitabine. These data suggest that the MUC4 down-regulation may constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for improving the efficacy of gemcitabine to eradicate the total PC cell mass, and thereby preventing disease relapse.
