The present study investigates the oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by conventional ozonation and the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The major degradation products identified were methanesulfinate, methanesulfonate, formaldehyde, and formic acid in ozonation process. The subsequent degradation of intermediates shows that methanesulfonate is more resistance to ozonation, which reduces the mineralization rate of DMSO. The effect of t-butanol addition and ozone gas flow dosage on the degradation rate was evaluated. The rate constant of the reaction of ozone (k(D)) with DMSO was found to be 0.4162 M(-1)S(-1). In the second part of this study, DMSO degradation and TOC mineralization were investigated using O(3)/UV, O(3)/H(2)O(2) and UV/H(2)O(2) processes. In all theses processes the degradation of target organics is more pronounced than TOC removal. The efficiencies of these processes were evaluated and discussed. The formation of sulfate ion in all AOPs have been identified and compared with other processes. Overall it can be concluded that ozonation and ozone-based AOPs are promising processes for an efficient removal of DMSO in wastewater.
