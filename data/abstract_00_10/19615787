In this study we evaluated the pharmacologic costs of hepatitis C treatment, considering recommendations on both the duration of therapy and sustained virological response. With this aim, we analyzed relevant scientific articles published in the previous 10 years, considering the most common genotypes present in Spain. In this analysis, we estimated overall costs to be 1,636,524.58-1,761,365.73 euro and 1,794.586.39-1,917,013.73 euro with the use of pegylated interferon (PegIFN)-alpha-2a and PegIFN-alpha-2b, respectively. Sustained virological response was 59.18% and 64.58% respectively, with no significant difference between the two formulations. Finally, we assess the economic costs of the use of high-dose PegIFN-alpha-2a and ribavirin in patients with genotype 1 and treatment resistance (baseline HCV-RNA values > 800.000UI/ml, without early viral response at 12 weeks and weight > 85kg).
