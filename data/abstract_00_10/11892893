The study was initiated to determine the in vitro activity and MIC/disk test comparisons of BMS284756, a new des-fluoro(6)-quinolone, against isolates of staphylococci and enterococci from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 2000. Isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. Against 3,789 strains of gram-positive cocci from the SENTRY Program (2000), the BMS284756 MIC90 and percentage susceptible at < or = 2 and < or = 4 microg/ml were: Staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml; 89.3 and 97.1%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 4 microg/ml; 86.1 and 96.0%) and enterococci (> 4 microg/ml; 62.0 and 76.2%). Also tested were selected staphylococci (300 strains) and enterococci (102 strains) by two standardized methods. The activity of BMS284756 was highly correlated with oxacillin resistance among staphylococci. Oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were all inhibited by BMS284756 at < or = 0.5 microg/ml, whereas oxacillin-resistant strains required inhibitory concentrations of > or = 1 microg/ml. Excellent correlation was observed between the MIC and 5-microg disk zone diameter for staphylococci and enterococci (r=0.91 to 0.93). Among vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, 67% of Enterococcus faecalis, 25% of E. faecium, and 76% of other Enterococcus spp. isolates were inhibited by BMS284756 at < or = 2 microg/ml. All vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; 11 E. faecalis and 15 E. faecium) were inhibited by > or = 2 microg/ml of BMS284756. Among the non-VRE, non-faecium enterococcal isolates (n=64), 62% were inhibited by < or = 0.5 microg/ml. BMS284756 showed excellent activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and moderate activity against enterococci other than VRE and E. faecium. Acceptable correlations were observed between MIC and disk test results for both tested genus groups.
