In the present work primary antimicrobial resistance was analyzed in clinical H. pylori strain isolates from adult patients from Polish Wielkopolska region within the last 10 years. Drug sensitivity was evaluated in a total of 142 H. pylori isolates, with 66 strains originating from years 1997/1998 forming group 1 and 76 strains isolated in 2007/2008 forming group 2. Sensitivity to amoxicillin, tetracycline, metronidazole and clarithromycin was determined by E-test. All strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and tetracycline. On the other hand, a high proportion of strains resistant to metronidazole was determined (36.4% in group 1 and 44.7% in group 2). In parallel, a growing tendency was discovered for resistance to clarithromycin (9.1% strains resistant in group 1 and 18.4% isolates resistant in group 2). The studies confirm the need for monitoring the drug resistance of Helicobacter pylori strains.
