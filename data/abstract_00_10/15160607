To emphasise the role of outer and inner membranes in the resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to bactericidal activity of various disinfectants, spheroplasts and whole cells were compared. Spheroplasts are more sensitive than whole cells to quaternary ammonium compounds such as didecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) and C16-benzalkonium chloride. The outer membrane acts as a barrier to prevent these disinfectants from entering the cell. It seems to have no influence on activities of smaller molecules such as C12, C14-benzalkonium chlorides and sodium dichloroisocyanurate. For tri-sodium phosphate, the presence of outer membrane emphasized the action of the molecule. Moreover, resistance of DDAB-adapted spheroplasts to bactericidal activity of DDAB is higher than the resistance of non-adapted spheroplasts. This suggests that the inner membrane could also play a role in resistance to DDAB.
