OBJECTIVE: To determine the in vitro fluoroquinolone susceptibility profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from dogs with ulcerative keratitis. Animals-27 dogs with P. aeruginosa-associated ulcerative keratitis. PROCEDURES: P. aeruginosa isolates from dogs with ulcerative keratitis were collected during a 3-year period. Isolates were tested by use of the disk diffusion method for their susceptibility to 7 fluoroquinolones that are available as commercial ophthalmic preparations. The antimicrobials included second- (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and lomefloxacin), third- (levofloxacin), and fourth-generation (gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin) fluoroquinolones. Isolates were designated as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to the various antimicrobials. The percentage of susceptible isolates was compared among individual fluoroquinolones and among fluoroquinolone generations. RESULTS: None of the dogs had received topical or systemic fluoroquinolone treatment prior to referral. Twenty-seven P. aeruginosa isolates were collected during the study period. In vitro, bacterial resistance to the tested fluoroquinolones was infrequently identified (24/ 27 isolates were susceptible to all fluoroquinolones evaluated); susceptibility percentages ranged from 88.9% to 100% for individual antimicrobials. There were no significant differences among isolate susceptibilities to the individual antimicrobials or among generations of fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: On the basis of these in vitro data, none of the 7 evaluated fluoroquinolones (individually or collectively by generation) appeared to offer a clinically important advantage in the treatment of P. aeruginosa-associated ulcerative keratitis in dogs. Among the P. aeruginosa isolates collected from dogs with ulcerative keratitis in this study, the likelihood of susceptibility to the fluoroquinolones evaluated was high.
