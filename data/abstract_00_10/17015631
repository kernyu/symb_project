Eighty-four isolates belonging to eight species that constitute the Pseudallescheria boydii complex were tested against 11 antifungal agents by using the microdilution method. There were significant differences among the species, with Scedosporium aurantiacum being the most resistant. In general, voriconazole was the most active drug, followed by posaconazole.
