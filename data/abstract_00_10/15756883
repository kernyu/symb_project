BACKGROUND: Although guidelines for multidrug-resistant organisms generally include recommendations for contact precautions and surveillance cultures, it is not known how frequently U.S. hospitals implement these measures on a routine basis and whether infectious diseases consultants endorse their use. METHODS: The Emerging Infections Network surveyed its members, infectious diseases consultants, to assess their use of and support for contact precautions and surveillance cultures for routine management of multidrug-resistant organisms in their principal inpatient workplace. Specifically, members were asked about use of these strategies for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and multidrug-resistant, gram-negative bacilli on general wards, ICUs, and transplant units. RESULTS: Overall, 400 (86%) of 463 respondents supported the routine use of contact precautions to control one or more multidrug-resistant organisms in at least one unit, and 89% worked in hospitals that use them. In contrast, 50% of respondents favored routine use of surveillance cultures to manage at least one multidrug-resistant organism in any unit, and 30% of respondents worked in hospitals that use them routinely in any unit. Members favored routine use of surveillance cultures significantly more in ICUs and transplant units than in general wards for each multidrug-resistant organism (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the infectious diseases consultants endorsed the use of contact precautions for routine management of patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms and work in hospitals that have implemented them. In contrast, infectious diseases consultants are divided about the role of routine surveillance cultures in multidrug-resistant organism management, and few work in hospitals that use them.
