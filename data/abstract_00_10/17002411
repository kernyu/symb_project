The current control of parasitic nematodes in small ruminants relies on the use of chemical anthelmintics, but the development of resistance requires research in alternatives. Bioactive plants represent one of those solutions. Previous results suggest that plants rich in condensed tannins (CTs) might have direct anthelmintic effects. However, the relationships between the biochemistry of active compounds and the mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated. Therefore, this study examined in vitro the effects of different CT monomers on the exsheathment of infective larvae for two nematode species. Monomers of prodelphinidins were more potent inhibitors of exsheathment than those of procyanidins. More severe inhibition was also found with galloyl derivatives. These results suggest that the number of free hydroxy groups of CT monomers is a key factor in interactions with parasite larvae. Comparison of effects between the two nematodes suggests different susceptibility to monomers depending on species, which might be related to the protein composition of sheaths.
