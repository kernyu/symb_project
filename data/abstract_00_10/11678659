Bioassay-guided fractionation of Machaerium multiflorum yielded the hitherto unreported (+)-trans-hexahydrodibenzopyrans machaeriol A (1) and machaeriol B (2), as well as the known guaiane sesquiterpene (-)-kessane. Structure elucidation was based on (1)H and (13)C NMR data, mainly 2D NMR (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMQC, (1)H-(13)C HMBC, and (1)H-(1)H NOESY experiments. This is the first report of the hexahydrodibenzopyrans from a higher plant other than the genus Cannabis. The cannabimimetic activity was thus evaluated by radioligand binding assay for cannabinoid receptor CB1, which indicated, notably, that both 1 and 2 were inactive. In addition, the cross reactivity of 1 and 2 toward antibodies designed for urinary metabolites of cannabinoids was evaluated with the EMIT and On Line cannabinoids assays. Both compounds showed no response at 100 000 ng/mL in both assays. Machaeriol B (2) demonstrated in vitro antimalarial activity (IC(50) = 120 ng/mL) against Plasmodium falciparum W-2 clone.
