The use of gatifloxacin (GAT) in combination with ethionamide (ETA) with or without pyrazinamide (PZA) for a 12-week treatment period followed by an 8-week observation period was evaluated in a model of tuberculosis in mice. Mice treated with GAT at 300 mg/kg of body weight in combination with ETA (25 mg/kg) for 5 days per week had sterile lungs, whereas mice treated with GAT (100 mg/kg) and ETA (25 mg/kg) had about 10 CFU/lung; however, there was regrowth of the organisms in both groups at the end of the observation period. When PZA (450 mg/kg 5 days per week) was added to the high-dose GAT-ETA regimen, no viable mycobacteria were present after the 8-week observation period. GAT in combination with ETA and PZA has great promise for the treatment of tuberculosis.
