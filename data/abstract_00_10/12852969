Replacement of the pyridylmethyl moiety in indinavir with a pyridyl oxazole yielded HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PI) with greatly improved potency against PI-resistant HIV-1 strains. A meta-methoxy group on the pyridyl ring and a gem-dimethyl methyl linkage afforded compound 10 with notable in vitro antiviral activity against HIV-1 viral strains with reduced susceptibility to the clinically available PIs. Compound 10 also demonstrated favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics in animal models.
