The present study involves collecting 125 isolates labeled as C. albicans from five different Lebanese hospitals and utilizing the microsatellite genotyping test to determine the following: first, the accuracy of hospital identification by comparing microsatellite results to hospital results. Second, the frequency and genotypes of infectious strains present relative to tissue and hospital location--a possible indicator of nosocomial infection, and third, a possible relationship between lack of microsatellite heterozygosity to azole resistance. Our results showed that the error in hospital identification varied from 2 to 33%, averaging at 7%, with the highest identification error in stool. Misidentified isolates were mainly Candida tropicalis followed by C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. Strains with similar genotypes were also found to occur within certain hospitals suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. Finally, a relationship between lack of heterozygosity and azole resistance was observed since nine out of 10 homozygous isolates sharing a common allele with a heterozygote strain were sensitive to all drugs tested, whereas the homozygous genotype was resistant to at least one drug.
