This study was performed to detect LfrA and Tap efflux pumps among clinical isolates of non-pigmented rapidly growing mycobacteria (NPRGM). Gene detection was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers designed for each gene. Susceptibility of the strains to doxycycline, tigecycline and ciprofloxacin was analysed using the broth microdilution reference technique. In total, 166 clinical isolates were included in the study. The lfrA gene was detected in four strains (2.4%), comprising two strains of Mycobacterium chelonae (6.7% of this species), one Mycobacterium fortuitum (1.1%) and one Mycobacterium mucogenicum (14.3%). The tap gene was detected in 109 strains (65.7%), comprising 3 Mycobacterium abscessus (33.3%), 12 M. chelonae (40%), 75 M. fortuitum (84.3%), 2 Mycobacterium mageritense (40%), 15 Mycobacterium peregrinum (68.2%), 1 Mycobacterium alvei and 1 Mycobacterium porcinum; no strains of M. mucogenicum were tap-positive. No differences between tap-positive and -negative strains were observed for resistance to doxycycline (Fisher's exact test, P=0.055). lfrA is rare among clinical isolates of NPRGM, whilst tap is found more commonly. No correlation was detected between the presence of the efflux pumps and resistance to quinolones or tetracyclines.
