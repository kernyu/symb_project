The aim of the survey was to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of the combination therapy cefepime and amikacin in the initial treatment of haematology patients with febrile neutropaenia. Two hundred twenty (220) episodes of febrile neutropaenia were analysed in 54 males and 82 females (median age 58 years), most patients had a severe neutropaenia with in 72% of all periods a neutrophil count of less than 100. Microbiological infection was confirmed in 72 cases (32.8%). Sixty-one (61) bacteria were isolated from blood cultures of which 22 were identified as Gram-negative bacteria and 38 as Gram-positive bacteria. Sixty-three (63) episodes (28.6%) were clinically documented, 85 episodes (38.6%) were fever of unknown origin. Clinical cure was achieved in 123 febrile episodes (56%) after initiation of the current antibiotic protocol; another 22 patients (10%) became afebrile after modifying the initial antibiotic regimen 48 hours or longer after treatment initiation. In 61 cases (27.7%) there was persistent fever or re-occurrence of fever, these cases were considered as treatment failure. Eight patients (3.6%) died during the study. This survey has demonstrated that the combination therapy with cefepime and amikacin can be considered as an effective treatment for febrile neutropaenia in high-risk haematological patients in our centre with a high incidence of resistance to Gram-negative bacteria.
