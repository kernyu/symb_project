The aim of the study was to compare the antimicrobial resistance pattern of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from urban and rural peripheral health centres and from sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attendees. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 191 N. gonorrhoeae isolates (165 isolates from STD clinic attendees and 26 from peripheral health centres) was carried out in Delhi, India, using the calibrated dichotomous sensitivity technique for penicillin, tetracycline, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin and nalidixic acid, and minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using E-test. Penicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-resistant, penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae and tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains were higher in STD clinic attendees than in peripheral health centres, probably because of less antibiotic pressure in the peripheral areas. High-level resistance to ciprofloxacin and multiresistant strains were also higher in STD clinic attendees. The present study emphasizes the importance of surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae in different population subgroups in order to monitor the spread of multiresistant strains and to update the national treatment recommendations.
