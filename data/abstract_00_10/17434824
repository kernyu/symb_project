The prevalence of Escherichia coli among the uropathogens routinely isolated in non-hospital laboratories (Labs) and its susceptibility profiles were investigated. Thirty-three Labs were selected throughout Italy. In vitro assays were performed by means of disk diffusion according to the CLSI. Females were prevalent (79.9%) and the mean patient age was 58.6 (sd 20.4) years. Overall, the prevalence of E. coli was 55.3% (1375 strains), with Enterococcus spp 10.2 %, Proteus mirabilis 4.8%, coagulase-negative staphylococci 4.3% and Klebsiella 3.8% being the next most frequently encountered species. High compliance with quality control program was observed. Susceptibility figures in E. coli were consistently low for many antimicrobial agents such as ampicillin (51.3%) and co-trimoxazole (74.6%) and higher for others such as gentamicin (87.9%) and ceftazidime (95.1%). Resistance rates were higher among male patients and increased according to the patient's age.
