The prevalence of Stapylococcus bacteriaemia is increasing worldwide, because of the increasing use of invasive procedures leading to nosocomial infections, but also of a changing way of life (increasing fashion for tattoos or piercing, use of intravenous drugs). Infective endocarditis develops in 10-30% of the cases of staphylococcus bacteriaemia. Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis must be suspected when it develops in the year following heart surgery or implantation of permanent devices. In drug users, it usually involves the tricuspid valve. According to the resistance of the germ to meticillin, antibiotic therapy uses a combination of intravenous penicillin or glycopeptide and an aminoside. Other antibiotics such as fosfomycin, rifampicin, fusidic acid, or clindamycin can be used when aminosides are contra-indicated. The role of newer antibiotic agents, such as daptomycin or linezolide, remains to be established.
