We investigated the efficacy of gemcitabine and vinorelbine (Gem/Vin) combination chemotherapy as a salvage and mobilization regimen in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed the data of our relapsed or primary refractory HL patients treated with Gem/Vin regimen which consisted of gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2)/day and vinorelbine 30 mg/m(2)/day on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. The overall response rate was 72.4%. Ten (34.5%) patients achieved complete remission, 11 (37.9%) partial remission, and eight (27.6%) patients had no response. Mobilization with Gem/Vin regimen was successful in 20/23 (87%) patients while mobilization failure was seen in three (13%) patients. Gemcitabine and vinorelbine is an effective salvage regimen with acceptable toxicity and high mobilization potential in relapsed or refractory HL patients.
