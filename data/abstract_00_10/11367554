Several methods were used to type 64 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) derived from hospitals in Morocco. The clinical isolates originated principally from blood cultures and wound sources. These isolates provided the opportunity to substantially compare the proficiency of developing molecular techniques with conventional phenotypic tests for use in the identification of clinical staphylococci. The following molecular methods were examined: Utility ribotyping analysis (Ribotyping); PCR analysis performed with 16S-23S ribosomal-DNA intergenic spacer (ITS-PCR); PCR-based random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The results obtained by the molecular techniques were contrasted to those of conventional phenotypic tests. Conventional phenotypic tests allowed the outright recognition of the majority of isolates (50/64). These 50 isolates were subdivided into 33 novobiocin-susceptible and 17 novobiocin-resistant strains of CNS. However, 2 other novobiocin-susceptible and 12 other novobiocin-resistant isolates remained unclassified by these tests. There was a good agreement between the conventional phenotypic tests and RAPD for the 33 novobiocin-susceptible isolates. But, the RAPD technique permitted the assignment of the two unidentified novobiocin-susceptible isolates to the Staphylococcus hominis species. A complete correlation was obtained between the three molecular tools for recognition of the 12 novobiocin-resistant isolates that were not identified by phenotypic typing; these were in fact identified as 5 Staphylococcus cohnii and 4 Staphylococcus equorum. Three isolates remained unidentified by all three systems of molecular techniques.
