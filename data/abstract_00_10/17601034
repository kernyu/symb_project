The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance testing of bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens from patients hospitalized in three Intensive Care Units in Wroclaw. The susceptibility of bacteria (107 strains) to selected antibiotics was determined. The results clearly show that non-fermentative rods were identified as the main agents causing pneumonia (58% of isolates). The second commonest pathogens were Gram-positive cocci (29%). The P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae strains were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime and cefotaxime. All isolates of A. baumanii were susceptible only to imipenem. The rods of K. pneumoniae and E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, about 55% strains of both bacteria were sensitive to other antibiotics, except piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem and ciprofloxacin. About 90% of methicillin resistant S. epidermidis strains were resistant to all antibiotics, except vancomycin (100% isolates were sensitive). ESBL were detected among E. cloace, K. pneumoniae and E. coli. We found P. aeruginosa rods producing MBL.
