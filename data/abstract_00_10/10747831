Ten quinolone-resistant mutants of Citrobacter freundii, which were selected in vitro with fluoroquinolones from two clinical isolates, were studied. The parent isolates were susceptible to quinolones in spite of showing a single substitution in the GyrB (His-417 --> Leu). No change was observed in the outer membrane proteins or in the lipopolysaccharide in any of the ten mutants studied with respect to their parent isolates. The development of quinolone resistance in selected mutants was associated with the appearance of a substitution in the GyrA (Thr-83 --> Ile) in nine of the ten mutants plus enhanced active efflux in all of them.
