The HIV-1 gp41 has been identified as an important target for the immune response, for the development of antiviral and vaccine strategies, and for epidemiologic studies. This study describes the HIV-1 env gp41 region mutations, associated with enfuvirtide (ENF) resistance, in proviral DNA from PBMCs in antiretroviral treatment-naive individuals from Pune, India. Twenty-one antiretroviral drug-naive chronically HIV-1-infected individuals were enrolled. The study sequences belonged to subtype C (n = 17), subtype A1 (n = 2), and CRF_AE (n = 2). In subtype B-infected individuals, the various HR1 region substitutions in env gp41 that have been associated with ENF resistance include A30V, L33S/T/V, L34M, G36D/E/S/V, I37T/K/V, V38A/M/E/G, Q39R, Q40H, N42T/D, N43D/K/S, L44M, L45M, R46M, L54M, and Q56K/R as well as N126K and S138A in the HR2 region. The study sequences did not reveal any ENF resistance-associated mutations at env gp41 amino acid positions: 36 to 45. The presence of L54M and Q56K in combination is associated with 5-fold reduced sensitivity to inhibition by ENF. The mutation L54M was seen in seven subtype C and two CRF_AE study sequences. Q56K was observed in a subtype A1 sequence. All the study sequences harbored N42S, a natural polymorphism associated with increased susceptibility to ENF. Of the mutations V38A and N140I, known to provide immunologic gain, the latter was observed in four subtype C sequences. This is the first study from India highlighting the presence of certain mutations in Indian subtype C env gp41, which may play a role in the evolution of subtype-specific variations in the resistance to ENF and associated immune response.
