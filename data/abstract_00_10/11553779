We report that complete protection against malaria and total inhibition of liver stage development and parasitemia was obtained in 100% of BALB/c mice primed with a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus expressing the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium yoelii (AdPyCS), followed by a booster with an attenuated recombinant vaccinia virus, expressing the same malaria antigen, VacPyCS. We found increased levels of activated CS-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells, higher anti-sporozoite antibody titers, and greater protection in these mice, when the time between priming and boosting with these two viral vectors was extended from 2 to 8 or more weeks. Most importantly, by using this immunization regimen, the protection of the immunized mice was found to be long-lasting, namely complete resistance to infection of all animals 3 1/2 months after priming. These results indicate that immunization with AdPyCS generates highly effective memory T and B cells that can be recalled long after priming by boosting with VacPyCS.
