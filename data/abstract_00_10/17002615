A set of 18 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, collected prospectively in a Bulgarian hospital during episodes of increased A. baumannii occurrence during 2000-2002, was investigated for genotypic diversity and antibiotic susceptibility. Four genotypes were identified by amplified fragment length polymorphism genomic fingerprinting, one of which (type 1) accounted for 13 isolates, indicating that a specific strain was predominant. The single isolate allocated to type 2 was identified to European clone I. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, but most retained susceptibility to tobramycin and colistin, and all except one were susceptible to imipenem.
