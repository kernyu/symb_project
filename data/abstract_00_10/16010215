Gonorrhoea is currently the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection in England and Wales (Public Health Laboratory Service, 2002). Early initiation of treatment is important in the reduction of the onward transmission of infection and contributes to the overall control of the spread of gonorrhoea. A central tenet of this is the use of effective antimicrobial treatment. Both global and local surveillance programmes have successfully generated robust data, identifying the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance when using fluoroquinolones, formerly a first-line treatment for genital infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. As a result of this evidence base, the first-line treatment recommendations in England and Wales were changed. It is now recommended that anogenital gonorrhoea is treated with third generation cephalosporins, with either a 400 mg single oral dose of cefixime, or a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg. This change in 2004 in first-line treatment exemplifies the application and delivery of evidence-based treatment and care.
