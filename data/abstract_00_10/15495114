BACKGROUND: Early acquired infection may cause severe illness or death in the neonatal period. Prompt treatment with antibiotics has shown to reduce mortality. It is not clear which antibiotic regimen is suitable for treatment of presumed early neonatal sepsis. OBJECTIVES: To compare effectiveness and adverse effects of antibiotic regimens for treatment of presumed early neonatal sepsis. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2003), EMBASE (1980 to September 2003) and ZETOC (1993 to August 2003) databases were searched for possible studies. Pharmaceutical companies were contacted for any unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies comparing antibiotic regimens for the treatment of early neonatal sepsis (both monotherapies and combination therapies). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both reviewers screened abstracts and full reports against the inclusion criteria, appraised the quality of and extracted data from papers. For dichotomous outcomes, treatment effect was expressed as relative risk with 95% confidence interval. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Two small studies had compared monotherapy with combination therapy. There was no significant difference in mortality, treatment failure or bacteriological resistance. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence from randomised trials to suggest that any antibiotic regimen may be better than any other in the treatment of presumed early neonatal sepsis. More studies are needed to resolve this issue.
