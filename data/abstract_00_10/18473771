Polyclonality is defined as the occurrence of different genotypes of a bacterial species. We are of the opinion that these different clones originate within the patient. When infections and outbreaks occur, the terms of polyclonal infections and polyclonal outbreaks have been used, respectively. The origin of polyclonality has never been reported, although some authors suggest the acquisition of different clones from different animate and inanimate sources. We think that the gut of the critically ill patient with microbial overgrowth is the ideal site for the de-novo development of new clones, following increased spontaneous mutation.
