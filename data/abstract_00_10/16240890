Following the recent improvement of efficacy of treatment regimens, HIV disease is now considered as a chronic infection needing long term therapy. Potential for occurrence of resistance to antiretrovirals and long term side effects, particularly metabolic and cardiovascular complications, are the major constraints of this approach. New strategies are currently under evaluation aiming to improve treatment efficacy and patient's quality of life. The major challenge remains access to care in developing countries, particularly in Africa, where only a minority of patients have access to treatment today.
