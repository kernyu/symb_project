To investigate the response of Streptococcus pneumoniae to three distinct antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), bacitracin, nisin, and LL-37, transcriptome analysis of challenged bacteria was performed. Only a limited number of genes were found to be up- or downregulated in all cases. Several of these common highly induced genes were chosen for further analysis, i.e., SP0385-SP0387 (SP0385-0387 herein), SP0912-0913, SP0785-0787, SP1714-1715, and the blp gene cluster. Deletion of these genes in combination with MIC determinations showed that several putative transporters, i.e., SP0785-0787 and SP0912-0913, were indeed involved in resistance to lincomycin and LL-37 and to bacitracin, nisin, and lincomycin, respectively. Mutation of the blp bacteriocin immunity genes resulted in an increased sensitivity to LL-37. Interestingly, a putative ABC transporter (SP1715) protected against bacitracin and Hoechst 33342 but conferred sensitivity to LL-37. A GntR-like regulator, SP1714, was identified as a negative regulator of itself and two of the putative transporters. In conclusion, we show that resistance to three different AMPs in S. pneumoniae is mediated by several putative ABC transporters, some of which have not been associated with antimicrobial resistance in this organism before. In addition, a GntR-like regulator that regulates two of these transporters was identified. Our findings extend the understanding of defense mechanisms of this important human pathogen against antimicrobial compounds and point toward novel proteins, i.e., putative ABC transporters, which can be used as targets for the development of new antimicrobials.
