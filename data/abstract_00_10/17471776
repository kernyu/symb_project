European countries differ with regard to the occurrence of resistant micro-organisms. This indicates that the development of resistance can be influenced. Resistance levels are low in the Netherlands, but the resistance to various antibiotics is increasing. Factors that are known to contribute to antibiotic resistance are: the dosage and duration of antibiotic exposure and the type of antibiotic used in combination with a specific micro-organism. The selection pressure can be decreased by making use of antibiotics with a narrow spectrum. A new pharmacodynamic finding is that the dosage of antibiotics can be regulated in a way that minimises the selection of resistant clones. Implementation ofnational guidelines for the treatment of infections will contribute to more efficient use of antibiotics and the control of antibiotic resistance in the Netherlands.
