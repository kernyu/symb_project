Culture of human cells with human interferon alpha and beta (IFNA and IFNB) results in increased resistance of the cells to cell killing by X rays. To identify candidate genes responsible for the IFN-induced X-ray resistance, we searched for genes whose expression levels are increased in human RSa cells treated with IFNA, using an mRNA differential display method and Northern blotting analysis. RSa cells, which showed increased survival (assayed by colony formation) after X irradiation when they were treated with IFNA prior to irradiation, showed increased expression levels of LEU13 (IFITM1) mRNA after IFNA treatment alone. In contrast, IF(r) and F-IF(r) cells, both of which are derived from RSa cells, showed increased X-ray resistance and high constitutive LEU13 mRNA expression levels compared to the parental RSa cells. Furthermore, the IFNA-induced resistance of RSa cells to killing by X rays was suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides for LEU13 mRNA. LEU13, a leukocyte surface protein, was previously reported to mediate the actions of IFN such as inhibition of cell proliferation. The present results suggest a novel role of LEU13 different from that in the inhibition of cell proliferation, involved in IFNA-induced refractoriness of RSa cells to X rays.
