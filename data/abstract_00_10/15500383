Adefovir dipivoxil, an acyclic nucleotide analogue, is effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in both hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and -negative patients, with improvement in liver histology, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels, alanine aminotransferase levels, and HBeAg seroconversion (for HBeAg-positive patients). It is also effective against lamivudine-resistant strains of hepatitis B mutations. It has been studied in pre- and post-liver transplant patients. Compared to lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil is associated with a much lower risk of emergence of drug-resistant HBV. Adefovir-associated resistant virus is susceptible to lamivudine therapy. The recommended dose of adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg is associated with low risk of nephrotoxicity. Adefovir dipivoxil can be recommended as a first-line treatment but can also be used in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection who are failing lamivudine therapy.
