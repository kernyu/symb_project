To examine the effect of negatively charged steroidal amphiphiles on antimicrobial activity, two pairs of epimeric, dendritic tricarboxylato amphiphiles--4-(2-carboxyethyl)-4-[3-(5alpha-cholestan-3-yl)ureido]heptanedioic acid (1) and 4-(2-carboxyethyl)-4-[3-(5alpha-cholestan-3-yloxycarbonylmethyl)ureido]heptanedio ic acid (2)--were synthesized. A broad antimicrobial screen of 11 microbes revealed that these amphiphiles only showed good activity against a methicillin-resistant isolate of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and modest activity against an unrelated strain of S. aureus. The best activity, a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 27 microM, was found for the 3beta epimer of 1 against MRSA.
