Acidic pH of the Golgi lumen is known to be crucial for correct glycosylation, transport and sorting of proteins and lipids during their transit through the organelle. To better understand why Golgi acidity is important for these processes, we have examined here the most pH sensitive events in N-glycosylation by sequentially raising Golgi luminal pH with chloroquine (CQ), a weak base. We show that only a 0.2 pH unit increase (20 microM CQ) is sufficient to markedly impair terminal alpha(2,3)-sialylation of an N-glycosylated reporter protein (CEA), and to induce selective mislocalization of the corresponding alpha(2,3)-sialyltransferase (ST3) into the endosomal compartments. Much higher pH increase was required to impair alpha(2,6)-sialylation, or the proximal glycosylation steps such as beta(1,4)-galactosylation or acquisition of Endo H resistance, and the steady-state localization of the key enzymes responsible for these modifications (ST6, GalT I, MANII). The overall Golgi morphology also remained unaltered, except when Golgi pH was raised close to neutral. By using transmembrane domain chimeras between the ST6 and ST3, we also show that the luminal domain of the ST6 is mainly responsible for its less pH sensitive localization in the Golgi. Collectively, these results emphasize that moderate Golgi pH alterations such as those detected in cancer cells can impair N-glycosylation by inducing selective mislocalization of only certain Golgi glycosyltransferases.
