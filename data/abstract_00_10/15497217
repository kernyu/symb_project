The development of resistance to antiretroviral therapies has become a formidable barrier to providing optimal treatment of HIV infection in the United States. The emergence of new mutations resistant to antiretroviral agents and a rise in transmission of resistant viruses contribute to an increased risk of treatment failure. Resistance testing of both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive patients i snow recommended for identification of the most effective treatment regimen; however, resistance testing is not universally available or easily interpreted. Furthermore, poor adherence to a treatment regimen or treatment with less potent antiretroviral agents can lead to exposure of virus to subinhibitory levels of drug and the development of resistance. In this article, we discuss several issues that specifically impact the development and transmission of resistant HIV in patients belonging to ethnic minorities and teh implementation of strategies that will overcome resistance as an obstacle to optimal treatment.
