We have shown that 18-20 h cultivation of transformed mouse fibroblasts 3T3-SV40 in the presence of antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 10 mM), did not change their sensitivity to lysis by natural killer (NK) mouse splenocytes. However, in 18-20 h after NAC removal 3T3-SV40 cells demonstrated resistance to NK cell activity. The cytotoxicity index (CI) was reduced up to 4.6 +/- 2.4 % (in comparison with the control value 31.8 +/- 2.4 %) approximating to the value in non-transformed 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Normal 3T3 cells were resistant to NK action in all experimental conditions (CI varied within 0.7-5.3 %). These results show that NAC can induce partial reversion of transformed phenotype. We suggest that this effect may be due to the NAC-induced modifications of the cell surface and extracellular matrix proteins.
