A 5-year retrospective analysis of fungemia in patients with hematologic malignancies revealed that four patients, who received fluconazole and itraconazole during neutropenia, developed breakthrough candidemia due to azole-resistant Candida tropicalis isolates. This observation suggests that causative organisms of candidemia in neutropenic patients receiving azoles should be suspected of being azole-resistant.
