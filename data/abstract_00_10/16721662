Exposure of selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens to egg shell membranes (ESM) significantly reduced their thermal resistance and/or inactivated cells. Although the components responsible for this antibacterial activity have not been conclusively identified, several proteins associated with the ESM activity have been identified including beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, lysozyme and ovotransferrin, with each displaying varying degrees of antibacterial activity. Numerous attempts to purify active fractions of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, lysozyme and ovotransferrin from the ESM proved somewhat limited; however, hen egg white (HEW) beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase was purified using a two-step chromatographic procedure, isoelectric focusing followed by cation exchange chromatography. Pure fractions of ovotransferrin were also obtained in the process. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry were then used to partially characterize the individual protein components. Purified protein fractions such as these will be required in order to fully elucidate the mechanism responsible for the antimicrobial properties associated with the ESM.
