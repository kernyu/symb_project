Continual monitoring of antimicrobial resistance rates is essential. Several large surveillance programmes have been established, including the international, longitudinal, multi-centre study PROTEKT (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin). Initiated in 1999, PROTEKT monitors the antibacterial susceptibility of common respiratory tract pathogens. This article reviews the findings from PROTEKT to date and anticipates future trends in antimicrobial resistance. Data from PROTEKT indicate that resistance patterns for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are changing, with an increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistant genotypes. Resistance to the ketolide telithromycin is very rare, with rates of S. pneumoniae susceptibility remaining >99%. The in vitro activity of telithromycin remains at a high level irrespective of pathogen genotype or phenotype.
