The activity of itraconazole (RO 51211, molecular weight 705,64) and miconazole (RO 14889, molecular weight 479,15) obtained from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, against 100 fungi strains, was studied. These strains were isolated from vaginal materials of patients with recognized candidosis. The axenic fungal strains were assessed by own methods and unified tests (bioMerieux: API 20 C, API 20 C AUX). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values calculated from dose-response curves on agar diffusion-test (Kadlubowski's method), were also examined by analysing the variation (mean x +/- standard error, median Me, mode Mo, Min-Max). The drug MIC values for all strains were characterized by a wide range of variation itraconazole 0.0001 - 5.30 mg/L, miconazole 0.0045 - 4.70 mg/L; the shape of MIC values variation polygons was similar to normal distribution.
