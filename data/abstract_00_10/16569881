The potentially probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum CCUG 43738, which displayed atypical phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (MIC, 512 microg/ml) and minocycline (MIC, 256 microg/ml), was found to contain a tet(S) gene located on a plasmid of approximately 14 kb. Plasmid curing with novobiocin eliminated this plasmid and restored the tetracycline-susceptible phenotype of the host strain.
