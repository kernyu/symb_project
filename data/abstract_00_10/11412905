Bid is a BH3 domain only pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family which interacts with Bax to regulate apoptosis. Bax-deficient embryos show decreased neuronal programmed cell death in vivo and resistance to cytosine arabinoside (AraC)-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate that Bid-deficient embryos show no neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and Bid-deficiency has no effect on the in vitro apoptotic response of either telencephalic neural precursor cells or neurons to AraC-induced death. We conclude that bid does not play an essential role in either naturally occurring or genotoxin-induced neuronal cell death.
