BACKGROUND: Emerging resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa within cystic fibrosis (CF) populations is attributed to antibiotic pressure and spread of transmissible strains. We describe increasing resistance of P. aeruginosa isolates, resulting in the identification of two multiresistant strains and their impact on morbidity. METHODS: Susceptibility reports of all P. aeruginosa isolates since 1998 in our unit were reviewed. Isolates were submitted for genomic finger-printing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Clinical measures and the consumption of treatment resources were compared between those harbouring resistant organisms and those with sensitive strains. RESULTS: Analysis of 407 reports from 43 patients revealed isolation of multiresistant (MR) organisms increased during 1999. Those harbouring MR strains consumed more resources than non-MR. Strain typing showed a new 'Sheffield' strain in seven patients (100% MR), and the 'Liverpool' strain in 10 patients (40% MR). Individuals in these groups consumed significantly more resources than 23 patients with unique, susceptible strains (4% MR). DISCUSSION: Increasing resistance in isolates of P. aeruginosa may herald the arrival of a transmissible strain in CF Units which though sometimes sensitive, may become multiply resistant and require more intensive treatment. We now segregate those with transmissible strains from each other and from those with unique strains.
