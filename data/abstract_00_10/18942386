The immunotropic effects of the probiotic complex Bactistatin (the complex contains metabolites of Bacillus subtilis) used simultaneously with oral doxycycline during different periods of time (1, 5, 10 and 20 days) were estimated. The dynamics of the changes in the nonspecific immunity factors under the effect of the above mentioned products or their combination (bactistatin + doxycycline) during the treatment of different duration was demonstrated. It was found that the oral administration of the metabolic probiotic bactistatin to experimental animals during 1-10 days increased the activity of the nonspecific resistance factors. The immunotropic effects of the product were evident at the level of the cells of the blood phagocytic system and the processes related to synthesis of such enzymes as lysozyme and myeloperoxidase and their release into the blood stream. Comparatively rapid increase of the functional activity of the factors was registered even after a single administration of the product. When the combination of the products (bactistatin + doxycycline) was administered to the animals during a fixed period of time (10 days) significant activation of the nonspecific immunity factors was observed. In perspective the findings will allow to optimize the basic regimens of antibacterial therapy and urgent (postcontact) prevention of infectious diseases.
