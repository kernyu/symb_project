The ongoing TRUST (Tracking Resistance in the United States Today) study, which began monitoring antimicrobial resistance among respiratory pathogens in 1996, routinely tracks resistance at national and regional levels. The 1999-2000 TRUST study analyzed 9499 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1934 Haemophilus influenzae, and 1108 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates that were prospectively collected from 239 laboratories across the 9 US Bureau of the Census regions. Penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae varied significantly by region, from 8.3% to 24.8% (P<.001). In each region, penicillin resistance closely predicted resistance to other beta-lactams, macrolides, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Levofloxacin resistance was 0.5% nationally (regional range, 0.1%-1.0%). Multidrug resistance also varied significantly (P<.001) by region. beta-Lactamase production among H. influenzae varied significantly (regional range, 24.0%-34.6%) and M. catarrhalis (86.2%-96.8%) also varied by region. Notable variation in regional antimicrobial resistance rates (S. pneumoniae) and beta-lactamase production (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis) exists throughout the United States.
