AIM: To study several parameters of local non-specific resistance during development of experimental dysbiosis caused by administration of wide spectrum antibiotic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Objects of the study were colonocytes and coprofiltrates from 120 outbred mice developing experimental dysbiosis, in which activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxid dismutase [SOD] and catalase) and level of one of the final product of lipid peroxidation--malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS: Decrease of SOD and catalase activity and significant increase of MDA level during development of experimental dysbiosis were established, which were associated with decreased activity of oxygen-dependent bactericidal systems of colonocytes and changes in composition of colon microbiocenosis. CONCLUSION: It was suggested that changes in parameters of local non-specific resistance could be one of mechanisms, which cause alteration of microbiocenosis composition during colon dysbiosis.
