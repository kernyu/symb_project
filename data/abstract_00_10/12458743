Type I interferons (IFN alpha and beta) convert vertebrate cells into an antiviral state by inducing expression of proteins that inhibit virus replication. In humans and mice, Mx proteins constitute one family of interferon-induced antiviral proteins. Mx genes have recently been cloned from Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout. Moreover, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and type I IFN-like activity have been shown to induce Mx protein in salmonid cells. Chinook salmon embryo cells (CHSE-214 cells) have been suggested to have a defect in the IFN-system because the dsRNA polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) failed to induce an antiviral state in the cells. We have studied this phenomenon more closely in the present work. CHSE-214 cells were either transfected with poly I:C or incubated with poly I:C without transfection reagent. The cells were then studied for Mx protein expression and protection against infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) infection. The results showed that cells transfected with poly I:C were protected from IPNV infection, whilst cells incubated with poly I:C were not protected. Cells transfected with the double-stranded DNA poly dI:dC were also not protected against IPNV. Mx protein was expressed in CHSE-214 cells upon transfection with poly I:C, but not after incubation with poly I:C alone. Stimulation of CHSE-214 cells with supernatants from cells transfected with poly I:C, induced protection against IPNV, indicating production of type I IFN-like activity. These results suggest that CHSE-214 cells in fact are able to produce type I IFN, but may have defects in the mechanisms mediating uptake of poly I:C or may degrade unprotected poly I:C.
