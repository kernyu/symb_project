Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common mucosal infection caused by saprophytic and opportunistic yeasts belonging to the Candida genus. 518 vaginal swabs, with positive fungal culture were collected from unselected women attending the Sexually Transmitted Disease clinic of an Italian tertiary care hospital over a six year period to determine the pathogen prevalence in vulvovaginal candidiasis and to evaluate in vitro the antifungal susceptibilities of yeast recovered by Sensititre YeastOne antifungal panel plates according to CLSI document M27-A2. The isolates belonging to the genus Candida were 495 (95.5%) with Candida albicans percentage equal to 61.2%. Voriconazole was highly active (MIC50 0.008; MIC90 0.5 microg/ml), regardless of the species tested. On the contrary, fluconazole susceptibility was based upon the species. The intrinsic resistance to fluconazole of C. krusei was confirmed.
