Recent studies show that multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19A continues to emerge as a cause of invasive pneumococcal disease after the introduction of Prevnar. We report a case of multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae serotype 19A meningitis successfully treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin. This case reinforces the need for the empiric use of vancomycin in meningitis and the need for alternative treatments.
