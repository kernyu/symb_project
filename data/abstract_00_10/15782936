Thirty nosocomial isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, collected from three public hospitals in Recife, Brazil, between 1999 and 2000, were analysed in order to determine their epidemiological relatedness and genetic characteristics. The isolates were characterised by biotyping, antibiotyping, protein analysis, plasmid profile and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The majority of the clinical isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, in particular to beta-lactams, and 30% were found to be ESBLs producers. RAPD proved to be the most effective technique in discriminating unrelated K. pneumoniae isolates. It was confirmed by the highly genetic similarity found among related isolates from an hospital outbreak. We conclude that K. pneumoniae infections in Recife has been caused by a variety of bacterial genotypes. This is the first report that revealed the subtypes of K. pneumoniae in Brazil by plasmid analysis and RAPD.
