OBJECTIVE: To investigate the susceptibility of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) biofilms to antimicrobial agent by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). METHODS: S. mutans biofilms formed in vitro on glass slice were acted on with penicillin of different concentrations for 3 h. Then these biofilms were stained by fluorescence and were observed by CLSM. The bacterial density and viability of biofilms were recorded. RESULTS: When S. mutans biofilms were exposed to penicillin of 2 500 mg/L for 3 h, it was not completely killed. The higher the concentration of penicillin was, the weaker the biofilms against penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with planktonic S. mutans, S. mutans biofilms produced stronger resistance to penicillin. It suggests that we should find new strategies to control the infection caused by biofilm in clinic.
