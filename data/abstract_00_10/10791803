Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for 811 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from cases of bovine mastitis in 11 countries. The countries and number of isolates included Denmark (105), England (92), Finland (95), Germany (103), Iceland (22), Ireland (42), Norway (101), Sweden (123), Switzerland (69), United States (53), and Zimbabwe (6). The antimicrobial agents tested were penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, cephalothin, ceftiofur, amoxicillin + clavulanate, penicillin + novobiocin, enrofloxacin, premafloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, pirlimycin, neomycin, lincomycin + neomycin, and sulfamethazine. The MIC90 for these antimicrobial agents for all strains were 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, < or =0.06, 0.125, 0.125, < or =0.0078, 0.5, 1.0, 16.0, 1.0, 2.0, 0.5, and 4.0 microg/ml, respectively. Overall, only small variations between countries were seen in the MIC90 for the majority of compounds tested. Of the strains tested, 35.6% were positive for beta-lactamase production on initial testing, with an additional 21.3% positive after induction by penicillin. In conclusion, the overall level of resistance was generally low for all antimicrobial agents tested regardless of country. Given the differences in antimicrobial use in various countries, the widespread adoption of mastitis control programs to prevent infections limits the exposure of S. aureus infected animals to antimicrobial drugs.
