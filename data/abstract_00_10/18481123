The purpose of this study was to characterise methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from the Republic of Georgia, part of the former Soviet Union. Thirty-two non-duplicate MRSA isolates were collected in the period from May 2006 to February 2007. The patient data were analysed and the isolates were characterised by staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing, staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and the detection of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes. Only two closely related spa types were found; 29 isolates were of spa type 459 and three were t030. The spa types belonged to sequence type (ST) 239, clonal complex (CC) 8. All isolates were multiresistant, PVL-negative and harboured SCCmec type IIIA. Based on the molecular findings and PFGE, the isolates most closely resembled the pandemic Brazilian clone (ST239-IIIA).
