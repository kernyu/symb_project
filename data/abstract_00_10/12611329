The efficiency of treatment was studied in 149 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who isolated multidrug resistance of Mycobacteria tuberculosis (MBT). The multidrug resistance of MTB, to at least isoniazid and rifampicin can be associated with both the resistance to other essential (streptomycin, ethambutol) and that to reserve drugs. With this, patients with MBT resistance to a combination of essential and reserve drugs more frequently showed a chronic course of the disease with severe clinical manifestations and more disseminated infiltrative-and-destructive lesions in the lung. Drug treatment regimens using a combination of reserve drug were effective only in patients with MBT resistance to essential drugs while they were little effective in those with resistance to essential and reserve agents. The use of artificial pneumothorax in patients with MBT resistance to essential and reserve agents could cease bacterial isolation in 77.8% of the patients even by ingesting a small number of the drugs. Clinically, the occurrence of MBT resistance to reserve drugs is justified to determine a radically new status in patients in the context of chemotherapy and the whole further treatment in this group of patients. A clinical classification of MBT multidrug resistance is proposed, which identifies two categories of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: those resistant to essential drugs and those resistant to a combination of essential and reserve drugs.
