BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a well-known nosocomial pathogen, is now emerging as a prominent cause of community acquired infections. We have noted an increase in number of cutaneous infections in Los Angeles over the past 2 years. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the clinical presentation and treatment of community acquired MRSA skin infections. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 39 patients with 46 involved sites was performed. The sites of infection, morphology, antimicrobial susceptibility, and definitive treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Cutaneous abscesses were the most common presentation of cutaneous MRSA infection. Definitive treatment consisted of incision and drainage in combination with antimicrobial therapy. The most effective antibiotics were vancomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in combination with rifampin, and linezolid. CONCLUSION: Community acquired MRSA infection appears to be a growing problem requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. First line treatment is incision and drainage in combination with linezolid, vancomycin, or combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and rifampin.
