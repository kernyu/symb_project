The resistance of Plasmodium spp. to currently used drugs has become a serious problem and efforts are being directed in obtaining new drugs with different structural features. One option favoured is the search for new plant derived antimalarial drugs. Bark and leaves of 20 extracts from 14 South African plant species were tested for in vitro antiplasmodial activity by means of the flow cytometric test. The most active extract of each species giving more than 70% inhibition at 50 microg/ml was selected for determination of IC(50) values. Two extracts had IC(50) values below 2 microg/ml, another seven had IC(50) values between 2 and 5 microg/ml while one had an IC(50) of 10.1 microg/ml. Chloroquine had an IC(50) of 0.043 microg/ml. Cytotoxicities of the five most active extracts at 50 microg/ml were determined with the monkey kidney cell toxicity test and the ID(50) values ranged between 35 and 100 microg/ml.
