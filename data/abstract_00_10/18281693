BACKGROUND: The treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii meningitis is a serious therapeutic problem due to the limited penetration of antibiotics into the CSF. We describe the clinical features and the outcome of a group of patients with nosocomial neurosurgical meningitis treated with different therapeutic options. METHODS: All patients with nosocomial post-surgical meningitis due to A. baumannii diagnosed between 1990 and 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: During the period of study, 51 cases of this nosocomial infection were identified. Twenty-seven patients were treated with intravenous (iv) monotherapy: carbapenems (21 cases), ampicillin/sulbactam (4 cases) and other antibiotics (2 cases). Four patients were treated with iv combination therapy. Nineteen patients were treated with iv and intrathecal regimens: colistin by both routes (8 cases), carbapenems plus iv and intrathecal (4 cases) or only intrathecal (5 cases) aminoglycosides, and others (2 cases). Seventeen patients died due to the infection. One patient died without treatment. The mean (SD) duration of therapy was 17.4 (8.3) days (range 3-44). Although no patients treated with colistin died, we did not observe statistically significant differences in the mortality among the groups with different treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial Acinetobacter meningitis has a high mortality. Combined therapy with iv and intrathecal colistin is a useful and safe option in the treatment of nosocomial Acinetobacter meningitis.
