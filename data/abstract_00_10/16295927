REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an emerging equine and zoonotic pathogen. Infection control protocols can be used to control MRSA in human hospitals, but measures to eradicate MRSA on horse farms have not been evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To describe an MRSA eradication programme that was used to attempt to eliminate MRSA colonisation among horses and horse personnel on 2 equine farms. METHODS: Active surveillance cultures and infection control protocols were implemented on 2 farms with endemic MRSA. RESULTS: Active screening and strict implementation of infection control protocols resulted in a rapid decrease in number of colonised horses on both farms. The majority of horses eliminated MRSA without antimicrobial treatment. On one farm colonisation was eradicated, while only 2 (3%) colonised horses remained on the other farm at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Although at this stage the benefit of eradication of MRSA from populations of horses and cost-benefit studies have not been established, this study illustrates that short-term eradication can be achieved with a policy of segregation, enhanced infection control precautions and repeated testing of groups of animals. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Infection control practices should form the basis of MRSA control. Antimicrobial therapy does not appear to be required for eradication of MRSA colonisation in horses and control of MRSA on farms. In appropriate circumstances, these methods may be useful for controlling the spread of this potentially serious pathogen.
