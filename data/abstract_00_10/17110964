The competitor fungus Trichoderma aggressivum causes green mould disease, a potentially devastating problem of the commercial mushroom Agaricus bisporus. Due to the recent appearance of this problem, very little is known about the mechanisms by which T. aggressivum interacts with and inhibits A. bisporus. A mechanism generally used by Trichoderma species in the antagonism of other fungi is the secretion of cell wall degrading enzymes. In this study, we determined the activities of chitinases produced in dual cultures of these fungi over a 2 week period. Both intracellular and extracellular enzymes were studied. Agaricus bisporus produced N-acetylglucosaminidases with apparent molecular masses of 111, 105, and 96 kDa. Two resistant brown strains produced greater activities of the 96 kDa N-acetylglucosaminidase than susceptible off-white and white strains. This result suggested that this enzyme might have a role in the resistance of commercial brown strains to green mould disease. Trichoderma aggressivum produced three N-acetylglucosaminidases with apparent molecular masses of 131, 125, and 122 kDa, a 40 kDa chitobiosidase, and a 36 kDa endochitinase. The 122 kDa N-acetylglucosaminidase showed the greatest activity and may be an important predictor of antifungal activity.
