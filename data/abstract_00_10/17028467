Nosocomial pneumonia, especially ventilator-acquired pneumonia, has the greatest impact on patients' management in intensive care unit. Inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment increases attributable and crude mortality from ventilator-acquired pneumonia. De-escalation therapy improves short-term survival of patients with ventilator-acquired pneumonia without increasing the emergence of resistant organisms.
