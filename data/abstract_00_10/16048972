Preincubation of pneumococci with sub-MIC concentrations of ceftriaxone (1/16x MIC), cefotaxime (1/8x MIC), and meropenem (1/4x MIC) alone or combined with levofloxacin (1/8x MIC) over 6 h prevents the emergence of levofloxacin-resistant mutants after 96 h of incubation but does not affect the intracellular accumulation of levofloxacin in two penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strains, suggesting a link between the mechanism of action of beta-lactams and the emergence of quinolone-induced resistance in pneumococci.
