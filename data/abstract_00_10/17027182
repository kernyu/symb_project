Since 2000 to 2005 we assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI). A total of 19 618 bacteria were studied, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin were in vitro the most potent drugs with more than 80% of susceptibility. If we compare year 2000 to 2005 we observed a significant decrease of susceptibility for fluoroquinolones. For the same point of comparison, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin showed a favourable evolution. Rationale and prudent use of antibiotics must now moved us to prescribe parsimoniously fluoroquinolones especially for some indications such as uncomplicated UTI though there are some others "old antibiotics" with a role may be underestimated for this specific indication.
