OBJECTIVE: To rapidly identify drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis using phenotypic and genotypic methods and to evaluate the clinical significance of rapid phenotypic susceptibility test by phage amplified biologically assay (PhaB). METHODS: PhaB, DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) were performed on the 91 rifampicin (RFP)-resistant strains (including 82 multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains), 42 RFP-susceptible strains, 75 ofloxacin (OFLX)-resistant strains and 40 OFLX-susceptible strains at the same time. RESULTS: The results obtained using PhaB assay, DNA sequencing and PCR-SSCP were compared with the absolute concentration method. For RFP susceptibility, the accordance, sensitivity and specificity of PhaB were 93%, 92% and 95% respectively; the accordance, sensitivity and specificity of DNA sequencing were 93%, 90% and 100% respectively; those of PCR-SSCP were 90%, 86% and 100% respectively. For OFLX susceptibility, the accordance, sensitivity and specificity of PhaB assay were 95%, 95% and 95%; those of DNA sequencing were 80%, 71% and 98% respectively; those of PCR-SSCP were 75%, 63% and 98% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PhaB assay is a low-cost, rapid, and sensitive method and shows high accordance with absolute concentration technology. It can give drug susceptibility test results within 48 - 96 h, and is a promising technology in clinical laboratory.
