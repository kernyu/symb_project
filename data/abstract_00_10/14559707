OBJECTIVE: To survey the antibiotic resistance and the prevalence of penicillinase-producing and highly tetracycline-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG and TRNG) in Guangzhou in 2002. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the 4 antimicrobial agents, tetracycline, spectinomycin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, to 100 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were determined by agar dilution method, and beta-lactamase was detected by iodine quantification method. RESULTS: There were 15 (15%) strains of PPNG and 28 (28%) strains of TRNG among the 100 strains of Neisseriae gonorrhoeae examined, with a resistant rate to ciprofloxacin as high as 98% and 32 (32%) strains identified to be highly resistant to the antibiotics (MIC >or=16 mg/L). No resistant strains to ceftriaxone and specitinomycin were identified, but ceftriaxone susceptibility of the strains was declining. CONCLUSIONS: The current antibiotic resistance of gonococci strains are still serious in Guangzhou, especially in the case of ciprofloxacin resistance. The strains are sensitive to spectinomycin and ceftriaxone, and continuous monitoring of the bacteria for their antibiotic resistance is necessary.
