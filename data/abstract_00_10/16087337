The 2-arylvinyl moiety in 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-piperidyl)-5-[(E)-2-(5-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl)vinyl]pyrazol e 2, which has previously shown improved DNA gyrase inhibition and target-related antibacterial activity, was transformed to other groups and the in vitro antibacterial activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated. Many of the 5-[(E)-2-arylvinyl]pyrazoles synthesized in this study exhibited potent antibacterial activity against quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria with minimal inhibitory concentration values equivalent to those against susceptible strains.
