Blood bacteriostatic activity (BBA) was studied in 87 patients with respiratory tuberculosis. Clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) strains and different culture media, such as solid (Lowenstein-Jensen and Middlebrook), liquid (modified Soton) and semiliquid (SM developed for accelerated determination of drug resistance in MBT) media were used. With isoniazid-resistance of MBT, the use of solid media yielded underestimated BBA. The SM medium based on the Soton medium added by 0.35% of culture agar and 25% equine serum was optimal, which provided evidence for BBA on day 7 (visual recording of MBT growth). Examination of BBA by means of SM revealed a clear inverse correlation between the degree of BBA and the bacteriological parameters of sputum study. The small numbers of sputum MBT cultures (a high correlation, r = -0.88; p = 0.01) and short bacterial isolation (average correlation, r = -0.65; p = 0.01) corresponded to the high values of BBA.
