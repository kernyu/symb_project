BACKGROUND: To assess the relationship between ciprofloxacin use and the prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Semestral mean values regarding use of antibiotic and prevalence of ESBL Kp were compared during 9 semesters using linear regression and coefficient of correlation. RESULTS: The only statistically significant correlation was ciprofloxacin use and ESBL(+) K. pneumoniae prevalence, with a coefficient of correlation of 0.86 and p = 0.0027 using linear regression. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin use must be taking into account when considering infection control programs due to high prevalence rates of ESBL(+) K. pneumoniae in the hospital setting.
