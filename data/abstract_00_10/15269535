To produce an industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that metabolizes xylose, we constructed a rDNA integration vector and YIp integration vector, containing the xylose-utilizing genes, XYL1 and XYL2, which encode xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) from Pichia stipitis, and XKS1, which encodes xylulokinase (XK) from S. cerevisiae, with the G418 resistance gene KanMX as a dominant selectable marker. The rDNA results in integration of multiple copies of the target genes. The industrial stain of S. cerevisiae NAN-27 was transformed with the two integration vectors to produce two recombinant strains, S. cerevisiae NAN-127 and NAN-123. Upon transformation, multiple copies of the xylose-utilizing genes were integrated into the genome rDNA locus of S. cerevisiae. Strain NAN-127 consumed twice as much xylose and produced 39% more ethanol than the parent strain, while NAN-123 consumed 10% more xylose and produced 10% more ethanol than the parent strain over 94 h.
