The first two Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing (KPC) type 2 strains carrying ST258 were detected in Finland in June and early August 2009. They were found colonising two patients transferred from the Mediterranean; one patient referred from a hospital in Greece where isolates were first found in 2007 and another from Italy where the first isolates have been described only very recently.
