Development of type I diabetes requires coordinated expression of myriad genes responsible for the initiation and progression of the disease. Expression of these genes are regulated by a small number of transcription factors including the Rel/NF-kappaB family. To determine the roles of the Rel/NF-kappaB family in type I diabetes, we studied multiple low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice deficient in either c-Rel or NF-kappaB1. We found that mice deficient in each of these NF-kappaB subunits were resistant to streptozotocin-induced diabetes. However, the mechanisms of the disease resistance may differ in different cases. Deficiency in c-Rel selectively reduced Th1, but not Th2 responses, whereas NF-kappaB1 deficiency had little effect on T cell responses to anti-CD3 stimulation. Death of dendritic cells was accelerated in the absence of NF-kappaB1, whereas death of macrophages and granulocytes was affected primarily by c-Rel deficiency. Furthermore, Stat-1 expression was significantly reduced in macrophages deficient in NF-kappaB1, but not c-Rel. These results indicate that both c-Rel and NF-kappaB1are essential for the development of type I diabetes and that strategies targeting each of these subunits would be effective in preventing the disease.
