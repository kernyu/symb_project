Horizontal transfer of genetic material is a fact of microbial life and bacteria can obtain new DNA sequences through the processes of conjugation, transduction and transformation. This offers the bacterium the possibility of evolving rapidly by importing new genes that code for new traits that may assist in environmental adaptation. Research in this area has focused in particular on the role of horizontal transfer in the dissemination through bacterial populations of genes for resistance to antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics. It is becoming clear that many other phenotypic characteristics have been acquired through horizontal routes and that these include traits contributing to pathogenesis and symbiosis. An important corollary to the acquisition of new genes is the problem of how best to integrate them in the existing gene regulatory circuits of the recipient so that fitness is not compromised initially and can be enhanced in the future through optimal expression of the new genes.
