The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are encoded by three genes that yield 10 isoforms through alternative mRNA splicing. The roles of each JNK isoform in the many putative biological responses where the JNK pathway is activated are still unclear. To examine the cellular responses mediated by different JNK isoforms, gain-of-function JNK1 polypeptides were generated by fusing the upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MKK7, with p46JNK1alpha or p46JNK1beta. The MKK7-JNK fusion proteins, which exhibited constitutive activity in 293T cells, were stably expressed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Swiss 3T3 cells expressing either of the MKK7-JNK polypeptides were equally sensitized to induction of cell death following serum withdrawal. To search for other cellular responses that may be selectively regulated by the JNK1 isoforms, the gene expression profiles of Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1alpha or MKK7-JNK1beta were compared with empty vector-transfected control cells. Affymetrix Genechips identified 46 genes for which expression was increased in MKK7-JNK-expressing cells relative to vector control cells. Twenty genes including those for c-Jun, MKP-7, interluekin-1 receptor family member ST2L/ST2, and c-Jun-binding protein were induced similarly by MKK7-JNK1alpha and MKK7-JNK1beta proteins, whereas 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1alpha and 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1beta. The set of genes selectively induced by MKK7-JNK1beta included a number of known interferon-stimulated genes (ISG12, ISG15, IGTP, and GTPI). Consistent with these gene expression changes, Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1beta exhibited increased resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus-induced cell death. These findings reveal evidence for JNK isoform-selective gene regulation and support a role for distinct JNK isoforms in specific cellular responses.
