Resistance or susceptibility of bifidobacteria to lysozyme and growth of bifidobacteria in human milk were tested. Susceptible bifidobacterial strains stopped their growth almost immediately after the addition of lysozyme (400 microg/ml), moderately susceptible strains exhibited reduced growth rate, and growth curves of resistant strains were not affected. Strains of human origin were more resistant to lysozyme than animal strains. While strains of B. bifidum grew well in human milk samples, the growth B. animalis strains was inhibited after inoculation to human milk. The resistance to lysozyme seems to be a promising criterion for the selection of new probiotic bifidobacterial strains.
