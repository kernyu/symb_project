PURPOSE: To determine the antibiotic susceptibility of preoperative conjunctival bacterial flora. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility of conjunctival bacterial strains isolated from 142 patients undergoing intraocular surgery was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. chi(2) statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among the 116 bacteria isolated, 95 (82%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). Most (>75%) of them were susceptible to vancomycin, minocycline, aminoglycosides, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. Approximately one-half of CNS was resistant to erythromycin and azithromycin. Over 90% of streptococci were susceptible to levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin. RESULTS: Fluoroquinolones, specifically gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin continue to provide broad-spectrum coverage against common conjunctival bacterial flora.
