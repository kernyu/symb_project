High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg/kg/d divided twice daily) remains the drug of choice for treatment of acute otitis media despite increasing antimicrobial resistance. For persistent or recurrent acute otitis media, guidelines recommend high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90/6.4 mg/kg/d), cefdinir, cefprozil, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, or ceftriaxone. Increasing the dose of amoxicillin does not cover infection with beta-lactamase-producing pathogens; add the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate to amoxicillin, or choose a cephalosporin with good activity against S pneumoniae and good beta-lactamase stability. Key factors for enhancing compliance are taste of suspension, dosing frequency, and duration of therapy.
