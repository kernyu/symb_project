There are currently 17 African countries in which animal trypanocidal drug resistance has been reported. Large-scale surveys were carried out in only ten of them. The lack of baseline information is mainly due to the fact that the methods currently available for the detection of drug resistance are laborious, expensive and time consuming. In this review the mechanisms involved in resistance to isometamidium and diminazene will be discussed, together with some new molecular detection tools that have been developed recently enabling faster diagnosis of drug resistance than conventional laboratory or field tests.
