The development of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria has led to a search for novel classes of antimicrobial drugs. Bacteriocins are peptides that are naturally produced by bacteria and have considerable potential to fulfill the need for more effective bacteriocidal agents. In this mini-review, we describe research aimed at generating analogues of bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of structure-activity relationships in these peptides. In particular, we report recent findings on synthetic analogues of leucocin A, pediocin PA1, and lacticin 3147 A2, as well as on the significance of these results for the design and production of new antibiotics.
