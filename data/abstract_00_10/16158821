The cytotoxic action of the deoxyadenosine analogue 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A) depends on the incorporation into DNA after being phosphorylated to F-ara-A triphosphate (F-ara-ATP) by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). The mechanisms of resistance to F-ara-A were investigated in a newly established variant of L1210 mouse leukemia cells (L1210/F). L1210/F was more than 41-fold more resistant to F-ara-A than the parental cell line and had a 55% lower dCK activity. Interestingly, L1210/F showed a modest level of cross-resistance to deoxycytidine analogues phosphorylated by dCK, for instance, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). The comparative study of F-ara-A and ara-C demonstrated that the difference in the accumulation of their respective triphosphates was minor. In contrast, the incorporation of F-ara-A into DNA was strikingly suppressed compared with that of ara-C. In general, the high natural triphosphate levels interfere with corresponding analogue incorporation into DNA. The deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and deoxycytidine triphosphate pool sizes in L1210/F cells were increased by 4.9-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, compared with the parental cells. Treatment with hydroxyurea increased the ratio of F-ara-ATP to dATP 2.1-fold and enhanced the action of F-ara-A in L1210/F. This is the first cell line to show that the profoundly defective incorporation of F-ara-A into DNA during competition with excess dATP confers a high degree of resistance to F-ara-A.
