BACKGROUND: Isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) has been recommended for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: We used a mathematical model to simulate the benefits and risks of preventive treatment delivered through antiretroviral (ARV) clinics using clinical data from Botswana. RESULTS: Preventive treatment was found to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) by at least 12 cases per 100000 population per year versus the scenario without such treatment over a 50-year simulation. Isoniazid (INH) resistant TB was observed to increase by <1% per year, even when using pessimistic assumptions about resistance emergence. The use of tuberculin skin testing had little impact as a screening procedure, while secondary treatment was observed to nearly double the impact of a preventive treatment program. Regardless of whether or not preventive treatment was implemented, INH-resistant TB rose in the context of increasing HIV prevalence, but was minimally amplified by preventive treatment itself. CONCLUSIONS: IPT programs implemented through ARV clinics may be effective at reducing TB incidence. The resistance contribution of IPT appears unlikely to supersede its overall incidence and mortality benefits.
