A new class of novel bis-benzimidazole diamidine compounds have been synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities, including drug-resistant bacterial strains. Anti-MRSA and anti-VRE activities of the most potent compound 1 were more active than Vancomycin. The mechanism of action for this class of compounds appears to be different from existing antibiotics. Bis-benzimidazole diamidine compounds have potential for further investigation as a new class of potent anti-MRSA and anti-VRE agents.
