Recent data show that more than 50% of catheter-associated bloodstream infections are caused by staphylococci. Staphylococcal infections produced by intercellular-adhesion cluster (ica) carriers can be even more problematic due to the presence of methicillin and mupirocin resistance genes. In the present study, a multiplex PCR protocol that allows the simultaneous identification of staphylococci and detection of both the ica and methicillin and/or mupirocin resistance genes was developed. Furthermore, the method allows differential detection of the ica locus from Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
