The changing epidemiology of invasive candidiasis, along with concerns for the emergence of drug resistance, necessitates the identification of patients at increased risk of non-albicans Candida (NAC) to optimize selection of antifungal therapy. The major findings of a study regarding the demographic characteristics, costs, and outcomes of nonneutropenic patients with candidemia due to NAC are discussed. Given available treatment options, such risk assessment is most relevant to initial empiric therapy in stable patients without neutropenia who might be candidates for initial therapy with an azole (eg, fluconazole). The study's investigators reinforce the need for timely antifungal therapy for patients with candidemia.
