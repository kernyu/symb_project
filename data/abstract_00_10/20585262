OBJECTIVE: To assess the mutational patterns and factors associated with baseline drug-resistant HIV-1 present at initiation of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) at 3 sites in Lusaka, Zambia, in 2007-2008. METHODS: Population sequencing of the HIV-1 pol gene was performed in the PharmAccess African Studies to Evaluate Resistance Monitoring cohort. Drug resistance-associated mutations (DRMs) were identified using the WHO 2009 Surveillance DRM list. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with baseline resistance. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of baseline resistance was 5.7% [31 of 548 participants; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.9 to 7.9]; the prevalence of DRMs associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors was 1.1%, 4.0%, and 1.1%, respectively. Resistance prevalence was 5.2% (27 of 523) in antiretroviral-naive and 16.0% (4 of 25) in antiretroviral-experienced (ie, previous use of ART or antiretroviral prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child transmission) participants (P = 0.022). Dual-class resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs was observed in 0.6% of participants. HIV-1 subtype C was identified in 98.0% (537 of 548) of participants. Prior antiretroviral experience (odds ratio: 4.32, CI: 1.34 to 14.0, P = 0.015) and hemoglobin level (highest tertile versus lowest tertile odds ratio: 2.74, CI: 1.09 to 6.89, P = 0.033) were independently associated with baseline resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline resistance may compromise the response to standard NNRTI-based first-line ART in 6% of patients in Lusaka, Zambia. Continuous resistance monitoring is warranted to maintain individual and population-level ART effectiveness.
