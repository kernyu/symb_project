To study the resistant mechanism and clinical significance of pseudomonas aeruginosa to beta-lactam antibiotics, the outer membrane permeability rate of 30 P. aeruginosa strains to 5 beta-lactam antibiotics was measured and their production of beta-lactamase and the beta-lactamase genes they carried detected. Furthermore, the relationship between the permeability, beta-lactamase and the clinical effects of beta-lactam antibiotics was observed. By using 14C-penicillin and liquid-scintillant isotope assay, the affinity of penicillin binding proteins (PBPS) was measured and their roles in the resistant mechanism studied. It was revealed that the permeability rate was higher in sensitive strains than in resistant ones (P < 0.05). All strains harbored 1-4 beta-lactamase genes and produced beta-lactamase. Higher permeability rate and higher degree of stability to beta-lactamase indicated better clinical therapeutic effects. The affinity of PBPs changed little without regard to the permeability and beta-lactamase. These results suggested that the permeability of outer membrane and beta-lactamase, but not PBPs, played important roles in the resistant mechanism of P. aeruginosa to beta-lactam antibiotics and affected the clinical therapeutic effectiveness of some patients.
