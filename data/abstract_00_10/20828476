In this study we examined the hygienic and sanitary quality of pasteurized cow's milk in the state of Parana, Brazil, by determining the presence of coliforms and occurrence of antimicrobial residues. A total of 260 milk samples were collected from commercial establishments in different regions of the state. Coliform populations were estimated by the multiple-tube test, and antimicrobial residues were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Overall, 105 samples (40.4%) were unsuitable for consumption according to Brazilian legal standards. Among the coliforms, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were respectively identified in 77.05 and 36.07% of the samples. The highest rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents were observed for ampicillin (19.2%), cephalothin (18.9%), and tetracycline (17.1%). Antimicrobial residues were detected in 80 samples (30.8%). Forty-eight samples (18.5%) were positive for tetracycline, 29 (17.4%) for neomycin, 9 (3.5%) for beta-lactams, 6 (2.3%) for gentamicin, 4 (1.5%) for chloramphenicol, and 1 (0.4%) for streptomycin-dihydrostreptomycin. The results demonstrate a high prevalence of coliforms and also a high occurrence of antimicrobial residues in pasteurized cow's milk from Parana, Brazil.
