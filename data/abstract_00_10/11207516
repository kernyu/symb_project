AIM: To compare 1-week ranitidine bismuth citrate-based (RBC) triple therapy vs. omeprazole-based (O) triple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in Hong Kong with high prevalence of metronidazole resistance. METHODS: Patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and H. pylori infection were randomized to receive either: (i) RBCCM: ranitidine bismuth citrate (pylorid) 400 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 400 mg; or (ii) OCM: omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 400 mg, each given twice daily for 1 week. Endoscopy (CLO test, histology and culture) and 13C-urea breath test were performed before randomization and 6 weeks after drug treatment. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were randomized. H. pylori eradication rates (intention-to-treat, n=180/per protocol, n=166) were 83%/92% for RBCCM and 66%/70% for OCM (P=0.01, intention-to-treat and P=0.001, per protocol, respectively). RBCCM treatment was unaffected by metronidazole susceptibility and achieved a significantly higher eradication rate in metronidazole-resistant cases (89%) than the OCM group (45%, P=0.0064). CONCLUSION: One-week ranitidine bismuth citrate-based triple therapy is significantly better than omeprazole-based triple therapy for the eradication of H. pylori infection, especially in metronidazole-resistant cases. It is an effective regimen for the eradication of H. pylori infection in regions with a high prevalence of metronidazole resistance.
