The source and antimicrobial susceptibility of 1293 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from 1996 to 1999 were studied. Urine was the most common source for outpatient isolates (61.2%), while for hospitalized patients respiratory samples were the most frequent (40.2%). The most active antimicrobials with resistance rates <=10% were ceftazidime, imipenem, tobramycin and amikacin. By contrast, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin showed resistance levels >10%. The percentages of resistance to ceftazidime, aztreonam and imipenem in isolates from inpatients and from patients in the intensive care unit were significantly higher than those in isolates from outpatients and other clinical departments. Comparison of susceptibility data from 1996 to 1999 showed a significant increase in the resistance rate for all of the antibiotics studied but imipenem.
