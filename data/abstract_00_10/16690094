The atovaquone resistance of malaria parasites correlates with mutations in the cytochrome b gene. We sequenced the Plasmodium falciparum cytochrome b gene of 135 African isolates. Our data showed a high mutation rate (8.9%); however, the risk of emergence spreading of atovaquone-resistant P. falciparum strains could be limited.
