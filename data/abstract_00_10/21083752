OBJECTIVES: To evaluate Helicobacter pylori antibiotics resistance evolution from 2000 to 2009 to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin in Beijing, China. METHODS: A total of 374 H. pylori strains isolated from 374 subjects who had undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy from 2000 to 2009 were collected and examined by E-test method for antibiotics susceptibility. RESULTS: The average antibiotics resistance rates were 0.3% (amoxicillin), 37.2% (clarithromycin), 63.9% (metronidazole), 1.2% (tetracycline), 50.3% (levofloxacin) and 61.9% (moxifloxacin). Overall resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolone increased annually (from 14.8 to 65.4%, 38.9 to 78.8%, and 27.1 to 63.5%, in 2000 or 2006-2007 to 2009, respectively). The secondary resistance rates were much higher than primary rates to these antibiotics, which also increased annually in recent 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The trend of clarithromycin, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolone resistance of H. pylori increased over time and the resistance to amoxicillin and tetracycline was infrequent and stable in Beijing. Clarithromycin, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolone should be used with caution for H. pylori eradication treatment.
