This study analyzes the sensitivity to meropenem of 880 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized patients in various medical units of County Hospital No. 1 Timisoara. As a result, a high sensitivity of gram-negative pathogens to meropenem (82.01%) has been noticed. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 93.17% of Escherichia coli and 71% of Klebsiella sp. were susceptible to meropenem. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, a high susceptibility was noticed to meropenem (91%), more than 70% to imipenem, but piperacillin + tazobactam had 42% resistance rates.
