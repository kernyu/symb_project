OBJECTIVES: The efficacy of prophylactic treatment with human lactoferrin 1-11 (hLF1-11), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide, was studied in a rabbit model of femur infection. METHODS: Calcium phosphate cement with 50 mg/g hLF1-11 or gentamicin was injected into the femoral canal, after inoculation with Staphylococcus aureus. Three weeks later, slices of the proximal femora were sawn for quantitative bacterial culture and histology. RESULTS: Treatment with hLF1-11 (P<0.038) or gentamicin (P<0.008) caused a reduction of cfu compared with the untreated control rabbits. The number of sterile cultures was higher in hLF1-11- (3/7) and gentamicin- (5/6) treated animals than in controls (1/7). Radiological and histological analysis showed early bone ingrowth into the cement cracks, and only moderate pathological changes in rabbits with positive cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Local prophylaxis with hLF1-11 effectively reduced development of osteomyelitis in a rabbit model, but gentamicin resulted in a larger number of sterile femora.
