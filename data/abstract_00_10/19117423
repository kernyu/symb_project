A series of novel 4,6-di(substituted)amino-1,2-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine derivatives designed to have ClogP of 5.1-7.5 was synthesized and evaluated for their antiseptic properties by MIC and MBC tests against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including MRSA, VRE, and P. aeruginosa. Among these compounds, 4-alkyl-6-aralkyl derivatives having ClogP of 6.6-7.1 and 4-alkyl-6-aryl or 4,6-dialkyl derivatives with ClogP of 6.0-6.4 showed pronounced antibacterial activities in both tests.
