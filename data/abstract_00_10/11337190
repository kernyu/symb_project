The frequency of isolation and antifungal susceptibility patterns to fluconazole and itraconazole were determined for 166 Candida glabrata isolates causing bloodstream infection at a single institution from 1995-2000. Findings demonstrated a trend of increasing resistance to itraconazole among the isolates, but no trend in resistance to fluconazole. The frequency of C. glabrata isolates among all blood culture isolates of Candida spp. causing bloodstream infection remained stable during the study period and ranged from 18-31%.
