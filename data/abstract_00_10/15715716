The presence of PER-1- and OXA-10-like beta-lactamases was investigated by PCR in 49 ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from patients hospitalised in the 24-bed general intensive care unit of the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine during a 12-month period between February 1999 and February 2000. The clonal relatedness of the isolates was investigated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, and the sequences of the PER-1 and OXA genes from all isolates were determined. The rates of resistance of the isolates to imipenem, aztreonam and cefepime were 98%, 92% and 96%, respectively, and to piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam were 41% and 37%, respectively. Using the double-disk synergy test, 37% (18/49) of the isolates were identified as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers. The PER-1 gene was identified in 86% (42/49) and the OXA-10 gene in 55% (27/49) of the ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Of isolates carrying the PER-1 gene, 48% (20/42) also carried the OXA-10 gene. The respective nucleotide sequences were identical for each isolate. Sixteen RAPD patterns were detected among the PER-1-positive isolates, but 60% (25/42) of the PER-1-positive isolates belonged to two distinct patterns, while the remainder exhibited a wide clonal diversity. The results indicated that the prevalence of PER-1- and OXA-10-like beta-lactamases remains high among ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates in Turkey.
