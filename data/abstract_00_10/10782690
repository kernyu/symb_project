Incorporation of a 4-hydroxy-N-acetylprolinol nucleotide analogue at the 3'-terminus of DNA or 2-5A-DNA sequences resulted in a significantly enhanced 3'-exonuclease resistance while the affinity for complementary RNA was only slightly decreased. Furthermore, the binding to and activation of human RNase L by thus modified 2-5A-DNA conjugates was not altered as compared to the parent unmodified 2-5A-DNAs.
