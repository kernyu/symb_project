The efficacy of decoquinate against Eimeria infections in broiler chickens was evaluated using two drug sensitive laboratory strains of Eimeria tenella and 20 field isolates of Eimeria spp. collected from farms in China where various anticoccidials (including maduramicin) had been used. Decoquinate (20-40 ppm in feed) and maduramicin (5 ppm) were efficacious against E. tenella laboratory strains, but decoquinate more so than maduramicin. Body weight gains of E. tenella infected chickens were significantly improved, and caecal lesions were prevented, by feeding either decoquinate or maduramicin. Decoquinate also prevented oocyst production, but maduramicin did not. Most (18/20) Eimeria field isolates were resistant to maduramicin, judged by oocyst production; decoquinate at > or =20 ppm completely controlled all 20 field isolates. Decoquinate has potential value as a broiler anticoccidial in China and other countries where it has not been previously used.
