OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the microbiological profile of acute appendicitis in children. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study including children hospitalized for acute appendicitis. METHODS: A specimen of the appendice and the peritoneal exudates (if exists) was performed intraoperatively for aerobe bacteriological examination. Anaerobic incubation was not possible in our study. RESULTS: Eighty children were included. The specimen culture isolated aerobic bacteria in 56 patients (70%). Polymicrobial infection was found in 14 children. Gram-negative bacilli were the most frequently isolated microorganisms (64/70). Escherichia coli was found in 48 children. The resistance rate to amoxicilline-clavulanic acid and to cefazolin was 35%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to ticarcillin was detected in seven patients. CONCLUSION: In our study, the specimen culture found aerobic bacteria in 70% of cases, especially Gram-negative bacilli. Empiric antibiotherapy in acute complicated appendicitis in children should be efficient against these microorganisms.
