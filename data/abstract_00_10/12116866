Four airport malaria cases have been observed in the vicinity of the Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle International Airport, Paris, France. These cases were geographically very close to each other and clustered in a short period of time during the summer of 1999. The phenotype and genotype of the Plasmodium falciparum isolates obtained from these patients were determined in order to know whether a single mosquito could have infected more than one subject. The genomic characterisation of isolates was performed using the polymorphic markers merozoite surface protein 1 (Msp 1) and merozoite surface protein 2 (Msp 2) genes, the kappa and omega repeats domains of cg2 and the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) genotypes. Results showed identical genotypes for isolates 1, 2 and 4 whereas the genotype of isolate 3 differed at one locus. The molecular analysis was consistent with the hypothesis that all patients could have been bitten by the same mosquito and that patient 3, may have received a different clone and an additional species. In vitro susceptibility data did not confirm or rule out this hypothesis because isolates had the same profile of susceptibility to the tested drugs.
