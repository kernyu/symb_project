Acinetobacter baumannii is increasingly recognized as an important multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen. Recent work has highlighted enhanced growth and heightened virulence in the presence of ethyl alcohols. As alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) are extensively used in health care settings, the authors set out to determine whether the hand rubs could also influence the growth of prevalent multidrug-resistant strains circulating in UK hospitals. A significant increase in growth was observed when minimal media were supplemented with concentrations of 1% and lower of four commercially available hand rubs. In addition, growth in ABHR-supplemented media resulted in secretion of proteins into the culture supernatant. One of these was identified as OmpA, which is recognized as having emulsifying activity, which could potentially confer enhanced pathogenicity to A. baumannii.
