The aims of this study were to quantify the rate of inappropriate glycopeptide use. The study was carried out by reviewing all medical records of patients who received a glycopeptide in a hospital located in Italy. A total of 452 patients received glycopeptides, with a rate of inappropriate use of 90.9%. Appropriateness of glycopeptide prescriptions was significantly higher in Intensive Care Units compared with surgical wards (odds ratio (OR) = 0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01-0.14), in younger patients (OR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.95-0.99) and in those patients who received the prescription for therapy rather than prophylaxis (OR = 0.2; 95% CI = 0.06-0.66). Models were also developed to predict appropriateness of glycopeptide indications for therapy and prophylaxis. The information obtained in our audit may enable development of strategies to improve physician prescribing patterns.
