We have used plasmid pLTV3, which carries transposon Tn917, to obtain a series of mutants of Listeria monocytogenes EGD showing varied degrees of resistance to ampicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem. In this paper we focus on the characteristics of two strains in which decreased susceptibility to ampicillin is accompanied by changes in the structure of the cell wall murein and cell-wall related changes of phenotype.
