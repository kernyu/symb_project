Malaria is frequently a deadly disease, particularly in tropical countries of the world where this protozoan infection is endemic. While physicians in tropical countries are familiar with the presentation, those who do not practice in endemic regions of the world may neglect to add tropical diseases to their differential diagnosis of fever. Epidemiologic data from the CDC show the number of cases of malaria being diagnosed in the United States in the last decade has risen sharply. With international travel continuing to rise, there is strong reason to consider malaria as a source of fever.
