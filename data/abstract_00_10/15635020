Rhodotorula species are emerging pathogens in immunocompromised patients. We report the in vitro activities of eight antifungals against 64 Rhodotorula isolates collected in surveillance programs between 1987 and 2003. Rhodotorula strains are resistant in vitro to fluconazole (MIC at which 50% of the isolates tested are inhibited [MIC(50)], >128 microg/ml) and caspofungin (MIC(50), >8 microg/ml). Amphotericin B (MIC(50),1 microg/ml) and flucytosine (MIC(50), 0.12 microg/ml) are both active in vitro, and the new and investigational triazoles all have some in vitro activity, with ravuconazole being the most active (MIC(50), 0.25 microg/ml).
