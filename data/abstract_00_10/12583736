[reaction: see text] Continuing from the syntheses and the antibacterial studies of a library of pyranmycins, we further probed the proximity around ring III of pyranmycin by introducing an "extended arm" that has hydroxyethyl or aminoethyl groups at the O-2' ', O-3' ', or O-4' ' positions. The results from the antibacterial studies reveal the optimal structural motif is the attachment of an extended arm with a terminal hydroxyl group at the O-3' ' position.
