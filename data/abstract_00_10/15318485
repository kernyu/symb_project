The widespread and indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic, as well as commensal, microorganisms. Resistance genes may be horizontally or vertically transferred between bacterial communities in the environment. The recipient bacterial communities may then act as a reservoir of these resistance genes. In this study, we report the incidence of antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria isolated from the Mhlathuze River and the distribution of genetic elements that may be responsible for the observed antibiotic resistance. The resistance of the enteric bacteria isolated over a period of one year showed that resistance to the older classes of antibiotics was high (94.7% resistance to one antibiotic and 80.8% resistance to two antibiotics). Furthermore, antibiotic resistance data of the environmental isolates showed a strong correlation (r = 0.97) with data obtained from diarrhoea patients. PCR based methods demonstrated that class 1 integrons were present in >50% of the environmental bacterial isolates that were resistant to multiple antibiotics. This class of integrons is capable of transferring genes responsible for resistance to beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, sulfonamide and quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents. Conjugate plasmids were also isolated, but from a small percentage of isolates. This study showed that the Mhlathuze River (a) is a medium for the spread of bacterial antibiotic resistance genes, (b) acts as a reservoir for these genes and (c) due to socio-economic pressures, may play a role in the development and evolution of these genes along this river system.
