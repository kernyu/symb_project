The antibacterial effectiveness of liquids used as intraocular tamponading agents in vitrectomy was tested in this study. Two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as challenge organisms: the ATCC 9027 strain and a randomly selected resistant strain. The liquid intraocular tamponading agents tested were perfluorocarbons, balanced salt solutions, and silicone oils. Perfluorocarbons demonstrated a significant decrease in growth of the ATCC 9027 strain and sufficient protection against the resistant strain of P. aeruginosa. The balanced salt solutions as well as the silicone oils demonstrated insufficient protection against both strains used. There is a correspondence of results in the pairs of chemically similar substances.
