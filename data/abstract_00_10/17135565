A cross-sectional survey was designed to investigate the proportion of tetracycline residues in marketed pork in suburb and urban districts in Hanoi. A total of 290 raw muscle samples were randomly collected from open markets in these districts. The samples were qualitatively screened for tetracycline residues using the agar inhibition test, and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) as the reference strain. The inconclusive samples were then analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The positive samples from either test were defined as positive results. Overall, 5.5% of all collected samples were positive for tetracycline residues. The proportion of positive samples from shops in suburb districts was significantly (P < 0.05) different from those collected from shops in urban districts. So, the factor of region was identified as a risk factor of tetracycline residue proportion in raw pork with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.03 (95% CI = 1.12, 14.45). For the other factors, such as season, type of shop, type of abattoir, origin of meat, etc., the difference in proportion of positive samples within each factor was substantial but not statistically significant. These factors were identified as nonrisk factors. Such a high proportion may pose a potential hazard to public health, particularly since they might induce drug resistance of pathogenic micro-organisms.
