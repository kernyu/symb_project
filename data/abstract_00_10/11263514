The use of short-course chemotherapy (SCC) in directly-observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) programmes in sub-Saharan Africa was often restricted to patients with infectious and serious forms of tuberculosis, because of high costs of such regimens. With reduced drug prices and wide-scale substitution of thiacetazone by ethambutol in the continuation phase of treatment, various short-course regimens are now available at the same or even lower costs than long-course regimens. Several DOTS programmes are considering extending access to short-course chemotherapy to non-infectious patients, or have done so already. The authors provide an overview of the issues regarding the debate on the introduction of universal SCC in national tuberculosis control programmes in low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. They advise on a low-risk strategy to avoid the emergence of rifampicin resistance as a consequence of the wide availability of rifampicin associated with universal short-course, and strengthening of the health system to maintain high performance levels in diagnosis and treatment.
