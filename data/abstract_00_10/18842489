BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally. The quest continues to identify viral factors that influence disease progression and severity as well as responses to treatment of HBV infection. Based on variations in HBV, the virus has been divided into a number of genotypes. DATA SOURCES: Review of published literature on HBV genotypes. RESULTS: HBV genotypes are likely to be important in determining the severity and progression of HBV-induced liver disease as well as responses to different anti-viral agents. CONCLUSION: Although HBV genotyping is not yet recommended for routine use in treating HBV infection, available data suggest that, as in hepatitis C virus infection, HBV genotyping is also likely to become a routine investigation for HBV treatment, perhaps in the not too distant future.
