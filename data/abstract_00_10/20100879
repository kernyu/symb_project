This study compared the activity of finafloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone which shows enhanced activity under acidic pH, and that of ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter baumannii under standard conditions (pH 7.2) and at a pH of 5.8. Overall, finafloxacin demonstrated superior activity to ciprofloxacin under acidic conditions. Furthermore, finafloxacin showed comparable activity to ciprofloxacin at pH 7.2. Hence, finafloxacin could be a promising new antimicrobial agent for the treatment of A. baumannii infections at acidic body compartments.
