The in-vivo efficacies of the artesunate malartin, alone and in combination with amodiaquine, have been assessed against uncomplicated cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria attending two treatment centres in Cameroon (the WHO/University of Buea malaria health post in Bolifamba and the University of Buea's health centre in Molyko). The 213 participants were treated for 3 days (malartin-amodiaquine) or 5 days (malartin alone) and then followed-up on days 3, 7 and 14. Only 86 of the patients given malartin alone and 80 of those given malartin-amodiaquine completed follow-up. Most patients given malartin alone showed an adequate clinical and parasitological response (91.9%), the rest showing late parasitological failure (7.0%) or early treatment failure (1.2%). The corresponding values for the malartin-amodiaquine combination were slightly better, at 93.8%, 5.0% and 1.2%, respectively. No late clinical failures were recorded in either treatment arm. In both treatment arms, the prevalence of anaemia in the treated adults (aged>15 years) and children decreased significantly during follow-up (P<0.05). Both regimens were well tolerated and neither gave rise to any serious adverse effects. The most common side-effects were dizziness and fatigue in those given malartin alone and fatigue, itching and nausea in those given malartin-amodiaquine. Three days of treatment with the malartin-amodiaquine combination appears to be slightly more effective and a slightly better choice than 5 days of treatment with malartin alone.
