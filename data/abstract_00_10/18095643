The bis-salicylhydrazides class of HIV-1 integrase (IN) inhibitors has been postulated to function by metal chelation. However, members of this series exhibit potent inhibition only when Mn2+ is used as cofactor. The current study found that bis-aroylhydrazides could acquire inhibitory potency in Mg2+ using dihydroxybenzoyl substituents as both the right and left components of the hydrazide moiety. Employing a 2,3-dihydro-6,7-dihydroxy-1 H-isoindol-1-one ring system as a conformationally constrained 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl equivalent provided good selectivity for IN-catalyzed strand transfer versus the 3'-processing reactions as well as antiviral efficacy in cells using HIV-1 based vectors.
