To determine whether the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase (5NT), cytidine deaminase (CDD), topoisomerase I (TOPO I) and topoisomerase II alpha (TOPO II) are involved in clinical resistance to cytarabine (ara-C), we analyzed the level of expression of these parameters by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR), at diagnosis in the blast cells of 77 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with ara-C, including 31 for whom samples were collected at first relapse. By univariate and/or multivariate analyses, patients with expression of 5NT or hENT1 deficiency at diagnosis had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). These results suggest that expression of 5NT and reduced hENT1 in leukemic blasts at diagnosis are correlated with clinical outcome and may play a role in resistance mechanisms to ara-C in patients with AML.
