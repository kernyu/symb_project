Currently available combinational therapies based on the use of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs) and other new class drugs such as CCR5 inhibitors and integrase inhibitors for HIV-1 infection and AIDS have been shown to suppress virus replication and extend the life expectancy of HIV-1-infected individuals. Despite this undeniable success, there are limitations associated with current treatment regimens including emergence of drug resistance, complicated dosing protocols, adverse side effects, and increasing cost. Consequently, the development of new RTIs and PIs, including new class drugs, remains essential to the future management of HIV/AIDS. In this paper, the current status of drug development of novel RTIs and PIs is briefly reviewed.
