AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of quinolone resistance among Campylobacter jejuni and Camp. coli isolates from Danish poultry at the farm level, as well as for the whole country. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data and isolates were collected from a national surveillance of Campylobacter in poultry. Quinolone resistance was investigated by determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to nalidixic acid and enrofloxacin. Among Camp. jejuni and Camp. coli combined, 7.5% were resistant to nalidixic acid. Quinolone resistance varied considerably from farm to farm, with 0% on some farms and almost 100% on others, but the resistance was evenly distributed geographically. With respect to isolates from farms where resistance was detected, quinolone resistance was higher among Camp. coli (28.7%) than among Camp. jejuni (11.3%). PFGE typing of quinolone-resistant and quinolone-susceptible isolates from four farms indicated that certain resistant isolates belonged to specific clones that were able to persist on the farms during several rotations, even in the absence of selective pressure. Some clones were present and repeatedly isolated in both a quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant variant. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, quinolone resistance among Campylobacter isolates from Danish broilers was 7.5% in 1998 and 1999; it was higher among Camp. coli than Camp. jejuni. Genetic diversity among resistant isolates was lower than among susceptible isolates, and certain clones existed in both a resistant and a susceptible variant. Some resistant clones appeared to persist on the farms and were repeatedly isolated from poultry flocks. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study is important for the understanding of persistence and dynamics of Campylobacter in broiler houses. It also highlights the extent, farm-to-farm variation and persistence of quinolone-resistant Campylobacter in broiler houses.
