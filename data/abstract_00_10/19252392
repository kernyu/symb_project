In this study, we aimed to determine an index of anti-MRSA drugs for long-term treatment. We examined adult patients to whom the anti-MRSA drugs arbekacin sulfate (ABK), vancomycin hydrochloride (VCM), and teicoplanine (TEIC) had been administered in the St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Yokohama City Seibu Hospital, for 1, year. The number of patients treated for>or==14 days was 22 (31%) among 71 patients. Immunosuppressive agent positivity (p=0.07), albumin (ALB) level of <or==2.5 g/dl (p=0.03), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of >or==10 mg/dl (p=0.01),%STAB >or==15% (p=0.11), and the period until the blood drug level is measured (p=0.06) were analyzed with respect to the differences between both groups by univariate analysis. An ALB level of <or==2.5 g/dl was a significant factor as determined by multivariate logistic analysis (p=0.04). It is thought that it is necessary to base long-term administration on necessity in patients with low albumin levels in blood, to consider the appropriate treatment and nutrition management together, and to consider the appropriate treatment depending on the early stage of the blood drug level, and to promote the proper use of drugs.
