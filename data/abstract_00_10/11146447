The median survival for human malignant glioma patients treated with neurosurgery and postoperative radiotherapy does not exceed one year. Only a minority of patients benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. It was the aim of our study to determine which genomic alterations in malignant gliomas modulate the sensitivity to chemotherapy or cytotoxic cytokines such as CD95 ligand (CD95L) or Apo2L/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL). Therefore, we analyzed 12 human malignant glioma cell lines for chromosomal gains and losses by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The gains most commonly identified were on chromosomes 7q, 19, 1, and 20q, whereas the most frequent losses were on 13q, 11q, 18q, and 4q. By comparison with previously published data on this panel of glioma cell lines1112, we defined candidate regions which may carry genes responsible for sensitivity to chemotherapy or cytotoxic cytokines. All but one of the chromosomal regions associated with response to chemotherapy, i.e. 1p12, 3p21, 11p11.2-p13, 12q23, 17p11. 2-p13, were different from those associated with response to cytotoxic cytokines, i.e. lp12, 1q22, 12q12-q21. Genomic regions known to harbor major candidate genes, including genes encoding death ligands, death receptors, caspases and BCL-2 family proteins, were not found to be imbalanced. In addition, we identified 5q13-q14, 5q34, 10p11.2, 9q21-q34 as genomic regions associated with the proliferative activity of malignant glioma cell lines. Cell lines with gain on proximal 5q, where CCNB1 and CCNH reside, showed an increased growth rate, suggesting that cyclins activating cdc2, the dominant G2/M phase kinase, may play a role in glioma tumorigenes.
