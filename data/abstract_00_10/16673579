Using the agar dilution method, the antibacterial activity of 18 antibiotics inclusive of 4 carbapenems were investigated against 101 strains of urinary pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections who visited the Department of Urology at Kagoshima University Hospital, between January and December 2002. 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 3 strains of Staphylococcus spp. (exclusive of S. aureus), 14 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Enterococcus spp. (exclusive of E. faecalis), 41 strains of Escherichia coli, 21 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (exclusive of E. coli), 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 strains of glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative rods (exclusive of P. aeruginosa) were examined. 1. Against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, vancomycin and teicoplanin were active. Additionally, arbekacin was active against S. aureus clinical isolates and ampicillin was active against E. faecalis clinical isolates. Carbapenems were active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 2. As for clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, meropenem was most active against Enterobacteriaceae among 13 antibiotics tested. Against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, MIC90 of meropenem was the lowest among 13 antibiotics tested. In addition, resistant rate of meropenem and biapenem against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates was lower than those of the other carbapenems tested. 3. As main urinary pathogens showed no remarkable increase in resistance to carbapenems, it can be stated that carbapenems retain their position as the drug of first choice for severe infection.
