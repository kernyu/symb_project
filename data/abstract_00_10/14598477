The effect of yeast double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and of hyaluronic acid (HA) compositions produced on the interferon synthesis, peritoneal phagocytic activity of macrophages and on the hematological parameters were studied in an experiment with white noninbred mice. HA was shown to enhance the dsRNA-induced interferon synthesis, to inhibit the leukopenic reaction and to produce no effect on the phagocytosis-stimulating activity. The data obtained are indicative of that HA is a promising preparation regarding its use within the interferon-inducing compositions based on dsRNA.
