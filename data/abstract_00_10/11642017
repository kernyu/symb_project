In 1999, during the survey of resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics by 31 clinical laboratories of Rhone-Alpes area, MIC to penicillin (P), amoxicillin (AMX) and cefotaxime (CTX) of 877 PRP strains or with a diameter of inhibition to oxacillin inferior to 26 mm, were determined by each institution by E-test (n = 220 strains) or ATB-PNEUMO (n = 657 strains). MICs of these three antibiotics were determined by dilution in agar medium by the coordinating center. The essential agreement was respectively for ATB-PNEUMO and E-test 89% versus 84% for P (p > 0.05), of 86% vs 79% for AMX (p < 0.01), and of 91% vs 86% for CTX (p = 0.03). When the strains were classified in clinical category, the differences were significant (p < 0.001) for AMX (85% vs 71%) and for CTX (82% vs 75%) but not for P (73% vs 78%). ATB-PNEUMO method was more sensitive than E-test for the detection of strains susceptible to P (90 vs 73%), to AMX (83 vs 78%) and to CTX (80 vs 72%) and for the strains intermediate to AMX (90 vs 78%). On the contrary, E-test is more specific than ATB-PNEUMO for the detection of P-resistant strains (94 vs 86%). Finally, the specificity of both methods is the same for detection of P-S, AMX-R and CTX-I strains.
