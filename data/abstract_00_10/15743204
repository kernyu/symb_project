On the basis of molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the dynamic properties of the carbapenem- and cephamycin-resistant dinuclear zinc metallo-beta-lactamase from Bacteroides fragilis and its complex with a biphenyl tetrazole inhibitor, 2-butyl-6-hydroxy-3-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-3H-quinazolin-4-on e 1 (L-159061). The results obtained with the newly developed force field parameters for the coordination environment of the catalytic zinc ions show that the active site gorge comprising major and minor loops gets deeper and narrower upon binding of the inhibitor, which supports the previous experimental implication that the structural flexibility of the loop structures plays a significant role in enzymatic action. In the presence of the inhibitor, the Trp32 side chain at the apex of the major loop covers the entrance of active site channel, thereby contributing to the stabilization of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. In addition to a direct coordination of the inhibitor tetrazole ring to the second zinc ion in the active site, the hydrogen bonding of Lys167 to the inhibitor carbonyl group and hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitor and side chains of loop residues prove to be significant binding forces of the enzyme-inhibitor complex.
