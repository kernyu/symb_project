The genotype structure and silver sulfadiazine (SDS) resistance of a number of Acinetobacter baumanii strains that circulated for a prolonged period of time in burn UCUs were studied. The most resistant strain (SDS MIC 50 mcg/ml) contained a class 1 integron with the gene of sulfonamides resistance (sul1) in its genome. Possible reasons for selection of the multiple resistance among Acinetobacter spp. in burn units are discussed.
