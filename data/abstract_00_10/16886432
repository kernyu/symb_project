The purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to 6 antifungal agents of 143 strains of Candida species isolated from 545 patients with suspicion of fungal infection. Test ATB Fungus (bioMerieux) was used. Among all Candida isolates 91.6% were susceptible to tested polyenes and 32.9% to all azoles. Less susceptible to polyenes isolates were noted in low percentage (0.7 to 4.2%) and to azoles more frequently (32.9 to 41.2%). Candida isolates resistant to antifungal agents tested were dependent from the kind of clinical samples and species of fungi. Monitoring of the susceptibility to antifungal agents by ATB commercial test seems to be useful tool for therapeutic purposes.
