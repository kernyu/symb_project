A ceftazidime-resistant Providencia stuartii isolate from Algeria harbored a ca. 160-kb conjugative plasmid that contained a truncated bla(VEB-1b) gene flanked by three 135-bp repeated elements. This work gives further evidence of the worldwide spread of bla(VEB) genes that are associated with genetic structures other than class 1 integrons.
