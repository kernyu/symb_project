PURPOSE: To examine the in vitro resistance to ofloxacin of preoperative bacterial isolates from the conjunctival sac of Japanese patients. METHODS: The database of bacterial flora cultured preoperatively from the conjunctival sac of 1455 Japanese patients (1455 eyes) between 1995 and 1999 was reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The incidence of resistance of isolates to ofloxacin in vitro increased from 13.5% in 1995 to 32.8% in 1999. The percentage of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus isolates resistant to ofloxacin was 19.6% and 15.0%, respectively, in 1995 and 33.7% and 28.1%, respectively, in 1999. Logistic regression analysis showed that diabetes mellitus and aging were significantly associated with ofloxacin-resistant strains of bacteria. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the increased likelihood that conjunctival sac flora is resistant to ofloxacin, especially in elderly and diabetic patients.
