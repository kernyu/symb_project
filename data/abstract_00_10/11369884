Influenza virus A/Hong Kong/1774/99, isolated from a young child with mild influenza, was shown to be similar in its antigenic and genetic characteristics to H3N2 viruses circulating in pigs in Europe during the 1990s and in particular to be closely related to viruses isolated from two children in the Netherlands in 1993. Similar viruses had previously not been identified outside Europe. Although there is little evidence as to how the child contracted the infection, it appears likely that pigs in southern China were the source of infection. Characteristics shared with the European swine viruses include resistance to the anti-influenza drugs amantadine and rimantadine. Thus not only does this incident once again highlight the potential of pigs as a source of novel human influenza viruses, but also indicates the potential for emergence of amantadine-resistant human viruses.
