OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and patterns of antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance (ARV-DR) among ARV drug-naive, recently infected persons with HIV in the 4-year interval (2003-2006) after the inception of the National Access to ARV Programme for People who have AIDS in Thailand. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of patients with recent HIV infection for HIV risks, ARV-DR risks and baseline ARV-DR. RESULTS: Seven of the 305 patients (2%) had baseline ARV-DR. Via contract tracing, all seven patients with transmitted ARV-DR identified sexual partners with prior ARV treatment failure and had documented low (<75%) ARV adherence. Annual ARV-DR increased from 0 to 5.2% (P=0.06) between 2003 and 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Report of sexual partners with potential HIV and ARV drug exposures can prompt baseline ARV-DR testing of at-risk individuals, while behavioural interventions for adherence and safer sex are refined to minimize the emergence of resistance to generic, fixed-dose combination stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine (GPO-VIR) therapy.
