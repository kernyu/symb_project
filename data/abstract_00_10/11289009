The antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from specimens of invasive infections was examined at Siriraj Hospital, a tertiary care center in Bangkok, during December 1996 April 1998. The percentage of S. pneumoniae isolates intermediate and resistant to various antibiotics were: penicillin, 25% and 21%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 24% and 0%; cefuroxime, 6% and 36%; cefotaxime, 6% and 1.4%; ceftibuten, 5% and 42%; imipenem 22% and 0%; co-trimoxazole, 6% and 41%; chloramphenicol, 2% and 26%; erythromycin, 12% and 16%; azithromycin, 0% and 30%; and roxithromycin 0% and 33%. Most of the penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSP) were also nonsusceptible to other antibiotics except cefotaxime, and imipenem. The isolates from respiratory specimens have a higher rate of resistance to all antimicrobial agents with a significant rise in MIC50 of beta-lactam antibiotics. There was no difference in the outcome of infections caused by penicillin-susceptible and -nonsuscetible S. pneumoniae. The only identifiable risk factor associated with PNSP infection was prior use of antibiotic within 3 weeks.
