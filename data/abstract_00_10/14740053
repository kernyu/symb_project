The in vitro kinetics of inactivation of both wild-type and I21V InhA enzymes by [FeII(CN)5(INH)]3- indicate that this process requires no activation by KatG, and no need for the presence of NADH. This inorganic complex may represent a new class of lead compounds to the development of anti-tubercular agents aiming at inhibition of a validated target.
