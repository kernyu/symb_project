Immunoglobulin idiotypes (Id) of malignant B lymphocytes and plasma cells are tumor-specific antigens that were extensively used in immunotherapy studies. The effector mechanisms, involved in resistance to tumor following Id vaccination, are a controversial issue. Since cell-mediated responses, rather than antibody responses, constitute powerful effectors against tumors, recent studies focused on the generation of Id-specific T cells. Traditional methods for assessment of cellular responses in murine models of Id vaccination are inadequate because of their low sensitivity and because they do not determine actual frequency of antigen-reactive T cells. Here, we use the highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay for enumeration of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting cells in Id-vaccinated mice. Our experimental model consists of the murine B-lymphocyte tumor 38C-13, which expresses surface IgM, and the plasma cell tumor D2, which secretes IgM with idiotypic specificity identical to that of 38C-13. Vaccination of mice with purified 38C-13 IgM induced resistance to 38C-13 as well as to D2 tumor cells. Although immunized mice produced high levels of anti-Id antibodies that bound to 38C-13 cells, no binding of antibodies to D2 occurred, suggesting that cellular mechanisms mediated resistance to the plasma cell tumor. ELISPOT assays revealed that immunization induced a significant increase in the frequency of Id-specific IFN-gamma-secreting T cells. Depletion of T cell subsets demonstrated that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were involved in the response to Id. This is the first report on application of the ELISPOT assay for enumeration of Id-reactive T cells in a murine model of Id vaccination, providing a tool to study Id-specific T cell responses and to evaluate the efficacy of Id vaccines.
