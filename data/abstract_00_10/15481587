The antibiotic resistance pattern of respiratory tract pathogens isolated of different animal species suffering from respiratory tract diseases has been investigated by antibiograms performed by agar diffusion test. The results show that the resistance situation in Switzerland is favourable compared with studies from other countries. However, high resistance rates were found in certain species: 61% of Streptococcus spp. were resistant to erythromycin and 44% to tetracycline, 59% of Bordetella bronchiseptica were resistant to ampicillin and 50% of Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica were multiresistant to tetracycline, ampicillin and streptomycine. The gram negative isolates were widely resistant to streptomycine.
