This report describes the unusual occurrence of mastitis and breast abscess in both mother and infant, both caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Mother and child were both immunocompetent, and their only risk factor was routine confinement. The case highlights the importance of considering MRSA as a cause for mastitis in mothers and infants. MRSA is increasingly common, and failure to consider it as a cause for mastitis will lead to delays in treatment (as it did in this case). The case also demonstrates the role of Hospital in the Home in the treatment of postnatal infections, where hospitalization can be extremely disruptive.
