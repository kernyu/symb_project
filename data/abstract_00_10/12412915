An ecological survey was conducted from April 1997 to June 1999 on four turkey flocks (F1 to F4). Turkey cecal contents, litter, waterers, feed, feeders, and environmental swabs were analyzed. Presence of Salmonella was determined using conventional microbiological screening techniques and confirmed by serology. Positive isolates were serotyped and screened for antibiotic resistance. From a total of 69 Salmonella isolates 25% were resistant to one or more antibiotics including gentamicin (G), spectinomycin (SP), streptomycin (S), tetracycline (T), tobramycin (TO), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Isolates included 45 S. heidelberg, 13 S. senftenberg, 7 S. muenster, 2 S. anatum, and 2 S. worthington. Resistance to antibiotic(s) was highest among waterer isolates (55%) followed by environmental swabs (43%), feeder content samples (33%), turkey cecal contents (26%), and litter samples (5%). Frequencies of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella in F1, F2, and F4 were 27, 13, and 40%, respectively. Salmonella was undetected in F3. In F1, S. heidelberg from cecal content and waterer samples was resistant to G, SP, S, and T, whereas S. anatum from waterer samples was resistant to T and S. In F2, S. worthington from litter and feeder content samples was resistant to T, and in F4, S. muenster from environmental swabs was resistant to TO, S, SP, and G. Identifying preharvest sources and characterizing serotype and antibiotic-resistance profile can assist poultry producers and integrators in tracking movement of Salmonella on turkey farms.
