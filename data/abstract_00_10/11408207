The in vitro activities of meropenem, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, vancomycin, and penicillin against 130 clinical isolates of group C and G streptococci, including vancomycin-tolerant isolates, were evaluated. Meropenem, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, vancomycin, and penicillin MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 0.06, 2.0, 0.25, 0.5, and < or = 0.016 microg/ml, respectively. Meropenem, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and penicillin were active against group C and G streptococci, including vancomycin-resistant strains.
