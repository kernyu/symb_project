A total of 499 Salmonella enterica serovar Agona isolates from cattle, swine, chicken, and turkey samples were assayed for antimicrobial susceptibility and subtyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Salmonella Agona isolates exhibited increased resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, cephalothin, and chloramphenicol, and a single isolate was resistant to ceftriaxone. Multiple drug resistance (MDR; resistance >or= 2 antimicrobials) was exhibited in 57% (n=282/499) of the Salmonella Agona isolates and 22% (n=111/499) of these Salmonella Agona isolates were resistant to five or more antimicrobials. PFGE patterns of 482 Salmonella Agona slaughter samples resulted in 165 unique patterns. Cluster analysis indicated that isolates indistinguishable by PFGE appeared to group according to antimicrobial resistance profiles. These data suggest that Salmonella Agona is increasing in prevalence in U.S. cattle presented for slaughter and should be further monitored.
