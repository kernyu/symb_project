The prevalence of nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations was determined among 95 human immunodeficiency virus-infected Thai children who were treated with dual nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. Almost all children had resistance to at least 1 NRTI, and approximately half of the children had resistance to multiple NRTIs. Cross-resistance to stavudine and azidothymidine was universal.
