AIM: To try efficacy and safety of ophramax (cephtriaxon) made in India ("Ranbaxy") in infectious-inflammatory diseases treated in a general hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ophramax was given in a dose 1 to 4 g/day to 23 patients with pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, soft tissue infection, enterocolitis, etc. Therapeutic effect was examined with bacteriological identification of the infective agents, antibioticograms, agar diffusion test. RESULTS: High sensitivity of pathogens to ophramax was observed in bronchopulmonary diseases (90.7%). In other infections sensitivity of the pathogens was 59.3%. Enterococci were the only highly resistant pathogens (40.5%). Ophramax remains in the body in sufficiently high concentrations for 24 hours. This attributes to good therapeutic effect. CONCLUSION: Clinico-microbiological and pharmacokinetic findings show that ophramax can be used as a basic drug for treatment of different infectious-inflammatory diseases. Once-a-day regimen is a great advantage of ophramax.
