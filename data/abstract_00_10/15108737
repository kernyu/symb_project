We compared oropharyngeal cultures and fluconazole susceptibility for Candida in 100 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 100 non-HCWs. Isolates were identified using standard microbiological methods. Susceptibility was determined by Etest and microtiter method. There was no significant difference in prevalence or species of oropharyngeal Candida between HCWs and non-HCWs. Fluconazole resistance was infrequent.
