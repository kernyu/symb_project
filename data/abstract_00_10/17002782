Type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) is a monomeric enzyme and requires Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) for its activity. Up to now, seven PP2C-like genes have been identified in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the protein encoded by the sixth PP2C-like gene, YCR079w, has not been demonstrated to have PP2C activity. In this study, we show that YCR079w confers a rapamycin-resistant function in yeast cells, and we also demonstrate that the YCR079w-encoded protein exhibits characteristics of a typical PP2C. Therefore, YCR079w encodes the sixth PP2C, PTC6, in budding yeast.
