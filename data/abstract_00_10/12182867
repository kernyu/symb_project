An efficient synthesis of DNA binding molecules consisting of four heterocyclic carboxamide units and various substituents at both termini is described. The minor-groove binding ligands showed excellent activity against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria; no cross-resistance to known antibacterial drugs was observed.
