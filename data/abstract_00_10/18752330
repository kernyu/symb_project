UNLABELLED: Treatment of 171 patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) 10 mg over 48 weeks resulted in significant histological, virological, serological, and biochemical improvement compared with placebo. The long-term efficacy and safety of ADV in a subset of these patients was investigated for up to 5 years. Sixty-five patients given ADV 10 mg in year 1 elected to continue in a long-term safety and efficacy study (LTSES). At enrollment, the 65 LTSES patients were a median 34 years old, 83% male, 74% Asian, 23% Caucasian, median baseline serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA 8.45 log(10) copies/mL, and median baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 2.0 x upper limit of normal. At 5 years on study, the median changes from baseline in serum HBV DNA and ALT for the 41 patients still on ADV were 4.05 log(10) copies/mL and -50 U/L, respectively. HBeAg loss and seroconversion were observed in 58% and 48% of patients by end of study, respectively. Fifteen patients had baseline and end of follow-up liver biopsies; improvements in necroinflammation and fibrosis were seen in 67% and 60% of these patients, respectively. Adefovir resistance mutations A181V or N236T developed in 13 LTSES patients; the first observation was at study week 195. There were no serious adverse events related to ADV. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ADV beyond 48 weeks was well tolerated and produced long-term virological, biochemical, serological, and histological improvement.
