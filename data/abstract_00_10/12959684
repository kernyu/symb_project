We bacteriologically analyzed 156 species of Enterobacteriaceae, isolated from 138 patients with community-acquired diabetic foot ulcers, in a prospective study made at a diabetic center and at the Federal University of Ceara, Brazil, from March, 2000, to November, 2001. The samples were cultured using selective media, and identification, susceptibility tests and detection of plasmid-mediated-extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing strains were made with conventional and automated methods. The most frequently occurring pathogens were K. pneumoniae (21.2%), Morganella morganii (19.9%) and E. coli (15.4%). High resistance rates were noted for ampicillin, first generation cephalosporin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and chloramphenicol. ESBL-producing strains were detected in 6% of the patients. Resistance among gram-negative bacteria has become increasingly common, even in community-acquired infections.
