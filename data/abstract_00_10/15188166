BACKGROUND & AIMS: The main limiting factor for sodium absorption in distal colon is the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This study aimed to characterize mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of ENaC expression in ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Epithelial preparations from surgically removed inflamed and control sigmoid colons were used. Active electrogenic Na(+) transport (J(Na)) was determined after 8-hour aldosterone stimulation in Ussing-chambers (corrected for the altered epithelial/subepithelial resistance ratio). Subsequently, ENaC alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits were analyzed immunohistochemically and in Western and Northern blots (corrected for the inflammatory increase in subepithelial protein content). To study gene regulation, the promoters of beta- and gamma-ENaC were analyzed in reporter gene assays. RESULTS: In controls, aldosterone stimulated J(Na) and induced ENaC beta- and gamma-subunit expression, whereas this response was virtually abolished in UC. Preservation of surface epithelium in UC was indicated by unchanged ENaC alpha-subunit expression, which points also against a mere immaturity or epithelial cell loss. Inhibition of electrogenic sodium transport as well as beta- and gamma-ENaC mRNA expression could be mimicked in control colon by in vitro preexposure for 8 hours to tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma. Promoter analysis revealed that down-regulation of beta- and gamma-ENaC gene expression was primarily induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that, in UC, elevated proinflammatory cytokines selectively impair beta- and gamma-ENaC expression, which contributes to diarrhea by reducing colonic sodium absorption.
