Two new norlignans, hyperiones A (1) and B (2), three new acylphloroglucinols, aspidinol C (3) and hyperaspidinols A (5) and B (6), the known compound aspidinol D (4), and the symmetrical dimeric xanthone hyperidixanthone (7) were isolated from Hypericum chinense. Their structures were established by spectroscopic analysis. In an antibacterial assay using a panel of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, compounds 3 and 4 exhibited promising activity against the NorA efflux protein overexpressing MDR Staphylococcus aureus strain SA-1199B with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mug/mL (8.4 muM) and 4 mug/mL (16.8 muM), respectively. The positive control antibiotic norfloxacin showed activity at MIC 32 mug/mL (100 muM).
