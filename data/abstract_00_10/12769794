The introduction of potent drug combinations comprising reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors has dramatically altered the natural history of HIV disease, at least in the short term. Unfortunately, poor penetrability into different anatomic compartments, toxicity and drug resistance, are some of the problems related to their prolonged use. HIV's ability to mutate and become resistant along with the ongoing viral replication during HAART, which may lead to the emergence of independently evolving viral strains in different anatomic compartments and establishment of latent viral reservoirs also remain critical for the success and failure of antiretroviral therapy. Current drug therapies do not eliminate these viral reservoirs, nor do they discourage their formation. New strategies are needed for flushing hidden pockets of HIV in vivo. This review will focus mainly on novel strategies in the pipeline, along with the recent developments in the field.
