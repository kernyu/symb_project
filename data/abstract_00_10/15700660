Helicobacter pylori is the main causative agent of peptic ulcer disease. Clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori is one of the common causes of failure of the eradication therapy based on the use of amoxicillin-clarithromycin and proton pump inhibitors. In this study, 78 H. pylori strains isolated from antral biopsy specimens of dyspeptic patients have been tested for susceptibility to clarithromycin, with NCCLS approved agar dilution and the E-test methods. Sixteen (20.5%) of the strains were found resistant to clarithromycin, and the resistance rates were similar obtained by E-test and agar dilution method. The high rate of clarithromycin resistance among H. pylori strains in our study population, may give a direction to follow-up of the eradication therapy and to define regional treatment policies.
