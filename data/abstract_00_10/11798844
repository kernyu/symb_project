OBJECTIVE: To analyze the surveillance data on bacterial resistance in Shanghai hospitals reported from January 1 to December 31, 1999. METHODS: Data on bacterial susceptibility testings of 14 855 clinical isolates collected from eleven Shanghai hospitals were performed using Kirby-Bauer method and the results were analyzed according to NCCLS (1999). RESULTS: Methicillin resistant strains accounted for 64% and 77% of S. aureus and CNS respectively; and no vancomycin resistant strains were found. In Enterococcus spp, vancomycin resistant strains accounted for 3.5% and 1.7% of E.fecalis and E.fecium, respectively. Resistant rates of E.coli against piperacillin, gentamicin and fluoroquinolones were about 50% or higher. Resistant rates of Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, Citrobacter spp and Acinetobacter spp against the third generation cephalosporins have increased markedly. Besides, the resistant rates of P.aeruginosa against ceftazidime and imipenem have increased to 27% and 20% respectively. CONCLUSION: A national strategy on the restrictive and prudent use of antibiotics is urgently needed.
