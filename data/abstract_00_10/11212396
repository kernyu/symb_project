One hundred and twenty-nine children with acute viral and bacterial infection of the respiratory tract were examined and disturbance of the large intestine microflora was detected. It was characterized by significant reduction of lactobacilli, moderate growth of opportunistic bacteria and higher contents of Candida. Changes in T- and especially B-cellular immunity were observed in 35 per cent of the patients. In patients with decreased avidity of the immunoglobulins G in the peripheral blood the changes were observed in 82-100 per cent of the cases. In the majority of the patients the capacity for interferon genesis was suppressed. A shorten course (5 days) of the bifidumbacterin forte therapy in a dose of not less than 10(9) CFU/ml. normalized the intestinal microflora, improved the indices of the B- and T-cellular immunity (including the subpopulation of the T-helper cells but not the T-suppressor cells), stimulated NK and improved the ability to induce alfa- and gamma-interferons of the peripheral blood leukocytes. The experience with using high doses of bifidumbacterin forte was evident of its good tolerance and possible value in increasing the patient resistance to infection.
