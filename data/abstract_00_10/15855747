Despite numerous scientific advances in the past few years regarding the pathogenesis, diagnostic tools and treatment of infectious enteritis, enteric infections remain a serious threat to health worldwide. With globalization of the food supply, the increase in travel, mass food processing and antibiotic resistance, infectious diarrhea has become a critical concern for both developing and developed countries. Oral rehydration therapy has been cited as the most important medical discovery of the century due to the millions of lives that have been saved. However, statistics concerning diarrhea-induced mortality and the highly underestimated morbidity continue to demonstrate the severity of the problem. A more complete understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diarrhea and potential new vaccines and effective treatments are badly needed. In addition, public health preventive actions, such as early detection of outbreaks, care with food, water and sanitation and, where relevant, immunization, should be considered a priority. This article provides an overview of the epidemiological impact, pathogenesis and new approaches to the management of enteric infections.
