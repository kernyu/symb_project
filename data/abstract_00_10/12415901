The activity of antimicrobial agents frequently used for treating bovine mastitis was determined against 101 coagulase-positive staphylococci isolated from bovine mammary secretion. The isolates were obtained from 39 dairy farms located in the central dairy area of Argentina. The disk diffusion method was used and the following antimicrobial agents were tested: penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, cephacetrile, penicillin + novobiocin, erythromycin, pirlimycin, novobiocin and neomycin. The highest levels of resistance were observed against penicillin and ampicillin (47.6%), while the lowest against erythromycin (2%), pirlimycin (4%) and neomycin (2.9%). No resistant strains against oxacillin, cephacetrile and penicillin + novobiocin were detected.
