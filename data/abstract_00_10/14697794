A series of peptidomimetic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors containing substituted all-phenylnorstatine [APNS: (2S,3S)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyric acid] were designed and synthesized. From the structure-metabolism relationship of this type of HIV protease inhibitors, the compounds having para substitution of the phenyl ring of Apns and/or 2,6-disubstitution of the P2' benzylamine were found to be able to avoid the P2 phenol glucuronidation that occurs with SM-319777 (formerly named JE-2147, KNI-764); one of the main metabolic pathways of SM-319777. These new analogues, such as SM-322377, had more desirable pharmacokinetic profiles and more potent antiviral activity against not only wild type HIV-1 but also the multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 than SM-319777.
