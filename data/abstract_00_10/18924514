Urinary tract infections (UTI) could present with different clinical forms dependent on intensity and localization of infection and child's age. The symptoms could be non specific in children. Condition that provoke to urinary stasis, especially voiding dysfunction is the favourable factor for UTI appearance. Gram-negative enteric bacteria is the most common pathogen. Urine culture is the basic investigation that allow to identify pathogen and its drug sensitiveness but simultaneous urinalysis is necessary to recognize the inflammation of urinary organs. In addition, the number of leukocytes gives an idea about inflammation intensity. Ultrasonographic (USG) scan is necessary to examine urostasis. DMSA study performed during febrile UTI allow to identify children with acute pyelonephritis and when repeated 6 months later - those with renal scars. A normal USG and DMSA scan during infection makes voiding cystourethrography (VCU) unnecessary in the primary examination. The presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) not always predispose children to renal lesions. Early and appropriate treatment of UTI, especially during the first 24 hours, diminishes the likelihood of renal involvement during the acute phase of infection but does not prevent scar formation. The proper hygiene of the urethral meatus, voiding and drinking habits and preventing of constipation are crucial in UTI prophylaxis.
