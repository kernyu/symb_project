The soluble copper silicate (CS) MIC of 100 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 100 strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was 175 mg Cu/liter. Bactericidal and postantibiotic effects (> or =1 h) were seen at 2x MIC and 4x MIC. The frequency of mutation was <10(-9), and serial passage could not extend growth beyond 1.6x MIC.
