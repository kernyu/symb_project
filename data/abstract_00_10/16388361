Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) has a very fluctuating course and responsiveness to interferon beta (IFN-beta) treatment in each patient is extremely difficult. Agreement exists about the negative role of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) on clinical efficacy and markers of IFN-beta bioavailability have been studied; no guidelines exist yet about what to do when a patient becomes NAbs positive or IFN biological activity is lost. In this study 405 MS patients have been longitudinally studied for NAbs and MxA expression. A spontaneous disappearance of NAbs was observed in a few patients with low antibody titre; according to the clinical course, a therapeutic modification has been made in patients persistently NAbs positive; in these patients NAbs persisted over time despite the interruption of IFN therapy.
