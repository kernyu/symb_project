PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the most recent data on severe Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. The focus will be on clinical studies with an emphasis on the critically ill. RECENT FINDINGS: The frequency of P. aeruginosa as the etiologic agent of infections associated with high morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients continues to increase. Unfortunately, pan-resistant isolates are now emerging as a significant clinical problem. Highly or pan-resistant isolates are associated with more frequent inappropriate initial therapy and increased mortality. Prevention relies on limitation of antibiotic pressure. Unfortunately, antibiotic class rotation has not resulted in persistent decreases in resistant isolates and the increased use of treatment protocols may actually increase selection. SUMMARY: Because of the frequency of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and the high associated mortality, combination, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be used for empiric coverage of suspected P. aeruginosa infections. Accurate diagnostic testing can help to discontinue unnecessary antibiotics and decrease the overall selective pressure. Increasing resistance without new antibiotic classes on the horizon suggests the need for better use of available antibiotics and an emphasis on innovative treatment strategies in the future.
