Ceftobiprole MICs at which 50% and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC50 and MIC90), determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method, were both 1 microg/mL (range, 0.5-1 microg/mL) against 143 community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 0.5 microg/mL (range, 0.25-0.5 microg/mL) with 29 methicillin-susceptible isolates recovered from military trainees during 2 prospective investigations.
