Research on benzimidazole-resistant Population S small strongyles began in a Shetland pony herd in 1974 at the University of Kentucky and has continued for over 25 years. The present update, for the period 1992-1999, evaluated activity of pyrantel pamoate (PRT) in field tests in the pony herd. Additional critical tests with PRT and oxibendazole (OBZ) were done in foals born in the herd. Activity of PRT was initially excellent in field tests, based on epg/lpg count data, but declined rapidly during the second full year of pyrantel treatments. Critical test data for small strongyles indicated efficacies of PRT were about 60% at the beginning of the present observations and this intermediate level of removal continued throughout the seven-year period except for 1994 (75%). Unusual was the finding that field test epg/lpg data on small strongyles indicated much lower activity of PRT than found in worm count data in critical tests. The previously reported ineffective activity of OBZ on this population of small strongyles continued. Data are presented on prevalence and drug activity on several species of internal parasites besides small strongyles.
