Two hundred non-duplicate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates causing bacteremia in patients in four major Hong Kong hospitals during the period 2000 to 2001 were characterized by antibiogram, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using SmaI restriction enzymes, and determination of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types. Nine PFGE types, A to I, were obtained. PFGE type A constituted 50% (99/200) of all isolates and was present in isolates from all four hospitals. PFGE types A to E, had previously been identified as the major types at one of the hospitals from 1988 to 2000. The majority had a resistance profile to tetracycline (T), erythromycin (E), clindamycin (D), gentamicin (G), tobramycin (To), and ciprofloxacin (Ci), and belonged to SCCmec type III; and representatives belonged to clonal complex 239 (CC 239) (MRSA with SCCmec type III and sequence type 239, designated ST 239-MRSA-III). PFGE types F to I were new patterns that had not been previously identified in isolates from Hong Kong. PFGE type F constituted 18% (35/200) of MRSAs, had resistance profile TEGToCi, and belonged to CC 5 (ST 5-MRSA-II). PFGE type G included 13% (26/200) of MRSAs, had resistance profile TECi, and belonged to CC 45 with SCCmec type I or II. PFGE type H had characteristics similar to those of CC 239, while PFGE type I included three isolates, two of which expressed resistance to oxacillin and fusidic acid only. Two of these strains had SCCmec IVa and carried sequence type 389, with a multilocus sequence typing allelic profile of 3-35-19-2-20-26-39. Contemporary MRSAs causing bacteremia in Hong Kong hospitals belong to three clonal complexes (CC 5, CC 45, and CC 239). The most prevalent MRSA clone in Hong Kong belongs to CC 239, with PFGE types A to E and H, SCCmec type III, ST 239, and a resistance profile of TEDGToCi.
