This study was undertaken to determine whether resistance to moxidectin had developed in a large herd of draught horses, maintained on a small acreage, which had been routinely treated with moxidectin for five years. Faeces were collected for egg counts immediately before moxidectin gel was administered orally, and seven, 30, 60 and 90 days later. The faecal egg counts were significantly reduced at seven and 30 days after treatment, but were not significantly different from pretreatment counts at 60 and 90 days after treatment. There was no evidence of resistance having developed.
