The antimicrobial activity of 10 natural abietanes isolated from Plectranthus grandidentatus and P. hereroensis acetonic extract was evaluated against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). The results revealed that the most active diterpenes were coleon U (1), 7alpha-acetoxy-6beta-hydroxyroyleanone (2) and horminone (3). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging 0.98-15.63 microg/ml were obtained for MRSA clinical strains, and MIC values of 15.63 and 31.25 microg/ml were obtained for VRE clinical strains. Some structure-activity relationships are emphasized.
