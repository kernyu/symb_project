The impact of a late fall treatment on the spring rise of fecal egg counts was evaluated in a controlled study with Canadian horses treated with 2 different dewormers immediately after removal from pasture for winter housing. The horses were stabled until the end of the trial period. Seventeen weanlings, 20 yearlings, and 15 2-year-old horses located in Ontario, which were presumed to be naturally infected with cyathostomins after pasture grazing, were randomly allocated to either a group treated with 0.4 mg/kg of moxidectin and 2.5 mg/kg of praziquantel or a group treated with 0.2 mg/kg of ivermectin and 1.5 mg/kg of praziquantel. Three weeks after treatment, all strongyle fecal egg counts were reduced to zero for both treatment groups. However, at 5 months post-treatment, mean geometric fecal egg counts were statistically higher for the yearlings and 2-year-old horses treated with ivermectin than for the yearlings and 2-year-old horses treated with moxidectin (P < 0.0001).
