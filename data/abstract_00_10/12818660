The identification of several lesion mimic mutants (LMM) that misregulate cell death constitutes a powerful tool to unravel programmed cell death (PCD) pathways in plants, particularly the hypersensitive response (HR), a form of PCD associated with resistance to pathogens. Recently, the characterization of novel LMM has enabled genes that might regulate cell death programmes to be identified as well as the dissection of defense signaling pathways and of crosstalk between multiple pathways in ways that might not be possible by studying the responses of wild-type plants to pathogens.
