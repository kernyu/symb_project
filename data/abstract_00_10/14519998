Adenylate cyclase deficient (cya) mutants of E. coli K-12 were found to be resistant to fosmidomycin, a specific inhibitor of the non-mevalonate pathway, just like to fosfomycin. E. coli glpT mutants were resistant to fosfomycin and also to fosmidomycin. This fact shows that fosmidomycin was transported inside via the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter, GlpT. DNA micro-array analysis showed that the transcription of glpT and other genes concerning glycerol utilization were highly dependent on the presence of cAMP.
