We compared the propensities of Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 and of the recombination-deficient JH2-2 recA strain to develop mutational resistance to linezolid. In both organisms, a mutation in a single rrl copy conferred resistance to linezolid. Delay in acquisition of the mutation by other rrl copies in JH2-2 recA showed that gene conversion contributed to the acquisition of resistance.
