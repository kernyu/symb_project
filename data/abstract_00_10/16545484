BACKGROUND/AIMS: We previously established hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon-harboring cell lines possessing two interferon (IFN)-resistant phenotypes: a partially resistant phenotype (alphaR series) and a severely resistant phenotype (betaR series). We recently found that the severe IFN resistance of the betaR-series cells is caused by the functional disruption of type I IFN receptors. Here, we aimed to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the partial IFN resistance of the alphaR-series cells. METHODS: alphaR-series cells were pre-treated with 5-azacytidine to evaluate the effects of DNA demethylation on IFN resistance. cDNA microarray analysis was carried out in order to compare 1alphaR cells, which belong to the alphaR series, treated with both 5-azacytidine and IFN-alpha with cells treated with 5-azacytidine or IFN-alpha alone. RESULTS: We found that the IFN-resistant phenotype of alphaR-series cells was impaired by treatment with 5-azacytidine. cDNA microarray analysis identified seven IFN-stimulated genes, which were up-regulated by 5-azacytidine treatment. We demonstrated here that the ectopic expression of each of these seven genes in 1alphaR cells frequently weakened the IFN resistance of these cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that the epigenetic silencing of IFN-stimulated genes is implicated in the acquisition of a partially IFN-resistant phenotype of HCV replicon-harboring cells.
