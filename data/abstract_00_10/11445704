OBJECTIVE: Septic complications and the emergence of drug-resistant microbes represent serious risks to patients. Recently, naturally occurring peptides have been discovered that possess potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Protegrin-1 is particularly attractive for clinical use in human wounds because, unlike defensins, protegrin-1 retains broad antimicrobial and antifungal activity at physiologic salt concentration and in the presence of serum. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of protegrin-1 in killing multiple drug-resistant microbes isolated from human burn patients. DESIGN: For thein vitroexperiment, bilayer radial diffusion was performed comparing standard antibiotics with protegrin-1 on multiple-drug-resistant microbial organisms isolated from infected burn wounds. In vivo, rats received a 20% total body surface area partial-thickness burn by immersion in 60 degrees C water for 20 secs followed by wound seeding with 106 colony forming units of Silvadene-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. SETTING: University of Michigan research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Rats were randomized into three groups: those receiving synthetic protegrin-1, acetic acid (carrier), or gentamicin (positive control). Protegrin-1 was administered by topical application or intradermal injection. Wound tissues were harvested aseptically at different time points for quantitative bacterial counts. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed rapid and significant decreases in bacterial counts for protegrin-1-treated groups compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that protegrin-1 potentially may be used as an alternative or adjunct therapy to standard agents used to treat wound infections.
