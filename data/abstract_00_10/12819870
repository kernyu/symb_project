Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been shown to increase cellular resistance against oxidative injury, but the functional significance of this is currently obscure. We investigated the protective role of HO-1, induced by tin-protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), in attenuating liver transplantation injury. Lewis rats were intraperitoneally treated with saline as control, 50 micro mol/kg of SnPP, or 2 mg/kg of cycloheximide (CHX) before SnPP injection. Gene expression of HO-1 was induced after either treatment with SnPP- or CHX + SnPP instead of saline, whereas HO-1 protein synthesis was enhanced in Kupffer-like dendritic cells of the SnPP-treated group. Following reperfusion of liver grafts preserved for 30 h, there were fewer intercellular adhesion molecule-1-positive cells in SnPP-treated livers, significantly reduced numbers of dead cells, and enhanced graft viability. The present data suggest that increased synthesis of HO-1 protein by SnPP pre-conditioning is linked to the improved liver graft viability through inhibition of inflammatory adhesion molecules.
