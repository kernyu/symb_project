Resistance to antimonials has become a clinical threat in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Unravelling the resistance mechanism needs attention to circumvent the problem of drug resistance. In one of the resistant isolates, we earlier identified a gene (PG1) implicated in antimony resistance whose localization in the present study was confirmed on the pellicular plasma membrane of the parasite thereby indicating towards membrane modification as a mechanism of resistance in this resistant isolate.
