The introduction of HIV-1 protease (HIV-PR) inhibitors has led to a dramatic increase in patient survival; however, these gains are threatened by the emergence of multi-drug-resistant strains. Design of inhibitors that overcome resistance would be greatly facilitated by deeper insight into the mechanistic events associated with binding of substrates and inhibitors, as well as an understanding of the effects of resistance mutations on the structure and dynamic behavior of HIV-PR. We previously reported a series of simulations that provide a model for HIV-PR dynamics, with spontaneous conversions between the bound and unbound crystal forms upon addition or removal of an inhibitor. Importantly, the unbound protease transiently sampled a third fully open state that permits entry to the active site, unlike both crystallographic forms. Recently, a crystal structure of unbound HIV-PR was reported for the MDR 769 isolate (PDB: 1TW7); unlike all previous experimental structures, the binding pocket is open. It is suggested that drug resistance in this strain arises at least in part from the inability of inhibitors to induce closing. We carried out simulations of the MDR 769 HIV-PR mutant and observed that the reported structure is unstable in solution and rapidly adopts the semi-open conformation observed for the unbound wild-type protease in solution. Further analysis suggests that the wide-open structure observed for MDR 769 arises not from sequence variation, but instead is an artifact from crystal packing. Thus, despite being the first experimental structure to reveal flap opening sufficient for substrate access to the active site, this structure may not be directly relevant to studies of inhibitor entry or to the cause of HIV-PR drug resistance.
