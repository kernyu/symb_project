The combination of vancomycin and beta-lactams is often considered synergistic and has been recommended for the treatment of glycopeptide-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) infections. In this study, the combination of vancomycin or teicoplanin with different beta-lactams was tested. When using NaCl 4% w/v, for better expression of heterogeneous resistance to beta-lactams, with a longer (48-h) incubation period and a higher (10(7) CFU/mL) inoculum, the association of vancomycin with beta-lactams was antagonistic. However, a synergistic effect was observed for teicoplanin under the same conditions.
