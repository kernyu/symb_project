Forty two strains of enterococci were isolated from feces of healthy adolescents. Strains were selected according to their antagonistic effects associated with bacteriocinogenic and microcinogenic activity. Resistance of enterococci to antibiotics, various concentrations of hydrochloric acid and bile, their level of production of organic acids and adhesiveness were determined. Characteristics related to pathogenicity were investigared in 5 microcinogenic strains of E. faecium with broad spectrum of antagonistic activity. Non-pathogenic microcin-producing strains of E. faecium resistant to physiological concentrations of hydrochloric acid and bile with broad spectrum of antagonistic activity against obligatory pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms can be considered as possessing probiotic activity.
