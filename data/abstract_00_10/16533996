Parotid gland infection as a source of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia has been rarely reported. It is predominantly a disease of the elderly and is associated with significant mortality. Two cases are described here that presented over a 6 month history at a district general hospital. Many cases may be preventable with adequate hydration and good oral hygiene, combined with effective infection control.
