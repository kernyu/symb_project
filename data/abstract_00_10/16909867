Anomeric pairs of alpha- and beta-dodecyl, alpha- and beta-(1-pentylhexyl), and alpha- and beta-cyclododecyl glycosides of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) were synthesized. The starting beta-D-glucosaminides were obtained by the oxazoline method, and the corresponding alpha-isomers, by the mercuric iodide-catalyzed glycosylation of alcohols with alpha-glucosaminyl chloride peracetate in nitromethane at -90 degrees C. No reliable differences between the stimulation of mouse resistance to the infection with Staphylococcus aureus (doses of 2, 20, and 200 microg/mouse) and Escherichia coli (doses of 0.05, 1, and 20 microg/mouse) with the MDP alpha- and beta-glycosides were found.
