The emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a major problem throughout the world and a rational use of antibiotics is therefore very important. This study was performed to estimate the appropriateness of antimicrobial drug use in Celal Bayar University Hospital in Manisa. The data of all inpatients (n=937) between October and December 1998 were collected according to the Kunin and Jones criteria. Of the patients, 16.6% (n=156) were receiving antibiotics, and in 63.5, 23.0 and 13.5% of these, a single, two and three agents were used, respectively. The purpose of antibiotic use was for prophylaxis in 23.9%, as an empiric decision in 71.4% and for therapeutic culture-based reasons in 4.7%. The rate of rational antibiotic use was 45.7% and it was statistically higher in those patients from whom specimens had been taken for culture than in patients receiving prophylactic or empiric antibiotics. On medical wards, rational antibiotic usage was 55.1%, while it was 26.3% in surgical wards (P<0.0001). The low rate of appropriate antibiotic use in our university hospital reflects the urgent need of rationalization.
