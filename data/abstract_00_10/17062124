The anti-microbial susceptibility and genetic diversity of 65 strains of Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus (Sez) isolated from mares presenting clinical signs of endometritis was determined by disk agar diffusion and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) methods, respectively. Overall, Sez isolates were susceptible to beta-lactams, enrofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. These anti-microbials could be recommended as empiric anti-microbial therapy in cases of endometritis caused by Sez. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis typing revealed a great genetic diversity (56 different PFGE macrorestriction profiles) and a low level of genetic relatedness amongst the isolates.
