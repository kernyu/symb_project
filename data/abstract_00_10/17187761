The deletion strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae YNL080c (designed as EOS1) was identified as a strain sensitive to high-sucrose stress in our previous report [A. Ando, F. Tanaka, Y. Murata, H. Takagi, J. Shima, Identification and classification of genes required for tolerance to high sucrose stress revealed by genome-wide screening of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, FEMS Yeast Res. 6 (2006) 249-267]. Delta eos1 showed higher sensitivity to oxidative stress than to high-sucrose stress. Immunofluorescence microscopic and cellular fractionation analyses suggested that Eos1 localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We found that the deletion of EOS1 enhances tunicamycin tolerance and that in Delta eos1 the transcription level of KAR2, which is the ER stress-inducible gene, was much lower than that in the wild-type strain (BY4741) when exposed to tunicamycin. The inhibition of the N-glycosylation of carboxypeptidase Y and invertase activity caused by the addition of tunicamycin was depressed in Delta eos1, suggesting that EOS1 may be involved in N-glycosylation of the cellular proteins.
