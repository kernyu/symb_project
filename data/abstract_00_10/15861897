The authors studied the effect of storage period and heat on the physical and chemical properties of honey and proceeded to study the antibacterial effect of honey on Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. In samples of honey (Egyptian clover honey) that were heat-treated and stored over a long period of time, water content decreased, hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) was produced and increased in concentration, and enzyme activity decreased. Colour, measured in optical density, was markedly affected in honey samples stored over long periods of time, as was the refractive index, but electrical conductivity remained unaffected by storage or heating. Similarly, the storage period had no effect on pH value. To study the therapeutic effect of honey on E.coli and S. typhimurium, 25 isolates of E. coil O157:H7 (18.5%) and 49 isolates of S. typhimurium (36.2%) were isolated from 135 samples taken from children and calves (30 stool samples from children and 105 samples from calf organs and faecal swabs). Most E. coli O157:H7 and S. typhimurium isolates were highly resistant to most antibiotic discs. In vitro, the antibacterial effect of honey was more pronounced on E. coil O157:H7 than on S. typhimurium. Water content, pH value, HMF and the presence of H2O, all played an important role in the potency of olover honey as an antibacterial agent. In vivo, mice were used as a model for studying the parenteral usefulness of honey as an antibacterial agent against both pathogens. The antibacterial activity of honey that had been stored over a long period of time decreased and high concentrations of honey proved more effective as antibacterial agents. In this study there was lower mortality among mice treated with honey but the parenteral application of honey and its therapeutic properties require further investigation.
