A capillary electrophoresis (CE) microchip made of a new and promising polymeric material: Topas (thermoplastic olefin polymer of amorphous structure), a cyclic olefin copolymer with high chemical resistance, has been tested for the first time with analytical purposes, employing an electrochemical detection. A simple end-channel platinum amperometric detector has been designed, checked, and optimized in a poly-(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) CE microchip. The end-channel design is based on a platinum wire manually aligned at the exit of the separation channel. This is a simple and durable detection in which the working electrode is not pretreated. H(2)O(2) was employed as model analyte to study the performance of the PMMA microchip and the detector. Factors influencing migration and detection processes were examined and optimized. Separation of H(2)O(2) and L-ascorbic acid (AsA) was developed in order to evaluate the efficiency of microchips using different buffer systems. This detection has been checked for the first time with a microchip made of Topas, obtaining a good linear relationship for mixtures of H(2)O(2) and AsA in different buffers.
