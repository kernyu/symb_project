Antimicrobial therapy is one of the main stones of sepsis therapy. A recent study of septic shock patients showed that each hour of delay in antimicrobial administration during the ensuing 6 h after the onset of hypotension was associated with a decrease in survival rates. However, many questions regarding the impact of infection caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens on the mortality of patients with sepsis still need to be clarified. There is a lack of fair studies in the literature. Most studies have had inadequate sample size, inadequate adjustment for predictors of adverse outcomes, and inadequate definition of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Despite the fact that appropriate therapy is essential to treat sepsis, it seems that severity of underlying diseases and comorbidities are more important than resistance, although the studies were not well designed to examine the real impact of resistance on outcome. Finally, new technologies such as microarray that can identify different microorganisms, genes of resistance, and virulence in a few hours might have a great impact on the treatment of sepsis due to antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the future.
