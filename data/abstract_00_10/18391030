Significant increases in the MIC(90)s of linezolid in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were seen between the baseline period of 2001 to 2003 (0.5 microg/ml) and 2004 (2 microg/ml). The MICs were 4 microg/ml in three strains. Both fluoroquinolones (except levofloxacin) and kanamycin were found to have statistically significant degrees of concordance with linezolid.
