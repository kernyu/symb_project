PURPOSE: To compare the safety and efficacy of a new enhanced viscosity ophthalmic formulation of tobramycin, given twice daily (BID), with the existing four times daily (QID) treatment regimen in patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis. METHODS: This was a 12-day, multicenter, observer-masked, randomized, parallel group study. Patients received one drop of tobramycin 0.3% (3 mg/mL) enhanced viscosity ophthalmic solution BID or tobramycin 0.3% (3 mg/mL) ophthalmic solution QID in the affected eyes for 7 days. The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of patients with sustained cure/presumed bacterial eradication based on clinical judgment at the test-of-cure visit (Day 12). Pretherapy bacterial isolates were obtained and tested for susceptibility to tobramycin by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). RESULTS: A total of 276 patients were enrolled in the study and 203 of these were culture positive and attended all follow-up examinations. In this group, 98% of those treated with tobramycin enhanced viscosity ophthalmic solution and 99% of those treated with tobramycin 0.3% ophthalmic solution were categorized as having sustained cure/presumed eradication at the test-of-cure visit (p = 0.6037). Reported adverse events were not serious, mild to moderate in severity, and generally did not prevent continuation in the study. Several pre treatment pathogens demonstrated tobramycin resistance (MIC > 4 mg/mL). However, therapy with both treatments was effective in the majority of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Tobramycin enhanced viscosity ophthalmic solution is well tolerated and has equivalent efficacy to the established treatment regimen with a simplified posology. The formulation provides an alternative therapy for acute bacterial conjunctivitis that should improve patient compliance and satisfaction.
