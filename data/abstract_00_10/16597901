We report an immunocompetent woman with multisystem organ failure following herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) hepatitis. After she initially responded to intravenous acyclovir, she was switched to oral valacyclovir. She developed respiratory failure and opportunistic infections and died. Autopsy confirmed disseminated HSV infection, and lung tissue grew acyclovir-resistant HSV-2.
