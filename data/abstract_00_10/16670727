The diffusion of the outlines of antibiotic sensitivity is a practice that is recommended for improving the prescription of antibiotics and for controlling the appearance and spread of resistances. During the years 2003 and 2004, data was gathered on the sensitivity to antibiotics of the main bacteria isolated in outpatient urine cultures, coprocultures, faringoamygdal and otic smears in the Pamplona health area, which attends to a population of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. Of the 9,495 uropathogens isolated, 90% were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 96.4% to 2nd generation cephalosporins, 95.3% to phosphomycin and 97.7% to nitrofurantoin. One point eight percent (1.8%) of the strains of Escherichia coli isolated in urine were producers of extended spectrum b-lactamases, while 0.5% of the urinary isolations of Klebsiella pneumoniae were producers of this type of b-lactamases. Ninety-six point five percent of the 797 isolations of Salmonella serotipo Enteritidis were sensitive to cotrimoxazol, and 97.5% of the 1,057 isolations of Campylobacter jejuni were sensitive to eritromycine. Of the 319 bacteria isolated in otitis media, 96.5% were sensitive to amoxyline. The Gram negative bacillae producers of otitis externa showed a sensitivity above 90% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and polimixin B. Twenty-nine point seven percent of the isolations of Streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to eritromycine. Fourteen point three percent and 17.4% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolated in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively were resistant to methicillin. Knowledge of the map of antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms in circulation in each geographical area is information that is necessary for the empirical choice of antibiotic treatment.
