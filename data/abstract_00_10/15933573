Our aim was to determine the significance of species identification and penicillin susceptibility of viridans streptococci in children with malignancies. Streptococcus mitis accounted for 58% of invasive viridans streptococcal infections of which 51% were penicillin-nonsusceptible. There was no significant association between species or penicillin susceptibility pattern and clinical presentation or outcome.
