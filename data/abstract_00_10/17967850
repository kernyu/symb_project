OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize decreased susceptibility to tigecycline in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli obtained during Phase 3 clinical trials. METHODS: Gene expression was analysed by transcriptional profile analysis and RT-PCR. Transposon mutagenesis with IS903kan was used for selection of transposon mutants. Transposon insertions were mapped by DNA sequencing and PCR analyses. The MICs were determined by broth microdilution. RESULTS: Both transcriptional profile analysis and Taqman RT-PCR demonstrated increased expression levels of MarA, a transcriptional activator, and AcrAB, an RND-type efflux pump, in the strains with elevated tigecycline MICs. Transposon mutagenesis generated nine mutants, the majority of which had either marA or acrB inactivated. Sequence analysis revealed a single nucleotide insertion in the open reading frame of the marR gene in less-susceptible strains of E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that a loss of MarR functionality due to a frameshift mutation resulted in constitutive overproduction of MarA and AcrAB and, consequently, in decreased susceptibility to tigecycline in clinical isolates of E. coli.
