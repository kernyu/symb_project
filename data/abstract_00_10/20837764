Acinetobacter lwoffii, a species whose natural habitat is the human skin, intrinsically possesses a chromosomal gene encoding a carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D beta-lactamase, OXA-134. This species may therefore constitute a reservoir for carbapenemase genes that may spread among other Acinetobacter species.
