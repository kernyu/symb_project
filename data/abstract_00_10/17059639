In 2003, a national surveillance of demographic, behavioural, clinical and laboratory data on gonorrhoea at genitourinary (GU) medicine clinics in Scotland was undertaken. The data-set represented 77% of all gonorrhoea cases. Findings were compared with data reported from England and Wales. Young women (16-19 years) and young men (20-24. years) represented the greatest proportion of heterosexual infections in Scotland (36 and 30%, respectively) and in England and Wales (37 and 32%, respectively). In Scotland (relative to England and Wales), men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for more of the total gonorrhoea; there were more heterosexuals aged 45+ years; fewer belonged to ethnic minorities; fewer had had gonorrhoea previously; more heterosexual men had a sexual partner abroad; ciprofloxacin resistance was higher. During the year, first-line therapy changed from ciprofloxacin to a third-generation cephalosporin. Extended surveillance for gonorrhoea is vital in guiding appropriately targeted interventions as the epidemiology of gonorrhoea may differ in neighbouring countries.
