A survey of 152 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains from medical centers in Las Cruces, NM, and El Paso, TX, revealed the presence of spa types 2 and 24 (clone USA100) and spa type 1 (clone USA300-0114). Las Cruces MRSA displayed relatively high vancomycin MICs, and one hetero-vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus strain was identified.
