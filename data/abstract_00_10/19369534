Diagnostic, genotypic and antibiotic-resistance determinants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were analysed by molecular methods to verify the failure of ceftriaxone treatment in two cases of pharyngeal gonorrhoea. Monoplex assays were needed to define competitive inhibition of a positive Chlamydia PCR in a duplex assay. Different penA changes were detected in the N. gonorrhoeae isolated from the two cases. These were associated with raised ceftriaxone MICs of 0.03 and 0.016 mg l(-1), which may have contributed to the treatment failures in these cases.
