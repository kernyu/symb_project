UNLABELLED: Failure of Helicobacter pylori treatment is a growing problem in daily practice. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of two new regimes as second-line options in a randomized and prospective study. METHODS: Patients in whom a first eradication regime containing clarithromycin had failed were included. After performing gastroscopy and a 13C-urea breath test (UBT), the patients were randomized to receive a combination of 20 mg of rabeprazole, 500 mg of levofloxacin, and 200 mg (two tablets) of furazolidone administered once daily for 10 days (RLF) or the combination of 20 mg of rabeprazole, 120 mg (two tablets) of bismuth subcitrate, 100 mg of doxycycline, and 200 mg of furazolidone, administered twice daily for 10 days (RBDF). Clinical examinations and new UBT were performed 60 days after therapy. RESULTS: Sixty patients were included (mean age, 46 years, 57% females). Two patients were excluded: one because of adverse effects and another as a result of protocol violation. Compliance was similar in both groups (90% took all medications correctly). Side-effects (96% mild) were observed in 87% of the patients and were comparable between groups, except diarrhea, which was more frequent in group RLF (p= .025). Intention-to-treat cure rates were 77% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62-93%) in the RLF group and 83% (95% CI: 68-97%) in the RBDF group (p= .750). Per-protocol cure rates were 80% (95% CI: 65-95%) in the RLF group and 82% (95% CI: 67-96%) in the RBDF group (p= 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: Both once-daily triple (rabeprazole, levofloxacin, and furazolidone) and twice-daily quadruple therapy (rabeprazole, bismuth subcitrate, doxycycline, and furazolidone) for 10 days achieved encouraging results. Subsequent studies should be performed to evaluate antibiotic resistance, doses, dosing intervals, duration of treatment, and safety of these two regimes.
