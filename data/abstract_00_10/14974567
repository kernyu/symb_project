OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin hydrolysate (bLf-lysate) alone or in combination with other antimicrobials against antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli strains isolated from baby pigs. SAMPLE POPULATION: 3 clinical strains of E coli were isolated from baby pigs with severe diarrhea and designated as strains 9061, 9062, and 9065. PROCEDURE: The broth microdilution checkerboard and fractional inhibitory (or bactericidal) concentration index were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect elicited by bLf-lysate in combination with kanamycin, gentamicin, cephalothin, cefamandole, penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, or rifampicin against the 3 strains of E coli. RESULTS: The 3 strains of E coli were susceptible to gentamicin and rifampicin but highly resistant to most of the other antimicrobials tested, except for strain 9061 that was also susceptible to cephalothin but intermediately inhibited by kanamycin and cefamandole. Synergistic growth-inhibitory activity was observed between bLf-lysate and gentamicin against 1 strain of E coli (strain 9062); synergistic bactericidal activity was found between bLf-lysate and rifampicin against all 3 strains of E coli. Moreover, partial synergy was observed between bLf-lysate and kanamycin, gentamicin, cephalothin, or cefamandole against the strains of E coli, but this partial synergistic activity was mostly seen against only 1 of the strains. Little interaction between bLf-lysate and tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin G, or erythromycin was observed against the clinical strains of E coli. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A combination of bLf-lysate and certain antimicrobials may prove clinically effective against antimicrobial-resistant strains of E coli.
