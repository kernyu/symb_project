SETTING: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) can jeopardise the success of national TB control programmes. Rapid, simple drug susceptibility tests applicable in developing countries would allow earlier treatment of patients with MDR infections. OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility and performance of the resazurin microtitre assay (REMA) as an indirect test for detecting isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Madagascar. DESIGN: Study comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the REMA plate test with the Lowenstein-Jensen proportion method for determining the resistance of M. tuberculosis strains to INH and RMP. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the resazurin test were studied in 77 strains and were respectively 95% and 97.3% for the detection of INH resistance, and 95% and 100% for the detection of RMP resistance. The sensitivity and specificity for the identification of MDR strains were respectively 89% and 100%. CONCLUSION: The resazurin test is sensitive and specific enough for the detection of INH- and RMP-resistant strains. It is also easy to use, rapid and inexpensive, making it suitable for developing countries. Its usefulness for national drug resistance surveys should be assessed.
