Insulin resistance is a fundamental aspect for the etiology of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and has links with a wide array of secondary disorders including weight gain and obesity. The present study analyzes the effect of Cichorium intybus methanolic (CME) extract on glucose transport and adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells by studying the radiolabelled glucose uptake and lipid accumulation assays, respectively. By performing detannification (CME/DT), the role of tannins present in CME on both the activities was evaluated. CME and CME/DT exhibited significant glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a dose-dependent response. Glucose uptake profile in the presence of PI3K and IRTK inhibitors (Wortmannin and Genistein) substantiates the mechanism used by both the extracts. CME inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but failed to show glucose uptake in inhibitor treated cells. The activity exhibited by CME/DT is exactly vice versa to CME. Furthermore, the findings from PTP1B inhibition assay, mRNA and protein expression analysis revealed the unique behavior of CME and CME/DT. The duality exhibited by C. intybus through adipogenesis inhibition and PPARgamma up regulation is of interest. Current observation concludes that the activities possessed by C. intybus are highly desirable for the treatment of NIDDM because it reduces blood glucose levels without inducing adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
