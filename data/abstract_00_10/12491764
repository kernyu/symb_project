Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and humanitarian missions are increasing worldwide. The prevalence of MRSA in the populations served may be unknown. A BRAVA (Blast Resuscitlation and Victim Assistance) mission was conducted at Battambang, Cambodia that included microbiology support. No MRSA was detected in our patients despite the reported increase in MRSA in Asia. Continued investigation is warranted for future missions.
