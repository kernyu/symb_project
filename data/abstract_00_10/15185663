During the last years, there has been an alarming worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens of the respiratory tract, and particularly pneumococcus. This is generally attributed to extensive use of antibiotics prescribed for respiratory tract infection and the selection pressure they exert on bacterial strains of nasopharyngeal flora. In our opinion, five actions have to be coordinated in order to control this phenomenon. To improve the continuing education of practitioners and the diagnosis between viral and bacterial respiratory infections, to restrict the use for the situations where antibiotics are really necessary, to prescribe in these situations at the right dosage and duration the more potent antibiotics, to plan straight-a-way an alternative treatment in case of failures, finally achieve a prompt implementation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
