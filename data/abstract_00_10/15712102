From 2001 to 2003, rates of susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam (86%), ceftazidime (80%), ciprofloxacin (68%), and levofloxacin (67%) did not decrease or decreased by <1.5%, whereas the rate of susceptibility to gentamicin decreased by 3.2% (from 75.5% to 72.3%) and the rate of susceptibility to imipenem decreased by 5.6% (from 84.4% to 78.8%), for 2394 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected in the Tracking Resistance in the United States Today surveillance studies. Rates of multidrug resistance (i.e., resistance to > or =3 antimicrobial agents) increased from 7.2% in 2001 to 9.9% in 2003 and were significantly higher for isolates from the East North Central and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States than for isolates from other regions. Analysis of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) suggested that combining an antipseudomonal beta -lactam with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin would yield a 3.4%-7.1% increase in the percentage of isolates susceptible to the combination, compared with the beta -lactam alone. Ratios of the area under the serum concentration-time curve values for free drug to modal MICs for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were similar and were >125 (target ratio), whereas those ratios for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were significantly lower. Ongoing surveillance of P. aeruginosa is essential.
