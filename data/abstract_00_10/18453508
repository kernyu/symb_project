Beta lactam antibiotics were very effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, resistance to this class of antibiotics has become an increasing problem. Reports of penicillin resistant and multidrug resistant strains are being made in many parts of the world. We examined the drug sensitivity pattern of S. pneumoniae isolates in a retrospective analysis of laboratory records of S. pneumoniae isolates between March 2001 and April 2005 at Gondar University Hospital, Ethiopia. A significant proportion of the isolates were found to be resistant to one or more of the commonly used antibiotics. Furthermore, the isolates appear to be acquiring an increasing resistance to crystalline penicillin, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin. This situation needs immediate attention.
