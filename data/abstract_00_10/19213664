PURPOSE: Concurrent inhibition of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways might improve the efficacy of anticancer agents and abrogate resistance mechanisms. This phase I study evaluated temsirolimus in combination with sunitinib in patients with advanced RCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility included advanced RCC and <or= 2 previous systemic regimens. At the starting dose, temsirolimus 15 mg was administered by intravenous (I.V.) infusion once weekly, and sunitinib 25 mg was administered orally once daily for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. RESULTS: In the first cohort, dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 treatment-related toxicities that lasted >or= 7 days) were observed in 2 of 3 patients. One patient experienced grade 3 rash during week 3, which led to treatment discontinuation. A second patient had grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 48,000/microL), cellulitis, and gout during week 3 and was hospitalized; platelets recovered to 109,000/microL 4 days after discontinuation of protocol therapy. A third patient experienced rash, asthenia, diarrhea, stomatitis, constipation, fever, and rectal hemorrhage, all of which were mild in severity. The study was terminated because of dose-limiting toxicity observed at low starting doses of both agents. CONCLUSION: Concomitant use of I.V. temsirolimus 15 mg weekly and oral sunitinib 25 mg daily (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off) is not recommended.
