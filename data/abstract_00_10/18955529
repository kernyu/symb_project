Among 165 Spanish Haemophilus influenzae isolates with mutations in the ftsI gene (ftsI(+)) (2005 to 2007), 73% were beta-lactamase negative and 26.7% were positive. The proportion of beta-lactamase-negative isolates to beta-lactamase-positive isolates was 2:1 to 4:1 in general, versus 1:3 in pediatric hospitals. Among 44 beta-lactamase-positive strains, 8 strains produced ROB-1 (5 from the pediatric hospital). beta-Lactamase-positive ftsI(+) strains were phylogenetically closer than were beta-lactamase-negative strains.
