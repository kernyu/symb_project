Screening of MRSA carriers can be performed at the time of admission to a hospital/a ward or during an outbreak. In this second situation not only patients but also medical staff are examined. Because the anterior nares are a major reservoir of MRSA, the nasal swab is the most important screening sample. Specimens are plated directly on selective media containing fixed concentrations of oxacillin or other antimicrobial agents.
