OBJECTIVES: To assess correlates of asymptomatic gonorrhea among patients attending Genitourinary Medicine Clinics participating in the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRASP) in England for 2001-2003. STUDY DESIGN: GRASP is a sentinel surveillance program that monitors antimicrobial resistance to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Data collection occurs annually in June to August each year. RESULTS: Women with previously diagnosed gonorrhea had decreased odds of asymptomatic gonococcal infection, as did women diagnosed with other sexually transmitted infections (all except chlamydia, syphilis, herpes, and warts). Heterosexual men, but not women, coinfected with chlamydia had significantly higher likelihood of being diagnosed with asymptomatic gonorrhea, as did homosexual men coinfected with syphilis and warts. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity in correlates of asymptomatic gonorrhea has implications for screening in clinical settings. Such findings also depend on the extent of testing on sexually transmitted infections from different sites of infection, which has particular relevance in homosexual men and would thus need to be investigated in other studies.
