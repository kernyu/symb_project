The development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria has been attributed to the overuse of antimicrobials in human medicine. Another route by which humans are exposed to antibiotics is through the animal foods we eat. In modern agricultural practice, veterinary drugs are being used on a large scale, administered for treating infection or prophylactically to prevent infection. Hence, there is pressure on analytical scientists to detect and confirm the presence of antimicrobials in foods of animal origin. The aminoglycosides and macrolides are two families of antibiotics, each with important applications in veterinary medicine. These antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of bacterial disease, e.g., aminoglycosides for mastitis and macrolides for enteric infections. They have also been used as feed additives for growth promotion. As a result, legislation has been laid down by the European commission in which member states must meet strict criteria for monitoring residues (including antimicrobials). Testing for low levels of aminoglycosides and macrolides in foods is a priority and hence the development of fast, reliable, sensitive methods for their extraction and subsequent analysis is of great interest. This paper reviews analytical methods for both extracting and determining these classes of antibiotics in various food matrices focusing in particular on the last 10 years. Extraction and clean-up methods such as deproteinisation, and solid-phase extraction are described. Various screening methods are also covered including thin layer chromatography (TLC), enzyme immunoassay, capillary electrophoresis (CE) and microbiological assays. Finally, liquid chromatography (LC) methods are discussed which are combined with mass spectrometry (MS) when sensitivity requirements are stringent.
