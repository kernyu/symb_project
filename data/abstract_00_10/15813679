Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed on 197 yeast isolates from the BCCM/IHEM biomedical fungi and yeasts collection (Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-organisms / IPH-Mycology) to study the in vitro activity of voriconazole against fluconazole, itraconazole and amphotericin B. MICs of the four antifungal agents were determined by an adapted NCCLS M27-A microdilution reference method. MIC readings were visually and spectrophotometrically determined. Optical density data were used for calculation of the MIC endpoints. For amphotericin B, the MIC endpoint was defined as the minimal antifungal concentration that exerts 90% inhibition, compared to the control growth. The azoles endpoints were determined at 50% inhibition of growth. The MIC distribution of voriconazole susceptibilities showed that 193 isolates had a MIC < or = 2 microg/ml and 185 a MIC < or = 1 microg/ml. Cross-tabulation of voriconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole MICs indicated that voriconazole MICs raised with fluconazole and itraconazole MICs. The in vitro data obtained in this study suggest that voriconazole may also be effective treating yeast infection in patients infected with fluconazole or itraconazole resistant isolates.
