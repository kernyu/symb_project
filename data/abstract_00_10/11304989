The resistance of beta-lactam antibiotics in penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) is due to alterations in penicillin-binding proteins(PBPs). Recently, highly beta-lactam-resistant strains(MIC: > or = 4 micrograms/ml for penicillin, > or = 8 micrograms/ml for ampicillin, and > or = 4 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime) have been isolated. High resistance of these strains is caused by further alterations in pbp2x and pbp2b genes adjacent to conserved amino acid motifs, in addition to that detected in common PRSP. The resistant mechanisms of macrolides in S. pneumoniae is recognized as production of a 23s rRNA methylase encoded by ermB and efflux system mediated by mefA gene. We detected these genes by PCR in clinical isolates, and showed the relationship between the presence of each gene and the susceptibilities of 14-, 15-, 16-membered macrolides.
