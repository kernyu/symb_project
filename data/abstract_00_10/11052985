With conventional intracellular recording methods, we investigated the mechanism of actions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase (HX/XO) reactions on AH/type 2 myenteric neurons in the guinea pig distal colon. Of the 54 neurons to which HX/XO was applied, 32 neurons showed a transient membrane hyperpolarization(s) followed by a long-lasting membrane depolarization. Two additional groups of 10 myenteric neurons exhibited only a membrane hyperpolarization(s) or a late-onset membrane depolarization, respectively, and the remaining two neurons did not show any response to HX/XO. Analysis of changes of the input resistance induced by HX/XO indicated that suppression and augmentation of the conductance of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels are the ionic mechanisms underlying the membrane hyperpolarization and depolarization, respectively. The effects of HX/XO on myenteric neurons were mimicked by application of caffeine or H(2)O(2). The results suggest that OH(.), but neither H(2)O(2) nor O(2)(.-), is responsible for HX/XO-induced responses. The intracellular Ca(2+) store may be the acting site of ROS in colonic AH/type 2 neurons.
