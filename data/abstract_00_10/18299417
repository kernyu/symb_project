Resistance profiles were compared among 18 extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) and 27 acquired AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolates collected from Canadian intensive care units from 2005 to 2006. ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were more likely to be gentamicin resistant (P < 0.03), fluoroquinolone resistant (P < 0.0001), and multidrug resistant (P < 0.0001) than AmpC-producing E. coli isolates.
