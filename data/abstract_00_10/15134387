Routine hospital screening of the resistance of Streptococcus pyogenes to macrolides is usually done using the erythromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin disk diffusion technique. When a strain is found to be resistant to one of these macrolides, it is generally assumed to be resistant to the whole class. However this approach gives only partial qualitative information because S. pyogenes strains with inducible and M phenotype resistance are still susceptible to 16-membered ring macrolides such as rokitamycin. Seventy-four erythromycin-resistant (22 inducible and 52 M phenotype) strains of S. pyogenes were tested for their susceptibility to rokitamycin and clindamycin (control) by means of the agar disk diffusion test and the results were compared with those obtained using the Epsilometer test, a quantitative technique for measuring bacterial susceptibility and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Epsilometer testing of erythromycin in comparison with rokitamycin is useful for measuring the real degree of susceptibility of macrolide-resistant strains quickly and simply. This is important because strains with the same disk diffusion diameter do not necessarily have the same MIC, but a scattered distribution of susceptibility.
