When seven elderly patients with fever due to bacterial infection failed to respond to ofloxacin 300 mg/day for 3 days, we prescribed Mao-bushi-saishin-to for 7 days. Bushi, one of the components of Mao-bushi-saishin-to, is a complex of various alkaloids, which is known to stimulate the conducting system of the heart, so half of the standard dose was prescribed for these patients. We assessed changes in the patients' body temperatures and serum C-reactive protein concentrations. As a result, the patients' body temperatures all fell to under 37 degrees C and C-reactive protein levels decreased from an average of 3.06 mg/dl to an average of 0.36 mg/dl (P< 0.02). In cases where a fever does not decrease through dosage of an antibiotic such as ofloxacin after about 3 days, half of the standard dose of Mao-bushi-saishin-to for 7 days should be considered as a complementary therapy.
