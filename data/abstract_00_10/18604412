In the present study were evaluated the DNA macrorestriction profile and SCCmec types for nine multi-resistant MRSA selected. Also antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion method was evaluated for 68 MRSA isolates against 12 antimicrobial agents. The isolates were recovered from blood culture collected from hospitalized patients in three hospitals of Porto Alegre, Brazil. PFGE and PCR for mecA and SCCmec I, II, III, IV types genes were done on selected nine isolates with susceptibility only to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. Two clone profiles, with five subtypes, were demonstrated among multi-resistant MRSA analyzed. Eight isolates showed harbor SCCmec type III and one isolate was not typeable. The knowledge of SCCmec type, clone and antimicrobial profiles among S. aureus is essential mainly to prevention and control of dissemination of the antimicrobial resistance.
