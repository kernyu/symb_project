Variable genetic elements including plasmids, transposons and prophages are involved in pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance, and are an important component of the staphylococcal genome. This review covers a set of newly described variable chromosomal elements, pathogenicity and resistance islands, carrying superantigen and resistance genes, especially toxic shock and methicillin resistance, respectively.
