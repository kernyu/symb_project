In 2002, 495 indole-positive proteae strains were isolated from patients at 60 hospitals in Japan. Nine indole-positive proteae strains had reduced susceptibility to imipenem (MIC > or = 8 microg ml(-1)) and were identified as Providencia rettgeri by BD Phoenix. Eight of the nine Prov. rettgeri isolates were confirmed as metallo-beta-lactamase producers by the double-disc synergy test. All the metallo-beta-lactamases were classified as IMP-1 by PCR and DNA sequence analysis. These bla(IMP-1) genes were encoded in the integron structure on conjugative plasmids. These plasmids could transfer from Prov. rettgeri clinical isolates to Escherichia coli ML4903 at a frequency between 1.5 x 10(-5) and 5.5 x 10(-7). The eight bla(IMP)-positive strains were isolated from two hospitals, and showed two different PFGE patterns, two different integron structures and two different incompatibility groups, which corresponded to the two hospitals. These results strongly suggest the possibility of nosocomial infections by bla(IMP-1)-producing Prov. rettgeri isolates.
