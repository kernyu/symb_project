From 2002 to 2006, 35 of 73 multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from different wards at Charles Nicolle hospital of Tunis were positive for class B carbapenemase (using the imipenem-EDTA test), owing to a bla(VIM-2) gene cassette in a class 1 integron. Twenty-three isolates additionally produced the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase SHV2a. DNA sequences immediately surrounding bla(SHV2a) shared extensive identity with a Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid sequence. Despite belonging to the same chromosomal type, as shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), the VIM-2 producing P. aeruginosa isolates prevalent at Charles Nicolle hospital displayed a diversity of VIM-2-carrying integrons.
