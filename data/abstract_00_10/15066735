Although there is extensive literature on the control of MRSA, when that concerning epidemics is excluded, only a limited amount remains regarding the control of endemic MRSA. Several guidelines have been recently published recommending stringent control measures, which are often suggested based on their success in controlling MRSA outbreaks in hospitals with few MRSA or in containing MRSA cases introduced into a hospital with no MRSA. In these settings, multiple measures are usually introduced with apparently successful results. However, results may not be generalizable to other settings and we do not know the minimum effective measures required for MRSA containment. This paper aims critically to review the literature to determine whether evidence exists for the value of the infection control measures that are widely recommended in the endemic setting. Much of this literature is based on observational studies, with few randomized, controlled trials having been conducted. More well-designed studies are required before many of the principles on which we build infection control programmes can be regarded as evidence based.
