Lectins from cell walls of wheat seedlings in normal conditions and infected by Fusarium sp. and treated by salicylic acid were isolated by the methods of gel-filtration, affinity chromatography and isoelectric focusing, their biochemical properties were studied. It is shown that isolated preparations of lectins suppressed the development of colonies of fungus Fusarium graminearum. A conclusion was made on the possibility of employment of isolated lectins in the molecular-breeding programs on raising wheat resistance towards fusariosis.
