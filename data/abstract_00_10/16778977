OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between gene mutation of GTP cyclohydrolase I function region in lanosterine 14 alpha-demethylase (14-DM) DNA sequence and drug resistance of Candida albicans. METHODS: One standard strain and 2 isolate strains of Candida albicans were induced artificially by fluconazole plus albendazole. The gene fragments of the 3 strains and another 2 clinical isolates which were resistant to fluconazol were detected by PCR, and then cloned onto pMD-18T vectors to sequence and analyze the change of gene sequence after the induction. RESULTS: The sequences underwent substantial gene mutations after induction. Some of the mutations resulted in alteration of amino acids. The sequence change and subsequent alteration of amino acids in the tested strains coincided with those in the clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: Gene mutation and alteration of amino acid of 14-DM GTP domain are related to azole-resistance in Candida albicans.
