Five children received nevirapine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used as part of a triple-drug regimen to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection. They all developed resistance mutations to the agent within 4-10 months. They differed in compliance with drug therapy and development of specific mutations. Whether these mutations predict clinical resistance has yet to be determined.
