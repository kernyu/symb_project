In order to identify the true nature of community-acquired urinary tract infections, the uropathogens isolated from 100 patients with urinary tract infection included in a prospective study conducted in community clinics were compared to 244 isolates from outpatient urine specimens routinely submitted to the laboratory. Significant differences in both the spectrum of bacteria and their antibiograms were found between the two groups. Laboratory data analysis of uropathogens from outpatient urine specimens may not reflect the true bacteriology of urinary tract infections acquired in the community. Hence, surveys based on laboratory data alone may overestimate resistance rates, leading to misinformed choices being made when treatment is empirical.
