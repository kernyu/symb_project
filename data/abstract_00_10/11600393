The in vivo activity of telithromycin against erythromycin A- and penicillin G-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae was superior to that of azithromycin, clarithromycin, cefdinir, and levofloxacin. In respiratory tract infections caused by erythromycin A-susceptible S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae in mice, telithromycin was more effective than clarithromycin and comparable to azithromycin.
