Phenotypes and genetic relatedness of invasive Haemophilus influenzae strains were evaluated from 1989 through 2001. Among 119 isolates, multidrug resistance decreased (from 50 to 0%), the level of H. influenzae serotype b (Hib) strains declined (from 81 to 16%), the level of noncapsulated strains rose (from 19 to 80%), and the first invasive H. influenzae serotype f strain was described. This study documents changes in invasive H. influenzae infections in Portugal, i.e., the emergence of non-type-b strains that are genetically diverse and unrelated to Hib.
