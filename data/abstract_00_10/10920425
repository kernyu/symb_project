The classical presentation of neurotuberculosis is meningitis. Intracranial tuberculomas are a rare manifestation of neurotuberculosis and are due to hematogenous dissemination of distant focuses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Around 1% of patients with central nervous system tuberculosis develop intracranial tuberculomas some weeks or months after the beginning of the specific treatment with tuberculostatic chemotherapy. The involution of the lesions is slow and does not mean drug resistance nor lack of adequate treatment. We describe the case, diagnosed and treated at the 25th Infirmary of Santa Casa da Misericordia do Rio de Janeiro, of an immunocompetent male patient who developed meningitis and multiple intracranial tuberculomas during the specific treatment of miliary tuberculosis. The literature is revised and the diagnosis, treatment and possible immunological mechanisms are discussed.
