Although the number of available antiviral drugs for hepatitis B infection (VHB) today is higher than ever, treatment of chronic VHB infection is still often managed by specialists because of the complex natural history of this viral infection and of the risk of selecting viral strains that are resistant to therapy. Different clinical and virological aspects need to be considered to establish a correct indication for therapy. Once antiviral therapy has been started, patients need close monitoring to guarantee adequate compliance and to detect promptly the selection of viral variants resisting to therapy.
