Forty-seven fusidic acid- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from clinical samples in four hospitals in Kuwait were studied for their relatedness by biotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and for the genetic location of their resistance determinants. Forty-four isolates were resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin and neomycin. Forty-one isolates were resistant to erythromycin and trimethoprim, 10 were resistant to chloramphenicol and four were resistant to ciprofloxacin. They contained two or three plasmids of c. 28, 2.8 and 1.8 kb. Genetic studies demonstrated that resistance to cadmium, propamidine isethionate and ethidium bromide were linked and were carried on the c. 28-kb plasmid. Chloramphenicol resistance was encoded by the 2.8-kb plasmid in resistant isolates. No resistance was associated with the 1.8-kb plasmid and this was considered to be a cryptic plasmid. Resistance to fusidic acid, methicillin, benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin were located on the chromosome. All the isolates produced urease, but varied in the production of haemolysins, pigments, lipase and lecithinase and were classified into nine biotypes. In contrast, PFGE divided the isolates into two major patterns with one PFGE type constituting the majority of isolates in all four hospitals. The presence of the dominant PFGE pattern in all four hospitals suggests that it is an epidemic MRSA clone with the capacity to spread. Infection control measures should be directed towards restricting the further spread of this clone.
