TAN 1057-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli strains were selected to elucidate the mechanism of resistance and the mode of action of this dipeptide antibiotic. Cell-free translation with isolated ribosomes and S150 fractions from sensitive and resistant S. aureus strains demonstrated that alterations in the ribosomes contribute to the resistance of the bacteria.
