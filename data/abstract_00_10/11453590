Two Enterococcus gallinarum isolates distinguished by different colony sizes were recovered from the same blood culture from a woman with acute myeloid leukemia. They were designated E31 (the one with larger colonies) and E32 (the one with smaller colonies). Both isolates were glycopeptide resistant, but the MICs of vancomycin and teicoplanin for E31 (32 and 2 microg/ml, respectively, consistent with the VanC phenotype) and E32 (128 and 16 microg/ml, respectively, consistent with the VanA phenotype) were different. E31 and E32 had the same plasmid profile and showed identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns after digestion of total DNA with NotI and a two-band variation after digestion with SmaI. Polymerase chain reaction experiments showed that both isolates had both the vanC-1 and vanA genes and carried a Tn1546-related transposon lacking orf1, vanY, and vanZ. The absence of these three genes was confirmed by Southern analysis with appropriate probes. Southern hybridization experiments using a vanA probe showed that this atypical Tn1546-related element appeared to be located on the chromosome. In both E31 and E32, the vanA probe hybridized to EcoRV and HindIII fragments larger in size than the hybridizing fragments observed in the VanA prototype strain Enterococcus faecium BM4147, suggesting the lack of the relevant EcoRV and HindIII restriction sites.
