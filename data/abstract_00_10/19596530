Fluoroquinolones are used to treat infections caused by Escherichia coli in canine and feline veterinary patients, particularly those infecting the urinary tract. The gyrA gene is a primary target causing fluoroquinolone resistance in gram negative coliforms, with mutations in codons 83 and 87 generally associated with high-level of resistance E. coli clinical isolates. We have developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) quantitative PCR to identify enrofloxacin-resistance in clinical E. coli isolates that carry mutations in codons 83 and 87 of gyrA. This real-time quantitative PCR assay is rapid, economical, and sensitive compared with cultured antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The assay identified as few as four genome copies per reaction from culture and 19 genome copies in urine. For the 70 isolates tested, the sensitivity was 87.5% (95% CI=75-95.3%) (n=42/48), specificity was 100% (95% CI=87.3-100%) (n=22/22), whereas accuracy was 91.4% (95% CI=82.3-97%) (n=64/70). Furthermore, we were able to accurately differentiate between the wild type and mutants E. coli directly from infected canine urine samples (n=5) within 2 h. These results were confirmed by sequence alignments of the PCR products and comparison with the susceptibility testing. The FRET-PCR assay appears to have promising clinical application as an early diagnostic tool for rapid and sensitive detection and differentiation of the level of fluoroquinolone resistance among clinical E. coli isolates that may facilitate design of the dosing regimen.
