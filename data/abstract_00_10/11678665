A new polyacetylene carboxylic acid, 13(E),17-octadecadiene-9,11-diynoic acid (13,14-dihydrooropheic acid, 1), and the known 17-octadecene-9,11,13-triynoic acid (oropheic acid, 2) were isolated from the stem bark of Mitrephora celebica through bioassay-guided fractionation. Both compounds demonstrated significant activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis.
