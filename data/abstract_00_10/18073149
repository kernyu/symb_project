We evaluated the in vitro activity of voriconazole, amphotericin B, and itraconazole against 192 clinical mould isolates recovered in twenty Italian microbiology laboratories. The vast majority of isolates belonged to the genus Aspergillus (94.2%) with A. fumigatus (58.3%) being the most frequently isolated species. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using the broth microdilution method defined by the CLSI M38-A standard, and results were compared to those obtained with Sensititre panels. Aspergillus flavus ATCC 204304 was employed as reference strain and results were within all expected ranges. Voriconazole's activity against the 192 mould isolates was comparable to that of amphotericin B and itraconazole: voriconazole MIC90 (CLSI 1 microg/ml, Sensititre 1 microg/ml), itraconazole MIC90 (CLSI 0.5 microg/ml, Sensititre 0.5 microg/ml), amphotericin B MIC90 (CLSI 1 microg/ml, Sensititre 1 microg/ml). In conclusion, these in vitro data highlight voriconazole's broad spectrum activity against filamentous fungi and support its use as a first line agent for the treatment of fungal diseases.
