A total of 328 cloacal swabs and 163 footpads of wild birds were investigated for the presence of salmonellae. All 19 isolates from cloacal swabs were serotyped as Salmonella Typhimurium susceptible to all five conventional antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, oxytetracycline and nalidixic acid) tested. In contrast, 15 salmonellae isolated from footpads included S. Muenhen, S. Virchow, S. Bareily and S. Bovismorbificans, including S. Typhimurium; these non-Salmonella Typhimurium isolates showed multiple drug resistance.
