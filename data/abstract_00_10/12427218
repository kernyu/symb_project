OBJECTIVE: To investigate the underlying resistance mechanisms in 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. METHODS: Ten K. pneumoniae strains according to distinct bacteriocin typing and REP-PCR, were examined for their plasmid content, their ability to transfer their resistance to aminoglycosides and third-generation cephalosporins, and their production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and beta-lactamases. RESULTS: Transfer of resistance to the above-mentioned antibiotics as well as to co-trimoxazole and tetracycline in Escherichia coli strain RC 85 at a frequency of 5-106 was achieved for all strains by conjugation. Similar strains harbor a self-transferable multiresistant plasmid (80 kb) with similar EcoRI and HindIII restriction patterns. This plasmid encodes an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase which confers high-level resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam. It produces SHV-5 beta-lactamase, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing and DNA sequencing. Aminoglycoside resistance was co-transferred, and AAC(6')-I, mediating resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin, and AAC(3)-I, mediating resistance to gentamicin and sisomycin, were encoded in all isolates and their transconjugants, while APH(3')-I, mediating resistance to kanamycin and neomycin, was encoded in seven strains. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that a multiresistant transferable plasmid encoding the SHV-5 beta-lactamase, causing unusually high resistance to ceftazidime and aztreonam, and the combination AAC(6')-I + AAC(3)-I of acetylating enzymes causing, also resistance to all clinically available aminoglycosides, is established in K. pneumoniae in Greece.
