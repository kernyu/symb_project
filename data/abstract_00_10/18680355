Bacterial Outer membrane (OM) proteins involved in antibiotic resistance have been reported. However, little is known about the OM proteins and their interaction network regulating streptomycin (SM) resistance. In the present study, a subproteomic approach was utilized to characterize OM proteins of Escherichia coli with SM resistance. TolC, OmpT and LamB were found to be up-regulated, and FadL, OmpW and a location-unknown protein Dps were down-regulated in the SM-resistant E. coli strain. These changes at the level of protein expression were validated using Western blotting. The possible roles of the altered proteins involved in the SM resistance were investigated using genetic modified strains with the deletion of these altered genes. It is found that decreased and elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations and survival capabilities of the gene deleted strains and their resistant strains, Delta tolC, Delta ompT, Delta dps, Delta tolC-R, Delta ompT-R, Delta dps-R and Delta fadL-R, were correlated with the changes of TolC, OmpT, Dps and FadL at the protein expression levels detected by 2-DE gels, respectively. The results may suggest that these proteins are the key OM proteins and play important roles in the regulation of SM resistance in E. coli. Furthermore, an interaction network of altered OM proteins involved in the SM resistance was proposed in this report. Of the six altered proteins, TolC may play a central role in the network. These findings may provide novel insights into mechanisms of SM resistance in E. coli.
