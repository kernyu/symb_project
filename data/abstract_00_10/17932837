Studies have produced conflicting findings on outcomes for patients with antimicrobial-resistant infection. This study evaluated whether infection with an antimicrobial-resistant organism affects outcome in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury treated with renal replacement therapy and whose clinical course is complicated with a nosocomial bloodstream infection. We found that infection with an antimicrobial-resistant organism did not adversely affect clinical outcome in this specific cohort, which already has a high mortality rate.
