Using human acute leukemia HL-60/Bcr-Abl (with ectopic expression of p185 Bcr-Abl) and K562 cells (with endogenous expression of p210 Bcr-Abl) subjected to a continuous selection pressure of up to 1.0 micro M Gleevec (imatinib mesylate, STI-571), we have isolated Gleevec-resistant K562 R (+Bcr-Abl), K562 R (-Bcr-Abl), and HL-60/Bcr-Abl R cells, which display disparate level and activity of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK). As compared with their sensitive counterparts, Gleevec-resistant cell types were >/=5-fold resistant to Gleevec-induced apoptosis. Bcr-Abl protein levels were significantly increased in HL-60/Bcr-Abl R and K562 R (+Bcr-Abl) cells, but K562 R (-Bcr-Abl) cells showed a marked decline in the mRNA and protein levels and activity of Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl TK level and activity corresponded to the signal transducers and activators of transcription-5 DNA binding activity and up-regulation of heat shock protein 70 levels. The decline in Bcr-Abl expression and TK activity in K562 R (-Bcr-Abl) cells was associated with reduced AKT kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription-5 DNA binding activities and increased sensitivity to the death ligand Apo-2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-induced apoptosis. All Gleevec-resistant cell types were sensitive to 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)- and PD180970 (a SRC and Bcr-Abl TK inhibitor)-induced apoptosis. Treatment with 17-AAG or PD180970 also induced apoptosis of CD34+ leukemic cells from three patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis who had progressive leukemia while receiving Gleevec therapy. Taken together, these findings indicate that in addition to overexpression or mutations in Bcr-Abl, resistance to Gleevec may also develop due to a loss of Bcr-Abl expression. These findings also support the rationale to test the in vivo efficacy of 17-AAG and PD180970 against STI-571-resistant Bcr-Abl-positive acute leukemias.
