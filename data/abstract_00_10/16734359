The results of the laboratory diagnoses of respiratory tract secondary infections in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis within a period of 12 months in a tuberculosis clinic were generalized. The species composition of the causative agents of lower respiratory tract secondary infection and the frequency of their detection in various clinical speciments (sputum, bronchial washings) were determined. The data on resistance of the opportunistic gramnegative bacilli (enterobacteria, pseudomonads, Acinetobacter spp.) isolated from the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis to various groups of antibacterials are presented.
