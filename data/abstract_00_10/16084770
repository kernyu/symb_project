In response to the emergence of parasite drug resistance to currently deployed antimalarials, the scientific community, in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry and public organizations, has fashioned an antimalarial drug development portfolio for the sustained development and registration of safe, effective and cheap antimalarial medicines. The management of this portfolio is being driven by MMV (Medicines for Malaria Venture), with a number of projects recently reaching the clinical end of this drug development pipeline.
