AIM: To study the prevalence and molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance in UPEC. METHODS AND RESULTS: PCR was used to detect the presence of the Class I integron variable region (VR). The VR amplicons were then characterized by partial sequencing and restriction digestion with AluI. VR negative isolates showed more antibiotic susceptibility than VR positive isolates. 30% of the isolates were positive for the VR and carried the genes dfrA7, dfrA17-aadA5, dfrA1-aadA1, dfrA12-orf5-aadA2 and bla(OXA-30)-aadA1. Five restriction patterns were detected and isolates with the same VR amplicon size had the same restriction pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that Class I integrons are widely disseminated in Lebanon and showed their importance for the occurrence and transmission of multidrug resistance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These findings will facilitate greater understanding of the factors that contribute to the presence and transfer of integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes in UPEC.
