LEARNING OBJECTIVES: : After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Identify risk factors associated with community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. Recognize the clinical presentation of patients with community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 3. Understand the treatment and indications for decolonization of patients who have community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections. SUMMARY: : Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has evolved over the past 10 years as a new health threat seen by plastic surgeons and is an increasing cause of soft-tissue infections. This pathogen has several distinct virulence factors and unique antimicrobial susceptibilities that distinguish methicillin-resistant S. aureus from traditional hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus. This article reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, and treatment of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
