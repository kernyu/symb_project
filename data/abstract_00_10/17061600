BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori isolates from 84 adults and 51 children were assessed during the period of 2001 through 2004 to find out whether their susceptibilities to metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, and furazolidone differ between the two groups or have changed compared with the results from our previous study done between 1997 - 2000. METHODS: Biopsies from 135 dyspeptic patients were cultured on Brucella blood agar. Pure cultures of H. pylori isolates were used for antibiotic susceptibility tests. Disk diffusion method was recruited to assess the susceptibility of H. pylori isolates to different dilutions of the above mentioned antimicrobials. Results obtained from the two groups were compared and minimum inhibitory concentrations determined. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of H. pylori isolates from adults and 37% from children were resistant to metronidazole. Clarithromycin resistance rate was 2.4% and 5.9% in H. pylori isolates from adults and children, respectively. Amoxicillin resistance was 2.4% in isolates from adults and 5.9% in isolates from children. Tetracycline resistance rate was 0% in H. pylori isolates from adults and 2.0% in isolates from children. Resistance to furazolidone was not observed. CONCLUSION: Resistance rates of H. pylori isolates from adults and children to metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, and furazolidone are similar and not significantly affected by age and time.
