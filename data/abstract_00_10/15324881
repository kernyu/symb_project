A series of aryloxy/thioaryloxy oxazolidinone derivatives has been synthesized and tested for in vitro antibacterial activity by MIC determination against a panel of susceptible and resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms, some of which are resistant to methicillin and vancomycin. Compounds 12a, 12b, 14a, and 14b from this series were found to be equipotent or more potent than linezolid in vitro.
