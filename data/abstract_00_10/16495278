In vitro interaction of fluconazole and berberine chloride was investigated against 40 fluconazole-resistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans. Synergism in fungistatic activity was found with the checkerboard microdilution assay. The findings of agar diffusion tests and time-kill curves confirmed the synergistic interaction, but no antagonistic action was observed.
