Bacterial meningitis remains a major cause of morbidity, mortality and neurodisability in childhood, particularly in the developing world where effective vaccines against the usual pathogens responsible for the disease are not in routine use. To describe the patterns and outcome of bacterial meningitis among children admitted into the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Nigeria. All children who satisfied the case definition for meningitis, admitted into the paediatric wards of the University College Hospital, UCH, Ibadan over a period of 30 months were prospectively enrolled and blood and CSF samples were taken for bacteriological analyses. A total of 97 children, 62 males and 35 females were studied. Their ages ranged between 2 months and 12 years, mean age 33.0 (SD=41.7) months, with 80.4% of the cases below the age of 5 years. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the leading pathogen, found in 16 (55.1%) of the 29 cases of definite meningitis. Other isolates include Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.1%), Klebsiella spp (7.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.0%), Escherichia coli (3.4%) and Pseudomonas spp. (3.4%). Hib and pneumococcus showed varying degrees of resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and cotrimoxazole. Twenty six (26.8%) of the cases died and 67.6% of the survivors developed significant neurological sequele. Bacterial meningitis remains a major cause of childhood mortality and neurodisability. Hib and pneumococcus remain the major pathogens responsible for this dreadful disease in Ibadan, Nigeria. The increasing emergence of antibiotic resistance calls for institution of adequate control measures, particularly routine childhood immunisation against the disease.
