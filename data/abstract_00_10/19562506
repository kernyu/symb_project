Primary cutaneous mucormycosis is an uncommon disease and occurs mainly in patients with immunocompromised disorders. We report a case of cutaneous mucormycosis in an immunocompetent man in whom no definite precipitating factors were noted. The isolate was identified as Rhizomucor variabilis according to the fungus morphology and DNA sequencing results. The lesion was successfully treated with oral Itraconazole, although the in vitro drug-susceptibility test showed resistance.
