Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant public health problem in the United States, with 1.25 million people infected with the virus. The long-term risks of chronic HBV infection include cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which occur in 15% to 30% of those infected at birth or early in life and may lead to liver transplantation or death. During the past few years, the development and increased availability of oral antiviral agents have made treatment simpler, safer, and more tolerable for these patients. This article focuses on 3 of these drugs--lamivudine, adefovir, and entecavir--and their use in patients with chronic HBV infection and advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.
