Various mutants of Pichia anomala were isolated by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treatment and UV irradiation through cycloheximide resistance and KCl sensitivity. The selected mutant HA-2 accumulated a higher content of RNA and grew faster than the wild-type strain in yeast extract-malt (YM) broth. Autolysis of the HA-2 mutant at 60 degrees C and pH 7.0 for 6 h was the best condition to obtain maximum yields of 5'-ribonucleotides, inosinic monophosphate (IMP) (6.2 mg/g biomass) and guanylic monophosphate (GMP) (35.5 mg/g biomass). The yield of adenylic monophosphate (AMP) (7.8 mg/g biomass) was optimal at 60 degrees C at pH 6.5 for 6 h. The inhibitory activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme and the nitrite-scavenging activity for autolysates of the HA-2 mutant were about 13.0% and 47.0% higher than those of native strain, respectively.
