Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, susceptibility to 26 antimicrobial agents used in veterinary and human medicine, and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes of Escherichia coli isolated from cows with mastitis were evaluated. Among 135 E. coli isolates, PFGE analysis revealed 85 different genetic patterns. All E. coli were resistant to two or more antimicrobials in different combinations. Most E. coli were resistant to antimicrobials used in veterinary medicine including ampicillin (98.4%, >or=32 microg/ml) and many E. coli were resistant to streptomycin (40.3%, >or=64 microg/ml), sulfisoxazole (34.1%, >or=512 microg/ml), and tetracycline (24.8%, >or=16 microg/ml). Most E. coli were resistant to antimicrobials used in human medicine including aztreonam (97.7%, >or=32 microg/ml) and cefaclor (89.9%, >or=32 microg/ml). Some E. coli were resistant to nitrofurantoin (38%, >or=128 microg/ml), cefuroxime (22.5%, >or=32 microg/ml), fosfomycin (17.8%, >or=256 microg/ml). All E. coli were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and cinoxacin. Almost 97% (123 of 127) of ampicillin-resistant isolates carried ampC. Eleven of 52 (21.2%) streptomycin-resistant isolates carried strA, strB and aadA together and 29 streptomycin-resistant isolates (55.8%) carried aadA alone. Among 44 sulfisoxazole-resistant E. coli, 1 isolate (2.3%) carried both sulI and sulII, 12 (27.3%) carried sulI and 10 (22.7%) isolates carried sulII. Among 32 tetracycline-resistant isolates, 14 (43.8%) carried both tetA and tetC and 14 (43.8%) carried tetC. Results of this study demonstrated that E. coli from cows with mastitis were genotypically different, multidrug resistant and carried multiple resistance genes. These bacteria can be a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes and can play a role in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes to other pathogenic and commensal bacteria in the dairy farm environment.
