Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was examined for 325 isolates of Salmonella enterica serotypes Cerro, Infantis, Livingstone, and Montevideo isolated from layer houses on a commercial egg-production farm in the western region of Japan between 1997 and 2002. No antimicrobials were used for therapeutic purposes on the farm during this period. From 1.8 to 3.1% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. Resistance to streptomycin and sulfisoxazole was found in 52.9 and 65.5%, respectively, of Salmonella Montevideo isolates and in 0 to 13.2% of the isolates of the other serotypes. All the streptomycin-resistant isolates of Salmonella Montevideo also exhibited resistance to sulfisoxazole. Salmonella Montevideo isolates were first isolated in 1998, and 80.0% of the isolates obtained in this year were resistant to streptomycin and sulfisoxazole. The results suggest that Salmonella Montevideo isolates that had already acquired resistance may have been introduced into the layer houses, although the route and vehicle of transmission were uncertain. The proportion of Salmonella Montevideo isolates resistant to streptomycin and sulfisoxazole significantly decreased (P < 0.01) from 79.5% for 1998 through 1999 to 37.3% for 2000 through 2002. This decrease probably was due to the fact that no antimicrobials were used on the farm. Among 10 isolates from different serotypes obtained from 1997 to 2002 that were resistant to ampicillin, two and five isolates harbored 42- and 63-kb R plasmids and identical DraI restriction enzyme digest patterns, respectively, and carried the blaTEM gene. The results suggest that the ampicillin resistance determinants were transferred among different serotypes of Salmonella in the layer houses.
