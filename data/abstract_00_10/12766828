Numerous therapies are available in both over-the-counter and prescription formulations for the treatment of head lice infestation. We summarize treatment recommendations from published literature and from a recent meta-analysis from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that describe the efficacy, safety, and resistance patterns of monotherapies available in the United States. If treatment with pyrethrin or permethrin fails to eradicate the infestation, the treatment of choice is malathion. However, because of malathion's flammability, it should be a second-line therapy. Orally administered ivermectin has been reported to be efficacious, but it is not currently a US Food and Drug Administration-approved pediculicide. Alternative therapies are also discussed, in addition to indications for prophylaxis, resistance reporting, and the social impact of infestation.
