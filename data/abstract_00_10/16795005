An idea to use 4'-C-substituted-2'-deoxynucleoside derivatives was proposed based on a working hypothesis to solve the problems of existing acquired immune deficiency syndrome chemotherapy (highly active antiretroviral therapy). Subsequent studies have successfully proved the validity of the idea and resulted in the development of 2'-deoxy-4'-C-ethynyl-2-fluoroadenosine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which is highly potent to all human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1s) including multidrug-resistant HIV-1 and has a low toxicity.
