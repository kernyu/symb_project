Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim for 73 Listeria monocytogenes isolates from clinical material samples, food and environment was determined using broth microdilution method. With exception of the sulfonamide all antibacterial agents were active against all tested strains. Resistance to sulfisoxazole (MIC > or = 512 microg/ml) was detected in case of 30.1% of isolates including 5 of 14 human strains.
