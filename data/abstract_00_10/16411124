Despite rising rates of macrolide resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae, the current guidelines for outpatient treatment of community-acquired pneumonia include a macrolide as initial empiric therapy. There have only been a few previously documented cases of macrolide treatment failure in community-acquired pneumonia and there is controversy as to whether macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae is clinically important. Reported here are two cases of community-acquired pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae, one of which was fatal, that failed to respond to clarithromycin.
