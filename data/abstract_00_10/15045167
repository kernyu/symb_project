OBJECTIVE: To study antimicrobial use for benchmarking and ensuring quality of antimicrobial treatment and to identify risk factors associated with the high use of antimicrobials in German intensive care units (ICUs) through implementation of the SARI (Surveillance of Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance in ICUs) system. DESIGN: Prospective, unit-based surveillance on antimicrobial use from February, 2000, until June, 2002. The data are standardised by use of the defined daily dose (DDD) for each antimicrobial defined by the WHO and by calculating use per 1000 patient days. SETTING: The data were obtained from 35 German ICUs and stratified by type of ICU (medical, surgical, interdisciplinary). RESULTS: To date, the project covers a total of 266,013 patient days in 744 reported ICU months and 354,356 DDDs. Mean antimicrobial use density (AD) was 1,332 DDD/1000 patient days and was correlated with length of stay. Penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitor (AD 338.3) and quinolones (155.5) were the antimicrobial group with the highest ADs. Comparison with US ICARE (Intensive Care Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology)/AUR (Antimicrobial Use and Resistance) data revealed a higher AD for glycopeptides and 3rd generation cephalosporins in ICARE/AUR ICUs, but a higher AD for carbapenems in German SARI ICUs regardless of the type of ICU. In the multivariate analysis, length of stay was an independent risk factor for an AD above the 75% percentile of the total amount of antimicrobials used (OR 1.96 per day); likewise, for the AD above the 75% percentile of carbapenems (OR 1.90 per day) and penicillins with extended spectrum (OR 2.01 per day). High use of glycopeptides and quinolones (AD >75% percentile) correlated with central venous catheter (CVC) rate (OR 1.14 per CVC day per 100 patient days and 1.16, respectively). CONCLUSION: The SARI data on antimicrobials serve ICUs as a benchmark by which to improve the quality of antimicrobial drug administration and for international comparison.
