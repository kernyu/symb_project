Pentamidine is a second-line agent used in the treatment of leishmaniasis and its mode of action and mechanism of resistance is not well understood. It was previously demonstrated that transfection of promastigotes and amastigotes with the ABC transporter PRP1 gene confers resistance to pentamidine. To further clarify this point, we generated Leishmania amazonensis mutants resistant to pentamidine. Our results indicated that this ABC transporter is not associated with pentamidine resistance in lines generated by drug pressure through amplification or overexpression mechanisms of PRP1 gene.
