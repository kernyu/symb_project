Four clonally related Escherichia coli strains were isolated successively from bile duct of a girl suffering from sclerosing cholangitis. One of them, selected after an imipenem-containing regimen, was resistant to carbapenems and to broad-spectrum cephalosporins due to a plasmid-mediated cephalosporinase, CMY-2, and the lack of outer membrane proteins OmpF and OmpC.
