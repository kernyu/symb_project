BACKGROUND: Acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are commonly recovered from immunocompromised individuals who exhibit chronic and/or disseminated herpetic lesions. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: The virulence and response to topical acyclovir therapy were evaluated in a mouse model of zosteriform cutaneous HSV infection using two HSV-1 isolates from the same immunocompromised patient (one susceptible and one resistant to acyclovir). RESULTS: The acyclovir-resistant virus, with a Thr63Ile change in the ATP-binding site of the thymidine kinase gene, produced almost as many skin lesions as the wild-type susceptible virus. As expected from in vitro susceptibility data, the herpetic lesions of the mice infected with the drug-resistant virus did not respond to topical acyclovir therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Some thymidine kinase HSV mutants associated with drug resistance may retain their pathogenicity at least in the mouse model described in this study.
