PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial profile, resistance patterns, and antibiotic sensitivity of bacterial keratitis to three commonly used ocular antibiotics. METHODS: All cases of bacterial keratitis referred to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Microbiology Laboratory from two consecutive annual 10-month periods were reviewed. The bacterial profile and resistance to ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, and gentamicin was evaluated within the two intervals. RESULTS: Of the 485 cultures analyzed, 66.4% (322) were positive for bacterial isolates. Of these, 19.2% were polymicrobial, 87.5% were gram-positive, and 12.5% were gram-negative. The most prevalent isolate was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (45.5%), followed by S. aureus (15.2%). The resistance patterns for gram-positive bacteria for ciprofloxacin for the first versus second time interval were 12% and 22% (P = 0.04) respectively, for cefazolin 13% and 23% (P = 0.04), and for gentamicin 4% and 7% (P = 0.36). The resistance patterns for gram-negative bacteria for ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, and gentamicin were not significantly different in the two tested time periods (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was increased resistance of gram-positive organisms to ciprofloxacin and cefazolin, but not gentamicin, in the two examined time periods. Increased resistance to these commonly used antibiotics emphasizes the need for close follow-up after initial empiric treatment, and maintaining a low threshold for selecting alternative therapy.
