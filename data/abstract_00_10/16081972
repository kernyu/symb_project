The purpose of this study was to compare a line probe assay (LiPA) with sequence analysis for the detection of mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors in human immunodeficiency reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. The limitations for interpreting LiPA make it unacceptable for routine clinical practice.
