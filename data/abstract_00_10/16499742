PURPOSE: To discuss the pathophysiology and the current treatment approaches for the dysregulation of glucose metabolism in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. DATA SOURCES: Selected research, clinical studies, clinical guidelines, and review articles. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV infection, multiple factors are associated with the pathogenesis of glucose dysregulation. Studies suggest that protease inhibitors, a class of antiretroviral agent, as well as viral factors, lipodystrophy, hepatitis C infection, injection drug use, and second-generation antipsychotics have been implicated in the development of glucose disorders and diabetes. Current treatment recommendations are based on extrapolated data from non-HIV diabetic patients. More research is needed to establish the most appropriate management for the disorders of glucose metabolism in the context of HIV infection. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: If left untreated, patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and complications associated with untreated diabetes.
