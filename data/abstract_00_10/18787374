OBJECTIVES: To assess the features of fat redistribution, detected by clinical and ultrasound (US) methods, and the presence of metabolic disorders in HIV-infected children undergoing antiretroviral therapy. To evaluate if serum levels of resistin, a hormone produced only by visceral adipose tissue, are a marker of fat redistribution in these patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-five consecutive symptomatic HIV-infected children were considered for inclusion in the study. Patients were enrolled if treated for at least 6 months with antiretroviral therapy with or without protease inhibitor (PI) and if compliant to the study protocol. Patients were evaluated for: anthropometric measures, fat redistribution by clinical and US methods, serum lipids, parameters of insulin resistance by homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, serum resistin levels by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Eighteen children fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. Twelve (66%) children had clinical and/or US evidence of fat redistribution; 9 (75%) of them were on PI therapy; only 3 of 6 children without fat redistribution were on PI therapy (p<0.05). Serum lipids and insulin resistance parameters did not differ between children with or without fat redistribution. There was a highly significant linear correlation between visceral fat detected by US and circulating resistin levels (r=0.87; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Fat redistribution occurred in most HIV-infected children undergoing PI therapy. Because serum resistin levels reflect the amount of visceral fat, they could be considered a sensitive marker of fat redistribution in HIV-infected children.
