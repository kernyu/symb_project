Out of 34 studied after-appendectomy tissues of adult and child patients 86 different strains of anaerobes were isolated. The antibiotic susceptibility of 30 isolated B. fragilis strains was tested using E tests. All studied strains were sensitive to imipenem, clindamycin and penicillin/tazobactam. Sensitivity to penicillin and cefoxitin was variable among these strains. One strain resistant to metronidazole (MIC--256 mg/L) and 3 strains with increased MIC to metronidazole were detected. Most of isolated strains were beta-lactamase producers.
