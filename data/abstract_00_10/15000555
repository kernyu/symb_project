Local infection control measures, antibiotic consumption and patient demographics from 1999-2000 together with bacteriological analyses were investigated in 29 ICUs participating in the ICU-STRAMA programme. The median antibiotic consumption per ICU was 1147 (range 605-2143) daily doses per 1000 occupied bed d (DDD1000). Antibiotics to which > 90% of isolates of an organism were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (TA90). The mean number of TA90 was low (1-2 per organism) for Enterococcus faecium (vancomycin:VAN), coagulase negative staphylococci (VAN), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftazidime:CTZ, netilmicin: NET) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (CTZ, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: TSU), but higher (3-7) for Acinetobacter spp. (imipenem:IMI, NET, TSU), Enterococcus faecalis (ampicillin:AMP, IMI, VAN), Serratia spp. (ciprofloxacin:CIP, IMI, NET), Enterobacter spp. (CIP, IMI, NET, TSU), E. coli (cefuroxime:CXM, cefotaxime/eftazidime:CTX/CTZ, CIP, IMI, NET, piperacillin-tazobactam:PTZ, TSU), Klebsiella spp. (CTX/CTZ CIP, IMI, NET, PTZ, TSU) and Staphylococcus aureus (clindamycin, fusidic acid, NET, oxacillin, rifampicin, VAN). Of S. aureus isolates 2% were MRSA. Facilities for alcohol hand disinfection at each bed were available in 96% of the ICUs. The numbers of TA90 available were apparently higher than in ICUs in southern Europe and the US, despite a relatively high antibiotic consumption. This may be due to a moderate ecological impact of the used agents and the infection control routines in Swedish ICUs.
