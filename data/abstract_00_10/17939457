A total of 92 canine/feline Pasteurella multocida strains form respiratory tract infections or infections of skin/ear/mouth as well as 42 canine/feline Bordetella bronchiseptica strains from respiratory tract infections were investigated for their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. While the P. multocida strains were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested - except sulfonamides -, a considerable number of the B. bronchiseptica strains was resistant or exhibited high MIC values against a number of antimicrobial agents including penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftiofur, cefquinome, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
