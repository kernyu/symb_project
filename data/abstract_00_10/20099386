The efficiency of category II DOTS chemotherapy was studied in 353 patients with recurrent tuberculosis. The latter was verified by a positive sputum smear test in 232 of them and this test was negative in 121. A control group consisted of 79 first detected patients. The results of the treatment for recurrences were substantially worse than those in new-onset tuberculosis. These have recently improved. Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to drugs was responsible for failing therapy. The worse results were obtained when the disease was multidrug resistant. Other reasons, social risk factors in particular, leading to incompliance lowered therapeutic effectiveness.
