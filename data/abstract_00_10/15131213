A prospective study of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance was performed with 304 consecutive group B streptococci (GBS) isolates. According to two automated susceptibility testing systems, Vitek-1 and Vitek-2, and double-disk agar diffusion, 79.9% were susceptible to both erythromycin and clindamycin. However, for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-inducible isolates, the accuracies of the Vitek-1 and Vitek-2 systems were 5.6 and 94.4%. In light of these results, we recommend that GBS be routinely tested using the double-disk diffusion method.
