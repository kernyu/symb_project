Emergence of multi-drug resistant HIV-1 is a serious problem for AIDS treatment. Recently, the virus-cell membrane fusion process has been identified as a promising target for the development of novel drugs against these resistant variants. In this study, we identified a 29-residue peptide fusion inhibitor, SC29EK, which shows activity comparable to the previously reported inhibitor SC35EK. Some residues in SC29EK not required for interaction with virus gp41 heptad repeat 1 (HR1) were replaced with a non-proteinogenic amino acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), to stabilize the alpha-helix structure and to provide resistance to peptidases.
