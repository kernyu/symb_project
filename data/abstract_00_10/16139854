A series of oxygenated cholesterol derivatives were prepared from new synthetic methods and evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial properties against human pathogens. The activity was highly dependent on the structure of the different compounds involved. The best results were obtained with hydroxy ketones 2, 4 and 5 and diketone 7 exhibiting activities against S. cerevisiae (ATCC 28383) and Candida albicans (CIP 1663-86). For example, compound 2 exhibited high activities against C. albicans (CIP 1663-86) and Amphotericine B and miconazole resistant strain C. albicans (CIP 1180-79) at a concentration of 1.5 microg/mL.
