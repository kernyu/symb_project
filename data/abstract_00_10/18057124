We present two cases of exudative pharyngitis due to Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Lancefield group G. While the participation of this organism as an agent of pharyngitis is well documented, we focus on failure of beta-lactam therapy, a phenomenon that is well described for pharyngitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes. Therefore, these case reports add to our knowledge of pharyngitis caused by non-S. pyogenes streptococci.
