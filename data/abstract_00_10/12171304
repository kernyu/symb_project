The issue of antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori is of particular concern and has become an important factor leading to eradication failure. This paper reports the prevalence of primary resistance to clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole and tetracycline among H. pylori isolates in the north-eastern part of Germany. A total of 1644 clinical H. pylori isolates was investigated over a period of 6 years from 1995 to 2000. The MICs were determined by the Etest. The overall rate of primary resistance was 26.2% for metronidazole and 2.2% for clarithromycin. No significant changes in the resistance rates during the period of investigation were observed. No isolate was resistant to amoxicillin or tetracycline. PCR-RFLP analysis for the detection of point mutations associated with clarithromycin resistance was performed with 36 H. pylori isolates. The A --> G transition mutation at position 2143 was detected in 19 H. pylori isolates (52.8%), whereas the mutation at position 2142 was found in 13 isolates (36.1%).
