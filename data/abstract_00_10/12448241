METHODS: This study evaluates the clinical efficiency of four regimens of antibiotic prophylaxis against wound infection in aseptic oral and maxillofacial surgery that does not involve implantation of foreign material and included 140 adult patients randomly distributed into four groups. Patients from two groups received prophylactic amoxicillin/clavulanate in a single-dose regimen or a 5-day regimen, respectively. Subjects from the other two groups received cefazolin in a single-dose regimen or a 5-day regimen, respectively. RESULTS: Clinical prophylactic efficiency proved to be equal for the four types of antibiotic regimens. DISCUSSION: Single-dose regimens are more economical, easier to administer, and carry a lower risk of inducing bacterial resistance. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is more expensive than cefazolin. For aseptic maxillofacial surgery that does not involve implantation of foreign material, we recommend preoperative single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin 2 g i.v. (in adult patients).
