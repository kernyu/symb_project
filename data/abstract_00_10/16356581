The available evidence on interferon-alpha (IFN) treatment for chronic hepatitis B is sufficient to conclude that in patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis, standard IFN therapy significantly improves clearance of HBeAg (number needed to treat [NNT] = 4), loss of HBV-DNA (NNT = 4) and clearance of HBsAg (NNT = 18). HBeAg positive patients with normal or slightly raised ALT should be treated only if there is histological evidence of progressive disease. In patients with HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis, less than 20% of subjects who have achieved an end-of-treatment virological response after a course of standard IFN maintain a sustained virological response in the long-term. IFN treatment could help to delay or prevent disease decompensation and liver-related deaths but further large studies are needed. Lamivudine is effective at reducing, and sometimes clearing, HBV replication in heavily immunosuppressed patients and can be safely administered to patients with advanced liver disease. Lamivudine should be continued over an undefined extended period of time, with a switch from lamivudine to adefovir if there is an HBV-DNA breakthrough under therapy. Adefovir, excluding cost, is preferable to lamivudine as a first-choice because there is less chance of inducing resistance. The long-term benefit of lamivudine and adefovir and the role of combinations is under investigation.
