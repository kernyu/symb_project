The phytochemical GC[sol ]MS analysis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of the aerial parts of Satureja montana L. and Satureja cuneifolia Ten., collected in Croatia were performed. The major compound of S. montana oil was the phenolic monoterpene carvacrol (45.7%). Other important compounds were the monoterpenic hydrocarbons p-cymene (12.6%), gamma-terpinene (8.1%) and the oxygen-containing compounds carvacrol methyl ether, borneol, thymol and thymol methyl ether. The volatile oil of S. cuneifolia was characterized as beta-cubebene (8.7%), limonene (8.3%), alpha-pinene (6.9%), spathulenol and beta-caryophyllene. The antimicrobial effects of S. montana and S. cuneifolia oils were found to have a broad spectrum activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens by the broth microdilution method. These oils were active against all the test strains, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Compared with S. cuneifolia, savory oil exhibited greater antimicrobial activity. The maximum activity of savory oil was observed against Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and against the yeast (Candida albicans). The essential oil of S. cuneifolia was also found to inhibit the growth of medically important pathogens such as S. aureus and E. coli. Fungicidal activity for both oils against C. albicans and S. cerevisiae was also observed.
