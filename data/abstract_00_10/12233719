The successful treatment of a 7-month-old infant with shunt-associated ventriculitis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium is presented. Linezolid was administered intravenously every 8 h; children have a greater volume of distribution and total body clearance than adults and therefore require more frequent dosing. The patient tolerated the therapy without adverse effects.
