The in vitro activity of daptomycin and selected comparator agents against Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with skin and soft tissue infection's was evaluated by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. Daptomycin was the most active agent against both S. aureus (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL; 100% susceptible) and VREF (MIC(90), 4 microg/mL; 100% susceptible), making it an excellent therapeutic option.
