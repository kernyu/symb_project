A regional audit report on the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in genitourinary (GU) medicine clinics in the UK in South Thames (South London, Kent, Surrey and Sussex). The majority of centres use trimethoprim as first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTIs. The incidence of trimethoprim resistance was 22.6%. The group has therefore recommended that cephalexin should be the first choice antibiotic for suspected UTIs within GU medicine.
