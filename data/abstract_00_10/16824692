Although in silico analysis have suggested that the antibiotic resistance genes in actinomycetes appear to be the origins of some antibiotic resistance genes, we have shown that recent horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from actinomycetes to other medically important bacteria have not taken place. Although it has been speculated in Benveniste and Davies' attractive hypothesis that antibiotic resistance genes of actinomycetes are origins of antibiotic resistance genes in pathogenic bacteria because the actinomycetes require mechanisms such as metabolic enzymes (encoded by the antibiotic resistance genes) to degrade the antibiotics they produce or to transport the antibiotics outside the bacterial cells, this hypothesis has never been proven. Both the phylogenetic tree constructed using 16S rRNA gene sequences and that constructed using concatenated amino acid sequences of 15 housekeeping genes extracted from 90 bacterial genomes showed that the actinomycetes is more ancestral to most other bacteria, including the pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and Chlamydia species. Furthermore, the tetracycline resistance gene of Bifidobacterium longum is more ancestral to those of other pathogenic bacteria and the actinomycetes, which is in line with the ancestral position of B. longum. These suggest that the evolution of antibiotic resistance genes of antibiotic-producing bacteria in general parallels the evolution of the corresponding bacteria. The ancestral position of the antibiotic resistance genes in actinomycetes is probably unrelated to the fact that they produce antibiotics, but simply because actinomycetes are more ancestral than pathogenic bacteria.
