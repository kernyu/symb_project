The activities of ceftobiprole and other beta-lactams were examined with 30 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates containing multiple pbp1a, pbp2b, and pbp2x mutations. The highest ceftobiprole MIC was 1 microg/ml, while the comparator MICs were 16 to 64 microg/ml. Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations for penicillin-binding protein 2x were 0.5 microg/ml (ceftobiprole) and 4 microg/ml (ceftriaxone) in a penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant isolate.
