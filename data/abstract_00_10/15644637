Antibiotic resistance of microorganisms that cause infections of the urogenital tract is a clinically relevant problem in obstetrics and gynecology. Due to methodological difficulties, resistance testing is rarely used for the management of these infections. Therefore, solid epidemiological data on resistance rates of most involved pathogens are scarce. Antibiotic resistance of several microorganisms appears to be increasing in various areas of the world, mainly Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis (metronidazole),Streptococcus agalactiae (macrolides, clindamycin), Mycoplasma hominis (tetracyclines, intrinsically macrolide resistant). In addition,isolated cases of clinical infections caused by multi-resistant Chlamydia trachomatis have been reported. The presence of antibiotic resistance should therefore be considered in patients with an unfavorable course despite adequate antibiotic therapy. In light of the growing problem of antibiotic resistance and the large gaps in our knowledge in this particular area, research efforts in the field of anti-biotic resistance in gynecological infections should be markedly intensified.
