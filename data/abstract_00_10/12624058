Resistance to antiretroviral agents often results from mutations within the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pol gene. Moreover, insertions within the p6 gag-pol region have recently been found to be involved with resistance to nucleoside analogs. Overall, we found that 21% of 156 specimens collected from HIV-infected individuals (17.6% from 74 drug-naive patients and 24.4% from 82 pretreated patients) harbored these insertions. Insertions around the KQE (Lys-Gln-Glu) motif were found in 12.2% of the pretreated patients but in none of the drug-naive subjects (P = 0.002). In contrast, insertions around the PTAP (Prol-Thre-Ala-Prol) motif were seen at similar rates ( approximately 15%) among drug-naive and pretreated patients, which supports the idea that they may be natural polymorphisms.
