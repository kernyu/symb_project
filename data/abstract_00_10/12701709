This paper is an overview of a non-specific local early induced resistance (EIR) mechanism, distinct from the incompatible-specific hypersensitive reaction (HR). We have shown that the local induced resistance (LIR) described earlier is not a single and uniform response to pathogen infection, because an early (EIR) and a late form can be distinguished. EIR operates from 3-6 h post-inoculation (hpi) until about 20 hpi, and is inhibited by a short heat-shock or the eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. In contrast, LIR, which corresponds to the induced resistance forms discovered earlier, requires more time (about 24 h) and intensive illumination to develop, and is effective for a longer period. EIR develops parallel with HR and is sometimes able to prevent it when the induction time of HR is longer than the time required for the development of EIR. It seems that EIR inhibits the metabolism of bacteria and the activity of hrp genes which otherwise are required for the induction of HR. In a compatible host-pathogen relationship the effect of EIR fails to take place. The rapid development of EIR is greatly influenced by temperature and the physiological state of the plant. EIR activates the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide at the bacterial attachment, expressing new peroxidase isoenzymes in the initiated plant tissue. It seems that this is a native general local defence mechanism which can localise foreign organisms even at the penetration site.
