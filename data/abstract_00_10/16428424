An Escherichia coli mutant was isolated and shown to be polymyxin B resistant. Mapping and sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation at codon 53 within the pmrA (basR) gene that results in a G-to-V substitution. Fusions of promoters from the pmrC, yibD, and pmrH genes with the lacZ reporter showed that they were constitutively expressed in pmrA53 cells. In pmrA+ strains, these promoters were induced by iron and zinc, while a DeltapmrA mutation blocked induction. The PmrA regulon regulates genes whose products remodel the composition and charge of lipid A and hence the barrier properties of the outer membrane. Along these lines, the pmrA53 mutant was also found to be hypersensitive to the anionic bile detergent deoxycholic acid.
