Calorie restriction (CR) has been shown to improve peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in animal models. However, the exact mechanism of CR on GLUT4 expression and translocation in insulin-sensitive tissues has not been well elucidated. In the present study, we examine the effect of CR on the expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), GLUT4 translocation, and glucose transport activity in adipose tissue from Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat and control (LETO) rats. CR (70% of satiated group) ameliorated hyperglycemia and improved impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in OLETF rats. In skeletal muscle, the expression levels of GLUT4 and GLUT1 were not significantly different between LETO and OLETF rats, and were not affected by CR. By contrast, the expression level of GLUT4 was markedly decreased in the adipose tissue of OLETF rats, but was dramatically increased by CR. The GLUT4 recruitment stimulated by insulin was also improved in OLETF rat adipocytes by CR. The insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake was significantly increased in adipocytes from the CR OLETF rats, as compared with the satiated OLETF rats. Taken together, these results suggest that CR improves whole body glucose disposal and insulin resistance in OLETF rats, and that these effects may associate with the increased adipocyte-specific GLUT4 expression.
