Candida rugosa is a rare cause of candidaemia, but important to recognize because of frequent azole-resistance and its association with catheters and total parenteral nutrition. Recommended therapy is an echinocandin or amphotericin, and catheter discontinuation. Fluconazole might be substituted based on susceptibility testing and a clinical response to initial therapy.
