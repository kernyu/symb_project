The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and its associated risk factors. The susceptibilities of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were tested against four first-line antituberculous drugs and were typed by spoligotyping. Spoligotyping of M. tuberculosis strains resulted in 95 different patterns that were divided into three evolutionary groups (1-3). Eighty-six (90%) of the isolates had unique patterns that were reported for the first time. Interestingly, 9.4% of the strains belonged to the Beijing family. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was seen in group 1 of the evolutionary scenario. All M. tuberculosis isolates belonging to the Beijing family were associated with a resistance pattern. MDR was much higher in bacteria isolated from Afghan TB patients residing in Iran.
