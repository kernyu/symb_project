Integrons have been widely described among the Enterobacteriaceae including strains of multi-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium DT104; however, information with respect to the presence of integrons among S. enterica serotype Enteritidis strains is limited. Multi-resistant isolates of Enteritidis were screened for the presence of integrons using a PCR protocol. One integron was detected in all isolates that were resistant to sulfonamide and streptomycin. Characterisation of these isolates indicated an integron which ranged in size between 1000 and 2000 bp and which harboured a gene cassette encoding the ant(3")-Ia gene specifying streptomycin and spectinomycin resistance. Further studies revealed the integrons to be located on large conjugative plasmids. This appears to be the first report of plasmid-borne integrons in Enteritidis.
