The in vitro activities of the lipopeptides palmitoyl (Pal)-Lys-Lys-NH(2) and Pal-Lys-Lys against gram-positive cocci were investigated. Enterococci and streptococci demonstrated higher susceptibilities than staphylococci and Rhodococcus equi. A positive interaction was shown when the lipopeptides were combined with beta-lactams and vancomycin. These results suggest that lipopeptides are promising candidates for antimicrobial therapy for infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
