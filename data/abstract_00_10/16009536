Four new chemosensitisers against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum based on the 9H-xanthene tricyclic scaffold were designed and synthesised in an attempt to identify simplified compounds that are easily accessible from commercially available starting materials. The compounds contain a common hydrophobic tricyclic 9H-xanthene moiety and an alkyl side chain with two amino groups, one of which is a tertiary substituted terminal amine, separated by three carbons and differing only in the chemical nature of the intermediary nitrogen atom. The best chemosensitising compound has a secondary amino group, showed a response modification index of 0.36 and caused a four-fold increase in chloroquine accumulation in a resistant strain of P. falciparum as well as having the highest selective therapeutic index when tested against a mammalian cell line.
