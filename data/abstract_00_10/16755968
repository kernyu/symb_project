Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) constitutes one of the main causes of nosocomial infections in badly burnt patients. The purpose of our study was to determine the frequency and evolution of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus strains in the department of resuscitation of badly burnt patients of Hopital AZIZA OTHMANA. From January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2003, tests for Staphylococcus aureus proved positive in 139 patients on at least, one occasion. Mean age of patients was 34 years and their sex ratio 1.7. 59.7% of the accidents were house hold accidents, and 70% of them were of thermal native. The average burnt cutaneous surface area was 44%. Sepsis occurred 7 days on average after admission to hospital. Hospital stay for this group varied between 3 and 140 days, outcome was fatal in 13 cases. MRSA occurred in 69% of cases. As for the other families of antibiotics, the frequencies of resistance remained elevated for tetracyclines, cotrimoxazole, gentamicine, erythromycine.
