It has been suggested that resistance to class IIa bacteriocins occurs at either a low or a high level. In listerial strains, low-level resistance (2-4-fold) to class IIa bacteriocins is attributed to alterations in membrane lipid composition. In Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis, high-level resistance (1000-fold) correlates with inactivation of the mptACD operon, which encodes the EII(Man)(t) mannose permease of the phosphotransferase system (PTS). Previous studies reported that in L. monocytogenes, high-level resistance involved the sigma(54) factor and the ManR activator. In this investigation, three genes associated with the resistance of Ent. faecalis JH2-2 to divercin V41, a pediocin-like bacteriocin from Carnobacterium divergens V41, were clearly identified by screening an insertional mutant library of Ent. faecalis JH2-2. These genes correspond to the well-known rpoN gene, which encodes sigma(54) factor, and to genes encoding a glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ) and a protein with a putative phosphodiesterase function (PDE). Resistance of the three mutants defective in the aforementioned genes appeared to be graduated: the rpoN mutant was more resistant than the glpQ mutant, which was more resistant than the pde mutant. Moreover, this resistance was specific to class IIa bacteriocins.
