We have prepared and evaluated the antibacterial activities of a series of substituted methylenepiperidinyl and methylenepyrrolidinyl oxazolidinones against several gram-positive strains including the resistant strains of Staphyloccus and Enterococcus, such as MRSA, CRSA, MSSA and VRE. Some of them showed comparable or superior in vitro activities (MIC) to vancomycin.
