The rdxA gene of 30 independently isolated Helicobacter pylori strains was sequenced. A comparison of the rdxA sequences revealed a higher percentage of amino acid substitutions in the corresponding protein than in other housekeeping genes. Out of 122 point mutations, 41 were missense and 4 were nonsense. A resistant strain with a nucleotide insertion in the rdxA sequence was also found. With the exception of the point mutations and the insertion generating a stop signal, no particular nucleotide mutation or amino acid substitution could be associated to metronidazole resistance. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the 30 nucleotide sequences did not demonstrate specific clusters associated with the resistance phenotype.
