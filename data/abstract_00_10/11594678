Three simple, related nucleosides, beta-L-2'-deoxycytidine (LdC), beta-Lthymidine (LdT), and beta-L-2'-deoxyadenosine (LdA), have been discovered to be potent, specific and selective inhibitors of the replication hepatitis B virus (HBV), as well as the closely related duck and woodchuck hepatitis viruses (WHV). Structure-activity relationship analysis indicates that the 3'-OH group of the beta-L-2'-deoxyribose of the beta-L-2'-deoxynucleoside confers specific anti-hepadnavirus activity. The simple nucleosides had no effect on the replication of 15 other RNA and DNA viruses, and did not inhibit human DNA polymerases (alpha, beta and gamma) or compromise mitochondrial function. The nucleosides are efficiently converted intracellularly into active triphosphate metabolites that have a long half-life. Once-daily oral administration of these compounds in the woodchuck efficacy model of chronic HBV infection reduced viral load by as much as 10(8) genome equivalents/ml serum and there was no drug-related toxicity. In addition, a decline in WHV surface antigen (WHsAg) paralleled the decrease in viral load. This class of nucleosides displays an excellent overall safety profile. The first compound, LdT, has already entered clinical trials and LdC, currently being developed as a prodrug, is expected to enter the clinic in the near future. These compounds have the potential for use in combination therapy with the goal of achieving superior viral suppression and diminishing the onset of resistance.
