We evaluated the clinical usefulness of a PCR assay that discriminates Staphylococcus aureus from coagulase-negative staphylococci and detects methicillin resistance on blood cultures by measuring the adaptation of antimicrobial therapy based on the PCR results. Only 7 of 28 patients (25%) benefited from a modification of antibiotic therapy based on the PCR results, since empirical therapy was appropriate in a majority of cases.
