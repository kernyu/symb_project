Two new stilbene derivatives, (E)-resveratrol 3-(6' '-galloyl)-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1) and (E)-resveratrol 3-(4' '-acetyl)-O-beta-D-xylopyranoside (2), and five known stilbene derivatives (3-7) were isolated from the dried aerial parts of Calligonum leucocladum. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic evidence. Compound 1 showed antioxidant activity and a restorative effect of the inhibition of oxacillin to oxacillin/methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
