BACKGROUND: Little is known about the HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in Ghana. OBJECTIVES: To determine the background protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations of HIV-1 from treatment naive patients in Ghana. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-five plasma samples randomly selected were analyzed for drug resistance mutations. The molecular phylogeny and recombinant patterns of the polymerase gene of HIV-1 were also analysed. RESULTS: No major drug-resistance mutations were seen in protease or reverse transcriptase genes. The L10I, L10V, V11I and E35G minor mutations were seen in four patients, while the V179E was observed in a patient with subtype G. An insertion of lysine was found at codon 36 of the protease gene of one patient. The predominant subtype was the CRF02_AG strain (n=22), but 3 (13.6%) of these were recombinants with HIV-1 subtype K and/or A1. Two patients harboured unclassified/complex strains with D/CRF01_AE and G/CRFAG_02 subtypes for the PR and RT, respectively, using the Stanford Database. Viral loads (VL) ranged from 2290 to >1,500,000c/ml (mean=339,065c/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment naive patients in Ghana before scale-up may have minor but not major PR mutations and high viral loads. The clinical effects of minor mutations/polymorphisms in the PR and RT genes and recombinants need to be investigated.
