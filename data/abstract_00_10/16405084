Clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) strains (their genotype, drug resistance, and virulence) and the characteristics of their caused processes were studied. More than a half the studied MBT isolates belonged to the genetic family Beijing. As compared with mycobacteria of individual genotypes, they showed a significantly higher rate of multidrug resistance, polyresistance, and a high virulescence and caused more common and frequently progressive pulmonary lesions requiring the use of large-dose isoniazid and second-line drugs and early surgical treatment.
