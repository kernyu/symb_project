Aim of our report is to discuss some key adherence features in the real world, by reporting two exceptional patients, who deliberately took all antiretroviral medications at half-dosage compared with standard prescriptions, and maintained a fully stable and sustained virological and immunological response after 6-10 consecutive years. The potential causes and consequences of this apparent misconduct of our patients on drug tolerability, resistance development, compliance monitoring, direct drug delivery, and health care providers behavior, are discussed.
