OBJECTIVE: The rates of Candida species and susceptibility to nystatin were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 1998 mycological tests have been carried out for identification of yeast species in the group of pregnant and delivering women hospitalized in the Obstetrics-Gynecological Departments of the Municipal Hospital in Bydgoszcz. We used two commercial media: Albicans ID and CHROMagar Candida. Noted have been 389 positive inoculation results for Candida from vaginal secretions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: From the total number of 416 differentiated fungus strains decidedly dominant was the species Candida albicans--constituting 81.97% of all strains. The second frequently occurring fungus species was Candida glabrata--11.06%. Further species were C. krusei--2.16%, C. tropicalis--1.20% and C. guilliermondii--1.20%. In 10 cases (2.41%)--in spite of carrying out the laboratory activities that are necessary in such a situation--the species type of tested strains could not be determined. The simultaneous occurrence of two Candida species has been noted in material originating from 27 women (6.94% of cases). Defining the drug-resistance of 93 Candida species strains against nystatin by means of the disk-diffusion method--it has been started that this drug is highly effective--81.72% of sensitive strains.
