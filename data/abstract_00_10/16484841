OBJECTIVES: To investigate the organisms causing neonatal sepsis and their modifications over an extended period, to assess their changing sensitivities to antibiotics and to verify whether the policy for screening pregnant women for group B streptococci (GBS) carriage is desirable in our settings. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Medical records of all infants with positive blood culture from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Salmaniya Medical Complex between 1991 and 2001 and Bahrain Defense Force Hospital between 1999 and 2001 were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 7,978 neonates in both hospitals 335 (4.19%) had culture-proven bacteremia. Gram-positive bacteria were isolated at constant rate over the 11-year period. The main agents isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) in 138 cases (41%), Staphylococcus aureus in 28 newborns (8%) and GBS in 26 patients (7.8%, 0.2/1,000 live births). All of them were sensitive to penicillin G, erythromycin and clindamycin. Gram-negative bacteria were declining but Escherichia coli was isolated in 35 cases (10%). Of special concern is the increasing percentage (5.7%) of Candida isolation. No clear trend toward increasing resistance was observed, although a major difference among the two institutions was evident. Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. showed resistance to many of the antibiotics tested, thereby posing difficult therapeutic choices. CONCLUSION: Good quality specimens are essential to evaluate the role of CoNS. The increasing threat of fungal infection must be carefully tackled. Specifically tailored policies for GBS prevention must be defined according to the local epidemiology.
