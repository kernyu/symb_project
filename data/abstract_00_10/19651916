We hypothesize a potential role for Borrelia burgdorferi OspC in innate immune evasion at the initial stage of mammalian infection. We demonstrate that B. burgdorferi is resistant to high levels (>200 microg/ml) of cathelicidin and that this antimicrobial peptide exhibits limited binding to the spirochetal outer membrane, irrespective of OspC or other abundant surface lipoproteins. We conclude that the essential role of OspC is unrelated to resistance to this component of innate immunity.
