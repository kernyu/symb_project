This study compared the frequency of the genetic polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in pulmonary tuberculosis without and with response to treatment. We carried out an observational, prospective, comparative study. Three groups were studied: healthy subjects, responders, and non-responders to directly observed treatment short-course. We took a peripheral blood sample for identification of polymorphic genotypes TNF -308G/A and lymphotoxin A (LTA) +252G/A by polymerase chain reaction, and their later digestion with the Nco1 restriction enzyme. We studied a total of 138 subjects: 42 (non-responders) and 48 in each of the remaining groups. Healthy subjects had significantly high frequency of the LTA +252A allele compared to groups of patients and could be related with protection from the disease. Patients had higher frequency of the non-polymorphic allele LTA +252G than healthy subjects. With regard to LTA +252G/A genotype, we did find a significant difference with a greater frequency in the group of patients. The LTA +252G/A genotype was associated with impaired response to treatment.
