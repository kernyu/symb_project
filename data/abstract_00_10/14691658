Vancomycin-resistant enterococci have recently emerged as significant nosocomial pathogens. Here we describe two Japanese patients, a 57-year-old man and a 12-year-old boy, with ventriculoperitoneal shunts for hydrocephalus who developed meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus gallinarum. The infection of the central nervous system in these two patients may have been associated with E. gallinarum derived from the gut. Removal of the shunts and antimicrobial treatment promoted apparent improvement in these patients. The risk factors and management of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections in the central nervous system are discussed.
