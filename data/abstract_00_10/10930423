Cysteine-scanning mutants as to putative transmembrane segments 4 and 5 and the flanking regions of Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H(+) antiporter (TetA(B)) were constructed. All mutants were normally expressed. Among the 57 mutants (L99C to I155C), nine conserved arginine-, aspartate-, and glycine-replaced ones exhibited greatly reduced tetracycline resistance and almost no transport activity, and five conserved glycine- and proline-replaced mutants exhibited greatly reduced tetracycline transport activity in inverted membrane vesicles despite their high or moderate drug resistance. All other cysteine-scanning mutants retained normal drug resistance and normal tetracycline transport activity except for the L142C and I143C mutants. The transmembrane (TM) regions TM4 and TM5 were determined to comprise 20 amino acid residues, Leu-99 to Ile-118, and 17 amino acid residues, Ala-136 to Ala-152, respectively, on the basis of N-[(14)C]ethylmaleimide ([(14)C]NEM) reactivity. The NEM reactivity patterns of the TM4 and TM5 mutants were quite different from each other. TM4 could be divided into two halves, that is, a NEM nonreactive periplasmic half and a periodically reactive cytoplasmic half, indicating that TM4 is tilted toward a water-filled transmembrane channel and that only its cytoplasmic half faces the channel. On the other hand, NEM-reactive mutations were observed periodically (every two residues) along the whole length of TM5. A permeability barrier for a membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, 4-acetamido-4'-maleimidylstilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, was present in the middle of TM5 between Leu-142 and Gly-145, whereas all the NEM-reactive mutants as to TM4 were not accessible to 4-acetamido-4'-maleimidylstilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, indicating that the channel-facing side of TM4 is located inside the permeability barrier. Tetracycline protected the G141C mutant from the NEM binding, whereas the other mutants in TM4 and TM5 were not protected by tetracycline.
