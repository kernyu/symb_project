In humans, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) most commonly result in intestinal colonization, which does not result in symptoms, may persist for a long time and serves as a reservoir for transmission of VRE to other patients. Certain VRE-colonized patients are at risk of infection, including haematology and oncology patients, patients in intensive care units and recipients of solid (especially abdominal) organ transplants. Controlling the spread of VRE colonization and preventing colonized patients from becoming infected are important aims. Ramoplanin is a member of a new class of antimicrobial agents; it may have a role in preventing infection in patients colonized with VRE.
