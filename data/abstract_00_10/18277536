Resistance to wide spectrum of antibiotics was studied and most widespread genetic determinants of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics were revealed. Susceptibility testing was performed using serial broth microdilution method. Detection of class A expanded spectrum beta-lactamases genes (TEM, SHV, CTX) by polymerase-chain reaction method was performed in 90 strains. Carbapenems remained the most active antibacterial agents with respect to studied E. coli strains. Among the 3rd generation cephalosporins the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations were observed for inhibition-protected combined agents (ceftazidime/clavulanic acid and cefoperazone/ sulbactam). Alone or in various combinations TEM, SHV, and CTX types of beta-lactamases were found in 58.9%, 14.4%, and 77.8% of strains. Combinations of 2 determinants were detected in 55.6% of the isolates, and all 3 determinants--in 5.6%. Most often E. coli was isolated in patients with urinary tract infections. Carbapenems and inhibition-protected combined 3rd generation cephalosporins are the most active agents against E. coli.
