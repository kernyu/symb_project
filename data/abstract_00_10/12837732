Four hundred and eight clinical strains of Vibrio cholerae isolated from different geographical areas and with different antimicrobial resistance patterns were tested for susceptibility to rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic active in vitro against Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs ranged from 0.5 to 4 mg/l for all strains. These values and the pharmacokinetic properties suggest rifaximin as an attractive antimicrobial agent for cholera.
