The present study was conducted to determine the prevalence of serotypes and antibiotic resistance in Shigella spp. isolated from patients admitted to Bouali hospital, Tehran, Iran during 1999 to 2001. All cases of shigellosis that were diagnosed according to their clinical pictures and microbial cultures were included in current study. Patients' age ranged from 12 to 89 years. Overall, 52 patients (56%) and 41(44%) were males and female, respectively. From a total of 90 Shigella isolates, 40 strains were identified as S. sonnei (45%), 26 as S. flexneri (27.9%), 3 as S. boydii (3%) and 21 as S. dysenteriae (24%). More than 95% of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and ceftizoxim, 70% to nalidixic acid and less than 50% to co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, ampicillin and fourazolodon.
