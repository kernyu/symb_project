The objective was to examine the coincidence in the prevalence of benzimidazole (Bz) resistance in smallholder goat herds, as determined by three average-based and two individually-based faecal egg count reduction (FECR) tests. Nineteen smallholder goat herds with more than 30 animals were selected from 84 herds in Yucatan. Animals shedding 150 eggs/g of faeces (EPG) on day zero were randomly divided into two groups. The control group did not receive treatment and the treated group received fenbendazole (10mg/kg body weight per os). Feed was withdrawn for 16 h before treatment. Ten days after treatment, both groups were sampled to determine their FEC. Faecal cultures and identification of infective larvae were performed for estimating the proportions of genera of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) present. Presence of resistant GIN was determined with three different average-based FECR (FECR(1), FECR(2) and FECR(3)) and two individually-based FECR (iFECR(1) and iFECR(2)). The prevalence of herds with Bz resistant nematodes (and 95% confidence interval (95% CI)) was calculated using each formula. Coincidence among formulae was estimated with Kappa values. The prevalence (+/- 95% CI) of Bz resistance calculated with FECR(1) (57.89 +/- 22.20) had a high coincidence with iFECR(1) and iFECR(2) (Kappa values of 0.86 and 0.79, respectively). The prevalence with FECR(2) (31.58 +/- 20.90) and FECR(3) (21.05 +/- 18.33) had a low coincidence with FECR(1) (Kappa < 0.50). Trichostrongylids found on Bz resistant farms were mainly Haemonchus spp., however, some Trichostrongylus spp. and Oesophagostomum spp. were found too. The high coincidence between the standard average-based FECR(1) and the individually based formulae is encouraging and may suggest that either formula could be applied to smallholder farmers. Further laboratory studies are needed to confirm the resistance status in the herds.
