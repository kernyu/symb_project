PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the sensitivity and resistance of commensal and pathogenic oral Candida to antifungal agents. METHODS: YBC Test Kit was used to identify species of commensal and pathogenic oral Candida; The in vitro susceptibilities of oral Candida to 5-flucytosine (5-FC), itraconazole (ITR) and fluconazole (FLU) were determined by NCCLS M27-A2 method. RESULTS: All strains were sensitive to 5-flucytosine, drug resistant strains to fluconazole and itraconazole were found both in commensal and pathogenic oral Candida spp; The proportion of no-C. albicans and antifungal drug resistant strains isolated from head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy were higher than oral commensal Candida and oral Candidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: The no-C. albicans and drug resistant strains to fluconazole and itraconazole can be found both in commensal and pathogenic oral Candida spp now.
