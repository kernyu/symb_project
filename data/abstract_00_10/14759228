The time the free drug serum concentration of antibiotic remains above the pathogen MIC (T > MIC) determines bacteriological efficacy and emergence or selection of resistance for penicillin and amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Multiple studies in animal and in-vitro models now support this conclusion. The size of the T > MIC (the pharmacokinetic/-dynamic target) is > 40-50% to maximise antibacterial effect and pathogen eradication for Streptococcus pneumoniae and probably also Haemophilus influenzae. The size of the T > MIC for optimal antibacterial effect is changed by host immune status but not by bacterial inoculum or mechanism of resistance. There is good animal evidence to support the prediction that, as long as the target T > MIC is achieved, strains of S. pneumoniae with amoxicillin MICs of 0.016 mg/L will respond to amoxicillin in the same way as those with MICs of 1-2 mg/L. Emergence of resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate in S. pneumoniae is related to low T > MIC (< 20%) and also to the degree of population heterogeneity to amoxicillin. Selection of resistant strains of S. pneumoniae is also related to T > MIC. Monte Carlo simulations based on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin with or without clavulanate in humans are needed to best predict the likely efficacy of different amoxicillin dosing regimens. This approach adequately allows the considerable pharmacokinetic variability in amoxicillin handling by infected patients to be accounted for as well as differences in pathogen beta-lactam susceptibility.
