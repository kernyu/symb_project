Escalating anthelmintic resistance has made it essential to develop alternative ways of worm management for reducing selection for worm resistance, and one of the most promising approaches is to treat only those animals unable to cope with worm challenge, thus favouring unselected worms originating from untreated animals. Only clinical evaluation of anaemia (FAMACHA system) and the body condition score are regarded as being of practical value or having potential, respectively, for repeatedly examining flocks or herds and identifying individuals for treatment. Only the FAMACHA system has been tested well enough for use under practical farming conditions. However, further investigation is needed on its effect on animal production, and methods to reduce labour. Trials over several seasons showed that most sheep under severe Haemonchus contortus challenge required no, or only one treatment over a full summer season. A small minority (usually < 5%) needed more than two treatments. Most sheep could cope without regular treatment. With sufficient training, clinical evaluation of anaemia was found reliable for practical use. The overwhelming majority of trainees (some poorly literate) were able to implement the FAMACHA system successfully. The dynamics of haemonchosis in a flock can easily be monitored. Farmers, farm workers and veterinarians all rated the system very highly (> 80%) and treatment costs dropped by approximately 58%. The heritability of FAMACHA values obtained by clinical evaluation was high at 0.55 +/- 0.17% in a Merino stud with +/- 550 young rams and ewes which were the progeny of 21 sires. The FAMACHA system may not be as applicable to goats as to sheep, but further work is necessary. The main benefits of the system are the reduction in treatments, its use for discriminating between animals of varying ability to cope with infection (thus allowing genetic selection), and its lowering of selection pressure on H. contortus for anthelmintic resistance.
