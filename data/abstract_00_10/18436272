Panama is the first country in the Central American region that has officially discarded chloroquine as a first-line drug to treat Plasmodium falciparum cases. Here we describe the clinical and molecular findings from autochthonous P. falciparum fatal cases, and the epidemiological situation that led to a change in the national antimalarial drug policy. Our results illustrate the potential pathogenicity of the strain of P. falciparum circulating in the country and provide molecular evidence of parasite resistance to chloroquine and antifolate drugs. The public health threats of these findings for the Central American region are discussed.
