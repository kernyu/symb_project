Vancomycin resistance has been reported in clinical isolates of both coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. The emerging threat of widespread vancomycin resistance poses a serious public health concern given the fact that vancomycin has long been the preferred treatment of antibiotic-resistant gram-positive organisms. Though major efforts are now being focused on improving our understanding of vancomycin resistance, there is much that remains unknown at this time. This article reviews the major epidemiologic, microbiologic, and clinical characteristics of vancomycin resistance in both coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus. The review begins with a discussion of issues common to both coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus, such as definitions, laboratory detection of vancomycin resistance, and infection control issues related to vancomycin-resistant staphylococci. The rest of the article is then devoted to a discussion of issues unique to each organism, including epidemiology, risk factors for infection, mechanisms of resistance, and management options.
