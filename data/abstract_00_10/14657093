Regulatory authorities have suspended the use of some antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed. The subject remains a hotly debated topic around the world. Controversy surrounds whether such use in animals presents a real risk of increasing resistance in human pathogens, and hence a human health problem. Views tend to be polarized. Proponents of the bans point to falling rates of resistance in animal and human isolates as a direct result; detractors question whether evidence exists for a link between growth promoter use and resistance in human pathogens and cite a decline in animal health among the undesirable effects. The article by Phillips et al. in this issue puts one view, this article aims to consider the merits of the arguments put forward by both sides and looks to a way forward.
