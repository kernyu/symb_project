Dimeric vancomycin analogues based on a lead compound identified from a library of synthetic analogues of vancomycin have up to 60-fold greater activity than vancomycin against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE, VanA phenotype). Simplified analogues have also been prepared and found to maintain activity against VRE and have broad-spectrum antibiotic activity.
