Industrial swine production is affected by several serious viral diseases, such as pseudorabies, hog cholera, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, which are frequently complicated with the increased incidence of bacterial complications such as Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP). This clinical observation is suggestive of a virus-bacteria synergism on the pathogenesis. One hypothesis is that viruses induce polymorphonuclear cell (PMNs, primarily neutrophils) dysfunction resulting in defective antibacterial resistance. The purpose of this study was to use the pseudorabies virus (PrV) as a model to explore the possibility of virus-induced PMN dysfunctions in pigs. The goals were to evaluate, in ex vivo settings, the oxidative burst (OB) function of pig PMNs, and to evaluate whether PrV could affect these responses to APP. We found that PrV served as a mild OB stimulant (2-fold) to pig PMNs, which also launched a significant burst to phorbol 12-myristate 13-diacetate (PMA; 61-fold), to non-opsonized, heat-killed and formaldehyde-fixed APP (8-fold), and to normal pig serum-opsonized APP (34-fold). Interestingly, the PMA-induced OB could be reduced 50-70% by preincubating PMNs with PrV, and the critical target was not likely the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase itself. Inactivated PrV was as efficient as viable PrV at exerting the inhibitory effect. On the other hand, PrV exerted a primarily additive effect on APP-induced OB, when the cytotoxic effect of APP on PMNs was avoided. The current finding suggests the possibility that activated PMNs are susceptible to PrV-induced dysfunction, and that the PrV-APP synergism may require upstream stimuli of PMNs to be initiated.
