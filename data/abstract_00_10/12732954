Macrolide antibiotics like erythromycin can induce the synthesis of a specific 23S rRNA methyltransferase which confers resistance to cells containing the erm gene. Erythromycin inhibits both protein synthesis and the formation of 50S subunits in bacterial cells. We have tested the idea that the 50S precursor particle that accumulates in antibiotic-treated Staphylococcus aureus cells is a substrate for the methyltransferase enzyme. Pulse-chase labeling studies were conducted to examine the rates of ribosomal subunit formation in control and erythromycin-induced cells. Erythromycin binding to 50S subunits was examined under the same conditions. The rate of 50S subunit formation was reduced for up to 30 min after antibiotic addition, and erythromycin binding was substantial at this time. A nuclease protection assay was used to examine the methylation of adenine 2085 in 23S rRNA after induction. A methyl-labeled protected RNA sequence was found to appear in cells 30 min after induction. This protected sequence was found in both 50S subunits and in a subunit precursor particle sedimenting at about 30S in sucrose gradients. 23S rRNA isolated from 50S subunits of cells could be labeled by a ribosome-associated methlytransferase activity, with (3)H-S-adenosylmethionine as a substrate. 50S subunits were not a substrate for the enzyme, but the 30S gradient region from erythromycin-treated cells contained a substrate for this activity. These findings are consistent with a model that suggests that antibiotic inhibition of 50S formation leads to the accumulation of a precursor whose 23S rRNA becomes methylated by the induced enzyme. The methylated rRNA will preclude erythromycin binding; thus, assembly of the particle and translation become insensitive to the inhibitory effects of the drug.
