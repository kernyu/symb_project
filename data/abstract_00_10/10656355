The project goal was to decrease excessive vancomycin use. Interventions included an educational chart note the first day of therapy, followed by pharmacists discussing the need for continued therapy with patients' physicians. Empirical vancomycin use improved from 20% to 90% compliance with guidelines within 6 months of the intervention.
