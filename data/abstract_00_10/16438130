A 28-day in vivo treatment trial to evaluate the efficacy of pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (Fansidar, PS) was conducted in 21 Lao patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Sixteen patients (76%) were completely cured with PS without any reappearance of asexual stage parasitemia during the follow-up examination. On the other hand, 5 patients (24%) failed to respond to this trial medication, resulting in recrudescence of asexual stage P. falciparum malaria. PS resistance resulted in higher prevalence of post-treatment gametocytemia, 25% gametocyte carriers among PS sensitive cases versus 75% of the resistant cases. These findings suggest that although the level of PS resistance is still valid for treatment of malaria in the study area of Lao PDR, post-treatment induction of gametocytemia among resistant cases may result an increase in transmission rate of PS resistant falciparum malaria.
