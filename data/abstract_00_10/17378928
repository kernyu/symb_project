The most common T-serotypes among group A streptococci (n = 88) isolated from pharyngeal samples of children referred to a tertiary hospital in Cyprus for pharyngitis or scarlet fever during a 14-month period (2003-2004) were T28 (25%), T8/25/Imp19 (22.7%) and T12 (9.1%). All 88 isolates were sensitive to penicillin and clindamycin, but 1.1% and 18.2% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline, respectively. Macrolide consumption was estimated at 1.7 defined daily doses/1000 inhabitants/day. The low percentage of resistance to macrolides may have been related, at least in part, to the low consumption of macrolides.
