The objectives of this study were to determine the genotypic and phenotypic patterns of resistance in a group of early-stage antiretroviral-naive patients failing initial therapy with didanosine, stavudine and nevirapine. These patterns of resistance were determined at baseline and at time of virological failure in 89 antiretroviral-naive patients with CD4 cells >500 cells/ml and viral load >5000 copies/ml who received initial antiretroviral therapy with didanosine plus stavudine and nevirapine as part of the SCAN study, and who failed after having reached undetectable plasma levels (<200 copies/ml). Of the 89 patients recruited in the SCAN study, 14 (16%) developed a virological failure after reaching a viral load below 200 copies/ml after a median of 20 months of follow-up. At baseline, none of these 14 patients had genotypic resistance. At time of failure, six out of 14 (43%) failing patients had wild-type genotype and no phenotypic resistance. Suboptimal compliance could be documented in four of these six patients. Seven patients (50%) had nevirapine resistance mutations (mainly K103N [4/7], Y181C/I [2/7], G190A/S [2/7] and V108I [1/7]) associated with phenotypic high-level resistance to nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz (nevirapine >47.4- to 58.1-fold, delavirdine >74.4- to 168.9-fold and efavirenz >56.0- to 347.2-fold). Four of these seven patients also had thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAM) (T215Y/F [2/4], M41L [1/4], D67N [2/4] and K70R [1/4]). Finally, one patient (7%) had exclusively TAM mutations (M41L). None of the patients developed mutations associated with didanosine resistance or phenotypic resistance to didanosine or stavudine. Suboptimal compliance or selection of nevirapine resistance often with TAM mutations was frequently associated with virological failure in a cohort of early-stage chronic HIV-1-infected patients treated with a protease inhibitor-sparing regimen.
