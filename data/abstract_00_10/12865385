OBJECTIVES: To determine the susceptibility of southern African strains of Bacillus anthracis to new, investigational agents as well as conventional antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MICs of 26 isolates of B. anthracis from South Africa and Zimbabwe, as well as the Sterne vaccine strain and a type culture strain, were determined by agar dilution. RESULTS: The most active antimicrobial agents were the novel ketolide ABT 773, new and conventional fluoroquinolones, and doxycycline; macrolides were intermediately active. The lack of activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins against B. anthracis was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility to conventional antibiotics was in keeping with previous studies. Two new fluoroquinolones and a ketolide showed promising in vitro activity that would support their further evaluation in animal models of anthrax.
