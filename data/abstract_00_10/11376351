In Streptococcus pneumoniae, resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin type B (MLS(B)) antibiotics is mediated by erm(B) and mef(A) determinants. Tetracycline resistance is always associated with resistance to minocycline and is due to the presence of the tet(M) gene. The erm(B) determinant is predominant. We demonstrated that the erm(B) gene could be present with mef(A), which is of streptococcal origin, and msr(A), which is of staphylococcal origin, this being an example of genetic promiscuity. The tet(M) determinant was associated with pneumococci harboring the erm(B) gene, while it was not associated with the strains harboring the mef(A) gene. This association is due to the fact that, in most of the cases, erm(B) and tet(M) reside in the same chromosomal conjugative transposon.
