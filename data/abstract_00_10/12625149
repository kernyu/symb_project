The antimalarial activity of 10 alpha-trifluoromethylhydroartemisinin (TFMHA) was compared to that of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in the Plamodium berghei mouse model. Treatment with TFMHA in mice infected with a P. berghei chloroquine-sensitive strain at 25 mg/kg for 3, 5, and 7 d, or DHA at the same dose for 7 d showed the parasite was eliminated from the host within 2.6 d. The radical cure and survival rates of these mice up to 60 d after infection were 90-100%. In mice infected with the P. berghei chloroquine-resistant strain, TFMHA used at 25 mg/kg/day for 3, 5, or 7 d reduced parasitaemia within 2 d. The radical cure and survival rates of these animals up to 60 d after infection were 30, 60, and 90% for the 3 treatment durations respectively. In contrast, DHA only had an inhibitory effect on the growth of the parasite within the first few days of treatment and could not eliminate the parasite even after 7 d of treatment. There was a 100% relapse and all mice died within 28 d after infection. The acute toxicity of TFMHA as determined by the median lethal dose (LD50) in mice treated orally was 820 mg/kg. In rabbits, TFMHA given orally at 20 mg/kg once daily for 28 successive days had no effect on the bodyweight, haematological, biochemical, histopathological and electrocardiogram parameters. The results showed that TFMHA is an effective antimalarial drug with a low level of toxicity.
