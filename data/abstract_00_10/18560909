A prospective study was conducted during a one-year period between 2006 and 2007 to describe the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) at University Hospital Basel, Switzerland (UHBS) and to determine phenotypic and genotypic features of C. difficile strains isolated at the Microbiology Laboratory UHBS including strains from regional non-university hospitals. We prospectively identified 78 CDAD cases at UHBS with an incidence of 2.65/1,000 hospitalised patients or 2.3/10,000 patient-days. Sixteen patients (20.5%) were infected with clindamycin-resistant strains of PCR-ribotype 027 during an outbreak at the geriatric hospital. Among 124 single-patient isolates, 28 (22.6%) were resistant to moxifloxacin and 34 (27.4%) were resistant to clindamycin, but all remained susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. Of 102 toxigenic isolates, 19 (18.7%) had an 18-bp deletion in the tcdC gene, eight (7.8%) a 39-bp deletion, and one (1.0%) a 54-bp deletion. Genes for binary toxin were present in 27 (21.8%). PCR-ribotype 027 was associated with older age (median age 83.5 vs. 65.5 years, p < 0.0001) and longer duration of hospitalisation before onset of disease (median 15.5 vs. 9 days, p = 0.014) with a trend towards higher crude mortality, more severe disease, and previous use of macrolides compared to ribotype non-027. Overall, severe disease correlated with use of a nasogastric tube and surprisingly shorter duration of hospitalisation before onset of disease. Today, laboratory-based and epidemiological surveillance systems are required to monitor CDAD cases and emergence of new epidemic strains.
