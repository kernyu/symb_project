Susceptibility to five antimicrobials was determined for Bacteroides spp. (n = 52) and Parabacteroides distasonis (n = 8). All isolates were susceptible to metronidazole. The resistance rates to ampicillin, cefoxitin, tetracycline and clindamycin were 98%, 9.6%, 65.3% and 19.2% of the Bacteroides strains, respectively. The genes cepA, cfiA, cfxA, tetQ, ermF and nim were found in 69.2%, 17.3% 9.6%, 50%, 7.7% and 3.8% for these strains respectively. All P. distasonis strains were resistant to ampicilin. Cefoxitin, tetracycline and clindamycin resistance rates were 75%, 87.5% and 50%, respectively. The ermF and nim genes were absent and 37.5%, 12.5%, 12.5% and 87.5% of this strains possessed cepA, cfiA, cfxA and tetQ genes, respectively. Ten cfiA gene positive strains of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides were submitted to E-test with imipenem and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The resistance rate to imipenem was 4.1% and 8.3% to amoxicillin-clavulanate. This feature is for the first time described in Brazil.
