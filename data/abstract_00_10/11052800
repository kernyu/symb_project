Several 4-benzyl analogues of 5-ethyl-6-methyl-4-(phenylthio)pyridin-2(1H)-ones were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-HIV-l activities. Key transformations include metalation at the 4-C-position of 5-ethyl-2-methoxy-6-methyl-3-pivaloylaminopyridine (5) and its coupling with benzyl bromide or benzaldehyde derivatives. Biological studies revealed that some of the new 4-benzylpyridinones show potent HIV-1 specific reverse transcriptase inhibitory properties. Compounds 14, 19, and 27, which inhibit the replication of HIV-1 in CEM-SS cells, with IC(50) values ranging from 0.2 to 6 nM are the most active compounds in this series. Biochemical studies showed that compound 27 strongly inhibited the activity of a recombinant HIV-1 RT. Moreover, the infectivity of isolated HIV-1 particles was severely decreased after exposure to compound 27. Although cross resistance is frequently observed between non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, compound 27 was capable of inhibiting a virus resistant to nevirapine with an IC(50) of 40 nM.
