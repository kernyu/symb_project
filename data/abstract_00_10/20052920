Characteristics of the clinical process of staphylococcal endocarditis in 115 inpatients and the adequacy of various regimens for their antibiotic therapy within a period of 10 years were analysed. Four clinical criteria for prognosis of staphylococcal endocarditis were determined: intravenous narcomania, splenomegalia, leukocytosis and hemorrhagic skin eruption. The analysis of the Russian and foreign findings showed that the use of betalactams (oxacillin, the 1st and 3rd generation cephalosporins) and lincomycin provided the adequate therapy resulting in eradication of the pathogen in case of oxacillin resistant staphylococci, whereas the use of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin was inexpedient. In case of MRSA it was recommended to use vancomycin and in case of endocarditis due to S. aureus with intermediate resistance to vancomycin (VISA, MIC > 0.5 mcg/ml) the use of linezolid was recommended.
