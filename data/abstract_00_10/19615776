Clevudine (L-FMAU) is a thymidine l-nucleoside analogue that was recently introduced for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Previous studies showed that clevudine has potent and sustained antiviral activity without causing viral resistance. No severe adverse event occurred during clinical trials. We describe two cases of drug-induced myopathy during long-term treatment of chronic hepatitis B with clevudine.
