We examined trends in resistance to first-line antituberculous agents for Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in Ontario, Canada from 1987 through 1998 (n=8069). The proportions resistant were as follows: isoniazid, 9.6%; rifampin, 1.9%; streptomycin, 4. 9%; ethambutol, 1.3%; and pyrazinamide, 1.7%. Resistance to isoniazid has increased markedly since 1990, whereas resistance to streptomycin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide increased from 1997 through 1998. Resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin did not increase. The incidence of persistence and reactivation (early or late treatment failure) was 1-2 per 100 person-years (PY) in the first 7-12 months and 0.3-0.9 per 100 PY from 13 months to 5 years thereafter. For initially susceptible strains, the incidence of resistance to isoniazid was 0.11 per 100 PY and for and rifampin was 0.06 per 100 PY in the first year and negligible thereafter, with an overall risk of 0.14% for isoniazid and 0.10% for rifampin. Resistance of M. tuberculosis to antituberculous agents, and in particular to isoniazid, is a growing problem in Ontario and is higher than elsewhere in Canada.
