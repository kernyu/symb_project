Certain streptomycin resistance mutations (i.e., rpsL and rsmG) result in the overproduction of antibiotics in various actinomycetes. Moreover, rpsL rsmG double-mutant strains show a further increase in antibiotic production. rpsL but not rsmG mutations result in a marked enhancement of oligomycin production in Streptomyces avermitilis and erythromycin production in Saccharopolyspora erythraea, accompanied by increased transcription of a key developmental regulator gene, bldD, in the latter organism.
