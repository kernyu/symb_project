The ribosome is an important target for aminoglycoside antibiotics; however, the clinical effectiveness of aminoglycosides has diminished due to bacterial resistance mechanisms. Here we report the X-ray structure of a novel synthetic aminoglycoside bound to the A site of the ribosome, its target for manifestation of activity. The structure validates the in silico design paradigms for the antibiotic and reveals the molecular interactions made by this novel antibiotic in prokaryotes.
