A previously healthy 53-year-old woman developed pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO) manifesting as progressive lumbago following wound infection of a decompressive craniectomy performed for brain contusion caused by a traffic accident. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed vertebral osteomyelitis at T-12 and L-1 with paravertebral abscess. Anterior debridement and fusion using autografts were performed at the first operation. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was cultured from the abscess specimen. Antibiotic therapy resolved the infection. Pedicle screw fixation was performed at the second operation. The patient became free from back pain and no recurrence of infection was seen. The diagnosis of PVO is frequently observed or delayed because of the nonspecific symptomatic presentation in the early stage. Coexistent infection or trauma makes early diagnosis more difficult. Indications and timing of instrumentation for the spinal column infected with MRSA is difficult. Two-staged operation with anterior debridement and posterior instrumentation after eradication of the infection is a safe and effective procedure for MRSA vertebral osteomyelitis.
