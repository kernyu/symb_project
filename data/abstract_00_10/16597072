OBJECTIVES: To characterize the antibiotic resistance seen in community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and determine which characteristics to look for in an antibiotic to improve clinical outcomes and decrease the potential for development of resistance. DATA SOURCES: Using MEDLINE, we performed a search of articles published from 1966 to 2004 to evaluate the current literature on the subject of antibiotic resistance and strategies to overcome it. Additional cited references, such as abstracts, were also identified. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant original research articles, reviews, and published abstracts were selected for inclusion in this review. RESULTS: Several factors were identified that should be considered when choosing empiric antibiotic therapy for community-acquired RTIs with the goal of improving clinical outcomes while minimizing the risk of resistance. These factors include spectrum of activity, bactericidal vs bacteriostatic activity, chemical structure, elimination half-life, and potency. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these studies support the use of targeted antibiotic agents that, based on structural and chemical properties, are optimized to have a low potential to induce resistance. This approach to antimicrobial therapy appears to be the most suitable for patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and other community-acquired RTIs.
