A 26-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with relapse of ulcerative colitis (UC). We diagnosed it as a refractory UC because intravenous corticosteroid therapy had no effect. Intravenous cyclosporine therapy and other conventional therapies did not lead to remission. Then the possibility of infliximab was discussed with the patient and her parents and treatment with infliximab was started. Infliximab was infused intravenously at a dose of 5mg per kilograms of body weight. Immediately after the first infusion, clinical symptoms improved, and clinical remission was achieved within 12 weeks. It is suggested that infliximab can be effective for refractory UC.
