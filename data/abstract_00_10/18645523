OBJECTIVE: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV-1 variants are thought to be less fit than wild-type virus. In 2005, we reported a case of transmitted MDR HIV-1 infection associated with dual tropism and rapid clinical progression. Here we report the in vitro characterization of the virus isolates. METHODS: Replication characteristics of bulk and clonal isolates from this case (MDR-1) were examined and compared with these of a panel of transmitted MDR and wild-type (WT) viruses (MDR-2 approximately 4, WT-1, 2). RESULTS: Infectivity and frequency of infectious virion of propagated isolates were high in MDR-1 biological clones (mean titer, 3.5 x 10(5) TCID50/mL; mean frequency of infectious virion, 1/2444) and its bulk isolate (3.2 x 10(6) TCID50/mL; 1/301) as compared with the other biological clones (7.3 x 10(3) TCID50/mL; 1/21,320). Upslope (log10 p24/mL/d) of viral replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture was much higher in MDR-1 clones (1.30 +/- 0.30: mean +/- SD) than those of MDR-2 approximately 4 (0.75 +/- 0.08) or WT-1, WT-2 clones (0.82 +/- 0.03). The bulk isolate and dual-tropic biological clones from MDR-1 depleted CD4+ T cells very rapidly in vitro compared with the other viruses tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that MDR HIV-1 can effectively evolve and compensate not only to retain high-level replication but also to exhibit virulence associated with rapid disease progression.
