HIV infection leads to a severe decrease of T CD4 lymphocytes with subsequent development of opportunistic infections. The use of current combination of antivirals has improved the morbidity and morbility of patients. Such treatments are not without severe drawbacks such as toxicity and resistance. Development of additional therapeutic strategies with cytokines, immunomodulators or therapeutic immunizations are currently intensely investigated. The clinical benefit of such strategies is under evaluation. However, these strategies may help to potentiate the immune restoration obtained with antivirals or alternatively to spare or delay the use of antivirals.
