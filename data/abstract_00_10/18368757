Analysis of prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in hospitals with different specializations was performed. 2584 strains were isolated. Methicillin-resistant (MR) strains were present in different profile hospitals and their total prevalence between isolated strains was 12.3% while significantly varied in different hospitals (from 8% to 37%). Along with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), MRSE (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis) and MRSS (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus saprophyticus) were presented in all studied hospitals. The prevalence of MR strains was highest among strains isolated from flame burn wounds (37%), while in samples from newborns in maternity hospital resistant strains represented 12% of isolates, and in general clinical hospital--not more than 9% of isolates. Relationship between rates of isolation of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and specialization of hospital unit was noted. For example, prevalence of MR staphylococci in isolates from newborns in ICU (47.5%) differed from the same one in maternity hospital (11.6%).
