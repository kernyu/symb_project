Posaconazole is an extended-spectrum azole antifungal that exhibits activity against a broad range of fungal pathogens, including yeasts and moulds. Clinical data have demonstrated the clinical utility of posaconazole against many therapy-refractory pathogens, including Aspergillus spp, Fusarium spp, and Zygomycetes. These data have provided clinicians with hope in these difficult situations. Some of the limitations that have emerged with the use of posaconazole are the lack of an intravenous formulation and erratic drug absorption. This fact is further complicated by the existence of saturable posaconazole absorption. Despite these drawbacks, posaconazole appears poised to become a prominent therapeutic modality for the prophylaxis and management of various fungal infections among high-risk patients.
