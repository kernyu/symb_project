Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen of immunocompromised hosts. In cystic fibrosis (CF), P. aeruginosa causes acute and chronic lung infections that result in significant morbidity and mortality. P. aeruginosa possesses several traits that contribute to its ability to colonize and persist in acute and chronic infections. These include high resistance to antimicrobials, ability to form biofilms, plethora of virulence products, and metabolic versatility. In P. aeruginosa, a cell-to-cell communication process termed quorum sensing (QS) regulates many of these factors that contribute to its pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that the CF lung environment presents a specialized niche for P. aeruginosa. The relationship of P. aeruginosa QS, biofilm formation, and the CF lung environment is discussed.
