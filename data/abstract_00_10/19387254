PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review is a concise review of recent developments in the field of viral hepatitis, based on publications between December 2007 and November 2008. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of acute hepatitis A and B infection has declined significantly, especially among children less than 15 years of age. Five oral antiviral agents have been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Telbivudine is more potent than lamivudine but is associated with a high rate of antiviral resistance compared with entecavir or tenofovir. De-novo combination of lamivudine and adefovir reduces the rate of antiviral resistance compared with lamivudine monotherapy. Individualizing dose and duration of pegylated interferon and ribavirin according to on-treatment virologic response may improve sustained virologic response rates. Several specifically targeted antiviral therapies notably protease and polymerase inhibitors are promising but must be used in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Hepatitis E virus has been reported to result in chronic hepatitis in transplant patients. SUMMARY: Multiple treatment options are available for hepatitis B but long-term treatment is required. Several specifically targeted antiviral therapies have shown promise. In the meantime, individualizing dose and duration of pegylated interferon and ribavirin might improve sustained virologic response rates in patients with hepatitis C.
