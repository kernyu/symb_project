A total of 7,837 clinical isolates of Candida were tested against fluconazole, and 351 resistant (fluconazole MIC >/=64 micro g/ml) isolates were identified (4% of the total tested). All fluconazole-resistant isolates were inhibited by caspofungin at concentrations that can be exceeded by standard doses (MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited, 1 micro g/ml; 99% of the MICs were </=2 micro g/ml).
