Studies have demonstrated that HIV-1 isolated from subjects experiencing virologic failure on stavudine (d4T)-containing regimens often contains thymidine analog mutations (TAMs), consisting of reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219Q/E, previously associated only with zidovudine (ZDV) resistance. In clinical study NZT40012, HIV-1 was isolated from 86 ZDV-naive subjects experiencing viremia on d4T-based therapies (plasma HIV-1 RNA > or =1000 copies/ml) and analyzed to examine the association between RT mutations and phenotypic resistance to d4T. Resistance-associated mutations were analyzed from HIV-1 isolated from 85 subjects. Of these, 24 samples (28%) had TAMs, and 30 samples (35%) had either TAMs and/or the Q151M multinucleoside resistance (MNR) mutation. Phenotypic susceptibility to d4T was determined by two commercially available methods. Statistically significant increases (p < 0.001) in phenotypic fold resistance to d4T were observed in virus with at least one TAM or MNR mutation. However, the mean increases in phenotypic resistance were 4-fold for the Antivirogram assay and 3-fold for the Phenosense HIV assay, only slightly above the levels used to designate decreased susceptibility to d4T. Subjects can experience viremia on d4T-containing regimens with virus exhibiting only small increases in IC(50), suggesting that relatively small changes in viral susceptibility to d4T may influence drug efficacy.
