In total, 408 staphylococcal isolates were tested for inducible clindamycin resistance (ICR) by the disk-diffusion induction test (D-test). ICR was detected in 5.7% of 105 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates, 3.6% of 111 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates, 30.8% of 94 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) isolates, and 11.2% of 98 methicillin-sensitive CoNS isolates. All MRSA isolates that were erythromycin-resistant and clindamycin-susceptible were positive by the D-test. The same results were obtained with an azithromycin instead of an erythromycin disk. All isolates were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The cost-benefit of the d-test should be evaluated locally after determining the incidence of the different resistance phenotypes.
