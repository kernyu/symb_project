We studied 31 clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Mbandaka resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and recovered in Tunisia over a 5-year period. The transferability of this resistance was demonstrated by conjugation experiments. Thirty of the 31 isolates were positive in the double-disk synergy test. By isoelectric focusing analysis, all of the isolates were found to produce a band of beta-lactamase activity with a pI of 5.9. Three of these isolates produced an additional band with a pI of 7.6. PCR and DNA sequencing identified these beta-lactamases as TEM-4 and SHV-2a, respectively. The remaining isolate, highly resistant to ceftazidime but susceptible to cefepime, produced a beta-lactamase that focused at pI 7.8. No synergy was detected by the double-disk synergy test. Sequence analysis of the bla gene amplified by PCR showed that the plasmid-mediated AmpC-type enzyme was ACC-1a. Fingerprinting analysis by repetitive-element PCR and enterobacterial repeat intergenic consensus-PCR suggested that 29 of the 31 Salmonella serotype Mbandaka isolates belonged to the same clonal population.
