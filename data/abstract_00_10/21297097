Integrase inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, but not in the plasma of a 42-year-old man with HIV encephalopathy treated with a raltegravir (RAL)-containing regimen. Raltegravir resistance may develop in the central nervous system when the virus is already multi-drug resistant because of different penetration into cerebrospinal fluid of individual antiretroviral agents.
