OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of resistance-conferring mutations to antiretroviral drugs in previously untreated patients with chronic HIV-1 infection as a basis for French recommendations on viral genotyping before antiretroviral treatment initiation. DESIGN: Resistance mutations were sought in samples from 404 patients seen in 23 specialized centres throughout metropolitan France in 1998. METHODS: The protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of plasma virions were sequenced. Primary and secondary protease and RT gene mutations were identified from the International AIDS Society resistance testing - USA panel. RESULTS: The prevalence of patients with primary and secondary mutations were 3.7% (95% CI 1.7-5.7) and 50.3% (95% CI 45.0-55.6), respectively. The prevalence of patients with mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors was 3.3% (95% CI 1.5-5.1) and 0.8% (95% CI 0.0-1.7), respectively. The prevalence of patients with NRTI primary mutations differed according to whether seropositivity had been diagnosed more or less than one year previously (0.2 versus 2.2% P = 0.023). Primary mutations associated with protease inhibitor resistance occurred at a prevalence of 1.9% (95% CI 0.5-3.4) with no difference according to the duration of known seropositivity. CONCLUSION: In France, in 1998, the prevalence of patients with primary mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low. Genotyping before the initiation of therapy was not recommended in chronically HIV-1-infected naive patients. A national sentinel survey of resistance in this clinical setting is performed regularly to update the recommendations for resistance testing.
