BACKGROUND: Great progress has been made in antiviral treatment of HIV disease over the last few years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The paper is based on relevant literature and our own experience in the largest HIV clinic in Norway. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Generally speaking, therapy with at least three active drugs is necessary in order to obtain maximum viral suppression. It is not established what constitutes the best starting-point for therapy, or what combination of drugs is the most efficacious. Treatment should be initiated before clinical immunodeficiency develops. All patients with CD4 counts < or = 0.2 x 10(9)/l should be offered treatment. The initial regimen should be either two nucleoside-analogues and one or two protease inhibitors, or two nucleoside-analogues and efavirenz. In order to avoid resistance and treatment failure, the patient should be thoroughly informed before and during treatment about the importance of good compliance.
