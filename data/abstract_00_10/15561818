Overexpression of CDR1, an efflux pump, is one of the major mechanisms contributing to drug resistance in Candida albicans. CDR1 p-lacZ was constructed and transformed into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain so that the lacZ gene could be used as the reporter to monitor the activity of the CDR1 promoter. Overexpression of CaNDT80, the C. albicans homolog of S. cerevisiae NDT80, increases the beta-galactosidase activity of the CDR1 p-lacZ construct in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, mutations in CaNDT80 abolish the induction of CDR1 expression by antifungal agents in C. albicans. Consistently, the Candt80/Candt80 mutant is also more susceptible to antifungal drugs than the wild-type strain. Thus, the gene for CaNdt80 may be the first gene among the regulatory factors involved in drug resistance in C. albicans whose function has been identified.
