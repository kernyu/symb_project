The main objective of this study was to determine whether a chemical immunomodulation protocol could reduce the resistance of NOD/LtSz-SCID mice to Plasmodium falciparum infection and provide an improved mouse model for screening the antimalarial activity of new compounds. This model was compared with the presently used immunodeficient Beige/Nude/Xid (BNX) mouse model, using the same protocol, in terms of percentage of infected mice, parasite development, leukocyte response and phagocytosis of P. falciparum infected cells in various organs. Our results show that the combination of the chemical immune modulation protocol with the genetic background of NOD/LtSz-SCID mice results in the development of long-lasting P. falciparum infection in a high percentage of mice. A comparison of the results obtained in the histological study for both mouse models suggests that the higher rate of success in NOD/LtSz-SCID mice could be related to the reduced macrophage recruitment developed in different tissues to remove the parasite from blood.
