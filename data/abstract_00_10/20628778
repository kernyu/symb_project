An 11-year-old girl with metastatic neuroblastoma developed recurrent bacteremia during sustained neutropenia after autologous peripheral blood transplantation. All febrile episodes of bacteremia were caused by single Delftia acidovorans strain revealed by ERIC-PCR. This strain became resistant to broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins through antibiotic treatments. Removal of the indwelling vascular catheter resulted in resolution of the infection. So far as we know, this is the first report of vascular catheter-related D. acidovorans bacteremia in Japan.
