AZD2563, a novel oxazolidinone, was tested against 10 well characterized multiple-resistant strains of staphylococci and viridans group or beta-hemolytic streptococci using kill curve kinetic methods. Generally, AZD2563 demonstrated bacteriostatic action and modest concentration-dependent cidal activity against a minority of strains of both genera. When combined with gentamicin (MIC/4 concentration), rapid bactericidal action was observed against all streptococci tested, but not against the staphylococci. No enhanced activity was noted when AZD2563 was added to subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin. Linezolid used as a control, showed the same characteristics, confirming that AZD2563 possesses activity comparable to other agents in the oxazolidinone class. AZD2563 remained active (MIC, < or = 1 microg/ml) against all 10 strains tested.
