The genome of Bacillus subtilis 168 was modified to yield a genome vector for the cloning of DNA several Mb in size. Unlike contemporary plasmid-based vectors, this 4.2 Mb genome vector requires specific in vivo handling protocols because of its large size. Inversion mutagenesis, a method to modify local genome structure without gain or loss of genes, was applied intensively to the B. subtilis genome; this technique made possible both exchange and translocation of designated regions of the genome. This method not only reshuffles the genome of B. subtilis, but can provide insight into the biologic principles underlying genome plasticity.
