A novel protein kinase, Mx-interacting protein kinase (PKM), has been identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for interaction partners of human MxA, an interferon-induced GTPase with antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. A highly conserved protein kinase domain is present in the N-terminal moiety of PKM, whereas an Mx interaction domain overlaps with C-terminal PEST sequences. PKM has a molecular weight of about 127,000 and exhibits high sequence homology to members of a recently described family of homeodomain-interacting protein kinases. Recombinant PKM has serine/threonine kinase activity that is abolished by a single amino acid substitution in the ATP binding domain (K221W). PKM catalyzes autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of various cellular and viral proteins. PKM is expressed constitutively and colocalizes with the interferon-inducible Sp100 protein and murine Mx1 in discrete nuclear structures known as nuclear bodies.
