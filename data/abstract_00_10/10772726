Cl-F-ara-A, an analog of fludarabine, was evaluated against a spectrum of tumor systems in culture and in mice. The compound exhibited significant cytotoxicity against a variety of human tumor cell lines. More importantly, the compound showed selectivity in vivo, with excellent activity being demonstrated against human colon and renal tumors. Human nonsmall cell lung and prostate tumors were also sensitive in vivo to the compound, albeit at a reduced level.
