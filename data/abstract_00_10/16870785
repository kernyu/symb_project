The atpE gene encoding the subunit c of the ATP synthase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the target of the new diarylquinoline drug R207910, has been sequenced from in vitro mutants resistant to the drug. The previously reported mutation A63P and a new mutation, I66M, were found. The genetic diversity of atpE in 13 mycobacterial species was also investigated, revealing that the region involved in resistance to R207910 is conserved, except in Mycobacterium xenopi in which the highly conserved residue Ala63 is replaced by Met, a modification that may be associated with the natural resistance of M. xenopi to R207910.
