The MICs and MBCs of quinupristin/dalfopristin were determined for 22 clinical strains MRSA with inducible type of resistance to MLS-B and for 15 of their derivatives with constitutive resistance to MLS-B. For MRSA strains with inducible resistance to MLS-B the obtained results for quinupristin/ dalfopristin were: MIC50 = 0.25, MIC90 = 0.5, MBC50 = 1.0 and MBC90 = 1.0. Mutants of the same strains characterized with the following values for quinopristin/dalfopristin: MIC50 = 0.5, MIC90 = 1.5, MBC50 = 4.0 and MTC90 = 8.0.
