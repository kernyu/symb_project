OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of tetrandrine on the P170 production expressed by multi-drug resistance gene, lung resistant protein (LRP), and topoisomeras II and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. METHOD: Cellular model of multi-drug resistance was established in S180 tumor cell by means of the scheme of PFC chemotherapy at the dosage lower than that with curative effect. P170, LRP and TOPO II were measured by flow cytometry after the mouse model was treated with tetrandrine for 4 weeks. RESULT: tetrandrine obviously reduced the enhancement of express of P170, LRP and the activity of TOPO II in the tumor cells with multi-drug resistance induced by chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Tetrandrine significantly inhibits the multi-drug resistance of tumor cells induced by chemotherapy via diminishing both the expression of multi-drug resistance gene and the activity of topoisomeras II.
