The results reported herein indicate that the ultraviolet-A (UVA) radiation-induced effects in Escherichia coli depend on its growth phase. Stationary-phase cells recover faster from a sub-lethal UVA exposure and have a higher resistance to lethal effect of the radiation than exponential growing cells. Although pre-incubation in spent medium supernatant increased the resistance of log-phase cells to lethal UVA effects, this pre-treatment considerably prolonged the duration of the radioinduced sub-lethal growth delay. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect exerted by the E. coli conditioned media and evaluate the influence of nutritional stress, hydrogen peroxide and acetate. Pre-incubated in conditioned medium, cells in exponential growth phase were irradiated and the induced effects were compared with those found when catalase, high culture densities and acetate were employed. Unexpectedly, the duration of the growth delay in cells submitted to these treatments was shortened in comparison with control cells incubated in conditioned medium with no modifications. Lengthening of the growth delay was mimicked when exponentially growing cells were incubated in fresh medium supplied with 5 microM H(2)O(2). The effects of spent medium on wild type and rpoS mutant strains were similar, indicating that this response is independent of RpoS controlled functions. We assumed that an oxidative component of the spent medium, probably H(2)O(2), could be involved in the observed phenomenon. This effect is specific of E. coli and independent of rpoS.
