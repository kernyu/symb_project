The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System Laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isolated two enterococcus-like strains that were referred to the CDC Streptococcus Laboratory for further identification. The isolates were recovered from human stool samples collected on different occasions from the same individual in Portland (OR, USA) in July 2000. Conventional physiological tests distinguished these strains from all known species of enterococci. Analyses of whole-cell-protein electrophoretic profiles showed the same unique profile for the two isolates, being most similar those of Enterococcus moraviensis and Enterococcus haemoperoxidus albeit not close enough to allow conclusive inclusion in any enterococcal species. Both isolates gave positive results in tests using the AccuProbe Enterococcus genetic probe, and Lancefield extracts reacted with CDC group D antiserum. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies also revealed that these strains were closely related to the species E. moraviensis (99.6 % identity). The results of DNA-DNA relatedness experiments confirmed that these strains represented a single novel taxon. The highest level of DNA-DNA relatedness found between the novel taxon and any of the currently recognized species of Enterococcus was 32 %, for both E. moraviensis and E. haemoperoxidus. On the basis of this evidence, it is proposed that these stool isolates constitute a novel species, for which the name Enterococcus caccae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 2215-02(T) (=SS-1777(T)=ATCC BAA-1240(T)=CCUG 51564(T)).
