Peptide antibiotics, particularly lantibiotics, are good candidates for replacing antibiotics to which bacteria have become resistant. In order to compare two such lantibiotics with two antibiotics, the MICs of nisin A, mutacin B-Ny266, vancomycin, and oxacillin against various bacterial pathogens were determined. The results indicate that nisin A and mutacin B-Ny266 are as active as vancomycin and oxacillin against most of the strains tested. Furthermore, mutacin B-Ny266 remains active against strains that are resistant to nisin A, oxacillin, or vancomycin. The wide spectrum of activity of mutacin B-Ny266, its low MICs against bacterial pathogens, and its activity against bacteria resistant to other inhibitors support the development of this substance for therapeutic use.
