Intensive care units (ICUs) are high risk areas for emergence and spread of multiresistant bacterial pathogens. In Germany, there are no representative epidemiological data on antibiotic resistance, prophylactic or therapeutic use of antibiotics in ICUs, or on the correlation between antibiotic use and emergence of resistance. Supported by the German Ministry of Science and Education, project SARI (Surveillance on antibiotic use and bacterial resistance in ICUs) started in 02/2000 and now includes data on antibiotic use and resistance rates in 35 medical, surgical and interdisciplinary ICUs. To date (2/2000-12/2002), a total of 939 participant months, 339,461 patient days and 452,282 defined daily doses (DDD) have been covered with a mean antibiotic usage density (AD) of 1,332 DDDs/1,000 patient days and resistance data on 31,189 isolates from ICUs. The design of the project and first results of SARI are presented. The epidemiological data of SARI form a basis for improved antibiotic and infection control management in ICUs (http://www.sari-antibiotika.de).
