Significant increases in the prevalence of resistance to antibiotics have been observed in common pathogen of humans worldwide. The consequences of the appearance and spread of antimicrobial resistance have included increasing morbidity, mortality, and cost of health care. The increasing use of antimicrobial agents promotes the appearance and spread of bacterial resistance. Strict clinical guidelines on antibiotic prescribing and firm guidance on the optimum length of treatment is required. These strategies can be utilized as a part of a multidisciplinary approach to limit the appearance and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, in addition to, surveillance of antibiotic resistance rates both locally and nationally.
