Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is gaining importance as a community-acquired pathogen, after becoming firmly established as a nosocomial pathogen. Here we report a case of endogenous endophthalmitis due to S. maltophilia. Antibiotic-susceptibility testing of the isolate was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The organism was resistant to aminoglycosides, imipenem, ticarcillin and cotrimoxazole and was sensitive to ceftazidime and chloramphenicol. The patient was successfully treated with a sensitivity-based intravitreal antibiotic regimen.
