Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) cause resistance to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and other cephalosporins. The ESBL enzymes are most often derivatives of beta-lactamases from the TEM or SHV group. The aim of our work was to study ESBL production by 35 ceftazidime-resistant strains. We selected these strains among 335 Enterobacteriaceae, isolated in Eastern Romania from healthy carriers and patients, between january-june 1999. To identify the studied strains we used API 20E and API 32E. The ESBL production was established by using both double disk synergy test (DDT) and EXPERT computer program of miniAPI (Bio Merieux). We revealed ESBL production in 26 strains when EXPERT program was used and only 23 when DDT was used. Our results suggest that miniAPI is a better method to study ESBL production than DDT.
