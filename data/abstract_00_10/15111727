Antiretroviral therapy was focus of many of the studies reported at the 11th CROI. This year, data on new drugs, refinements in the management of treatment-naive and treatment-experienced persons, the impact of drug resistance (particularly following exposure to a single dose of nevirapine), and the growing experience with antiretrovirals in the developing world were the dominant themes. This reviews summarizes new information relevant to clinicians and clinical researchers.
