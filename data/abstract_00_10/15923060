Conservative testing revealed a stable antibiotic resistance situation for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae in 32 German intensive care units (ICUs) actively participating in the SARI (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in ICUs) project over a three-year period (2001--2003). No significant changes were shown for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (P=0.501; the MRSA rate increased in 18 ICUs and decreased in 14 ICUs). The only exception was an increase in ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli.
