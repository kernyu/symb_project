The nature of bacterial isolates from children with clinically suspected urinary tract infections (UTI) was studied. The susceptibility of urinary pathogens to selected antibiotics was determined. The results clearly show that E. coli was identified as the main causative agent of UTI children (67% of isolates). The second commonest pathogen was P. mirabilis (10%). Over half E. coli isolates were resistant to amino-penicilins but almost all isolates (over 80%) were sensitive to antimicrobial agents combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors. We found significantly high percentage (32.5%) of ESBL strains among K. pneumoniae isolates.
