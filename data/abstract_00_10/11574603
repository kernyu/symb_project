A total of 3,051 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates in Europe were compared. MRSA isolates constituted 25% of all isolates and were more prevalent in southern Europe. MRSA isolates appeared to be more prevalent in intensive care units than in outpatient departments. Only a small minority of MSSA isolates were multidrug resistant, whereas the majority of MRSA isolates were multidrug resistant.
