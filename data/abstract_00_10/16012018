We describe an HIV/HCV coinfected patient with liver cirrhosis, who experienced severe CNS side-effects during efavirenz-based HIV therapy. Plasma levels of efavirenz were 10 times the upper limit and remained elevated (at twice the upper limit) 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Efavirenz resistance (K103N) developed and was probably due to 'functional' monotherapy.
