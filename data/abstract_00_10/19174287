Mycoplasma bovis has emerged as an important pathogen of young intensively reared calves in North America. A variety of clinical diseases are associated with M bovis infections of calves, including respiratory disease, otitis media, arthritis, and some less common presentations. Clinical disease associated with M bovis often is chronic, debilitating, and poorly responsive to antimicrobial therapy. Current control measures are centered on reducing exposure to M bovis through contaminated milk or other sources, and nonspecific control measures to maximize respiratory defenses of the calf. This article focuses on the clinical and epidemiologic aspects of M bovis infections in young calves.
