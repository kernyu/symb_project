BACKGROUND/AIMS: The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been reported to be increasing. However, the recent trend of eradication rates of H. pylori using first-line triple regimens has been rarely issued. Therefore, we aimed to determine the trend of H. pylori eradication rates in single center for recent eight years. METHODS: From January 1998 through October 2005, H. pylori eradication rates in 525 patients with H. pylori-positive peptic ulcer disease who received one-week triple regimens were retrospectively evaluated according to years, regimens, and ulcer locations. RESULTS: The overall H. pylori eradication rate was 78.7%. Yearly eradication rates from the year 1998 to 2005 were 83.7%, 80.4%, 81.4%, 78.8%, 75.3%, 77.6%, 78.9% and 77.6% consecutively by per-protocol analysis, However, no definite evidence of decreasing tendency of eradication rate was seen during the past eight years (p=0.419). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the eradication rates according to the ulcer locations and regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is found that there is no definite statistical evidence of decreasing trend for H. pylori eradication rate during past eight years, those for recent 5 years were lower than 80%, which suggests that we should scrutinize the trend of first-line H. pylori eradication rate, and concern for the expected lower rates in the near future.
