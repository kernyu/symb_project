Isolates (3,845) obtained from German adults with invasive pneumococcal disease between 1992 and 2004 were investigated. Of these, 430 isolates (11.2%) were erythromycin A nonsusceptible. Macrolide resistance genotypes and multilocus sequence types were determined. Among the isolates, 35.6% were erm(B) positive and 63.5% were mef positive. Over the study period, the frequency of resistance rose significantly from 2.2 to 17.0% (P < 0.001). A serotype 14, sequence type 9 clone was the most widespread.
