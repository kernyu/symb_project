Thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, nocathiacin I, II and III, were identified in a culture of Nocardia sp. WW-12651 (ATCC 202099). They exhibit potent in vitro activity (ng/ml) against a wide spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, including multiple-drug resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multi-drug resistant Enterococcus faecium (MREF) and fully penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and demonstrate excellent in vivo efficacy in a systemic Staphylococcus aureus infection mice model.
