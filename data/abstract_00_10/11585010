The purine nucleoside analogues, either alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, are increasingly used in the treatment of patients with indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. The initial studies in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (WM) are very promising. Approximately 40% of patients who have received prior therapy with alkylating agents respond, while response rates of up to 90% have been documented in untreated patients. However, it is not known whether the purine analogues offer any significant advantage over alkylating agents such as chlorambucil. In this review the treatment options in WM and in particular the role of the purine analogues are discussed.
