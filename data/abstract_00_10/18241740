In pediatric bloodstream infections with fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsielia species, we noted an association between FQ resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production (OR, 12; 95% CI: 2.28-83.8). A case control study revealed no significant risk factors (including prior antibiotic use) for FQ resistance among ESBL E coli and Klebsiella species (ESBL-EK).
