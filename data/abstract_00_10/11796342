A genomic library from a strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B that exhibits multiple drug resistance (MDR) was constructed in Escherichia coli. Two of the recombinant plasmids, pNOR5 and pNOR5, conferred resistance only to fluoroquinolones in E. coli, whereas the third, pNCTR4, conferred the MDR phenotype. Sequence and subcloning analysis showed that it is the presence of RecA on the first two plasmids which confers resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli. A similar analysis established that the MDR phenotype conferred by pNCTR4 is due to a gene, rma (resistance to multiple antibiotics), which encodes a 13.5-kDa polypeptide. The derived sequence for Rma exhibits a high degree of similarity to those of a group of MarA-like activators that confer MDR in E. coli. A MalE-Rma fusion protein was purified to near homogeneity and was shown to interact with a DNA fragment carrying a MarA operator sequence. Furthermore, overexpression of rma in E. coli caused changes in the outer membrane protein profile that were similar to those reported for MarA. These results suggest that Rma might act as a transcriptional activator of the marA regulon.
