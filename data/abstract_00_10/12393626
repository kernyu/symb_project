We report the outcome of reduced-intensity allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation (alloPCT) for 188 patients with lymphoma from the Working Party Lymphoma of the European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). The median age of the patients was 40 years, the median number of prior treatment courses was 3, and 48% of patients had undergone a prior autologous transplantation. Eighty-four percent of the patients received conditioning with fludarabine-based regimens and 10% with the BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, melphalan) protocol. Full donor chimerism was confirmed in 71% of 100 patients assessed. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in 37% of patients and chronic GVHD in 17%. A disease response to donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) was seen in 10 of 14 patients. With a median follow-up of 283 days, the overall survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 62% and 50%, respectively. The 100-day and 1-year transplantation-related mortality (TRM) rates were 12.8% and 25.5%, respectively, and were significantly worse for older patients. The probability of disease progression at 1 year for patients with chemoresistant and chemosensitive disease were 75% and 25%, respectively (P =.001). The progression-free survival at 1 year was 46% and was significantly better for those with chemosensitive disease, Hodgkin disease (HD), and low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Patients with high-grade NHL, mantle cell lymphoma, or chemoresistant disease had a poor outcome. Reduced-intensity progenitor cell transplantation is associated with a reduced TRM and may control advanced HD and low-grade NHL. A longer period of follow-up is required to determine the benefit of DLI and the graft-versus-lymphoma effect.
