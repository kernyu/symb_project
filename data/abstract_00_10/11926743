Despite substantial advances made in controlling the effects of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, it remains the single most important pathogen in solid organ transplantation (SOT). Because CMV shares some characteristics with other human herpesviruses, it is also an important model system for understanding the actions of herpesviruses 6 and 7, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and, potentially, hepatitis C and B. As the lessons learned from HIV influenced our thinking about other viral infections (e.g. importance of viral load), so too what is learned about CMV will be applied to other herpesviruses. The pervasive nature of CMV and the common problems posed by this virus prompted the convening of a panel of experts in the field of SOT to discuss issues associated with CMV in transplant recipients. This supplement reflects the presentations and discussions at this symposium, including the clinical implications of CMV drug resistance, economic impact of CMV on transplant programs, the rationale for CMV hyperimmune globulin (CMW-IGIV, CytoGam) in SOT, antibody inhibition of CMV, hypogammaglobulinemia, role of CMV in allograft vasculopathy, and the clinical use of CytoGam therapy in a variety of SOT patients. A number of questions during the general discussion prompted the addition of other material to this Supplement, including the development of CMV-IGIV for clinical use in SOT recipients and resource utilization associated with CMV-related hospital readmissions.
