Antimicrobial resistance patterns of pathogens causing hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in Shandong Province, China were investigated using data collected from January 2002 to December 2006. A total of 10 337 isolates were characterized in sputum samples from 39 920 LRTI patients: 68.72% were Gram-negative bacteria, 20.65% were Gram-positive bacteria, and 10.62% were fungi. Organisms most frequently isolated were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.88%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.80%), Escherichia coli (10.71%), fungi (10.62%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.68%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (9.03%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against Gram-negative bacteria. Most Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to vancomycin. Susceptibility to cephalosporins was not optimal and resistance to fluoroquinolones was high. Resistance of Gram-negative bacteria showed a rapid increase over the study period, while resistance of Gram-positive bacteria remained relatively stable. The emergence of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents used against LRTI pathogens has compounded the problem of using empirical therapy and created selective pressure on physicians to use certain antibiotics.
