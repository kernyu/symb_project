The understanding of apoptotic pathways provides new insights into cancer therapy. Therapies that modulate these pathways may induce apoptosis or sensitize tumor cells to other agents. Because many of the components of these pathways are altered in tumor cells compared with normal cells, therapies that target these abnormal apoptotic proteins may be more selective than traditional cytotoxic agents. Difficulties include the translation of the knowledge of these pathways into clinical trials and monitoring the predicted biologic effects in patients. The continued study of new targets, agents capable of modulating these targets, and markers of biologic effect in patients should improve clinical results.
