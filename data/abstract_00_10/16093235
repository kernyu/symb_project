Ten Nigerian medicinal plants used traditionally for the treatment of several ailments of both microbial and non-microbial origins were tested on multi-drug resistant S. typhi (MDR) strains of which six of them were active. The results revealed that both the aqueous and ethanol extracts of Terminalia avicennioides, Momordica balsamina, Combretum paniculatum and Trema guineensis were effective on the MDR-S. typhi strains with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values ranging from 9.60 to 14 mcg/ml and 24 to 33 mcg/ml, respectively. Whereas, only the aqueous extracts of Morinda lucida and Ocimum gratissimum were found to be active against this pathogen with MIC and MBC values of 9.60 and 24 mcg/ml for M. lucida, 40 and 55 mcg/ml for O. gratissimum, respectively. There was no statistical significant difference (P > 0.05) between the activity of each plant extract and the decoctions prepared from them. All the six active plants showed positive reactions to alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids and anthraquinones but in variable degrees. All but M. balsamina, indicated the presence of saponin.
