Anidulafungin is the third echinocandin antifungal agent to receive approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration. It is indicated for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, candidemia, and other candidal infections. Anidulafungin is fungicidal against Candida species, including Candida glabrata and isolates resistant to azoles and polyenes. The drug's efficacy is comparable to that of fluconazole for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, and it is effective in patients with invasive candidiasis and candidemia. Anidulafungin is distinct among the echinocandins in that it undergoes slow, nonenzymatic chemical degradation. As a consequence, impairments in renal or hepatic function do not substantially alter its pharmacokinetics. In addition, anidulafungin has not demonstrated any drug-drug interactions because it is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Anidulafungin is well tolerated in adults and pediatric patients, with few reported adverse drug events. The safety, tolerability, and potent fungicidal activity of anidulafungin against Candida species make it a reasonable alternative in the treatment of patients with serious candidal infections.
