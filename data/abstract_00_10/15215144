The ability of four 9,10-dihydroethanoanthracene derivatives (BG920, BG932, BG958, and BG996), as well as verapamil and promethazine, to reverse chloroquine resistance was assessed against 24 chloroquine-resistant and 10 chloroquine-susceptible strains of Plasmodium falciparum from different countries. The 9,10-dihydroethanoanthracene derivatives clearly increase chloroquine susceptibility only in chloroquine-resistant isolates.
