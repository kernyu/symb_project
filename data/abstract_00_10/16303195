There has been renewed concern in recent years about the use of antibiotics in food animal production and the potential risk it may pose to public health due to transfer of antibiotic resistance factors via the food supply. Although a legitimate concern, it bears reminding that this debate is not new. It has been ongoing for decades, yet there is still no documented case of human treatment failure due to antibiotic resistant bacteria acquired from USDA-inspected meat and poultry. This fact strongly suggests that the issue is not the imminent threat as has been portrayed by certain individuals or advocacy groups. The poultry industry as a whole has been using antibiotics responsibly for several decades, and there are strong beneficial arguments for their continued use. Responsible public policy demands a science-based approach be utilized in the decision making process before attempting to restrict or remove certain products due to overestimated risks. Part of this scientific review should include antibiotic use data, however this information has definite limitations and shortcomings which need to be understood before attempting to make any valid antibiotic resistance associations.
