We describe an invasive Acremonium strictum infection in a 9-year-old debilitated bone marrow transplant recipient. Outcome was successful, despite resistance to the amphotericin B that was initially administered. A. strictum was isolated from bone and urine cultures. We summarize data on 15 opportunistic invasive infections caused by Acremonium in pediatric hosts reported thus far in the English language literature.
