BACKGROUND: Treatment of steroid-resistant (SR) primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) remains a major challenge in nephrology. A prospective study was conducted to clarify the therapeutic role of low-density lipoprotein apheresis (LDL-A) in 11 nephrotic children with SR and cyclosporine A (CsA)-resistant primary FSGS. METHODS: Based on entry criteria, all 11 eligible patients had biopsy-proven primary FSGS presenting with nephrotic syndrome (NS) and were resistant to steroid and conventional-dose CsA therapy. LDL-A was performed twice a week for 3 weeks (first course), then weekly for 6 weeks (second course). Beginning from the second LDL-A course, a dosage of 1 mg/kg/d of prednisone was administered for 6 weeks, then tapered. RESULTS: Seven patients experienced remission of NS, 5 of whom achieved complete remission within 4 weeks after initiating prednisone therapy with LDL-A. These 5 patients maintained normal renal function during follow-up (median, 4.4 years). Of 2 patients with partial remission, 1 patient maintained stable renal function during follow-up (4.5 years), whereas the other patient showed a gradual decline in renal function and progressed to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) 7.8 years after LDL-A therapy. Four patients who were considered to experience treatment failure had persistent NS and progressed to ESRF in 1.3 years (median) after LDL-A therapy. Complete remission (n = 5) was associated with significantly more highly selective proteinuria compared with treatment failure (n = 4). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that combined LDL-A and prednisone therapy can be a valuable addition to therapeutic options for treating patients with SR-FSGS. The role of LDL-A in treating these patients deserves to be assessed further in larger randomized controlled trials.
