A vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) isolated from the blood of a 46-year-old patient with endocarditis was determined to be pulsed-field type USA300, daptomycin nonsusceptible, and positive for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes. Development of the VISA phenotype does not appear limited to traditional health care strains of S. aureus.
