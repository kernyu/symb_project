The objective of the study was to investigate antimicrobial resistance, plasmids and class 1 integrons in 150 Shigella strains isolated from patients with diarrhea in Vietnam. Most isolates were resistant to the majority of antimicrobial agents used for treatment in the isolation areas and 90% were resistant to three or more antibiotics. A total of 20 strains yielded class 1 integrons, which harbored oxa1, dfrA, orfF, and aadA gene cassettes. The most common gene cassette, aadA2, was always located closest to the 3' conserved segment of the integrons and oxa1 and dfrA closest to the 5' end. Plasmid profiles of the 20 class 1 integron-positive strains all contained more than one plasmid, and 14 different profiles were found. No correlation was found between species, antibiograms, plasmid profiles, or presence of class 1 integrons. Conjugation resulted in 25 transconjugants, which all were resistant to four or more antimicrobial agents and all harbored at least one plasmid (>60 kb). Class 1 integrons were detected in 64% of the transconjugants. Phenotypic resistance pattern and plasmid profiles of the transconjugants seemed independent of the presence of an integron. Class 1 integrons seemed of less importance in phenotypic antibiograms and in transfer of resistance genes than conjugative plasmids.
