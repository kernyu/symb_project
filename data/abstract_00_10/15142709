Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a significant pathogen that primarily affects patients with co-morbid illnesses, usually malignancies, who have been hospitalized for prolonged periods and received broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. The organism has been associated with an expanding spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with high case to fatality ratios. Therapy of these infections presents a significant challenge both for the clinician and the microbiologists because of its high-level antibiotic resistance to most of the currently used agents and methodological difficulties in susceptibility testing with this organism.
