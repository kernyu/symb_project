The effect of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) on the volatilization of 17 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) from still artificial seawater has been examined. The results show that SDBS at low concentration can retard the volatilization of OCPs compared to "clean" surface. The retarding influence is more pronounced for high level of SDBS than it is for low level of SDBS. A good positive correlation between the gas-seawater partition coefficients and the measured volatilization rates of OCPs is observed. Although the SDBS films present no significant, direct resistance to transfer, the films can absorb more OCPs from the above atmosphere with respect to the "clean" surface and reduce the net volatilization flux from the still artificial seawater. The effect of the film is more pronounced for volatilization of more volatile OCPs than it is for less volatile OCPs.
