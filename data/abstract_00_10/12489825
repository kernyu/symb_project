Red wine and its constituents have been shown to stimulate endothelium-dependent and nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasorelaxation in vitro in the isolated and precontracted aortic rings. The present study investigated if this occurred in vivo in rabbits, which chronically consumed a moderate amount of red wine. N(omega)nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) and L-arginine was infused into the rabbits that consumed red wine (7 mL/kg/d), ethanol (99.5%, 0.8 mL/kg/d), or water alone for 4 weeks, and the vaso-constrictive/-dilative response was studied in the renal artery. Following treatment with L-NAME (30 mg/kg), the renal blood flow rate decreased and renal vascular resistance increased. Only in the animals consuming red wine did a subsequent administration of L-arginine (300 mg/kg) increase the renal blood flow rate and decrease the renal vascular resistance. The effects were associated with the increase in the renal NO metabolite (nitrite/nitrate, NO2(-)/NO3(-)) production rate. From the present in vivo model, it is suggested that vasorelaxation by L-arginine is through the NO pathway and that the effects observed in the animals consuming the red wine cannot be attributed to alcohol alone.
