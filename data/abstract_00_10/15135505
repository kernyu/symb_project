The aim of the study was to assess Campylobacter infections in 309 patients with acute enterocolitis, 272 patients with relapses of chronic enterocolitis, 70 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (involving Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and 31 patients with other chronic intestinal illnesses. Isolation and identification were performed conventionally. Limited agar dilution method was used for susceptibility testing of the strains. Campylobacter species were isolated in patients with acute enterocolitis (7.8%), chronic enterocolitis (6.2%), Crohn's disease (6.2%), ulcerative colitis (3.7%), and irritable bowel syndrome (8.3%). Hippurate-positive Campylobacter jejuni isolates accounted for 62.2% of Campylobacter strains. One tetracycline resistant Campylobacter upsaliensis isolate was detected from a girl with acute enterocolitis. Resistance rates to erythromycin (31.1%) and clarithromycin (22.2%) were high, whereas those to amoxicillin/clavulanate (4.4%), ampicillin/sulbactam (13.3%), tetracycline (24.4%) and ciprofloxacin (22.2%) were relatively low. Resistance to erythromycin and either tetracycline or ciprofloxacin was detected in 8.9% and 6.7%. The involvement of Campylobacter infection in relapses of chronic intestinal disorders and the susceptibility patterns of the strains strongly emphasize the role of Campylobacter as a cause of infection in this group of patients.
