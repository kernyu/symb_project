The activity of cefditoren and six other cephalosporins was tested against 250 pneumococci, including strains resistant to macrolides and quinolones. Cefditoren gave the lowest MICs, with MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of < or =0.016/0.03, 0.125/0.5 and 0.5/2.0 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant pneumococci, respectively. A time-kill study of 12 pneumococcal strains with varying drug susceptibilities showed that cefditoren, at 2 x MIC, gave 99% killing of all strains after 12 h, with 99.9% killing after 24 h. Other cephalosporins gave similar kill kinetics but at higher concentrations. Against 160 Haemophilus influenzae, cefditoren had the lowest MICs (MIC(50) and MIC(90) both < or =0.016 mg/L), irrespective of beta-lactamase production. Time-kill studies of cefditoren compared with five other oral cephalosporins showed that cefditoren, at 8 x MIC, was bactericidal against 8/9 strains and gave 90% killing of all strains at the MIC after 12 h. Activity was bactericidal (99.9% killing) after 24 h with all drugs tested. Multistep studies of four penicillin-susceptible, four penicillin-intermediate and four penicillin-resistant strains showed that cefditoren, co-amoxiclav and cefprozil did not select for resistant mutants after 50 subcultures, compared with cefuroxime and azithromycin, where resistant mutants were selected in two and nine strains, respectively. Single-step mutation studies showed that cefditoren, at the MIC, had the lowest frequency of spontaneous mutants compared with other drugs.
