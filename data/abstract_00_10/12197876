In addition to the direct sanitary damage of a terrorist attack caused by biological weapons, the consequences of the massive stockpiling and consumption of antimicrobial agents in order to treat or prevent the disease under a potential epidemic due to pathogenic bacteria must also be considered. Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis and Yersinia pestis are the bacteria most likely to be used as terrorist weapons. Tetracyclines, quinolones and aminoglycoside are the antibiotics of choice against these microorganisms. The recent terrorist attack with anthrax spores in the USA caused a substantial increase in the sales of ciprofloxacin, as thousands of citizens received antibiotic prophylaxis for either confirmed or suspected exposure to anthrax, and many others stockpiled antibiotic supplies at their homes under a panic scenario. The massive consumption of antimicrobial drugs may lead to the selection of antibiotic resistant strains, and to the appearance of undesirable side effects, such as anaphylaxis or teratogenesis. National health authorities must develop realistic protocols in order to detect, treat and prevent mass casualties caused by biological weapons. An antibiotic stockpile has to be planned and implemented, and home stockpiling of antibiotics must be strongly discouraged.
