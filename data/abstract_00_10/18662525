Treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial agent significantly decreases the bacterial burden and reduces the risk of a patient progressing to a more severe infection. When evaluating the use of antibiotics, practitioners should consider such factors as the local resistance patterns of common respiratory pathogens, the likelihood of infection with a resistant organism, and the potential for treatment failure. Recent antibiotic use is a risk factor for treatment failure. For patients with risk factors predictive of treatment failure, beta-lactams (usually in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor or a macrolide) and fluoroquinolones are most commonly recommended.
