PURPOSE: The role of polymyxin antibiotics in the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections is reviewed. SUMMARY: Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem across hospitals worldwide, especially in intensive care settings, where nosocomial infections are 5-10 times more likely to occur than on the general wards. The polymyxins, a group of basic polypeptide antibiotics, were first isolated from Bacillus species in the late 1940s and appear to have a surface detergent effect, making them active against most gram-negative organisms. Early clinical reports suggested a high rate of toxicity associated with the polymyxins, specifically nephrotoxicity (20%) and neurotoxicity (7%); thus the polymyxins had largely fallen out of favor. However, recent studies have suggested that the toxicities associated with the polymyxins may be less severe and less frequent than earlier reports. The emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms has led to a reemergence in the use of this antibiotic class. Various clinical trials that evaluated the polymyxins for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms found that these antibiotics have acceptable effectiveness and may be used if necessary. CONCLUSION: The polymyxins have become a last resort for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms. Recent studies have suggested that the frequency of polymyxin-associated nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity may not be as high as was once thought. The polymyxins seem to be effective in treating various infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms but should not be used as first-line therapy until more is known about this class of antibiotics.
