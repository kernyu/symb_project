Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined for 122 Neisseria gonorrheae isolates obtained from 400 sex workers in Jakarta, Indonesia, and susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin were found. All isolates were resistant to tetracycline. A number of the isolates demonstrated decreased susceptibilities to erythromycin (MIC >/= 1.0 microg/ml), thiamphenicol (MIC >/= 1.0 microg/ml), kanamycin (MIC >/= 16.0 microg/ml), penicillin (MIC >/= 2.0 microg/ml), gentamicin (MIC >/= 16.0 microg/ml), and norfloxacin (MIC = 0.5 microg/ml). These data showed that certain antibiotics previously used in the treatment of gonorrhea are no longer effective.
