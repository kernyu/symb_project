Selenium as a component of glutathione peroxidase may be beneficial in insulin resistance, hence potentially may modify the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether selenium can also alter high glucose (HG), advanced glycation end products (AGE), high insulin (HI) and H2O2-induced expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and P-selectin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with selenium and stimulated by HG, AGE, HI and H2O2. Selenium significantly inhibited HG, AGE, HI and H2O2-induced expression of COX-2 and P-selectin. Moreover, selenium also inhibited HG, AGE, HI and H2O2-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which indicated that the preventive effects of selenium on COX-2 and P-selectin may be associated with p38. Our results indicated that selenium supplementation can reduce HG, AGE, HI and H2O2-induced expression of COX-2 and P-selectin by inhibition of the p38 pathway.
