OBJECTIVES: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility and serotype distribution of 205 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, collected from the CSF of meningitis patients identified between 1998-2003, during sentinel meningitis surveillance in Egypt. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated against six antibiotics using disc diffusion and Etest methods. Serotyping was performed by latex agglutination and the Quellung test. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of all isolates were found to be non-susceptible to penicillin (46% intermediate, MIC range 0.12-1.0 mg/L; 3% resistant, MIC = 2.0 mg/L), and 6% of the isolates were non-susceptible to ceftriaxone (5% intermediate, MIC = 1.0 mg/L; 1.3% resistant, MIC >/= 2 mg/L). Resistance rates for tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were high (52 and 59.7%, respectively), but those for erythromycin and chloramphenicol were lower (11 and 9%, respectively). Five serotypes (6B, 1, 19A, 23F and 6A) accounted for 37% of the total isolates. Ten isolates (5%) were non-typeable. Overall, 29 and 42% of serotypes were represented in the 7- and 11-valent conjugate vaccines, respectively. However, vaccine coverage for children <2 years was 38 and 56% for the 7- and 11-valent, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to penicillin may be increasing among S. pneumoniae strains causing meningitis in Egypt, and a moderate proportion of these strains are not covered by current pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. In addition to intensifying education efforts about judicious use of antibiotics, laboratory-based surveillance for other forms of invasive pneumococcal disease, especially pneumonia, is needed before decisions can be made regarding the most effective vaccines for control of this disease in Egypt.
