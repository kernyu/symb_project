A MALDI TOF MS based minisequencing method has been developed and applied for the analysis of rifampin (RIF)- and isoniazid (INH)-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. Eight genetic markers of RIF resistance-nucleotide polymorphisms located in RRDR of rpoB gene, and three of INH resistance including codon 315 of katG gene and -8 and -15 positions of the promoter region of fabG1-inhA operon were worked out. Based on the analysis of 100 M. tuberculosis strains collected from the Moscow region in 1997-2005 we deduced that 91% of RIF-resistant and 94% of INH-resistant strains can be identified using the technique suggested. The approach is rapid, reliable and allows to reveal the drug resistance of M. tuberculosis strains within 12 h after sample isolation.
