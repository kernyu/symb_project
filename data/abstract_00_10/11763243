The waste product produced by Novo Nordisk A/S from microbial fermentations is used as agricultural fertilizer in Denmark (NovoGro) after being treated by heat and chemicals to destroy the microorganisms. The fertilizer contains DNA fragments from the genetically modified microorganisms used in industrial production. This DNA contains genes coding for the desired industrial products as well as genes used as genetic selection markers during production strain development. The antibiotic resistance markers used as genetic selection markers are chloramphenicol (Cm), kanamycin (Km) and ampicillin (Ap). The aim of the present study was to examine whether DNA and intact genes were present in NovoGro and whether horizontal transfer of DNA isolated from inactivated production strains occurred either in the laboratory or in the fields treated with NovoGro. DNA isolated from NovoGro was analysed by PCR and intact genes coding for a protease and chloramphenicol resistance were amplified. This isolated DNA was used for in vitro experiments including electroporation and transformation but no transfer of DNA to Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis was observed. The antibiotic resistance profile of the indigenous bacterial population in the fields treated with NovoGro compared with fields treated with inorganic fertilizers showed no differences. In addition, DNA isolated directly from the fields treated with NovoGro for up to 7 years was analysed by PCR and no specific production gene constructs could be detected.
