Over the past decade, the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections continues to increase. Candida albicans remains the most important pathogenic yeast. Since 1995, a novel Candida specie has been identified and named Candida dubliniensis. This specie shares many phenotypic characteristics with Candida albicans, including the ability to produce germ tubes and chlamydospores. These similarities have caused significant problems in the identification of Candida dubliniensis. A large variety of methods have been developed for the discrimination of these two species. They included the sensitivity to different stress (temperature, salinity), growth on chromogenic and specific medium and carbohydrate assimilation. However, these methods can fail to assert the identification of Candida dubliniensis, but molecular typing methods are highly reliable and can confirm the identification. However, they are too complex for routine use. The identification of this specie in routine is essential in order to further understand the epidemiology, to better define the role of Candida dubliniensis as a potential pathogen and its susceptibility to develop a resistance to the antifungal agents. So, new methods have to be developed.
