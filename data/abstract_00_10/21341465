AIM: To estimate the incidence and clinical value of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) caused by its virus genotype 1. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fourteen patients (67 men and 47 women; mean age 44.9 +/- 13.3 years) were examined. RESULTS: There were high incidence rates of metabolic syndrome (47.2%) and insulin resistance (50%), in the genesis of which the host-virus interaction is discussed. There was an independent correlation of the insulin resistance and elevated leptin levels with abdominal obesity and hepatic steatosis; however, these indicators did not correlate with the stage of fibrosis. At the same time hepatic steatosis (found in 38% of the patients) and its degree correlated with the stage of fibrosis. Thirty-four of 66 (54.5%) patients receiving antiviral therapy achieved a stable virological response. CONCLUSION: Obesity, hyperglycemia, and significant insulin resistance along with the stage of hepatic cirrhosis are independent cofactors that determine no treatment response.
