If there is a change in the biological characteristics of schistosomes associated with the development of resistance to praziquantel, this could affect the transmission and pathology of the diseases they cause. To investigate this possibility, the host-parasite relationships of five praziquantel-resistant and five praziquantel-susceptible isolates of Schistosoma mansoni were compared in Biomphalaria glabrata snails and outbred CD(1) albino mice. Whether praziquantel-resistant or -susceptible, all the laboratory-selected isolates gave similar results in B. glabrata. However, the snails infected with any of three field-collected isolates from Senegal, each of which has been shown to be praziquantel-resistant, shed fewer cercariae and survived longer than the snails infected with the drug-susceptible or laboratory-selected, drug-resistant isolates. There were no differences between isolates in terms of their infectivity to mice. However, mice infected with any of four of the five drug-resistant isolates shed more eggs in their faeces than mice carrying the drug-susceptible parasites, and mice infected with any of the resistant isolates also had larger numbers of eggs in their tissues. Although granuloma sizes were generally similar for all isolates, the praziquantel-resistant isolates may be more pathogenic in mice than the susceptible ones because of their relatively high egg productions.
