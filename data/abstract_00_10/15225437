OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between curative effect and incidence rate of the YMDD mutations of hepatitis B virus during lamivudine treatment for chronic hepatitis B patients twenty-four weeks. METHODS: 120 patients with chronic hepatitis B were treated with lamivudine (100 mg/d) over 24 weeks. The levels of serum ALT and HBV-DNA and clinical symptoms were detected at baseline and the 24th weeks after treatment. HBV-DNA YMDD mutation in 17 patients was detected by gene chips at baseline and the 24th weeks. RESULTS: (1) Beside I case of YMDD/YVDD mutation was found before lamivudine treatment, 7 mutation were found after 24 weeks treatment, 2 with pure mutation strain, one of them was YIDD mutation, and the other was YVDD mutation; 2 and 3 others were YVDD/YMDD mutations and YMDD/YVDD mutations respectively. (2) The serum ALT and HBV DNA levels of YMDD mutation group showed no significantly change compared with normal group at baseline and 24th week. CONCLUSION: The level of serum ALT and HBV DNA showed no significantly changes with the incidence of YMDD mutations at the 24 week treatment
