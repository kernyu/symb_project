Between July and October 2003, 121 clinical isolates of group A streptococci (GAS) were collected from a London hospital and characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to determine the identity and prevalence of clones circulating within this setting. A total of 39 sequence types (ST), of which 20 were represented by a single isolate, were identified. The eight most prevalent clones among the 121 GAS were ST117/emm81 (16%), ST39/emm4 (9%), ST62/emm87 (7%), ST28/emm1 (6%), ST36/emm12 (6%), ST46/emm22 (5%), ST334/emm82 (5%), and ST101/emm89 (4%). Compared to those in the MLST database (http://spyogenes.mlst.net), 12 (31%) of the 39 STs had not been previously identified, although 7 of these differed from recognized STs at only a single locus, suggesting they were closely related to previously recognized strains. Resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline was seen in 7 and 20% of isolates, respectively, with four isolates resistant to both agents. GAS strains with higher (>80) emm types accounted for 45% of GAS isolates collected during this study. Continuing GAS surveillance, using easily comparable methods, is important for detecting changes in the character of disease-causing isolates.
