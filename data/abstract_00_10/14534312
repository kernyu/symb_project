Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations by single amino acid mutations in class A beta-lactamases threatens our most potent clinical antibiotics. In TEM-1 and SHV-1, the common class A beta-lactamases, alterations at Ser-130 confer resistance to inactivation by the beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid, and tazobactam. By using site-saturation mutagenesis, we sought to determine the amino acid substitutions at Ser-130 in SHV-1 beta-lactamase that result in resistance to these inhibitors. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that ampicillin and ampicillin/clavulanic acid resistance was observed only for the S130G beta-lactamase expressed in Escherichia coli. Kinetic analysis of the S130G beta-lactamase demonstrated a significant elevation in apparent Km and a reduction in kcat/Km for ampicillin. Marked increases in the dissociation constant for the preacylation complex, KI, of clavulanic acid (SHV-1, 0.14 microm; S130G, 46.5 microm) and tazobactam (SHV-1, 0.07 microm; S130G, 4.2 microm) were observed. In contrast, the k(inact)s of S130G and SHV-1 differed by only 17% for clavulanic acid and 40% for tazobactam. Progressive inactivation studies showed that the inhibitor to enzyme ratios required to inactivate SHV-1 and S130G were similar. Our observations demonstrate that enzymatic activity is preserved despite amino acid substitutions that significantly alter the apparent affinity of the active site for beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors. These results underscore the mechanistic versatility of class A beta-lactamases and have implications for the design of novel beta-lactamase inhibitors.
