RpoE2 is an extracytoplasmic sigma factor produced by Sinorhizobium meliloti during stationary growth phase. Its inactivation affected the synthesis of the superoxide dismutase, SodC, and catalase, KatC. The absence of SodC within the cell did not result in an increased sensitivity to extracellular superoxides. In contrast, the absence of KatC affected the resistance of S. meliloti to H(2)O(2) during the stationary growth phase. A katC strain behaved as an rpoE2 strain during an H(2)O(2) challenge, suggesting that the H(2)O(2) sensitivity of the rpoE2 strain resulted only from the lack of KatC in this strain.
