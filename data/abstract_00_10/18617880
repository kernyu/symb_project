Osteomyelitis is a relatively frequent bacterial infection of the jaw bones. This report describes a case of mandibular osteomyelitis in a surgical site after enucleation of a follicular cyst and extraction of the associated tooth. This case is unusual because maxillary osteomyelitis generally results from polymicrobial infection. In our patient, however, laboratory analysis identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the etiologic agent, an opportunistic pathogen normally found on moist surfaces and vegetation. Notorious for its antibiotic multiresistance, P. aeruginosa is increasingly recognized as a serious problem in hospitalized patients. Isolation of the responsible microbe permitted specific antibiotic treatment with a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin (250 mg/12 h), which fully cleared the infection.
