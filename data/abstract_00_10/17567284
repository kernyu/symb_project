Because the molecular mechanism of amoxicillin resistance in Helicobacter pylori seems to be partially explained by several mutational changes in the pbp1A gene, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the gene expression pattern in response to amoxicillin in the Amx(R) Hardenberg strain using RNA arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP-PCR). In the experiments, c. 100 differentially expressed RAP-PCR products were identified using five arbitrary primers. The cDNAs that presented the highest levels of induction or repression were cloned and sequenced, and the sequences were compared with those present in databases using the blast search algorithm. The differential expression of the isolated cDNAs was confirmed by real-time PCR. The preliminary results showed that amoxicillin alters the expression of five cDNAs involved in biosynthesis, two involved with pathogenesis, four related to cell envelope formation, two involved in cellular processes, three related with transport and binding proteins, one involved with protein degradation, one involved with energy metabolism and seven hypothetical proteins. Further analysis of these cDNAs will allow a better comprehension of both the molecular mechanism(s) of amoxicillin resistance and the adaptative mechanism(s) used by H. pylori in the presence of this antibiotic.
