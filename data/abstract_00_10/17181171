Coruscanone A, a plant-derived cyclopentenedione derivative, showed potent in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans comparable to amphotericin B and fluconazole. A series of analogues have been synthesized by modification of the cyclopentenedione ring, the enolic methoxy functionality, and the side chain styryl moiety of this natural product lead. A structurally close 1,4-benzoquinone analogue was also prepared. All the compounds were examined for their in vitro activity against major opportunistic fungal pathogens including C. albicans, C. neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus and fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains, with several analogues demonstrating potent antifungal activity. Structure-activity relationship studies indicate that the 2-methoxymethylenecyclopent-4-ene-1,3-dione structural moiety is the pharmacophore responsible for the antifungal activity of this class of compounds while the side chain styryl-like moiety plays an important complementary role, presumably contributing to target binding.
