Human plasma PAF-AH (platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase) is a Ca(2)+-independent phospholipase A2 of hematopoietic origin associated with LDL and HDL; it degrades PAF and oxidizes phospholipids. We show that human macrophages synthesize PAF-AH as a premedial Golgi precursor containing high mannose N-linked glycans. Secreted PAF-AH possesses a molecular mass of approximately 55 kDa and contains mature N-linked glycans. Secreted PAF-AH activity (90 +/- 4% of the total) bound to a wheat germ lectin column and could be eluted with N-acetylglucosamine, whereas digestion with N-acetylneuraminidase II completely abolished enzyme absorption. Tunicamycin significantly reduced cell-associated PAF-AH activity and inhibited enzyme secretion; but it did not alter the ratio of secreted to cell-associated enzyme (1.8 at 6 h and 3.1 at 24 h), suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for PAF-AH secretion. Digestion of cell-associated PAF-AH or secreted PAF-AH with peptide N-glycosidase F affected neither catalytic activity nor its resistance to proteolysis with trypsin or proteinase K; in addition, it did not affect PAF-AH association with LDL, but significantly increased its association with HDL. We suggest that macrophage-derived PAF-AH contains heterogeneous asparagine-conjugated sugar chain(s) involving sialic acid, which hinders its association with HDL but does not influence the secretion, catalytic activity, or resistance of PAF-AH to proteases.
