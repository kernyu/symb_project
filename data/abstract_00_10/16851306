A study of protein resistance of oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG), HS(CH2)11(OCH2CH2)nOH (n = 2, 4, and 6), self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au(111) surfaces is presented here. Hydroxyl-terminated OEG-SAMs are chosen to avoid the hydrophobic effect observed with methyl-terminated OEG-SAMs, particularly at high packing densities. The structure of the OEG-SAM surfaces is controlled by adjusting the assembly solvent. These SAMs were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Protein adsorption on these surfaces was investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). OEG-SAMs assembled from mixed ethanol and water solutions show higher packing density on gold than those from pure ethanol solution. For EG2OH- and EG4OH-SAMs, proteins (i.e., fibrinogen and lysozyme) adsorb more on the densely packed SAMs prepared from mixed ethanol and water solutions, while EG6OH-SAMs generally resist protein adsorption regardless of the assembly solvent used.
