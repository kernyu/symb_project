OBJECTIVES: To determine the degree of bacterial susceptibility to the most commonly used drugs for respiratory infections in Norway, and to find if bacterial resistance is emerging. METHODS: Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and group A streptococci from respiratory tract specimens and from the eye were collected from different parts of Norway during two study periods. During the first period (1993-1994), three laboratories, covering 15% of the Norwegian population, participated. During the second study period in 1997, five laboratories, covering 27% of the population, collected respiratory isolates. In total, 494 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 696 isolates of H. influenzae and 694 isolates of group A streptococci were included in the study. The study population comprised children and adults attending hospital and general practice. Bacterial susceptibility was determined by the E test, and breakpoints were according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial resistance was low, and we observed no significant increase in bacterial resistance between the two study periods. In 1997, only 0.6% of pneumococci had decreased susceptibility to penicillin, 1.6% of group A streptococci were resistant to erythromycin, and 6.7% of all isolates of H. influenzae produced beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens in Norway is low.
