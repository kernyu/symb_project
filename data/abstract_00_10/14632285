A 3.5-kb DNA fragment that confers resistance to D-cycloserine (DCS) was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of a DCS-producing Streptomyces garyphalus into Streptomyces lividans by a shot-gun cloning technique. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the existence of four open reading frames (ORFs B, C, D, and E), together with two incomplete ORFs, A and F. By introduction of the cloned fragment into Escherichia coli, the host obtained resistance to DCS. We showed that ORF B, which consists of 903 bp, is a DCS resistance gene. The hydropathy plot analysis of a protein deduced from ORF B revealed that the protein carries membrane-integral domains spanning the membrane 10 times, which suggests that the DCS-resistance determinant may be a factor associated with DCS transport.
