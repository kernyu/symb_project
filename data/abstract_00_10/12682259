BALB/c are genetically resistant to development of toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) when infected with Toxoplasma gondii, whereas CBA/Ca mice are susceptible. We compared TCR Vbeta chain usage in lymphocytes infiltrated into brains between these animals following infection. TCR Vbeta8(+) cells were the most frequent T cell population in brains of infected, resistant BALB/c mice, whereas TCR Vbeta6(+) T cells were more prevalent than Vbeta8(+) T cells in brains of infected, susceptible CBA/Ca mice. Adoptive transfer of Vbeta8(+) immune T cells, obtained from infected BALB/c mice, prevented development of TE and mortality in infected athymic nude mice that lack T cells. In contrast, adoptive transfer of Vbeta6(+) immune T cells did not prevent development of TE or mortality in the nude mice. The protective activity of Vbeta8(+) immune T cells was greater than that of the total Vbeta8(-) population. In addition, Vbeta8(+) immune T cells produced markedly greater amounts of IFN-gamma than did the Vbeta8(-) population after stimulation with tachyzoite lysate Ags in vitro. Thus, Vbeta8(+) T cells appear to play a crucial role in the genetic resistance of BALB/c mice against development of TE.
