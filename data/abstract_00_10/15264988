Gastroenteritis, caused by Salmonella spp. is usually a self-limiting infection and does not require treatment. However, in some immunosuppressed patients (such as the newborn, the elderly, those with AIDS or neoplasms), there is a greater risk of developing a severe systemic infection, and in these cases, antibiotic treatment is recommended. Third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are the most useful antibiotics in the treatment of these infections, although resistant strains are sometimes isolated. Therapeutic failures have been reported with fluoroquinolones in extra-intestinal infections caused by nalidixic acid resistant strains.
