Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have two types of lysozyme. Type II lysozyme differs from type I by only one amino acid, but only type II lysozyme has significant bactericidal activity. Due to this novel antibacterial property, lysozyme type II appears to be a candidate gene for enhancing disease resistance in fish as well as livestock species. Using polymerase chain reaction the lysozyme type II gene was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from rainbow trout. Two amplified fragments of 2041 and 2589 bp were observed. Sequencing revealed both amplicons were lysozyme genes having nearly identical nucleotide sequences, except the longer fragment has 548 base pairs inserted in intron 2 at nucleotide position 513 and a few point mutations within intron 2. Both versions of trout lysozyme type II gene were comprised of four exons and three introns. We also demonstrated that trout lysozyme is most likely encoded by these two different genes.
