We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the 27.8-kb R-plasmid pTET3 from Corynebacterium glutamicum LP-6 which encodes streptomycin, spectinomycin, and tetracycline resistance. The antibiotic resistance determinant of pTET3 comprises an intI1-like gene, which was truncated by the insertion sequence IS6100, and the novel aminoglycoside adenyltransferase gene cassette aadA9. The deduced AADA9 protein showed 61% identity and 71% similarity to AADA6 of integron In51 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, pTET3 carries the novel repressor-regulated tetracycline resistance determinant Tet 33 which revealed amino acid sequence homology to group 1 tetracycline efflux systems. The highest level of similarity was observed to the tetracycline efflux protein TetA(Z) from the C. glutamicum plasmid pAG1 with 65% identical and 77% similar amino acids. Each antibiotic resistance region of pTET3 is flanked by identical copies of the widespread insertion sequence IS6100 initially identified in Mycobacterium fortuitum. Transposition assays with a cloned copy of IS6100 revealed that this element is transpositionally active in C. glutamicum. These data suggest a central role of IS6100 in the evolutionary history of pTET3 by mediating the cointegrative assembly of resistance gene-carrying DNA segments.
