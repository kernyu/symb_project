In mating experiments, the erythromycin resistance methylase gene erm(A) was successfully transferred from erm(A)-positive clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes to macrolide-susceptible recipients of S. pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria innocua. Compared with the SmaI macrorestriction pattern of the S. pyogenes recipient, the patterns of S. pyogenes transconjugants shared the lack of a fragment and the appearance of a new, larger fragment. This is the first experimental evidence that the erm(A) gene can be transferred from erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes to macrolide-susceptible S. pyogenes as well as to other Gram-positive recipients.
