OBJECTIVE: This study had for aim to compare antibiotic resistance of 332 Salmonella enterica strains identified in human samples in the course of infections, in Lome. DESIGN: The strains were collected over two periods: 1998-2002 (N=168) and 2003-2004 (N=164). The antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by disk diffusion assay. RESULTS: The main serotypes identified were 147 Salmonella Typhi (44.3%), 97 Salmonella Typhimurium (29.2%), and 74 Salmonella Enteritidis (22.3%). The proportions of strains resistant to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazol, and amoxicillin (first line antibiotics) varied respectively from 33, 46, and 57% in 1998-2002 to 73, 79, and 82% in 2003-2004 (P<0.0001). The percentage of resistance to ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone was inferior to 10%. CONCLUSION: Fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins have become the first line antibiotics for the treatment of Salmonella in Lome (Togo).
