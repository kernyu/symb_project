Cross-resistance among Candida albicans isolates from the oropharynges of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients (n = 16) and environmental yeast strains of various species (n = 54) to medical and agricultural azole drugs was observed. Precautions against the unnecessary widespread use of azoles in the environment and human medicine are strongly recommended to prevent patients from acquiring azole-resistant yeasts.
