Blue green microalgae have been identified as one of the promising groups of organism from which biochemically active natural products have been isolated. Aqueous and organic extracts of nine blue green microalgae strains were screened against in vitro generated vancomycin intermediate resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) strains. Aqueous extracts of all the blue green microalgae cultures were found to be inactive, while all the organic (hexane, chloroform and methanolic) extracts of Anabaena virabilis and Anabaena sp. showed activity against VISA strains with MIC of 32-64 mug/ml.
