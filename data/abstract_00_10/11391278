Outbreaks of gram-negative colonization (generally by antibiotic-resistant enterobacteria) are common in newborn intensive care units (NICUs), and control methods are not always effective. We studied the effectiveness of an alcohol solution of N-duopropenide (NDP) in vivo (germicidal effect on flora of teams in the NICU and the pediatric intensive care unit vs handwashing with nonantiseptic soap) and its effect on the control of a multiresistant (MR) Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak in our NICU that had persisted for 13 months, despite the use of classic control measures. For educational purposes, we also performed 4 prevalence studies of microbial hand flora in NICU staff (two before and two after introducing NDP). The alcohol solution of NDP was highly germicidal in vivo, destroying microorganisms better than classic handwashing on the hands of 69 health care staff of our NICU and PICU. The flora in both units was reduced from an average of 63% to an average of 95%. Application of this disinfectant to the hands of health care workers after handling newborns helped to eliminate the MR Klebsiella strain in our NICU, (relative risk compared with the period preceding use of the disinfectant: 8.6, with 95% confidence intervals, 4.8-145.5). Four prevalence studies of hand microbial contamination, before and after NDP introduction in the NICU, showed a significant reduction of enterobacteriaceae, mainly MR K pneumoniae, in health care workers. In conclusion, NDP in alcohol was very effective in vivo. It proved to be a useful complementary measure to handwashing and reduced exogenous microorganism transmission in a unit with a heavy patient-care workload.
