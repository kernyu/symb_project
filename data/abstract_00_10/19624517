Seventy-five clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile from Shanghai and 80 from Stockholm were investigated. The prevalence of toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive isolates of C. difficile among isolates from Shanghai (33.3%) was significantly higher than among isolates from Stockholm (0%). Both sets of isolates were fully susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. However, the MICs of fluoroquinolones, erythromycin-clindamycin, tetracycline, rifampin and fusidic acid were significantly higher for the Shanghai isolates than for the Stockholm isolates. Thirty-three PCR ribotypes were identified; a dominant clone, 017, accounted for 18.7% of Shanghai isolates, whereas clone 005 dominated among Stockholm isolates, accounting for 11.3%. Strains 027 and 078 were not detected. No outbreak occurred during the study period.
