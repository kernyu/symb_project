A series of 1-aminopropan-2-ols were synthesized and evaluated against two strains of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum FCR3 (chloroquine-resistant) and 3D7 (chloroquine-sensitive). Microwave-assisted ring opening of epoxides (aryl and alkyl glycidyl ethers, glycidol, epichlorohydrin) with various amines without catalysts generated the desired library of beta-amino alcohols rapidly and efficiently. Most of the compounds showed micromolar potency against malaria, with seven of them having IC50 values between 1 and 10 microM against both Plasmodium falciparum strains.
