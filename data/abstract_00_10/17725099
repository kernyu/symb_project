One of the major obstacles related to chemotherapy is resistance against anticancer drugs, including Adriamycin (ADM). The purpose of the present work is to investigate the reversal effects on ADM resistance by hyperthermia (42.5 degrees C) combined with two reversal agents (Interferon alpha and Verapamil) in MCF-7/ADR (ADM-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cell line), and its relevant molecular mechanism of action. The cell survival rate and ADM IC50 of different experiment groups were measured by MTT test. The quantitative expression of MDR1 gene in cells was detected by Real-time PCR, and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on the cells surface and the intracellular ADM accumulation was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The ADM IC50 of the MCF-7/ADR cells decreased 830-fold after combined with Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and Verapamil (VRP). Although there was no distinction in the mRNA expression of MDR1, the P-gp on the MCF-7/ADR cell membrane was significantly reduced and the cellular ADM uptake increased markedly as compared to pretreatment. Our results suggeste that hyperthermia induces a considerably reversal activity against ADM resistance synergizing other reversal agents (IFN-alpha and VRP). The reversal mechanism needs further study. However, these features of hyperthermia may be exploited in clinical cancer chemotherapy.
