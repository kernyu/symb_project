Optimal empiric therapy of CAP is with appropriate monotherapy (e.g., doxycycline, levofloxacin). Combination therapy is problematic because of potential side effects and high cost. Empiric coverage should have a high degree of activity against both typical and atypical pathogens. The antibiotic selected should have an excellent side-effect profile and be relatively inexpensive. Clinicians should be selective in their choice of antibiotic for CAP and choose an antimicrobial that has little or no resistance potential, is relatively inexpensive, and permits i.v.-to-PO switch monotherapy.
