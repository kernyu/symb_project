Understanding the mechanism of the M2 proton channel of influenza A is crucially important to both basic research and drug discovery. Recently, the structure was determined independently by high-resolution NMR and X-ray crystallography. However, the two studies lead to completely different drug-binding mechanisms: the X-ray structure shows the drug blocking the pore from inside; whereas the NMR structure shows the drug inhibiting the channel from outside by an allosteric mechanism. Which one of the two is correct? To address this problem, we conducted an in-depth computational analysis. The conclusions drawn from various aspects, such as energetics, the channel-gating dynamic process, the pK(a) shift and its impact on the channel, and the consistency with the previous functional studies, among others, are all in favour to the allosteric mechanism revealed by the NMR structure. The findings reported here may stimulate and encourage new strategies for developing effective drugs against influenza A, particularly in dealing with the drug-resistant problems.
