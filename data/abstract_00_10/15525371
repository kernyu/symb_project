During 2000-2002 the National Veterinary Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (NRL-Salm) in Germany typed 11,911 isolates from animals, food, feed and the environment. All of them were tested for their susceptibility to 17 anti-microbial agents. Sixty-three per cent of all isolates were resistant and 40% were multiresistant (resistant against more than one anti-microbial). This general resistance level was strongly influenced by those specific serotypes which dominate the Salmonella epidemiology in Germany. Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 isolates from pig and cattle, and their resulting food products, were multiresistant in 98 and 94% of the cases respectively. During the period 2000-2003 an increasing quinolone resistance especially in Salmonella isolates from poultry and poultry meat (to 26%) and in S. Paratyphi B D-tartrate positive isolates (to 64%) could be observed. This increase was accompanied by a shift towards higher minimal inhibitory concentrations for ciprofloxacin.
