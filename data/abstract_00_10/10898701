One hundred eighty Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from children at a pediatric hospital in Singapore from 1997 to 1999 were serotyped and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined. Sixty-three percent of the isolates were resistant to penicillin. Significantly large numbers of the strains investigated were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (87.8%), tetracycline (71.7%), erythromycin (67.8%), and chloramphenicol (40%). Penicillin and multidrug resistance was mostly associated with the frequently isolated S. pneumoniae isolates of serotypes (serotypes 19F, 23F, 6B, and 14). Isolates of serotype 19F, the serotype most commonly encountered in Singapore (41.1%), had the highest prevalence of penicillin (78.4%) and multidrug resistance (94.6%). Most of the invasive S. pneumoniae isolates (8 of 17; 47. 1%) were of serotype 14.
