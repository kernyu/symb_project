Anthelmintic resistance is widely distributed in small ruminants throughout the world. The extension of resistance seems lower in southern European countries and has not been reported previously in Italy. In the present study, resistance to benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin was evaluated in a multi-breed goat farm of southern Italy. The farm had a history of repeated goat introductions from other flocks and a moderate regimen of anthelmintic treatments using alternatively the three above-mentioned drugs. Resistance of gastrointestinal strongyles was studied on the basis of faecal egg counts, egg hatch assay and necropsies. Resistance to anthelmintics was evidenced for benzimidazoles only, and Trichostrongylus colubriformis was the only resistant strongyle species. Single drug and single species resistance suggest that resistance is on its beginning and that measures for reducing the spread of resistance are of interest and should be promoted.
