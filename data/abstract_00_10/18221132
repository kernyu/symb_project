Tuberculosis (TB) is an important public health problem worldwide due to AIDS epidemic, the advent of multidrug resistant strains (MDR) and the lack of new drugs in the market. TB is responsible for almost 3 millions deaths each year. According to WHO (World Health Organization), which declared tuberculosis a global health emergency in 1993, tuberculosis, without a coordinated control effort, will infect an estimated 1 billion people by 2020, killing 70 million. In spite of this problem, there is a lack of development of new TB drugs. For example, it has been nearly 35 years since the introduction of a new class of compounds for the treatment of TB. Thus, there is an urgent need for new drugs to fight against this disease. Considering that, this review aims promising drug candidates that are in development against TB.
