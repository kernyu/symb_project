A review of the literature suggests that the major neurologic symptom complex of infection by Bacillus anthracis is a fulminant and rapidly fatal hemorrhagic meningoencephalitis and that the reported initial mode of entry can be via the cutaneous or inhalation route. For febrile patients with acute neurologic deterioration with associated findings of dark necrotic pustules on the extremities, gram-positive rods in the cerebrospinal fluid, and multifocal areas of unexplained intracerebral hemorrhage on computed tomographic scans, anthrax should be considered within the differential diagnosis. A low cerebrospinal fluid glucose level has been reported, with gram-positive rods often noted on the gram stain of the cerebrospinal fluid in severely affected patients. Reports indicate that death usually occurs within a week.
