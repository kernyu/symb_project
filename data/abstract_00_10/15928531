In Part 1 of this three-part series, an overview of how antimicrobials, the "silver bullets" of modern medicine, are designed to target specific agents of infection was given. The worldwide concern regarding antimicrobial resistance and the need for a more judicious approach to using antimicrobials was addressed. In this section, the focus is on those specific antimicrobial agents used to fight bacterial infections. Discussion addresses bacterial cell wall inhibitors (penicillins and cephalosporins), protein synthesis inhibitors (macrolides, tetracyclines, and aminoglycosides), and nucleic acid inhibitors (sulfonamides and quinolones). Examples of agents in each class are identified, with a look at the specific use, action, and potential for adverse effects. A general overview of patient teaching for antibacterial use is included.
