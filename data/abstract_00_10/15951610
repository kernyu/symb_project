AIM: To investigate the efficacy of lamivudine therapy in children with chronic hepatitis B who did not respond to interferon therapy in the past. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty four children aged 7-16 were given lamivudine for 12 months. Because of replication of HBV, 21 children were treated for the next 12 months (up to 24 months). Lamivudine was given in the dose 3-5 mg/kg per day (maximum 100 mg). Normalisation of aminotransferase, seroconversion HBe/anti-HBe and HBV DNA clearance were recognized as effective or promising prognosis of treatment. RESULTS: The response rate was 24% (8/34) and 29% (6/21) after 12 and 24 months respectively. In the first year of therapy the most significant was normalisation of aminotransferase, in the second year, seroconversion HBe/anti-HBe. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Lamivudine was effective in treatment of children with chronic hepatitis B, who did not respond to interferon alfa in the past. 2. Effectiveness of Lamivudine in longer period of treatment was increased from 24% at 12 months to 29% at 24 months. 3. Treatment of more than 12 months in children with replication hepatitis B virus, but initially normal aminotransferase, could cause Lamivudine resistance.
