PURPOSE: The chemistry, pharmacology, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety in humans, and formulary considerations of doripenem are reviewed. SUMMARY: Doripenem, a member of the beta-lactam class of antibiotics, is the newest addition to the carbapenems. It exhibits concentration-independent bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria; enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains; and anaerobic pathogens. Doripenem was found to be noninferior to meropenem in the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections and noninferior to levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis and was granted marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administration for these two indications. Doripenem was also found to be noninferior to imipenem in the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia and noninferior to piperacillin-tazobactam in the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia. It has a favorable safety profile, with gastrointestinal complaints and headache being the most common adverse effects and allergic reactions the most serious adverse effects. Doripenem has a relatively low potential to induce seizures. The only known clinically relevant drug interaction is that coadministration with valproic acid may result in reductions of valproic acid serum concentrations. As with most renally eliminated antibiotics, the dose of doripenem should be adjusted according to kidney function. CONCLUSION: Doripenem is an injectable carbapenem antibiotic with a spectrum of activity comparable to that of imipenem and meropenem. Its safety is similar to that of other carbapenems.
