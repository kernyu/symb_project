BACKGROUND: Lincomycin (LIN) is an antibiotic widely used in veterinary medicine to cure infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Although the toxicity of LIN is not serious, it will cause adverse effects in humans, such as pseudomembranous enteritis and bacterial resistance. In this study, for the preparation of a LIN derivative, a novel modification method was adopted. The LIN derivative modified at 2-position with a carboxylic group at the end of the spacer was synthesised and coupled to carrier proteins. A LIN polyclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed and characterised. RESULTS: The ELISA standard curve was constructed with concentrations of 0.1-1000 ng mL(-1). The IC(50) value for nine standard curves was in the range 23.7-29.3 ng mL(-1) and the limit of detection at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was 0.15-0.98 ng mL(-1). The cross-reactivity value of the LIN antibody with clindamycin hydrochloride, a homologue of LIN with similar molecular structure, was 18.9%, while less than 0.1% cross-reactivity was found with seven other compounds. For LIN-spiked food samples, the recoveries and relative standard deviation (RSD) were 76.6-117.6% and 1.7-34.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed ELISA can be utilised as a sensitive and specific analytical tool for the detection of LIN in food samples.
