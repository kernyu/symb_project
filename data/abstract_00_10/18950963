Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) have become the most frequently isolated organisms from bovine intramammary infections in recent years. While antimicrobial resistance (AR) is not considered a major problem among mastitis pathogens, concerns over emerging AR in general are increasing worldwide. Little information exists about the association between AR and one of the most common mastitis control measures, antibiotic dry cow therapy. The primary objective of the current study was to determine the prevalence of AR in CNS isolated before and after antimicrobial dry cow therapy. An additional objective was to genotypically characterize selected CNS isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), to assess diversity and persistence of organisms over the dry period. Resistance against 10 antimicrobials was determined using a broth microdilution method and compared between CNS isolates collected at dry-off and at calving and from cows treated or not treated with intramammary antimicrobial products at dry-off (752 cows in total). Results suggested that increasing age of a cow and dry cow treatment when combined with high milk somatic cell count at dry-off and positive clinical mastitis history, were associated with increased AR to most beta-lactam antimicrobials and sulfadimethoxine. PFGE results suggested considerable diversity among the tested isolates as well as some clusters within cows and herds. PFGE would be useful in distinguishing between potentially persisting infections and cures and reinfections with different CNS strains.
