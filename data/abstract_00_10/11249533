The global challenge of optimally treating bacterial infections is continuously evolving. Azithromycin, the first azalide antibiotic, presents pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that allow for a simple dosing regimen with minimal side effects. Current azithromycin uses include a variety of community-acquired respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue, and sexually transmitted disease infections. Azithromycin has also demonstrated substantial activity against atypical organisms such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and Chlamydia trachomatis. Due to a never-ending need for new antibiotic therapies, several other potential indications for azithromycin are being researched. This article will present various current research associated with azithromycin's potential use for malaria, trachoma, coronary artery disease (CAD), Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, erythema migrans, short-term therapy for respiratory infections, typhoid, cryptosporidiosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, acne, Mediterranean spotted fever and MAC. As bacterial and parasite resistance patterns fluctuate globally, azithromycin may be an alternative therapy for the previously mentioned indications, which will also enhance patient compliance and therefore effectively eradicate infection worldwide.
