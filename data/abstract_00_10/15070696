Circumvention of chemoresistance in the B-cell neoplasm multiple myeloma (MM) might be achieved by targeting certain intracellular signaling pathways crucial for survival of the malignant clone. The use of the macrolide rapamycin, selectively inhibiting the phosphoprotein mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream of, for example, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), possibly represents such a molecular mode of therapy. By using a panel of MM cell lines we showed that rapamycin induced G0/G1 arrest, an effect being associated with an increase of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and a decrease of cyclins D2 and D3. Interestingly, in primary, mainly noncycling MM cells, rapamycin, at clinically achievable concentrations, induced apoptosis. More important, rapamycin sensitized both MM cell lines and primary MM cells to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. This effect was associated with a decreased expression of cyclin D2 and survivin. The phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase p70S6K at Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424 was down-regulated by rapamycin and/or dexamethasone. Strikingly, the combinatorial treatment with rapamycin and dexamethasone suppressed the antiapoptotic effects of exogenously added IGF-I and interleukin 6 (IL-6) as well as their stimulation of p70S6K phosphorylation. The induction of apoptosis by rapamycin and dexamethasone despite the presence of survival factors was also demonstrated in primary MM cells, thus suggesting this drug combination to be active also in vivo.
