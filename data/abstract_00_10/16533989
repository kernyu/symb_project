Two hundred and fifty-one unique patient isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (123), Escherichia coli (114), Klebsiella oxytoca (7), Enterobacter cloacae (5) and Citrobacter freundii (2), flagged as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive by the Vitek system (GNS-526 card), were collected. These strains were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens submitted to the clinical bacteriology laboratories of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE), Edinburgh, UK (and associated GP practices), Hairmyers Hospital, Glasgow, UK, and the Amiri and Farwania Hospitals, Kuwait. Of the 101 RIE strains tested, 15 E. coli strains were found to be ESBL negative by Etest ESBL strips. On retesting the 15 E. coli strains with the Vitek GNS-532 card, 14 were found to be ESBL negative, despite being originally flagged as ESBL positive. The remaining 236 ESBL-producing strains were also subjected to the double disc-diffusion (DDD) technique for the detection of ESBLs. Of these, two were false negatives by Etest ESBL test strips (using both cefotaxime and ceftazidime strips), and 38 were false negatives by the DDD method. The Etest false-negative ESBL-producing strains of K. pneumoniae were positive by DDD. Technically, the Vitek method was the least demanding method to perform, as it was an integral part of the routine susceptibility test card. Etest strips were reliable, but were the most expensive of all the techniques used. The DDD test, while relatively inexpensive, was technically subjective, and in our hands, seven of the ESBL-positive strains that were confirmed by the other two techniques were not detected. Despite the false-positive ESBL-producing E. coli strains, the Vitek susceptibility card with its integral ESBL test offers the clinical laboratory a valuable and quick option to screen for ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli as part of the routine laboratory methodology.
