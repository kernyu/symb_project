We have observed a high incidence of isolated nalidixic acid resistance in Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis isolates in Ireland, particularly isolates of phage type 1 (PT1). A group of nalidixic acid-resistant (n = 22) and nalidixic acid-susceptible (n = 28) isolates of serovar Enteritidis from multiple sites in Ireland were selected. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with XbaI, and the MICs for nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin were determined. Mutations associated with nalidixic acid resistance in clinical isolates and laboratory mutants of serovar Enteritidis and 32 nalidixic acid-resistant isolates of 15 other salmonella serovars were identified. PFGE had limited discriminatory power. A specific point mutation (G246T) associated with amino acid substitution Asp87Tyr in the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrA gene accounted for 95% of all mutations in serovar Enteritidis and for all mutations in PT1 isolates. Greater diversity of mutations was observed among all non-Enteritidis salmonella serovars studied. Rates of nalidixic acid resistance in serovar Enteritidis may predominantly reflect clonal expansion after infrequent mutation or selection events.
