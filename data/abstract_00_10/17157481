Analysis of the in vitro activity of imipenem and 13 other antibiotics against 2485 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates obtained from clinical specimens from children hospitalized during 1993-2002 was performed. In 2002, the percentage of P. aeruginosa isolates susceptible to all tested antibiotics, with the exception of imipenem, increased or remained on nearly the same level as in 1993. An increase of resistance to imipenem from 4.3% to 18.3% was observed. The MIC(90) value of imipenem increased from 2mg/L to 16 mg/L. Simultaneously, a four-fold increase of the usage of carbapenems imipenem and meropenem in the hospital was noted. In 2000-2001, a high incidence of imipenem-resistant strains was observed. The imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains of serotype O6 from the general surgery ward and serotype O11 from the intensive care unit were shown to be clonally related by the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis method.
