OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency with which Staphylococcus schleiferi could be isolated from dogs with pyoderma and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolates that were obtained. DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 54 dogs with a first (n = 14) or recurrent (40) episode of pyoderma. PROCEDURE: Specimens were obtained and submitted for bacterial culture. Isolates were identified as S schleiferi on the basis of growth and biochemical characteristics. Two isolates were submitted for DNA sequencing to confirm identification. Methicillin susceptibility was determined by means of disk diffusion with oxacillin-impregnated disks. RESULTS: 3 of 14 dogs examined because of a first episode of pyoderma and 12 of 40 dogs examined because of a recurrent episode of pyoderma were receiving antimicrobials at the time of specimen collection. Staphylococcus schleiferi was not isolated from any dog with first-time pyoderma but was isolated from 5 dogs with recurrent pyoderma that were not receiving antimicrobials at the time of specimen collection and 10 dogs with recurrent pyoderma that were receiving antimicrobials. Nine isolates were identified as S schleiferi subsp schleiferi, and 6 were identified as S schleiferi subsp coagulans. All S schleiferi subsp schleiferi isolates were resistant to methicillin, but only 2 S schleiferi subsp coagulans isolates were. Two methicillin-resistant isolates were also resistant to fluoroquinolones, and 1 isolate had intermediate susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that S schleiferi subsp schleiferi and S schleiferi subsp coagulans may be isolated from dogs with recurrent pyoderma. Although isolates from dogs with pyoderma were frequently resistant to methicillin, multiple drug resistance was uncommon.
