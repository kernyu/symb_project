PURPOSE: In vitro assessment of drug candidates' affinity for multi-drug resistance proteins is of crucial importance for the prediction of in vivo pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. To have well described experimental tools at hand, the objective of the study was to characterize substrates and inhibitors of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). METHODS: Madin-Darbin canine kidney cells overexpressing mouse Bcrp (MDCKII-Bcrp) were incubated with various Bcrp substrates, or a mixture of substrate and inhibitor to either the apical (A) or basolateral (B) compartment of insert filter plates. Substrate concentrations in both compartments at time points t = 0 h and t = 2 h were determined by LC-MS/MS, and respective permeation coefficients (Papp) and efflux ratios were calculated. RESULTS: The Bcrp inhibitor Ko143 blocked topotecan and ABZSO transport in a concentration-dependent manner. P-gp inhibitors ivermectin, LY335979, PSC833, and the P-gp/Bcrp inhibitor ritonavir did not influence Bcrp mediated topotecan transport, however, blocked ABZSO transport. Additionally, neither was ABZSO transport influenced by topotecan, nor topotecan transport by ABZSO. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest different modes of substrate and inhibitor binding to Bcrp. In order to not overlook potential drug-drug interactions when testing drug candidates for inhibitory potential towards Bcrp, distinct Bcrp probe substrates should be used.
