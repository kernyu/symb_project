To test the conception about a pathogenetic role of correlation between gastric comtamination with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and immune system disorders in duodenal ulcer (DU), immune status and its response to current pharmacotherapy were studied in 84 patients in an acute recurrence phase. The patients were divided into 4 representative groups to receive monotherapy with omeprasol (group 1), combination denol + amoxicillin + tinidasol (group 2), quadrotherapy with drugs of group 1 and 2 (group 3), the above quadrotherapy plus immunomodulating drugs (imunofan + tactivin + oligovit) (group 4). In recurrent DU all the components of the immune system are affected especially cellular immunity. The response to the treatment was highest in group 1 and 4 (90% healing for 3 weeks), the worst in group 2 (68%). The complex of antibacterial drugs produces a moderate immunosuppressive action. The addition of immunomodulating drugs to the quadrotherapy promotes correction of secondary immunodeficiency and secondary Hp resistance to antibacterial drugs. This leads to a rise in eradication effect from 33-55 to 84% and a decrease in the number of early recurrences (during the first 6-12 months) from 42.1-33.6 to 12.5%.
