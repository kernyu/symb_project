A prospective study was carried out on 210 cases of children under 10 years of age with fever. Cases of gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and suspected sepsis in children seen or admitted to the pediatric hospital were studied. Clinical and microbiological data were recorded in a questionnaire or obtained from patient medical records. Most of the children with septicemia (71.3 per cent) were less than 1 year old. Focal source of bacteremia was gastroenteritis (40.4 per cent), pneumonia or bronchopneumonia (20 per cent), meningitis (7.4 per cent), and urinary tract infections (7.4 per cent). The predominant pathogens isolated from blood or stool specimens were gram-positive bacteria (53.3 per cent), mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The gram-negative bacteria (45.6 per cent) were mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Yersinia spp. One case of Candida albicans (1.1 per cent) was reported. Pasteurella pneumotropica was reported in two cases for the first time. The mortality rate was 4 per cent, mostly from septicemia cases. Long duration of hospitalization (> 10 days) and parenteral feeding were identified as risk factors. Resistance of the isolated pathogens to several commonly used antibiotics was observed. Empirical treatment with antibiotics is recommended only in life-threatening cases.
