Treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is limited by recurrent disease and the development of multidrug resistance. Therefore, novel treatment options are desirable. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using the photodynamic agent hypericin is proposed as an alternative approach for intraoperative visualization and treatment of this disease. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro effects of hypericin on childhood rhabdomyosarcoma and to evaluate photodynamic therapy as a possible basis for treatment. Rhabdomyosarcoma cells and fibroblasts (control) were incubated with increasing concentrations of hypericin. in vitro uptake and visualization of hypericin was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and FACS. For photodynamic therapy, cells were exposed to white light for different time periods. Cytopathologic effects were assessed using standard histology. Cancer cells were investigated for cell viability (MTT assay), proliferative activity (Ki-67 assay), and apoptosis (TUNEL test). A 100% uptake of hypericin was found within the population of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Uptake of hypericin in the fibroblasts was much less than in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Hypericin without exposure to white light had no effect on tumor cell viability. After irradiation, PDT resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of cell proliferation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells with a corresponding increase in the frequency of apoptosis. In fibroblasts, PDT was less effective compared to tumor cells. Our data suggest hypericin as a novel tool for visualization and photodynamic therapy of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
