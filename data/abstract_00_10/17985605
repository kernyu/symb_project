In the last decade, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) have emerged in young, individuals without risk factors for MRSA acquisition. They mainly present with skin and soft tissue infections. CA-MRSA are genotypically and phenotypically differents from HA-MRSA. In case of recurrent or severe soft tissue infections, search for CA-MRSA should be performed. Treatment consists of incision and drainage of abscesses and furuncles. If antibiotics are needed, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the first choice. A specialist in infection control is advised for contact screening implementation of hygienic precautions and decolonization therapy.
