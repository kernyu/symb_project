Competitive inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are used in chemotherapy or prophylaxis of many microbial pathogens, including the eukaryotic parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. Unfortunately, point mutations in the DHFR gene can confer resistance to inhibitors specific to these pathogens. We have developed a rapid system for testing inhibitors of DHFRs from a variety of parasites. We replaced the DHFR gene from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the DHFR-coding region from humans, P. falciparum, T. gondii, Pneumocystis carinii, and bovine or human-derived Cryptosporidium parvum. We studied 84 dicyclic and tricyclic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives in this heterologous system and identified those most effective against the DHFR enzymes from each of the pathogens. Among these compounds, six tetrahydroquinazolines were effective inhibitors of every strain tested, but they also inhibited the human DHFR and were not selective for the parasites. However, two quinazolines and four tetrahydroquinazolines were both potent and selective inhibitors of the P. falciparum DHFR. These compounds show promise for development as antimalarial drugs.
