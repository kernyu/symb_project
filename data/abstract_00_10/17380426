The purouindoline gene (pin) coding for puroindoline proteins (PINs) is located on chromosome 5D, controls grain hardness, and the PINs have in vitro antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (G+) bacteria, gram-negative (G-) bacteria and fungi. Wheat leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina is one of the most important fungal diseases for common wheat with AABBDD genomes. Tetraploid wheat (AABB genome) varieties Luna and Venusia were transformed with the purouindoline a (pinA) gene by bombardment, express PINA consititutively. Transgenic plants showed enhanced response to leaf rust in greenhouse and field. Comparative study of harvesting parameters showed significant differences between transgenic and control plants. These indexes were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in control plants than that in transgenic plants, which suggests that they are significantly affected by pinA gene and that the puroindoline a protein (PINA) can effectively inhibit in vivo the growth of fungal, and the transgenic tetraploid wheat can grow well in Hubei Province, Central China, where the tetraploid wheat varieties Luna and Venusia have poor yield due to their disease-sensitivity.
