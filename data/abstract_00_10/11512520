Lamivudine (beta-L-(-)-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine) has been a major breakthrough in the care of patients with hepatitis B. With prolonged monotherapy the development of resistance is an increasingly recognized problem that limits the long term efficacy of this nucleoside analogue. The most common mutations associated with lamivudine resistance occur within the highly conserved YMDD motif in the C domain of the viral polymerase and are often associated with a compensatory mutation in the proximal B domain. The structural and functional relationship of resistance mutations is reflected in different in vitro sensitivities to lamivudine and changes in replication capacities. During prolonged lamivudine treatment there can be successive changes of different resistant mutants (genotypic succession) or a single mutant can remain the dominant viral species. In patients treated for chronic hepatitis B infection the cumulative incidence of viral resistance reaches over 50% after 3 years. Most patients will have lower serum HBV DNA levels after the emergence of resistance which is ascribed to the decreased replication capacity of these mutants. Although severe flares and ongoing HBe antigen seroconversion can occur in these patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV, the impact of continued therapy on the long-term outcome is still insufficiently studied. In the setting of liver transplantation for HBV-associated disease the clinical course after the emergence of viral resistance is variable but still may lead to disease progression and graft failure. Analogous to the success of combination therapies to delay the emergence of antiviral-resistant HIV, it will be important to combine anti-HBV agents with additive or synergistic antiviral properties and different resistance profiles for future de novo combination therapies for hepatitis B infection.
