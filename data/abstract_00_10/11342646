Plasmodium berghei XAT is an irradiation-induced attenuated variant derived from the lethal strain P. berghei NK65, and its blood-stage parasites are spontaneously cleared in immune competent mice. In the present study, we studied the mechanism of host resistance to blood-stage malaria infection using P. berghei XAT. Infection enhanced Ab-dependent phagocytosis of PRBC by splenic macrophages in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, FcR gamma-chain knockout (FcRgamma(-/-)) mice, which lack the ability to mediate Ab-dependent phagocytosis and Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity through FcgammaRI, FcgammaRII, and FcgammaRIII, could not induce Ab-dependent phagocytic activity. These FcRgamma(-/-) mice showed increased susceptibility to the P. berghei XAT infection, with eventually fatal results, although they produced comparable amounts of IFN-gamma by spleen cells and anti-XAT Abs in serum. In addition, passive transfer of anti-XAT IgG obtained from wild-type mice that had recovered from infection into FcRgamma(-/-) mice could not suppress the increase in parasitemia, and almost all of these mice died after marked parasitemia. In contrast, passive transfer of anti-XAT IgG into control wild-type mice inhibited the increase in parasitemia. IFN-gamma(-/-) mice, which were highly susceptible to the P. berghei XAT infection, failed to induce Ab-dependent phagocytic activity and also showed reduced production of serum anti-XAT IgG2a isotype compared with control wild-type mice. These results suggest that FcR-mediated Ab-dependent phagocytosis, which is located downstream of IFN-gamma production, is important as an effector mechanism to eliminate PRBC in blood-stage P. berghei XAT infection.
