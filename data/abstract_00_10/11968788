Protease inhibitors block the protease enzyme of HIV-1. When new viral particles break off from an infected cell, protease cuts long protein strands into the parts needed to assemble a mature virus. When protease is blocked, the new viral particles cannot mature. Protease inhibitors being tested in humans include Atazanavir, GW433908, L-756,423, Mozenavir(DMP-450), Tipranavir and more. Several firms are trying to develop a new type of protease inhibitor that will be the more favorable pharmacokinetic and resistance profiles compared with currently available drugs. We cannot expect that every one of the drugs listed in this paper will be successfully developed. However, it is likely that significant clinical advancements can be made with those that are proven to be active and safe for patients in need.
