OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of the variation of the V3 loop tip motifs and the drug resistance in the primary treatment patients. METHODS: The partial region of the HIV-1 env and pol gene in 51 samples was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ,purified products were cloned into the vectors, the obtained were analyzed by MEGA soft wares. RESULTS: The V3 loop tip motifs had four types in our study (GPGR, GPGQ, GPGK, GQGR); the study on the drug resistance in primary treatment patients, showed that there were not major resistance associated with PI, and the resistance were minor mutations in protease gene. In the RT region, there were nine resistance mutants were single NRTIs or NNRTIs. CONCLUSION: The GPGR which was the typical western V3 loop tip motifs attained to 44.44%. This results showed that the percentage of primary drug resistance was still low in our study region, suggesting no need for genotyping detection in blood donor patients before primary therapy.
