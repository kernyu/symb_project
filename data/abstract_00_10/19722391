The objective of this study was to measure the effect of broiler processing on the prevalence, serotype, and antimicrobial resistance profiles of salmonellae. Twenty U.S. commercial processing plants representing eight integrators in 13 states were included in the survey. In each of four replications, 10 carcasses from one flock were collected at rehang and 10 more carcasses were collected at postchill; each carcass was sampled by whole-carcass rinse. Salmonella organisms were isolated from carcass rinses by standard cultural techniques, serotypes were determined, and the resistance to 15 antimicrobials was measured. Overall, Salmonella was detected on 72% of carcasses at rehang (ranging from 35 to 97%) and on 20% of carcasses postchill (ranging from 2.5 to 60%). In every instance, a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in Salmonella prevalence was noted between rehang and postchill. The four most common serotypes, accounting for 64% of all Salmonella isolates, were Kentucky, Heidelberg, Typhimurium, and Typhimurium var. 5-; most isolates of Kentucky (52%), Heidelberg (79%), and Typhimurium (54%) serotypes were susceptible to all antimicrobial drugs tested. However, only 15% of the Typhimurium var. 5- isolates were pansusceptible; more than one-half of the isolates of this serotype were resistant to three or more drugs. No isolate of any serotype exhibited resistance to amikacin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. These data demonstrate that although processing lessens carcass contamination with Salmonella, antimicrobial-resistant isolates may still be present.
