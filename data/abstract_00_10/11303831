OBJECTIVE: To report the results of the use of antimicrobial guidelines for the management of children with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. METHODS: Admittance and discharge criteria and algorithms for diagnosis and treatment were established. The decision to treat with antibiotics was based on radiologic findings in pneumonia with pulmonary consolidation and left to the attending physician's criteria in the remaining cases. The use of antibiotics was limited to penicillin and derivatives (ampicillin, amoxicillin) and macrolides. RESULTS: Of the 1163 children treated as bacterial pneumonia, hospitalized in public and private health facilities in Montevideo from September, 1997, through September, 1998, standard case management was applied in 1082 (93%). Age distribution was: <1 month, 1%; between 1 and 11 months, 29%; between 1 and 5 years, 50%; >5 years, 20%. Chest radiography showed evidence of pulmonary consolidation in 843 children (73%). Bacteria were detected in blood culture and/or pleural fluid of 57 children (5%). In 51 the identified microorganism was Streptococcus pneumoniae, susceptible to penicillin in 30, intermediate in 6 and resistant in 5 (maximum MIC, 4 microg/ml); in 10 cases etiologic diagnosis was made by antigen detection. Empyema was present in 62 children (5.3%); 38 (3.27%) required treatment in an intensive care unit; and 5 (0.4%) died. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with standard case management was highly satisfactory. Outcome of children treated with penicillin and derivatives was good, including children with empyema and pneumatocele and two patients with penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. At the present time S. pneumoniae resistant to penicillin is not an important problem in children with pneumonia in Uruguay. Surveillance of identified microorganisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility must continue.
