The combination effects of chloroquine with a mixture of febrifugine and isofebrifugine were evaluated against a blood-induced infection with chloroquine-resistant P. berghei NK65 in ICR mice. Mice in the untreated control showed a progressively increasing parasitemia leading to mouse death. A two-day dosage of 20 mg base/kg of chloroquine alone showed little effect against P. berghei NK65 infection, and all mice died from day 13 to 14 with an increasing parasitemia. A four-day dosage of 1 mg/kg of the febrifugine and isofebrifugine mixture alone showed a little antimalarial activity, but all mice died from day 19 to 27 with an increasing parasitemia. On the other hand, mice treated with chloroquine plus alkaloids survived during the experiment. All mice treated with chloroquine alone or the alkaloid mixture alone showed low parasitemia levels during a drug administration and following a few days, but then malaria parasites increased in the bloodstream of the treated mice until death. On the other hand, malaria parasites in the mice given chloroquine plus alkaloids decreased on day 6 and then were not detected by a microscopic examination during observation period.
