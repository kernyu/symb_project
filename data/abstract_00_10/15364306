Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are the commonest nosocomial infections worldwide. While they are often asymptomatic and frequently cost less than nosocomial surgical site infections or nosocomial pneumonia, they are major reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Numerous strategies have been devised in an attempt to reduce the incidence of CAUTI but few have proven effective. Novel technologies such as the potential use of antiseptic or antimicrobial coatings on catheters hold promise for possibly reducing these infections in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.
