INTRODUCTION: Risk factors associated with ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CAZ-R Kp) infection may vary among hospitals and in the same hospital at different time points. Knowledge of these factors is required to establish suitable infection control programs. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to assess risk factors for CAZ-R Kp infection. Thirty-two cases were compared with 28 controls admitted to a 200-bed general hospital during 1999 and 2000. RESULTS: In the univariate analysis Kp CAZ-R isolates were significantly associated with nosocomial acquisition (OR 5 17.40), prior antibiotic use (OR 5 14.94), particularly ciprofloxacin use (OR 5 5), and hospitalization stay of more than 6 days (OR 5 6.72). Significantly associated variables in the logistic regression analysis included nosocomial acquisition (OR 5 9.29), prior antibiotic use (OR 5 6.21), and particularly, ciprofloxacin use (OR 5 10.84). CONCLUSIONS: Efforts toward more rational overall antibiotic use and particularly ciprofloxacin use, combined with infection control measures are necessary to decrease the prevalence of CAZ-R Kp in our hospital.
