Genome shuffling can improve complex phenotypes; however, there are several obstacles towards its broader applicability due to increased complexity of eukaryotic cells. Here, we describe novel, efficient and reliable methods for genome shuffling to increase ethanol production of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using yeast sexual and asexual reproduction by itself, mutant diploid cells were shuffled through highly efficient sporulation and adequate cross among the haploid cells, followed by selection on the special plates. The selected strain obtained after three round genome shuffling not only distinctly improved the resistance to ethanol, but also, increased ethanol yield by up to 13% compared with the control.
