Helicobacter pylori infection is one of the commonest chronic infections worldwide. Eradication regimes usually contain two antibiotics, however resistance is increasing and this decreases treatment success. This study reports on the sensitivity and resistance of H pylori to several antibiotics in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in Jamaica. The rapid urease test (CLO) was positive in 128 (38%) of 336 patients. Fifty patients (39%; 50/128) with positive CLO tests had positive cultures for H pylori. Two-thirds (32/48) of islolates were sensitive to metronidazole and one-third (16/48) were resistant. Ninety-seven per cent of isolates (31/32) were sensitive to erythromycin. The sensitivity for clarithromycin was 92% (11/12) with one isolate (8%) resistant. All strains of H pylori (48/48) were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin - clavulanate. Metronidazole resistance is present in one-third of H pylori isolates and resistance to macrolides is relatively low in Jamaican patients. It is important to monitor antibiotic resistance in order to provide clinicians with data on the most appropriate and cost effective eradication regimes for H pylori.
