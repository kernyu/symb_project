Benzimidazole (BZ) resistance is widespread in nematode parasites of livestock, but very little is known about the levels of BZ resistance in parasites with avian hosts. We investigated BZ resistance in Trichostrongylus tenuis, a nematode parasite of red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scotica. BZ anthelmintics had been in use in this system for up to 15 years, yet existing phenotypic evidence for resistance was inconclusive. We screened 1530 individuals from 14 populations at the principal beta-tubulin locus for BZ resistance (isotype 1, residue 200) and 940 of these at two further resistance sites (isotype 1, residue 167; isotype 2, residue 200). No BZ resistant genotypes were found. Alternative mechanisms may be responsible for BZ resistance in this system, or the method and timing of treatments may reduce selection pressure for BZ resistance by creating substantial refugia for susceptible genotypes.
