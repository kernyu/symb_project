The World Health Organization is engaged in developing the Global Strategy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance. The preliminary document WHO/CDC/CSR/DRS/2000.I Draft has already been distributed, and remarks have been solicited.<br /> The World Health Assembly Resolution of 1998 urged Member States to encourage the appropriate and cost-effective use of antimicrobials. Member States were requested to implement effective systems of microbial resistance surveillance and to monitor volumes and patterns of antimicrobial drug use.<br /> The phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance is rising rapidly and causing growing international concern. Many countries have undertaken their own national plans to address the problem.<br /> The overall aim of the strategy being developed is to find the most effective forms and to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance and resistant microbes. The strategy covers the following topics: patients and general community, prescribers, hospitals, veterinarians, manufacturers and drug dispensers, and international aspects.<br /> The strategy is being developed on the basis of expert opinions, published reports, reviews of specific topics specially commissioned by various international and national bodies, and a large body of literature with a list of publications containing over 100 items.
