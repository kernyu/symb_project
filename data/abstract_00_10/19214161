From September 28, 2008, to January 31, 2009, influenza activity remained low in the United States but began to increase at the end of January. Thus far during the 2008-09 influenza season, influenza A viruses have predominated and are antigenically related to the 2008-09 influenza vaccine strains. Oseltamivir resistance has been detected in nearly all of the influenza A (H1N1) viruses tested so far during the 2008-09 season, with high levels of adamantane resistance among influenza A (H3N2) viruses. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity since the last update and reviews interim recommendations for the use of influenza antiviral medications.
