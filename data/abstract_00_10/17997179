The emerging and sustained resistance to antibiotics and the poor pipeline of new antibacterials is creating a major health issue worldwide. Bacterial pathogens are increasingly becoming resistant even to the most recently approved antibiotics. Few antibiotics are being approved by regulatory organizations, which reflects both the difficulty of developing such agents and the fact that antibiotic discovery programs have been terminated at several major pharmaceutical companies in the past decade. As a result, the output of the drug pipelines is simply not well positioned to control the growing army of resistant pathogens, although academic institutions and smaller companies are trying to fill that gap. An emerging option to fight such pathogens is combination therapy. Combinations of two antibiotics or antibiotics with adjuvants are emerging as a promising therapeutic approach. This article provides and discusses clinical and scientific challenges to support the development of combination therapy to treat bacterial infections.
