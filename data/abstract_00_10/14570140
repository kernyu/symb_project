The cattle tick Boophilus microplus causes significant economic losses in cattle in the tropical areas of Central and South America. Acaricides are widely used to control tick infestations, with the consequent selection of tolerant and resistant subpopulations. Detoxifying enzymes, and esterases in particular, have been associated with organophosphate resistance in Mexican isolates of B. microplus ticks. Here, we present results of the biochemical detection of esterases and oxidases in 20 isolates of larvae and adult ticks and the effect of esterase and oxidase inhibitors on larvae and adult stages of the tick. Our results indicate the presence of significant differences both in vivo and in vitro between esterase and oxidase activities of OP-susceptible and OP-resistant isolates, even when samples were collected in the same area. The importance of such differences in regionalized integrated pest management and in the US Tick Eradication Program is discussed.
