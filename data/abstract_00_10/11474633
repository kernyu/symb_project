This multicentre, randomized, double blind, parallel group study compared the efficacy and safety of gemifloxacin (320 mg once daily) with trovafloxacin (200 mg once daily) in 571 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Although treatment was given routinely for 7 days it could be extended to 14 days; two-thirds of patients were treated for 7 days. High clinical success rates were noted at follow-up in the per-protocol population in both the gemifloxacin group (95.8%) and the trovafloxacin group (93.6%), non-inferiority with 95% CI. In the intent-to-treat population, the clinical success rate at follow-up was significantly superior for gemifloxacin (87.6%) compared with trovafloxacin (81.1%; 95% CI 0.5, 12.4). The pathogens identified most commonly at presentation were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Gemifloxacin eradicated 100% of S. pneumoniae. One bacteraemic isolate of S. pneumoniae was associated with clinical failure in the trovafloxacin group (MIC of trovafloxacin 8 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was well tolerated and the incidence of transient liver function abnormalities was very low. Gemifloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with CAP.
