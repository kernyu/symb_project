Multidrug-resistant staphylococci often harbour plasmids that carry genes conferring resistance to several antimicrobial compounds. Many of these multiresistance plasmids appear to utilize a related theta-type replication system for which multiresistance plasmid pSK1 serves as a prototype. Essential pSK1 replication elements were identified by cloning segments of the replication region and testing the resulting plasmids for replication proficiency. An iterated region within rep and a DNA segment of up to 68 bp upstream of the rep promoter were both found to be essential for origin activity. The Rep protein was overexpressed as a 6xHis-tagged C-terminal fusion protein and was shown to bind in vitro to four Rep boxes located within the rep coding region. Inactivation of a divergently oriented promoter upstream of rep, designated P(rnaI), resulted in an elevated plasmid copy number. Comparative analyses suggest that the replication systems of many staphylococcal multiresistance plasmids share a similar genetic organization and utilize an antisense-RNA-mediated regulatory mechanism for copy number control.
