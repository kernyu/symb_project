The number of new antimicrobial drugs in the health care clinical practice has decreased gradually and significantly in the last 15 years. At the same time, there has been an increase in the appearance of microorganisms with resistance to conventional antibiotics, above all in intensive care units (ICU). Within this group, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSRA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase- negative staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii resistant to carbapenemics and extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing (ESBL) Enterobacteria are the most important. These pathogens are frequently also resistant to other groups of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. New recently introduced antimicrobial agents are available to combat these resistances. These are active mainly against gram positive bacteria resistant strains and in a more timely way against gram negative ones or both. Among the first group, the following stand out: daptomycin (a lipopeptide bactericide for parenteral use) and linezolid (oxazolidinone with bacteriostatic activity for parenteral and oral use). On its part, ertapenem (a carbapenem parenteral bactericide) and tigecyclin (a parenteral bacteriostatic tetracycline) are active against ESBL enterobacteria, the latter also being active against non-fermented gram positives and gram negatives, except for P. aeruginosa. Possibly, the introduction of these new compounds and other futures ones pending introduction will not only improve antimicrobial diversification but also serve to limit the spreading of these microorganisms.
