OBJECTIVES: To determine fluconazole population pharmacokinetics and explore the relationships between fluconazole average concentration and treatment effectiveness or microbiological resistance induction during a study aimed at evaluating the efficacy, tolerability and resistance induction after secondary prevention with fluconazole (150 mg weekly) versus placebo in human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic parameters of fluconazole determined from 458 serum drug concentration measurements obtained over 37 months in 132 HIV + patients not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Mean estimates and variabilities were generated using non-linear regression analysis. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between the estimated average concentration of fluconazole and candidiasis relapse or fungal resistance towards fluconazole. RESULTS: Fluconazole kinetics were best described by a one-compartment model with first-order oral absorp tion from the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmacokinetics were influenced only by body weight. No effect was observed for gender, age, height or lymphocyte CD4 counts. The mean apparent population clearance was 0.79 l/h, the volume of distribution 571 and the absorption constant (ka) 0.93 h(-1). Inter-occasion variability in clearance (45%) was large relative to intersubject variability (21%). Taking into account the average fluconazole concentration or the time above the minimal inhibitory concentrations did not clinically improve the prediction of the occurrence of oropharyngeal relapse or microbiological resistance. CONCLUSION: The relationship between fluconazole concentrations and preventive effectiveness was poor. Together with the rather large inter-occasion variability in fluconazole clearance, this suggests no role of therapeutic drug monitoring in optimising fluconazole treatment for secondary prevention.
