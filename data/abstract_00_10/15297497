The 16S rRNA gene has previously been used to develop genus-specific PCR primers for identification of enterococci. In addition, the superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) has been identified as a potential target for species differentiation of enterococci. In this study, Enterococcus genus-specific primers developed by Deasy et al. (E1/E2) were incorporated with species-specific primers based upon the superoxide dismutase (sodA) gene for development of a multiplex PCR. This assay provides simultaneous genus and species identification of 23 species of enterococci using seven different reaction mixtures. Accuracy of identification of the multiplex PCR was determined by comparisons to standard biochemical testing, the BBL Crystal kit, VITEK, and API Rapid ID 32 Strep. Isolates from swine feces, poultry carcasses, environmental sources, and retail food were evaluated and, overall, results for 90% of the isolates tested by PCR agreed with results obtained using standard biochemical testing and VITEK. Eighty-five percent and 82% of PCR results agreed with results from the API Rapid ID 32 Strep and BBL Crystal tests, respectively. With the exception of concurrence between identification using standard biochemical testing and VITEK (85%) and between BBL Crystal and VITEK (83%), the percent agreement for PCR was higher than or equal to any other pairwise comparison. Multiplex PCR for genus and species determination of enterococci provides an improved, rapid method for identification of this group of bacteria.
