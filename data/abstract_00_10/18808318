Hepatitis B virus is a significant cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic infection. Higher levels of viral load are associated with increased risk of developing liver-related complications. The current available oral therapies suppress viral replication through their action on the hepatitis B virus polymerase. As treatment with oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogues is associated with the development of drug-resistant mutations, there is continuing research for newer and more potent antiviral agents to reduce the chance of drug resistance. LB80380, a prodrug, is an oral nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral replication by incorporation into the viral DNA. Antiviral activity against wild-type virus and virus with drug-resistant mutations was demonstrated in Phase II trials, with significant reduction of viral load in patients treated with LB80380. LB80380 was also shown to be safe and well tolerated.
