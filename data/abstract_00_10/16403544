Salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are plant hormones involved in basal resistance against plant pathogens and also in induced resistance. The aim of this study is to develop a fast and sensitive method to determine simultaneously the levels of both these hormones. The present paper proposes a method that includes hormone extraction with MeOH-H(2)O-HOAc (90:9:1, v/v), evaporation of the extracts, and injection into the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) system in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Endogenous SA and JA levels in noninfested control cucumber cotyledons were 30.96 and 0.73ngg(-1) fresh weight, respectively. In roots, the levels were 8.31 and 15.82ngg(-1) FW, respectively. In plants treated with the biological control agent Trichoderma asperellum strain T-34, the levels of SA and JA did not differ from control plants. Rhizoctonia solani-diseased cucumber plants showed higher levels of SA and JA compared to noninfested controls (up to 2 and 13-fold higher, respectively). Detection limits for SA and JA were 0.45 and 0.47ngg(-1) fresh weight, respectively. The results of our research include the development of a method that is both fast and highly sensitive in the simultaneous quantitation of SA and JA from crude cucumber plant extracts, avoiding any purification and derivatization steps.
