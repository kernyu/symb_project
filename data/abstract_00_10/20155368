Anthelmintic resistance is very prevalent in ruminant strongyle populations, especially in goats. Several occurrences of multiple anthelminthic resistances have been reported in goat flocks throughout the world, including resistance to the most recent macrocyclic lactones. A faecal egg count reduction test was conducted to detect resistance to ivermectin in French goat flocks. Thirty goats per flock were randomly selected in 22 flocks and allocated into two groups of 15 animals: an untreated control group and an ivermectin-treated group (0.3 mg/kg BW per os). Individual faecal egg counts and pooled larval cultures were performed 16-17 days after anthelmintic treatment for control and treated groups. FECR's were calculated for treated group vs. control one and when <95/100, were considered as indicative of anthelmintic resistance. FECR results indicated the absence of ivermectin resistance in nematode populations from all the 22 goat farms. The nematode genera involved in control groups were of Teladorsagia/Trichostrongylus, Haemonchus and Oesophagostomum/Chabertia types.
