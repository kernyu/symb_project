Antibiotic resistance is a consequence of antibiotic use - we need to use antibiotics less and to use them prudently. Plans to combat antibiotic resistance were recently proposed by the World Health Organization, a United States interagency taskforce and the Australian Joint Expert Technical Advisory Committee on Antibiotic Resistance. Prudent antibiotic use includes not using antibiotics when benefit is minimal (eg, in many respiratory tract infections), using narrow-spectrum antibiotics whenever possible and using optimal dosages and regimens. The need for antibiotic therapy can be reduced by preventing infections through vaccination, infection control measures and improved sanitation. Surveillance of antibiotic resistance is needed to target interventions for minimising antibiotic use. More research is needed into new antibiotics and regimens and into improving medical devices and protocols to prevent infection. Some simple changes to practice could reduce development and spread of antibiotic resistance
