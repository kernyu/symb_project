The effect of kanamycin on the electrophysical parameters of cell suspensions of Escherichia coli K-12 and pMMB33 was investigated. Incubation of the sensitive K-12 strain with kanamycin resulted in significant changes in the orientation spectra (OS) of the cell suspensions; these changes were not revealed in the case of the resistant pMMB33 strain. In the case of the sensitive K-12 strain incubated with different kanamycin concentrations, changes in the OS of the cell suspensions occurred within the 10-1000 kHz frequency range of the orienting electrical field. The most pronounced change in the electrooptical signal was observed at 10 microg/ml of kanamycin. Control experiments were carried out by standard plating on nutrient media. Thus, the OS changes of suspensions in the presence of antibiotics may be used as a test for microbial resistance to such antibiotics.
