A series of studies was conducted to test the antifungal activity of clavicipitaceous endophytes and to identify potential fungal inhibitors in this symbiotic infection. A diverse group of endophytes was screened for antifungal activity using organic extracts from liquid fermentation cultures. Fungal inhibitors were purified from fermentation cultures of Epichloe festucae using a bioassay-directed extraction with Cryphonectria parasitica as the test organism. Compounds shown to have antifungal activity were subsequently identified using NMR and GC-MS. Extracts from a wide range of fungal isolates had various degrees of antifungal activity, but the greatest antifungal activity was observed in E. festucae and Neotyphodium tembladerae. Three types of inhibitors were isolated from a batch culture of E. festucae, including several indole derivatives, a sesquiterpene, and a diacetamide. Among the indole derivatives, indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-ethanol were identified as the major indoles. These compounds were previously reported in endophytic fungi, and this study suggests a role in host disease resistance against other pathogens. The diversity in fungal inhibitors produced by this endophyte also suggests that fungal inhibitors may act additively or synergistically to reduce colonization of endophyte-infected hosts by potential fungal competitors.
