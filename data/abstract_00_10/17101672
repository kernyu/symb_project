RWJ-416457, an investigational pyrrolopyrazolyl-substituted oxazolidinone, inhibited the growth of linezolid-susceptible staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci at concentrations of < or =4 microg/ml, generally exhibiting two- to fourfold-greater potency than that of linezolid. Time-kill studies demonstrated bacteriostatic effects for both RWJ-416457 and linezolid.
