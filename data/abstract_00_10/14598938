Twenty-eight (11.6%) out of 241 Spanish patients enrolled in an international phase III clinical trial of mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) comparing gemifloxacin vs. trovafloxacin were diagnosed of Legionnaires' disease. A definite diagnosis was established by seroconversion in 13 patients of whom only 2 had a positive Legionella urinary antigen. The remaining 15 patients were possible Legionella infections based on a single elevated IgG titer (> or = 1:512). All patients had a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia, 5 (19%) patients were older than 65, comorbidity was present in 9 (33%), and 10 (36%) had to be hospitalized. Fifteen patients were treated with oral gemifloxacin (320 mg/day) and 13 with oral trovafloxacin (200 mg/day). Overall, clinical success occurred in 25 (89.3%) patients after 7 days of treatment and only 1 patient needed a 14-day treatment. There were only one adverse event withdrawal and one clinical failure, and no patients died. In light of the favorable clinical outcome, the use of newer fluoroquinolones seems adequate for the treatment of suspected or proven Legionella pneumonia.
