A simple, highly sensitive, and label-free electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) aptasensor based on an anti-lysozyme-aptamer as a molecular recognition element, was developed for the detection of lysozyme. Improvement in sensitivity was achieved by utilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which were electrodeposited onto the surface of a gold electrode, as a platform for immobilization of the aptamer. To quantify the amount of lysozyme, changes in the interfacial electron transfer resistance (R(et)) of the aptasensor were monitored using the redox couple of an [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) probe. The R(et) increased with lysozyme concentration. The plot of R(et) against the logarithm of lysozyme concentration is linear over the range from 0.1 pM to 500 pM with a detection limit of 0.01 pM. The aptasensor also showed good selectivity for lysozyme without being affected by the presence of other proteins.
