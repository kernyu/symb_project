Salmonella enterica serotype choleraesuis (S choleraesuis) usually causes systemic infections in man that need antimicrobial treatment. We isolated a strain of S choleraesuis that was resistant to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin from a patient with sepsis. Ciprofloxacin resistance was associated with mutations in gyrA and parC, whereas the ampC gene (bla(CMY-2)), responsible for ceftriaxone resistance, was carried by a transposon-like mobile element. This element was found inserted into finQ of a potentially transmissible 140 kb plasmid, with an 8 bp direct repeat flanking the junction regions. The appearance of this resistant S choleraesuis is a serious threat to public health, and thus constant surveillance is warranted.
