In the production of sherry wines, the process of biological aging is essential for the development of their organoleptic properties. This process involves velum formation by "flor" yeasts. Several of these yeast strains have been isolated and characterized with regard to their genetic, physiological and metabolic properties. In this work, we studied their resistance to cold-, osmotic-, oxidative-, ethanol- and acetaldehyde-stress, and found, in most cases, a correlation between resistance to acetaldehyde stress and ethanol stress and isolation from "soleras." Moreover, gene expression analysis revealed induction of the heat shock protein (HSP) genes HSP12, HSP82, and especially HSP26 and HSP104, under acetaldehyde stress in most of the strains. In strain C, there was a clear correlation between resistance to ethanol and acetaldehyde, the high induction of HSP genes by these compounds and its presence as the predominant strain in most levels of several soleras.
