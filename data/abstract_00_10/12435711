Mutations at reverse transcriptase codons 44, 118, 207, and 208 were significantly correlated with reduced zidovudine susceptibility in biologically cloned human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. Sequences from the Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database showed that these mutations were more common in HIV-1 isolates from patients treated with zidovudine and lamivudine than in patients not treated with these drugs.
