In our study, we aim to determine the existence of microorganisms that are heteroresistant to linezolid among Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates in our setting between 1996 and 2002; during this period, linezolid was not used in clinical practice. There was no resistant subpopulation to 4 mg/l of linezolid in 99.4% of the strains. On the other hand, 16.46% of the strains exhibited resistant subpopulations to 4 microg/ml of vancomycin. However, the emergence of strains resistant to this drug has been described and the emergence of resistant strains should be monitored.
