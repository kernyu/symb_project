A series of fluconazole analogues 5-20 incorporating azaindole and indole moieties were prepared using oxirane intermediates synthesized under microwave irradiation. All of the compounds were evaluated in vitro against two clinically important fungi, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Four derivatives 6, 13, 14 and 18 exerted high antifungal activity against C. albicans with MIC(80) values 3- to 28-fold lower than that of fluconazole.
