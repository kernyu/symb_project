Fluoroquinolones have been used worldwide against a variety of infections because of their potent antibacterial activity and good pharmacokinetics. In Europe and USA, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin showed a good therapeutic efficacy for the past decade by sequential therapy for infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive pathogens including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Recently, injection form of ciprofloxacin was launched in Japan, and pazufloxacin, gatifloxacin, and sitafloxacin are under development. Appropriate usage of these injectable quinolones in Japanese medical practice should be established from the potency of each drug, the surveillance data of drug-resistance, and the experience in Europe and USA.
