We previously established lines of transgenic Xenopus laevis expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP fusion proteins in the rod photoreceptors of their retinas under control of the X. laevis opsin promoter, which permits easy identification of transgenic animals by fluorescence microscopy. However, GFP tags can alter the properties of fusion partners, and in many circumstances a second selectable marker would be useful. The transgene constructs we used also encode a gene that confers resistance to the antibiotic G418 in cultured mammalian cells. In this study, we show that F2 transgenic offspring of these animals are more resistant to G418 toxicity than their non-transgenic siblings, as are primary transgenic X. laevis. G418 resistance can be used as a selectable marker in transgenic X. laevis, and possibly other aquatic transgenic animals.
