Copper (Cu)-based biocides are important chemical controls for both fungal and bacterial diseases in crop fields. Here, we showed that Cu ions at a concentration of 100 muM enhanced t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) killing of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris through different mechanisms. The addition of an antilipid peroxidation agent (alpha-tocopherol) and hydroxyl radical scavengers (glycerol and dimethyl sulphoxide) partially protected the bacteria from the Cu-enhanced tBOOH and H(2) O(2) killing, respectively. Inactivation of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase gene rendered the mutant vulnerable to lethal doses of copper sulphate, which could be alleviated by the addition of an H(2) O(2) scavenger (pyruvate) and alpha-tocopherol. Taken together, the data suggest that Cu ions influence the killing effect of tBOOH through the stimulation of lipid peroxidation, while hydroxyl radical production is the underlying mechanism responsible for the Cu-ion-enhanced H(2) O(2) killing effects.
