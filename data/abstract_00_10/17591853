During a 2004 survey, 49 extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria were collected in 20 French private health care centers and one local hospital. They included 12 CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli strains (1.8% versus 0.3% in a 1999 survey). Most of them belonged to the same clone and contained a bla(CTX-M-15) gene on similar conjugative plasmids.
