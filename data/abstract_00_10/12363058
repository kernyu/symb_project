The safety and efficacy of amodiaquine (AQ), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and coadministered AQ+SP was assessed in 351 Tanzanian children (age range, 6-59 months) with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This open, randomized study followed the 28-day World Health Organization (WHO) protocol and evaluated safety using clinical and laboratory parameters. Children receiving SP were more likely to vomit during follow-up (32% vs. 17%: P = 0.03), and SP alone resulted in prolonged fever clearance times. Although Day 7 and Day 14 clinical and parasitological cure rates were similar, by Day 28 45% of children treated with AQ demonstrated R1 resistance and 27.5% were clinical failures compared with 25% and 6.3%, respectively, for SP alone. Coadministered AQ+SP was safe, combined the greater clinical (96.2%) and parasitological (64.2%) efficacy of SP with the more rapid symptom resolution of AQ, and reduced the incidence of gametocytemia during follow-up (AQ+SP 12.6% vs. SP 29.9%; P = 0.001). The level of R1 resistance to SP may herald a rapid decline in its efficacy as SP drug pressure increases. Coadministration of AQ+SP may delay this.
