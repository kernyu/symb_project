High-level resistance to aminoglycosides produced by 16S rRNA methylases in Enterobacteriaceae isolates was investigated. The prevalences of armA in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were 0.6%, 3.0%, and 10%, respectively. rmtB was more prevalent than armA. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns indicated that armA and rmtB have spread horizontally and clonally.
