Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) susceptible strains to aminoglycosides (AS-MRSA) have been increasingly isolated in the Albert Cheneiver Hospital during the past 10 years. The aim of this study was first, to analyse the genotypes and the profiles of resistance to antibiotics and second to compare the AS-MRSA with the MRSA resistant to gentamicin (GR-MRSA) and with MRSA resistant to kanamycin and tobramycin, but susceptible to gentamicin (GS-MRSA), previously studied in our laboratory. All the AS-MRSA consecutively isolated from clinical samples (carriage isolates excluded) from 01/01/1993 to 31/12/2002 (33 isolates) were typed by DNA macrorestriction. Their susceptibilities to other anti-staphylococcal drugs (erythromycin, lincomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin, fusidic acid and fosfomycin) were studied by the French standard disk method. The 33 strains showed a heterogeneous resistance to oxacillin and fell into five phenotypes. The main phenotype (51.5% of the AS-MRSA strains) was susceptible to the six antibiotics studied. DNA macrorestriction defined 24 genotypes (percentage similarity <80%). Among them 16 genotypes contained only one strain each, and none contained more than three isolates. Conversely the comparison with GR-MRSA and GS-MRSA isolated during the same period showed that the strains were not closely linked. The diversity of our isolates showed that it was not an epidemic phenomenon, in contrast to the results of similar studies. Our findings may be explained by the patients coming mostly from different hospital units. This work indicates the need for further studies on the genome, to determine whether AS-MRSA have derived from strains that occurred before aminoglycosides came into clinical use.
