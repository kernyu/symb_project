Antimicrobial activity-directed fractionation of the seeds of Aframomum longifolius (Zingiberaceae) afforded two new labdane-type diterpenoids, 15-hydroxy-15-methoxylabda-8(17), 12( E)-dien-16-al (aframolin A) ( 1) and 8beta(17)-epoxy-15,15-dimethoxylabd-12( E)-en-16-al (aframolin B) ( 2), together with the known diterpenes labda-8(17),12( E)-diene-15,16-dial ( 3) and aframodial ( 4). Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods. Compound 4 showed significant antimicrobial activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRS) while 1, 2 and 3 were found to be inactive.
