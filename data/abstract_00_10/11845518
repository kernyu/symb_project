The object of our study was to contribute to the knowledge of the epidemiology and bacteriology of Haemophilus influenzae so as to ensure better treatment of patients consulting the Treichville Teaching Hospital. In the bacteriology laboratory of that hospital, between January 1996 and December 1999, we diagnosed by culture and/or soluble antigen, 203 cases of Haemophilus influenzae in children. We observed that biovar IV was dominant (49.7) amongst the 163 (80.3%) positive cultures. Serovar b was the most frequent capsular type found 189/203 (93%). Of the 203 specimens, the frequency of other capsular forms was e 9/203 (4.5%), f 3/203 (1.5%), c 2/203 (1%). Resistance to ampicillin is currently estimated at 39.9%, whereas resistance to chloramphenicol is estimated at 5.5%.
