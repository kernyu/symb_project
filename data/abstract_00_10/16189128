Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains (VRE) were isolated from human wastewater but not swine fecal waste from a semiclosed agri-food system in Texas. Forty-nine VRE isolates possessed vanA, and one possessed vanB. Twenty-one pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types were identified and segregated into three groups. There was evidence of clonal dissemination among geographically separated sites.
