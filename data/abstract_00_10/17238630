Few studies have investigated sequential HIV-1 mutation changes in the HIV gene in patients changing antiretroviral drugs. We analyze such data from the HIV Drug Resistance Database at Stanford University using three data mining methods: association rule analysis, logistic regression, and classification trees. Although the AUC measures of the overall prediction is not high, these methods can effectively identify strong predictors of mutation change and focus further analysis by domain experts.
