BACKGROUND: To screen for the most resistant bacteriophage as indicator in disinfection tests, the resistance of bacteriophage phi chi 174D, T4 and f2 to iodophor were observed in laboratory. METHODS: The virucidal activity of iodophor against bacteriophage phi chi 174D, T4, and f2 were assessed by suspension test. The neutralizer is selected and appraised by testing with neutralizer. Bacteriophage phi chi 174D, T4, and f2 were detected and enumerated by the double-agar-layer plaque technique. RESULTS: (1) With 500 mg/L of available iodine of iodophor solution, within a contact time of 40 min, or 750 mg/L, 10 min, or 1000 mg/L, 5 min, the reduction of bacteriophage phi chi 174D could achieve the "disinfection" level [log10 inactivation value (LIV) or log10 reduction value (LRV) of bacteriophage phi chi 174D (log10 No-log10 Nt) was > or = 4.00 log10]. (2) With 600 mg/L of available iodine of iodophor solution, within a contact time of 40 min, or 700 mg/L, 5 min, the reductions of bacteriophage T4 could achieve the "disinfection" level. (3) With 50 mg/L of available iodine of iodophor solution, within a contact time of 10 min, or 75 mg/L, 10 min, the reductions of bacteriophage f2 could achieve the "disinfection" level. CONCLUSION: The order of resistance of the above three bacteriophages to iodophor from greatest to smallest is as follows: bacteriophage phi chi 174D greater than bacteriophage T4 > bacteriophage f2.
