The purpose of this study was to determine if multiple injections of different dosages of beta-glucan derived from barley would enhance the immune response and disease resistance against infections due to opportunistic pathogens Aeromonas hydrophila and Edwardsiella tarda in Labeo rohita fingerlings. Hence, four different dosages of beta-glucan suspension in phosphate-buffered saline at the rate of 0, 5, 10, 15 mg kg(-1) body weight of fish were injected intraperitoneally to the fingerlings of Labeo rohita at two-week intervals for four times. After every two-week interval different serum biochemical, haematological and immunological parameters of fish were evaluated. At the end of immunostimulation trial of 56 days, fish were divided into four subgroups under each major treatment group for challenge through i.p injection and bath immersion with two pathogens, A. hydrophila and E. tarda. The mortality (%) and agglutinating antibody titre was recoded on 28th day post challenge. Most of the immune parameters such as leucocyte count, phagocytic ratio, phagocytic index, lysozyme activity, complement activity, serum bactericidal activity were significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced on 42 days after three i.p injections of 10 mg of beta-glucan kg(-1) body wt. Challenge study indicated least mortality in the group of fishes injected with medium dose of 10 mg of beta-glucan kg(-1) body wt. four times. Multiple injections of beta-glucan might have maintained the activation of phagocytic cells for a long period which in turn would lead to long-term protection in fishes. Thus, injections of 10 mg of beta-glucan kg(-1) body wt. for three times can be advocated to enhance the immune response of fish species under aquaculture.
