BACKGROUND: Synthetic vascular conduits used in traumatic or infected fields have a high failure rate leading to catastrophic consequences including amputation and death. Although efforts to coat vascular grafts with antibiotics have had varying results, we developed a novel coating technique for expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), which has proven to be effective in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that the coated grafts would resist infection and have decreased neointimal hyperplasia when used in vivo in a large animal model. METHODS: Minocycline and rifampin suspended in a mixture of methacrylates were coated onto a 3cm segment of 6mm ePTFE (Bard, Tempe, AZ). An antibiotic-coated (ABX), adhesive-coated (AC), or control (C) ePTFE graft was then placed as an end-to-side graft into the left iliac artery of a male mongrel pig. Sterile saline or innoculum containing 3x10(8)Staphylococcus aureus (SA) or Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) was then placed directly on the graft and the reflected peritoneum re-approximated to confine the bacteria. After 6 wk, the graft was harvested, cultured, and morphometric analyses of neointimal hyperplasia were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven pigs had grafts placed (9 ABX, 9 AC, 9 C) and harvested. Of the nine grafts exposed to SA, the uncoated and adhesive-coated grafts averaged greater than 50,000 colonies of SA while the antibiotic-coated grafts averaged less than 50 colonies. Although not statistically significant, neointimal hyperplasia was decreased by 15% to 20% when using an ABX graft in an infected field. CONCLUSIONS: The coated grafts appeared to decrease NIH formation although not significantly in this small pilot study. The methacrylate antibiotic-coated ePTFE graft did provide resistance to infection when used in infected fields.
