Environmental fungi, in particular primary pathogens and Cryptococcus spp. can be responsible for skin lesions mimicking sporotrichosis. In this paper, we report a case of subcutaneous cryptococcosis in an apparently healthy, young male patient due to a non-C. neoformans Cryptococcus species, C. diffluens. The isolate showed in vitro phenotypic switching that may affect virulence and host inflammatory and immune responses, and in vitro resistance to amphotericin B and 5-flucytosin. This species shares several phenotypic traits with C. neoformans, and, therefore, decisive diagnosis should be based on biopsy and culturing results followed by molecular identification.
