Escherichia coli isolates (n = 617) from fecal samples of healthy and diarrheal pigs, pig farmers, and nonfarmers were analyzed for class 1 integrons. Three hundred ninety-two isolates (63.5%) were positive for class 1 integrons, based on the presence of intI1, with seventy-one of those isolates (11.5%) harboring all three conserved genes (intI1, qacEdelta1, and sul1) known to be associated with class 1 integrons. The presence of integrons was associated with isolate origin. Integrons were more prevalent in isolates from most pig groups than in isolates from pig farmers and nonfarmers. Selected integron-positive and integron-negative isolates were tested for resistance to 16 antimicrobials. All integron-positive swine isolates were multidrug resistant to at least three antimicrobial agents, demonstrating resistance to 14 different antibiotics that included sulphamethoxazole (100%), tetracycline (97.1%), ampicillin (92.8%), streptomycin (89.9%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (88.1%), nalidixic acid (60.9%), chloramphenicol (58.0%), kanamycin (55.1%), cephalothin (44.9%), gentamicin (39.1%), ciprofloxacin (33.3%), cefoxitin (8.7%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (5.8%), and amikacin (2.9%). All isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur and ceftriaxone. Forty-seven resistance patterns were observed among 69 integron-positive swine and swine farmer isolates. The most frequent pattern was tetracycline-ciprofloxacin-gentamicin-nalidixic acid-sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole-kanamycin-ampicillin-strept omycin (10.1%), which was found in diarrheal and healthy pigs. This study shows that integrons and multidrug-resistant commensal bacteria are common and appear to be a significant aspect of microbial communities associated with pigs and humans in southern Thailand.
