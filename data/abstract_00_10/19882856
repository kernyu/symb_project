The composition, the outcomes of treatment and a follow-up were analyzed in 4 954 first detected adult patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and the baseline negative results of a sputum test for acid-resistant mycobacteria, with the involvement of not more than a lobe. The basic course of therapy yielded clinical and X-ray effects in 83.6% of cases. In the late period of a follow-up, the rate of clinical cure was 93.4%; that of death from tuberculosis, formation of chronic incurable forms of the process, and recurrent tuberculosis was 1.4, 0.9, and 0.9%, respectively. Treatment interruption, multidrug resistance, social disadaption of patients, and severe comorbidity were responsible for the poor outcomes of timely detected tuberculosis.
