We reviewed literature published from 1995 through 2000 on developments in ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is no gold standard with which to compare the accuracy of various invasive procedures performed for diagnosis. Moreover, leaders in the field are calling for an outcomes-based analysis to assess the utility of invasive procedures. Two things are clear: 1) adequate empiric therapy is beneficial, and 2) changes in therapy based on recovery of pathogens by invasive means do not affect outcome. Clinicians are urged to review local antimicrobial resistance patterns and to initiate empiric therapy on the basis of those data.
