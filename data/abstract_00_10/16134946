A novel series of 4-oxo-4,7-dihydrothieno[2,3-b]pyridine-5-carboxamides have been identified as potential antivirals against human herpesvirus infections resulting from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Compounds 10c and 14 demonstrated broad-spectrum inhibition of the herpesvirus polymerases HCMV, HSV-1, and VZV. High specificity for the viral polymerases was observed compared to human alpha polymerase. The antiviral activity of 10c and 14, as determined by plaque reduction assay, was comparable or superior to that of existing antiherpes drugs, ganciclovir (for HCMV) and acyclovir (for HSV-1 and VZV). Drug resistance to compound 14 correlated to point mutations in conserved domain III of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase, but these mutations do not confer resistance to existing nucleoside therapy. In addition, compound 14 maintained potent antiviral activity against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strains. Substitution to the pyridone nitrogen (N7) was found to be critical for enhanced in vitro antiviral activity.
