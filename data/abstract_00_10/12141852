Seven alkaloids have been isolated from Teclea trichocarpa including four, normelicopicine (1), arborinine (2), skimmianine (6), and dictamnine (7), that are reported for the first time in addition to the previously reported alkaloids melicopicine (3), tecleanthine (4), and 6-methoxytecleanthine (5). The structure of 1 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Two alkaloids, 1 and 2, displayed limited in vitro activities against Plasmodium falciparum strains HB3 and K1, but there appeared to be little cross-resistance with chloroquine. Alkaloid 1 was found to have some activity against P. berghei in mice (32% suppression of parasitaemia at a dose of 25 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), but unlike chloroquine it did not inhibit beta-haematin formation in a cell-free system; 1 was found to have low in vitro cytotoxicity to KB cells (IC50 > 328 microM).
