Antimicrobial resistance (R) typing and DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF) of a random collection of 84 Irish thermophilic Campylobacter isolates is described. The collection included human, veterinary (porcine) and poultry isolates cultured between 1996 and 1998 in the Cork region of Ireland. Biochemical and molecular methods were used to identify Campylobacter jejuni and Camp. coli. Many of these isolates were simultaneously resistant to several common antimicrobial agents. In particular, resistance to ampicillin, spectinomycin, sulphafurazole and tetracycline was common. A total of 74 DAF profiles was identified among the study collection, showing a high degree of diversity. Dendrogram analysis of the DNA patterns identified three main clusters at the 50% similarity level, which included two clusters of Camp. coli and a third containing a mixture of Camp. jejuni and Camp. coli.
