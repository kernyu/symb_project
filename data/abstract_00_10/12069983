We cultured lamivudine-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants over an extended period of time in the presence of zidovudine and observed a premature reversion of the resistance-conferring M184V mutation. These data suggest that the presence of ZDV amplifies differences in replication capacity between wild-type HIV-1 and the mutant variant.
