The sensitivity/resistance of Pseudomonas spp. isolated from rabbits gastrointestinal tract and faeces to antibiotics, enterocins and herbal extracts was tested in this study. The counts of Pseudomonas-like bacteria were higher in faeces (3.23-6.16 log(10) CFU/mL/g) than in caecum (1.36-4.08 log(10) CFU/mL/g). Nineteen isolates (16 faecal, 3 caecal) were oxidase positive. The strains were allotted by phenotypization to Pseudomonas spp., Brevundimonas diminuta and Brevundimonasvesicularis. High percentage of resistant strains was observed to all antibiotics. The tested strains were more susceptible to natural substances, mainly to plant extracts oregano (95%) and sage extracts (58%). Comparing the antibacterial effect of antibiotics and enterocins against rabbits pseudomonads, enterocins were more effective; the strongest inhibitory activity was determined in the case of partially purified enterocins PPBs EF2019, EK13 and EF55.
