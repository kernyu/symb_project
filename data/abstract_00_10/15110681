Over the years the introduction of very effective drugs has revolutionized the treatment of tuberculosis. In recent years, however, emerging multiple drug resistance has become a major threat and thus calls for an urgent search for new and effective treatments for this deadly disease. This review is complementary to earlier reviews and covers more recent reports of naturally occurring compounds, and in some cases synthetic analogs, largely from plants, fungi and marine organisms that demonstrate significant activity in the in vitro bioassays against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and other mycobacterial species. Included also are traditional medicinal uses of specific plants when utilized to treat tuberculosis and other pulmonary diseases.
