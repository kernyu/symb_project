Nevirapine (NVP) single dose is widely used in developing countries to prevent HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission. However, this regimen selects key drug resistance mutations that can impair further HAART efficacy. We studied the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase genotype from 29 Ivoirian women 1 month after an NVP single-dose prophylaxis. NVP resistance mutations were observed in six (20.7%) women. The majority of the isolates were CRF02_AG. These results confirm previous studies and suggest the need for different prophylaxis regimens in this setting.
