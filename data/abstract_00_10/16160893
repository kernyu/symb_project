The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a federal agency in the United States charged with promoting health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and cost. To protect patients and health care personnel and promote safety, quality, and value of the health care delivery system in the United States, CDC provides leadership in surveillance, outbreak investigations, laboratory support and research, and prevention programs. Information from CDC programs are used to (1) assess the magnitude, trends, and risk factors of HAIs; (2) detect new patterns and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance; (3) detect infections/adverse events related to new procedures performed in healthcare; and (4) develop new strategies to prevent HAIs. The CDC approach to monitor and prevent HAIs is described.
