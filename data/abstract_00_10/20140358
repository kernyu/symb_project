The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic abnormalities (dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance) associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in AIDS patients, treated in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The patients were distributed in five different groups: Group 1, HIV-infected without antiretroviral therapy; Group 2, with Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Efavirenz or Nevirapine; Group 3, with Zidovudine, Lamivudine and Protease Inhibitor; Group 4, with Stavudine, Lamivudine and Efavirenz or Nevirapine; and Group 5, with Stavudine, Lamivudine and Protease Inhibitor. The lipid and glucose profile were determined and statistics comparison was made. The findings of this study showed significant statistics elevations of total cholesterol and triglycerides levels in patients of Groups 3, 4 and 5, when comparing to patients of Groups 1 and 2. Significant differences were not observed between the groups in the others parameters evaluated: Glucose, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Comparing two drugs of same class (NNRTI) through the subgroups II-efavirenz and II-nevirapine, significant differences in the serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose favorable to the subgroup II-NVP were observed. These findings suggest that combinations including Protease Inhibitors and/or Stavudine could cause more adverse metabolic effects, and if possible, should be avoided in patients with others cardiovascular risk factors to prevent the precocious atherosclerosis in AIDS patients receiving HAART.
