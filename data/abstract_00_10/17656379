The Specialist Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Subgroup has reviewed national surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The review has included literature searches and web searches to identify published and unpublished data relevant to surveillance systems, semi-structured interviews with 25 key informants (including representatives of the Health Protection Agency at national, regional and local level, consultant microbiologists, those involved in novel surveillance initiatives, those involved in the National Health Service information strategy, representatives of GP networks and representatives of academic primary care) and a stakeholder workshop with over 40 participants. The report also draws on recent Department of Health funded work on surveillance of AMR, antimicrobial prescribing and complications of infection. This report presents a summary of current and planned surveillance activities related to AMR, identifies gaps and makes recommendations for enhancements in surveillance of resistance in primary care and the community.
