Prodigiosin (PG) is a bacterial, red-pigmented antibiotic with immunosuppressive and apoptotic activities. To better understand its mechanisms of action, we tried to identify proteins associated with apoptosis induced by PG. For this purpose, the variation of protein expression on exposure to apoptotic concentrations of PG was examined, by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-E), in the MCF-7 cancer cell line resistant to mitoxantrone (MCF-7-MR). Six PG apoptosis-associated protein spots were further characterized by complementary peptide mass fingerprinting and tandem mass spectrometry data obtained on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometer. The proteins identified were involved in various cellular functions, including cell defence, DNA repair and cellular organization. Our data provide novel information on cell response to PG, a new apoptotic drug with interesting anticancer activity.
