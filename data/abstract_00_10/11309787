The calcification potential, biostability, and immunogenic response of materials intended for long-term in vivo use, such as in heart-valve bioprostheses, are essential components of device performance. Here we explore these properties in photooxidized porcine heart valves. To study immunological sensitization, we injected tissue extracts intradermally into guinea pigs. Test and control animals received a challenge patch of the appropriate extract and were scored for dermal reactions. Neither cottonseed oil nor sodium chloride extracts of photooxidized heart-valve tissues caused any dermal inflammatory response. After implantation in the rat subcutaneous model for 90 days, the calcium content of 48-h-treated photooxidized cusp tissue [0.04 +/- 0.00 mg/g wet weight (gww)] was comparable to that of unimplanted control tissues (usually <1 mg/gww) and much lower than that of glutaraldehyde-treated controls (71 +/- 15 mg/gww). The porcine aortic wall calcium content (49 +/- 31 mg/gww) was comparable to that of glutaraldehyde-treated controls (59 +/- 8 mg/gww). Histologically, a time-dependent decrease in inflammation and vascularization with increasing photooxidation time was noted in the rat model along with an increase in the stability and organization of collagen bundles. In summary, porcine valve tissues treated by dye-mediated photooxidation were resistant to calcification, were biostable, and demonstrated a low immunogenic response, indicating potential for use in heart-valve bioprostheses.
