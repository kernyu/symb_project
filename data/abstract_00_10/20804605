This review is an attempt to summarize our knowledge about taurine bromamine (TauBr) properties, its role in innate immunity and its therapeutic potential.TauBr and taurine chloramine (TauCl) are major haloamines generated by eosinophils and neutrophils at a site of inflammation. Both haloamines share anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. TauBr, similarly to TauCl, decreases the production of proinflammatory mediators. Their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities are enhanced by their ability to induce the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). TauCl is more stable than TauBr. On the other hand, only TauBr was found to be highly membrane-permeable showing stronger microbicidal activity than TauCl.In the light of the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of TauBr we discuss its therapeutic potential in local treatment of inflammation, especially acne vulgaris, the most common inflammatory skin disorder. TauBr, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, is able to kill Propionibacterium acnes, the skin bacteria involved in pathogenesis of acne vulgaris.As topical antibiotics used in the therapy of acne are associated with the emergence of resistant bacteria, topical TauBr seems to be a good candidate for an alternative therapy.Recently, in a double blind trial, the efficacy of TauBr was compared with the efficacy of clindamycin, one of the most common topical antibiotics used in acne therapy. Comparable reduction of acne lesions was observed in the TauBr and clindamycin groups of patients with mild and moderate inflammatory facial acne vulgaris. We conclude that this pilot study supports our concept that TauBr can be used as a topical agent in the treatment of acne vulgaris, especially in patients who have already developed antibiotic resistance. Further studies are necessary to substantiate the more extended use of TauBr as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agent in human medicine.
