Three new bromotyrosine derivatives (4-6) were isolated from an association of two sponges, Jaspis wondoensis and Poecillastra wondoensis, along with the previously described (E,E)-psammaplin A (1), (E,Z)-psammaplin A (2), psammaplin D (3), bisaprasin (7), and (3-bromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)acetonitrile (8). The structures of the new compounds were established on the basis of NMR and MS spectroscopic analysis. The compounds 1, 3, and 5-7 displayed significant cytotoxicity against human lung (A549), ovarian (SK-OV-3), skin (SK-MEL-2), CNS (XF498), and colon (HCT15) cancer cell lines. Compounds 3-7 were further evaluated for antibacterial activity against methicillin- or ofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus strains. Compound 4 exhibited more potent antibacterial activity than meropenem against several strains.
