Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most important strains which induce hospital and post-operative infection. In cases of infective endocarditis in which VCM was not efficacious, MRSA strains were chronologically isolated at three different times and examined with the following parameters: minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index, Mu 3 agar, population analysis, pulse field gel electropholesis (PFGE). The PFGE banding patterns of the three MRSA isolates were the same, therefore, it was concluded that the same strain of MRSA was selected for reduced susceptibility. A pattern of Mu 3 and Mu 50 was demonstrated under population analysis.
