Cefepime, a broad-spectrum, fourth-generation cephalosporin, showed excellent CSF penetration with levels ranging between 10 and 16 mg/L after two intravenous injections (100 mg/kg). The bactericidal activity of cefepime (-0.60 +/- 0.28 Deltalog(10) cfu/mL/h) was superior to that of ceftriaxone (-0.34 +/- 0.23 Deltalog(10) cfu/mL/h, P < 0.05) and vancomycin (-0.39 +/- 0.19 Deltalog(10) cfu/mL/h, P < 0.05) in the treatment of rabbits with meningitis caused by an isolate highly resistant to penicillin (MIC of penicillin G: 4 mg/L). The addition of vancomycin to both cephalosporins did not significantly increase the killing rate compared with monotherapies (P > 0.05). Similar results were obtained in time-killing experiments in vitro.
