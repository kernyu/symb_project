The cutaneous leishmaniasis is a frequent affection in Tunisia. In the Gafsa region it is a endemoepidemic infection. Our prospective study was carried out on 225 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis of the face collected over two years in the outpatients' department of dermatology at Gafsa hospital. The aim of our study was to know more about the evolutive epidemio-clinical particularities of the cutaneous leishmaniasis of the face. The relative frequency of the cutaneous leishmaniasis of the face for the new patients reached 5%. An equal distribution between the two sexes was noted. The average age of our patients was 24 years old and 6 months old with extremes ranging from 3 months to 77 years. The nodular and ulcerated forms were the most frequent (35.3%), followed by impetiginoid forms (23%), then the lupoid forms (15%). The papular form was quite frequent (13%). Impetiginoid lesions occurred frequently in the child. Lupoid lesions appeared particularly on the nose. The complicated forms: the cutaneuos necrosis or erysipelas of the face appeared after intralesional injections of meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime). The intramuscular meglumine antimoniate was used in 172 patients, among them 47 needed two treatments or more because of a particular resistance of the lesions of the face. The pimple of Gafsa, term initially used for ulcerated skin nodules, was actually characterised by a lesional polymorphism. The prognosis was good however the risk of in aesthetic scar of the face was important.
