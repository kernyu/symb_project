AIM: Mutations in rrs [nucleotide (nt) 1401], gyrA gene (codons 90, 91 or 94), tlyA, ethA and thyA genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) were evaluated for their usefulness in predicting treatment outcome of kanamycin (KM), capreomycin (CPM), ofloxacin (OFX), ethionamide (ETH) and para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS). METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA sequence analyses of these genes were performed against 188 MTB isolates obtained from patients put on second-line anti-TB drugs (SLDs) with well-documented clinical history and treatment outcome. Mutations in rrs and gyrA have 100% positive predictive value (PPV) in predicting treatment failure for KM and OFX, while 88.9 and 80% were obtained, respectively, when tlyA and rrs mutations were considered in CPM. For ETH and PAS, the PPV of using ethA and thyA mutations to predict treatment failure was 82.5 and 89.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated high specificities of gene mutations in predicting poor treatment outcome; however, further technical advancement is required to make the molecular detection of resistances to other SLDs feasible in clinical laboratories. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study to correlate different polymorphisms of major SLD resistance gene markers with predicted treatment outcome, using an international set of well-documented clinical MTB strains.
