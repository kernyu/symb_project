A novel and promising technology-photodynamic treatment (PDT), aimed for surface cleaning and sanitation in food industry-is presented. It is based on the treatment of surfaces with nontoxic dyes (photosensitizers), followed by illumination of the surface with regular white light. The method is currently used in the medical field and was proved to have wide specificity against a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens as well as against yeasts and protozoa. An additional advantage of this approach is that development of resistance of microorganisms to PDT was shown to be unlikely. The theoretical basis of light-induced antimicrobial treatment is described, followed by examples of its application for the cleaning and disinfection of surfaces. All available information supports the idea that PDT could offer a very efficient and cost-effective way to combat microbial contamination of foods. The advantages and pitfalls of the technique are discussed. Directions of future research needed for bringing the technology to commercial reality are identified.
