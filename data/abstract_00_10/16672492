Various statistical classification methods, including discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and cluster analysis, have been used with antibiotic resistance analysis (ARA) data to construct models for bacterial source tracking (BST). We applied the statistical method known as classification trees to build a model for BST for the Anacostia Watershed in Maryland. Classification trees have more flexibility than other statistical classification approaches based on standard statistical methods to accommodate complex interactions among ARA variables. This article describes the use of classification trees for BST and includes discussion of its principal parameters and features. Anacostia Watershed ARA data are used to illustrate the application of classification trees, and we report the BST results for the watershed.
