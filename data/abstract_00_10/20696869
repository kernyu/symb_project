The oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid targets the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) on the bacterial ribosome. Thirteen single and four double 23S rRNA mutations were introduced into a Mycobacterium smegmatis strain with a single rRNA operon. Converting bacterial base identity by single mutations at positions 2032, 2453, and 2499 to human cytosolic base identity did not confer significantly reduced susceptibility to linezolid. The largest decrease in linezolid susceptibility for any of the introduced single mutations was observed with the G2576U mutation at a position that is 7.9 A from linezolid. Smaller decreases were observed with the A2503G, U2504G, and G2505A mutations at nucleotides proximal to linezolid, showing that the degree of resistance conferred is not simply inversely proportional to the nucleotide-drug distance. The double mutations G2032A-C2499A, G2032A-U2504G, C2055A-U2504G, and C2055A-A2572U had remarkable synergistic effects on linezolid resistance relative to the effects of the corresponding single mutations. This study emphasizes that effects of rRNA mutations at the PTC are organism dependent. Moreover, the data show a nonpredictable cross-resistance pattern between linezolid, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and valnemulin. The data underscore the significance of mutations at distal nucleotides, either alone or in combination with other mutated nucleotides, in contributing to linezolid resistance.
