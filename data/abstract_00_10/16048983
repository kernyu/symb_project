Two clinical Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, identified as resistant to macrolides and chloramphenicol and nonsusceptible to linezolid, were found to contain 6-bp deletions in the gene encoding riboprotein L4. The gene transformed susceptible strain R6 so that it exhibited such resistance, with the transformants also showing a fitness cost. We demonstrate a novel bacterial mechanism of resistance to chloramphenicol and nonsusceptibility to linezolid.
