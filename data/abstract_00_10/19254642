Beta-lactam drugs, whose mechanism of action is inhibition of the last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis, are the largest family of antimicrobial agents and the most widely used in current clinical practice. These drugs have a slow, time-dependent bactericidal action, generally good distribution in the body, and low toxicity. Modifications of the original molecule have led to new compounds with a greater antimicrobial spectrum and activity; nonetheless, the use and efficacy of beta-lactams is limited in some clinical settings, owing to the increasing emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Despite this problem, penicillin remains the treatment of choice in a large number of infections, cephalosporins have a wide range of indications, carbapenems are used in nosocomially-acquired infection and infection caused by multiresistant microorganisms, and beta-lactam inhibitors restore the spectrum of activity of their companion penicillins (aminopenicillins, ureidopenicillins) when resistance is caused by beta lactamase production.
