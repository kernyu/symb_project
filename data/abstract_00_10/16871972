The aim of this study was to evaluate the transfer frequency of plasmids encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) from clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae to E. coli K12 C600 recipient strain. Additionally, resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs of the isolates as well as transconjugants were analyzed. Fifty-four clinical strains belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were isolated from children hospitalized in Medical University Hospital in Wroclaw. All the strains studied were identified in automatic ATB system using ID32E tests. Besides, they were ESBL-positive as was confirmed by the double-disc synergy test (DDST). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for twelve selected antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. The majority of the strains (87%) were able to transfer plasmid-mediated ESBL to E. coli K12 C600 recipient strain with a frequencies ranged from 10(-5) to 10(-1) per donor cell. All the isolates studied as well as their transconjugants were susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and norfloxacin (MIC <1mg/L). On the other hand, these strains displayed high level of resistance (MIC 512 - >1024 mg/L) to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, gentamycin, amikacin and cotrimoxazole. Genetic markers conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole were often co-transferred to recipient strain in conjugation process.
