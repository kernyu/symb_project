In the last 3 decades, systemic candidiasis has become increasingly recognized as a major source of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised pediatric patients. As the number of children receiving chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantations continue to increase, clinicians should expect that invasive infections from Candida spp. will also increase in these vulnerable hosts. Fortunately, in the past 15 years, the evolution of older antifungals coupled with the discovery of new classes of antifungal agents has equipped physicians with reasonable options for treating these otherwise life-threatening infections.This review aims to familiarize the reader with the evolving epidemiology of candidiasis in immunocompromised children as well as discuss therapeutic options from each class of antifungal agents. Mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, toxicities, resistance patterns, chemotherapy interactions, and clinical relevance in immunocompromised children are reviewed for polyenes, flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine), azoles, and echinocandins.
