BACKGROUND: Multiresistant, extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens are an increasing problem in daily clinical life. This paper summarizes the development of resistance as well as epidemiology, diagnostics, and treatment of ESBL-producing micro-organisms. We analyzed microbiological data collected at the Grosshadern Clinic in Germany between 1996 and 2007, in order to assess the importance of these micro-organisms to medical practice and surgical care units. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pathogens were isolated from 28,894 patients with Escherichia coli and 10,903 with Klebsiella pneumoniae pathogens between 1996 and 2006 and tested for ESBL production. For the year 2007 we have analyzed the complete spectrum of ESBL-producing pathogens and their distribution to different departments of the clinic. The agar diffusion test with five cephalosporins and an automated detection system (BD Phoenix) were used for screening purposes. Positive results were verified with the E- and double-disc agar diffusion tests. RESULTS: The most important pathogens isolated from patients were E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Analysis of ESBL-producing E. coli pathogens from 1996 to 2006 showed the prevalence increasing from 0% to 4.1%. For ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, we also found a prevalence rising from 0.3% in 1996 to 6.6% in 2006. For the year 2007 a further increase in ESBL-producing pathogens was detected, reaching 182 cases, with 118 of ESBL-producing E. coli (5.7 %) and 39 of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (7.4%). Of these, 24 cases with E. coli and nine with K. pneumoniae were surgery patients (20% and 23%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results show an increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing pathogens in hospitalized patients and in surgical departments. The resulting rise in treatment costs and patient risk require thorough knowledge of risk factors, therapy, and preventive measures.
