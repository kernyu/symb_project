There is intense antimicrobial use in long-term-care facilities (LTCFs), and studies repeatedly document that much of this use is inappropriate. The current crisis in antimicrobial resistance, which encompasses the LTCF, heightens concerns of antimicrobial use. Attempts to improve antimicrobial use in the LTCF are complicated by characteristics of the patient population, limited availability of diagnostic tests, and the virtual absence of relevant clinical trials. This position paper recommends approaches to management of common infections in LTCF patients and proposes minimal standards for an antimicrobial review program. In developing these recommendations, the position paper acknowledges the unique aspects of provision of care in the LTCF.
