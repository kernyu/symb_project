OBJECTIVE: Paediatric HIV treatment must address various special considerations. Administration of pharmacokinetically enhanced protease inhibitors (PIs) can improve paediatric therapeutic outcomes. The objective of this study was to review the use of boosted PI regimens in children. METHODS: Systematic literature searches of published manuscripts and conference databases using generic drug names and specific keywords were performed to ensure thorough and balanced reporting of available data. RESULTS: Boosted PI regimens offer multiple options across a range of ages and are efficacious in naive and experienced children; safety and tolerability are similar to those observed in adults. Novel boosted PI simplification approaches may foster adherence and diminish resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Boosted PIs are key components of first- and second-line treatments in children. Identifying factors associated with the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy in children may ultimately permit individualized therapies.
