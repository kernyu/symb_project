OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of non-target gene mutations and reduced permeability of the outer membrane on quinolone resistance and multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) in Escherichia coli. METHODS: Several high-level quinolone resistant isolates whose strains were accompanied by concurrent resistant to several antibiotics were selected. The PCR products of marOR region were sequenced to detect the possible gene changes and then the strains' outer membrane proteins (Omps) were extracted to analyze on the constitutive profiles. RESULTS: We found two site mutations in R410 isolate: 1,870(T-->C, Val-->Ala) and 1,879(A-->C, terminator-->Ser). The OmpF deficiency was found in all 3 resistant strains. CONCLUSION: The increased expression of MarA induced by gene mutations in marOR and the constitutive profile changes of the Omps (OmpF deficient strains) may play some role in the quinolone resistance and multiple antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli.
