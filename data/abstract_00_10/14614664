Despite the recent approval of lamivudine for the treatment of children with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, there is insufficient information on the kinetics of HBV clearance and the factors that predict a favorable treatment response to lamivudine in this population. In a small retrospective study of 16 HBV-infected children treated with lamivudine, we examined changes in virus load and other factors associated with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) clearance. High pretherapy alanine aminotransferase level, low serum HBV DNA load, and age at the start of treatment were independently associated with HBeAg clearance. HBeAg clearance was also associated with the achievement of specific levels of virus suppression, and failure to achieve those levels was associated with the development of lamivudine resistance. Additional studies are necessary to provide better indications and guidelines for the treatment of children with chronic HBV infection.
