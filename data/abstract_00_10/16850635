OBJECTIVES: To study the antibiotic susceptibility of common community- and hospital-acquired bacteria in Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Eight common bacterial pathogens were studied in 24 hospitals across Thailand in 2002-2003. Isolates of clinically proven infections were tested for their susceptibility by agar-based disc diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of 9,091 isolates of target bacteria were studied. Community and hospital acquired bacteria accounted for 54.9% and 45.1% respectively. Community acquired Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus were more susceptible to antimicrobials compared to hospital acquired strains. The difference in susceptibility of community-acquired vs hospital acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus spp. was less impressive indicating the spread of hospital strains into the community. Bacteria isolated from the blood stream were more susceptible to antimicrobials compared to those from the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical sites. Acinetobacter spp. and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible to antimicrobials compared to others. CONCLUSION: Decreased susceptibility to antimicrobials was found in all bacteria tested. The susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials of community-acquired bacteria decreased to a critical level indicating the widespread resistant bacteria to the community.
