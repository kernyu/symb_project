Peroxiredoxin-3 (Prdx3) is a mitochondrial member of the antioxidant family of thioredoxin peroxidases that uses mitochondrial thioredoxin-2 (Trx2) as a source of reducing equivalents to scavenge hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Low levels of H(2)O(2) produced by the mitochondria regulate physiological processes, including cell proliferation, while high levels of H(2)O(2) are toxic to the cell and cause apoptosis. WEHI7.2 thymoma cells with stable overexpression of Prdx3 displayed decreased levels of cellular H(2)O(2) and decreased cell proliferation without a change in basal levels of apoptosis. Prdx3-transfected cells showed a marked resistance to hypoxia-induced H(2)O(2) formation and apoptosis. Prdx3 overexpression also protected the cells against apoptosis caused by H(2)O(2), t-butylhydroperoxide, and the anticancer drug imexon, but not by dexamethasone. Thus, mitochondrial Prdx3 is an important cellular antioxidant that regulates physiological levels of H(2)O(2), leading to decreased cell growth while protecting cells from the apoptosis-inducing effects of high levels of H(2)O(2).
