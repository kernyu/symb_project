Neuroendocrine specific protein or reticulon 1 (NSP/RTN1) was identified as a putative ethanol-regulated gene using mRNA differential display in mice genetically selected for severe ethanol withdrawal (withdrawal seizure-prone, WSP). One transcript of RTN1 (3.0 kb) showed a statistically significant increase (13%) in relative abundance in whole brain of ethanol-treated WSP mice but not in mice selected for resistance to ethanol withdrawal convulsions (WSR). We hypothesized that ethanol-induced regulation of gene expression of mRTN1 is specific to mice predisposed to exhibit severe ethanol withdrawal and that the gene might be regulated differentially in specific brain regions. WSP and WSR selected lines and DBA/2J and C57BL/6J inbred strains of mice were exposed to ethanol vapor or air for 72 h. mRNA steady-state expression of RTN1 was assessed in hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum. Results indicated that the pattern of ethanol-induced changes in gene expression was dependent upon transcript size, brain region, and genotype. Modest increases in the relative abundance of both transcripts of RTN1 were observed in the hippocampus and cortex of all ethanol-treated mice. Results from cerebellum showed a moderate decrease in expression of RTN1 (3.0 kb transcript) in WSP and DBA/2J mice, but not in the mice resistant to ethanol withdrawal (C57BL/6J and WSR). These results suggest a genotype-specific effect of chronic ethanol exposure on steady-state mRNA levels of RTN1 in the cerebellum. Overall, the results indicate a complex pattern of ethanol-induced regulation of the putative mouse homologue of RTN1 and suggest that specific brain regional changes may be involved in the expression of physical dependence.
