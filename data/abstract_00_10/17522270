Sixty-one Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates of animal and human origin, matched by phage type, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and place of isolation, were analyzed by microbiological and molecular techniques, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and plasmid profiling. PFGE identified 10 profiles that clustered by phage type and antibiotic resistance pattern with human and animal isolates distributed among different PFGE profiles. Genomic DNA was purified from 23 representative strains and hybridized to the composite Salmonella DNA microarray, and specific genomic regions that exhibited significant variation between isolates were identified. Bioinformatic analysis showed that variable regions of DNA were associated with prophage-like elements. Subsequently, simple multiplex PCR assays were designed on the basis of these variable regions that could be used to discriminate between S. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates from the same geographical region. These multiplex PCR assays, based on prophage-like elements and Salmonella genomic island 1, provide a simple method for identifying new variants of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in the field.
