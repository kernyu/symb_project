A study on slaughter pigs from Saskatchewan detected Salmonella organisms in 12.5% and 5.2% of cecal content and ileocaecal lymph node samples, respectively. Cecal content prevalence was associated with larger farms and longer lairage periods. Antimicrobial resistance was detected in 41.5% of the isolates. Salmonella Enteritidis was the second most prevalent serotype.
