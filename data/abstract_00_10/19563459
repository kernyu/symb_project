BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance of Helicobacter pylori is a growing problem in clinical practice, particularly clarithromycin resistance. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the prevalence of H. pylori resistance to antimicrobial agents in Japanese children. METHODS: A total of 61 H. pylori strains isolated from children (mean age, 12.6 years; range, 4-18 years) between 1999 and 2007 were studied for primary antimicrobial resistance, using a microdilution method. In addition, the eradication rate with lansoprazole-based triple regimens was determined. RESULTS: The overall resistance rate of clarithromycin, amoxicillin and metronidazole was 36.1%, 0% and 14.8%, respectively. Resistance to both clarithromycin and metronidazole was detected in 6.6% of the strains. The rate of clarithromycin-resistant strains was 32.4% from 1999 to 2002 and 40.7% from 2003 to 2007, and clarithromycin minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)) increased fourfold from 1999-2002 to 2003-2007, with all clarithromycin-resistant strains showing low-level resistance. Metronidazole resistance rates were not different between these two study periods. Regimens involving amoxicillin and clarithromycin (n= 49) had a higher eradication rate in clarithromycin-susceptible strains (97.1%) than in the resistant strains (57.1%; P < 0.001). There was no difference in the eradication rate between 7 day and 10 or 14 day courses of the regimens (P= 0.53). The regimen with amoxicillin and metronidazole produced successful eradication in all nine patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: Clarithromycin resistance of H. pylori is high, and triple regimen treatment containing clarithromycin should be decided based on susceptibility to the agent.
