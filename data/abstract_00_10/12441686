Antibiotic resistance in Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, one of most frequent etiologic pathogens of food-borne bacterial gastroenteritidis in humans, is a serious health problem worldwide. Fifteen and 22 each of S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium were isolated from animals from 1983 to 1999 in Korea and tested for their antibiotic resistance patterns and phage types. S. enteritides isolates were highly resistant to sulfonamides (86.7%) and four of them (26.6%) showed multiple antibiotic resistance. The most frequent phage type (PT) of S. enteritids was PT1 (33.3%) even though none of them had multiple antibiotic resistance. S. typhimurium isolates were highly resistant to streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline, 100%, 95.5%, and 86.4% respectively. The incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance of S. typhimurium isolates was extremely high (100%) comparing to S. enteritidis isolates (26.7%). Two of the five ACSSuT type S. typhimurium isolates, resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline, were phage type DT104. All S. typhimurium isolates were sensitive to florfenicol. For the rapid detection of multiple antibiotic resistant S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium isolates, particularly ACSSuT type S. typhimurium DT104, antibiotic resistance genes, cmlA/tetR, PSE-1, and TEM, and Salmonella spp. Specific gene, SipB/C, were amplified using four pairs of primers in hot-started multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Two Korean isolates of S. typhimurium DT104 showed TEM amplicons instead of PSE-1 for the ampicillin resistance. The multiplex PCR used in this study was useful in rapid detection of ACSSuT type S. typhimurium and identification of b-lactamase gene distribution among Salmonella isolates.
