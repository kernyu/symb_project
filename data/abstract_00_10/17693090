To establish the role of the ferrocenyl moiety in the antiplasmodial activity of ferroquine, compounds in which this moiety is replaced by the corresponding ruthenium-based moieties were synthesized and evaluated. In both the sensitive (D10) and resistant (K1) strains of Plasmodium falciparum, ruthenoquine analogues showed comparable potency to ferroquine. This suggests that a probable role of the ferrocenyl fragment is to serve simply as a hydrophobic spacer group. In addition, ferroquine analogues with different aromatic substituents were synthesized and evaluated. Unexpectedly high activity for quinoline compounds lacking the 7-chloro substituent suggests the ferrocenyl moiety may have an additive and/or synergistic effect.
