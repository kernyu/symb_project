In 2001, Buenaventura, Colombia, the rate of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis was of 66 per 100,000 inhabitants. The poor control of the tuberculosis in this city during the last 10 years and the inadequate use of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs was an opportune situation for the development of high resistance to these drugs. Two surveys of initial resistance to first-line antituberculosis drugs were conducted in new cases of pulmonary TB, in the city of Buenaventura--the first from August 1, of 1997 to January 31 of 1998 and the second from November 15, of 2000 to November 15, 2001. The method of multiple proportions was used to determine drug susceptibility. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in 93% and 55% of the new cases of lung TB during each respective period. The initial resistance to at least one drug was 25% (9/36) and 32% (23/72), respectively. The initial multi-drug resistance (defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) was 6% for both surveys. This demonstrates the dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacilli and shows the need for surveillance of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in control of the disease, particularly in those areas where the TB control program has been erratically applied. In areas where multi-drug resistant TB occurs, the control strategy should be enhanced with the careful introduction of second-line drugs.
