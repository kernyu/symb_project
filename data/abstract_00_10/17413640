A 60-year-old woman under treatment for a left lower eyelid abscess developed a right caruncle abscess. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was identified in cultures performed on both lesions. Treatment consisted of oral ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin drops. There was resolution of both lesions with incision and drainage, and antibiotic therapy. MRSA is a pathogen that can be readily isolated from the caruncle. The authors are unaware of previous reported cases of a MRSA caruncle abscess.
