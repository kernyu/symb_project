LBM415 (NVP PDF-713) is the first member of the peptide deformylase (PDF) inhibitor class being developed for clinical trials as a parenteral and oral agent for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract disease and serious infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive cocci. In this study susceptibility testing results from 1,306 recent clinical isolates selected to over-represent resistance trends among the species were summarized. All staphylococci (153 strains; MIC at which 90% of isolates were inhibited [MIC90], 2 microg/ml), Streptococcus pneumoniae (170 strains; MIC90, 1 microg/ml), other streptococci (150 strains; MIC90, 1 microg/ml), enterococci (104 strains; MIC90, 4 microg/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (103 strains; MIC90, 0.5 microg/ml), and Legionella pneumophila (50 strains; MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml) were inhibited at < or = 8 microg of LBM415/ml, as were 97% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates (300 strains; MIC90, 4 to 8 microg/ml). Among other bacterial groups, 100% of gram-positive and -negative anaerobes, including 22 Bacteroides spp. strains (31 strains total; MIC90, 1 microg/ml), were inhibited by < or = 4 microg/ml, whereas Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains) and most nonfermentative bacilli (107 strains) were not inhibited at readily achievable concentrations. The compound was found to have a dominantly bacteriostatic action, and spontaneous single-step mutational rates occurred at low levels (10(-6) to <10(-8)). Drug interaction studies failed to identify any class-specific synergistic interactions, nor were antagonistic interactions observed. Variations in broth and agar MIC test conditions demonstrated that, whereas the agar-based method trended towards a 1-log2 dilution-higher MIC than the broth method and was inoculum dependent, other variations in incubation environment, medium supplements, pH, or calcium concentration had little influence on LBM415 MIC results. Use of the efflux inhibitor phe-arg-beta-naphthylamide showed an average of 1 log2 dilution decrease in H. influenzae MICs, demonstrating the contribution of efflux pumps in influencing susceptibility to PDF inhibitors. The in vitro activity of LBM415 against targeted bacterial species, including resistant subsets, and other laboratory characteristics of this novel compound demonstrate the potential of PDF inhibitors as a new class of antimicrobial agents.
