In the present study, it was shown that repetitive-DNA-element PCR fingerprinting using the (GTG)5 primer [(GTG)5-PCR] is a rapid and reliable tool to genotypically differentiate members of the recently described pan-European multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MAB) clone III from the known MAB clones I and II. The identification of four new representatives of the MAB clone III dating from 1991 to 1993 by (GTG)5-PCR indicates that this clone has persisted in European hospitals since the beginning of the 1990s. Tetracycline (TET) resistance was found to be common among clone III strains, including one strain that also displayed resistance to minocycline. The TET-resistance phenotype in this MAB clone appeared to be strongly associated with the presence of the efflux-type gene tet(A), but the fact that some members lack this gene or have acquired an additional tet gene [i.e. tet(M)] suggests that the tet gene carriage in the pan-European clone III population may have diversified in time and space. In contrast, all clone III strains shared the previously described aminoglycoside resistotype encoded by the aminoglycoside-modifying genes aphA6 and the class 1 integron-associated aadB, which may point to the fact that these genes probably are more stably inherited in MAB clone III compared to tet genes.
