The worldwide spread of erythromycin A-resistant streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, is of concern. Many studies have demonstrated that the viridans group streptococci can be a reservoir of erythromycin A resistance. Within oral streptoccoci, an important difference in the susceptibility pattern has been noted. The purpose of this short editorial is to highlight the importance of this group of bacteria as a reservoir of resistance to erythromycin A and the possible transfer of resistance to S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes.
