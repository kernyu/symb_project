The advent of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the 1990s and the threat posed by vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus led to the development of several new antimicrobial agents active against these pathogens. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was the first such drug to be commercially available but adverse effects have meant that the drug is now rarely used. Linezolid, the first antimicrobial of the oxazolidinone class, has met with more widespread use and has both an intravenous and an oral formulation. Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antimicrobial that is rapidly bactericidal against S. aureus. It is effective in the therapy of S. aureus bloodstream infections but is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant, making it of no use in the therapy of pneumonia. Tigecycline, by contrast, is bacteriostatic against most pathogens but has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and has enhanced penetration into many tissues. Other new antibiotics (dalbavancin, telavancin, ceftobiprole and doripenem) are currently under clinical development and hold promise for widespread clinical use in the next decade.
