A survey is given of the main classes of bacteriocins, produced by lactic acid bacteria: I. lantibiotics II. small heat-stable non-lanthionine containing membrane-active peptides and III. large heat-labile proteins. First, their mode of action is detailed, with emphasis on pore formation in the cytoplasmatic membrane. Subsequently, the molecular genetics of several classes of bacteriocins are described in detail, with special attention to nisin as the most prominent example of the lantibiotic-class. Of the small non-lanthionine bacteriocin class, the Lactococcus lactococcins, and the Lactobacillus sakacin A and plantaricin A-bacteriocins are discussed. The principles and mechanisms of immunity and resistance towards bacteriocins are also briefly reported. The biosynthesis of bacteriocins is treated in depth with emphasis on response regulation, post-translational modification, secretion and proteolytic activation of bacteriocin precursors. To conclude, the role of the leader peptides is outlined and a conceptual model for bacteriocin maturation is proposed.
