This study investigated the phenotypic and genetic properties of 28 clinical isolates of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Chryseobacterium indologenes recovered from a university hospital. Twenty isolates were confirmed to carry a bla(IND) gene. Among them, 9 isolates were confirmed to carry the IND-1 gene, 10 contained the IND-2 gene and 1 had bla(IND-3) alleles. One strain (No. 7) confirmed to be carrying the bla(IND-1) gene was susceptible to imipenem and was negative in phenotypic methods. The data revealed that the antimicrobial resistance patterns of C. indologenes harbouring MBL genes are remarkably distinct. Two specific types of MBL genes, bla(IND-1) and bla(IND-2), were identified to be the major genotype for C. indologenes isolated from Hefei, China.
