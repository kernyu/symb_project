A 53-year-old woman experienced a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii urinary tract infection 5 months after undergoing kidney and liver transplantation. The tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for her A. baumannii isolate was 1.5 microg/ml; the patient received 2 weeks of therapy with intravenous tigecycline as a 100-mg loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours, with no lapses in treatment and with resolution of the infection. Three weeks later, MDR A. baumannii was isolated from her sputum in the setting of clinical evidence of pneumonia, and tigecycline was restarted; the tigecycline MIC for the A. baumannii isolate was 2 microg/ml. At approximately the same time, the patient was found to have a paraspinal abscess and spinal osteomyelitis. Cultures of the abscess fluid grew A. baumannii with a tigecycline MIC of 24 microg/ml. A follow-up sputum culture again yielded A. baumannii, but with a tigecycline MIC of 24 microg/ml. Urine culture at that time also grew A. baumannii with a tigecycline MIC of 24 microg/ml. Clinicians should be aware that tigecycline MICs for A. baumannii isolates may increase during therapy with tigecycline after only brief exposure to the drug. Patients receiving tigecycline for Acinetobacter should be monitored for the development of clinical resistance, and isolates should be monitored for evidence of microbiologic resistance.
