As microbes become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, and in many cases to several drugs simultaneously, the search is on to find new therapies. One method to combat resistance is to use inhibitors of resistance mechanisms to potentiate existing antibiotics. Recent efforts are encouraging and highlight the importance of research at the chemistry-microbiology interface in developing new approaches to tackle resistance.
