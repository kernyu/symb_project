Using quantitative deep HIV-1 sequencing in a subject who developed virological failure to deep salvage therapy with raltegravir, we found that most Q148R and N155H mutants detected at the time of virological failure originated from pre-existing minority Q148R and N155H variants through independent evolutionary clusters. Double 148R+N155H mutants were also detected in 1.7% of viruses at virological failure in association with E138K and/or G163R. Our findings illustrate the ability of HIV-1 to escape from suboptimal antiretroviral drug pressure through selection of pre-existing drug-resistant mutants, underscoring the importance of using fully active antiretroviral regimens to treat all HIV-1-infected subjects.
