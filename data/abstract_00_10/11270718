The quinolone class of inhibitors of bacterial type II topoisomerases has gained major clinical importance during the last years due to improvements in both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. These include favorable bioavailability allowing oral administration, good tolerability, high tissue concentrations as well as superior bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant pathogens, like enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginoso, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, no enzymatic mechanism of drug inactivation exists in bacteria and no indications for transfer of clinically relevant resistance exist. Nevertheless, resistance is being increasingly reported, even for naturally highly susceptible species like Escherichia coli. The underlying mechanisms of resistance include alterations in both bacterial targets, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, often combined with mutations affecting drug accumulation, e.g., by increased drug efflux, reduced drug influx, or both. Investigations aiming at understanding the molecular mechanisms of quinolone action and resistance in more detail should provide a basis for a rational design of more potent derivatives. In addition, a prudent use of these highly valuable "magic bullets" is necessary to preserve their potential for the future.
