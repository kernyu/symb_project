A large number of callus from mature seeds of indica rice minghui 63 were obtained through pre-induction on medium with 2 mg/L 2,4-D but without inorganic and organic components for 9 days. Trichosanthin gene was transferred into indica rice minghui 63 by using agrobacterium with the help of bombardment and the transgenic plants were obtained by inducing regeneration. Southern and Western blot analysis showed that the trichosanthin gene had been transferred into genome of minghui 63 and expressed in rice plants. The anti-fungal assay suggested that transgenic rice plants enhanced resistance to infection of Pyricularia oryzae.
