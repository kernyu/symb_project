OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) has been increasing in recent years. Piperacillin (PIPC) is one of a few beta-lactams possessing good activity against BLNAR H. influenzae. We studied clinical efficacy of piperacillin and its beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) in children with lower respiratory tract infection caused by H. influenzae including resistance strains. METHODS: Subjects were 20 children with lower respiratory tract infection caused by H. influenzae treated with PIPC 100mg/kg/day (7 cases) or TAZ/PIPC 125mg/kg/day (13 cases). We selected cases from which resistant H. influenzae strains might be detected. Patients received prior antimicrobial therapy within two weeks before admission, or with underlying diseases. We examined patient profiles, clinical efficacy, susceptibilities for 6 beta-lactam antibiotics [PIPC, TAZ/PIPC, ampicillin (ABPC), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CTRX), and meropenem (MEPM)] and analyzed 6 genotype patterns of beta-lactam resistant genes by PCR. RESULTS: Efficacy was 7/7 in patients in PIPC group and 12/13 in patients in TAZ/PIPC group. Diminished efficacy was seen in only one case complicated with severe RSV infection. The susceptibility of all strains but one beta-lactamase producing, ABPC resistant (BLP) strain to PIPC and of all to TAZ/ PIPC was below 0.25 microg/mL. The genotype of the 15 strains isolated from the sputum on administration was as follows; beta-lactamase nonproducing, ABPC-susceptible (gBLNAS) strains were 4, gBLP strain was 1, beta-lactamase nonproducing, and ABPC-resistant (gLow-BLNAR) strains were 2, beta-lactamase nonproducing, ABPC resistant (gBLNAR) strains were 8. CONCLUSION: PIPC and TAZ/PIPC were useful against lower respiratory tract infection caused by H. influenzae including BLNAR in children.
