Chronic hepatitis B is associated with the development of cirrhosis in more than one third of patients and in a large proportion of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Current standard treatment includes pegylated interferon alfa-2a and five oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogues: entecavir, tenofovir, adefovir, telbivudine and lamivudine (listed according to antiviral efficacy). The advantage of interferon treatment is the possibility of long-term remission in one third of carefully selected HbeAg+ patients without development of resistance. However, interferon treatment is not efficient in the majority of patients. The advantage of treatment with nucleoside and nucleotide analogues is the possibility to suppress HBV DNA to undetectable levels in 70%-90% of patients. However, analogue treatment is a long-term treatment (possibly life-long) and is associated with the development of resistance.
