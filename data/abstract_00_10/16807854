We describe the first emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in Australia. Ninety A. baumannii isolates recovered from cultures of blood specimens from 69 patients were analyzed. Overall, 58 isolates (64%) were resistant to meropenem. The chi 2 test for linear trend revealed that emergence of carbapenem resistance was statistically significant during the 32-month study period. Selected isolates were of the same clonal type, and no genes encoding carbapenemases were identified.
