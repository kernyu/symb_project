The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella organisms, especially Salmonella Typhimurium DT104, has been reported in many countries, including the United States and Canada. The purposes of this study were to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella isolated from hog, beef, and chicken carcasses from provincially inspected abattoirs in Ontario and to determine the agreement between the agar dilution method and the microbroth dilution method for measurement of antimicrobial resistance of the isolates. Antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates from hogs (n = 71), beef (n = 24), and chicken (n = 295) to amikacin, ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline was determined using the two methods. None of the 390 isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin at levels of 0.125 microg/ml. All chicken and hog isolates were sensitive to amikacin, whereas all beef isolates were sensitive to both amikacin and gentamicin. Multiple antimicrobial resistance (resistance to more than one antimicrobial) was found in 29% of bovine isolates and 42% of porcine isolates using both methods for testing and in 42% by the agar dilution and 33% by the microbroth dilution methods in the chicken isolates. Overall, there was good agreement between the two test methods for resistance to most of the antimicrobials, with disagreement found in the results in 1.3% of the isolates for ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole, 8.2% for streptomycin, 5.6% for cephalothin, and 1.0% of the isolates for tetracycline. The lack of agreement between the two test methods was found mostly among the chicken isolates.
