OBJECTIVE: The incidence, clinical features, and prognosis of bacteremia due to Acinetobacter baumannii were investigated. METHODS: Prospective study of all episodes of A. baumanii bacteremia detected during the period of January 1995 to December 1998. A. baumannii was identified using recent standard methods. RESULTS: A total of 133 episodes of bacteremia due to A. baumannii were studied, all of them nosocomial-acquired. The incidence-density diminished from 2.02 episodes per 10,000 patient-days to 0.40 episodes per 10,000 patient-days after the implementation of a control program. Most of the patients (70%) were, or had been, in the ICU when bacteremia occurred. Some 80% of patients had a chronic illness and 62% had a Hilf's severity score > 4. Among the strains identified, 74% were multidrug-resistant and 28% were imipenem-resistant. Attributable mortality was 25.6%. Multivariate analysis showed that inappropriate antibiotic treatment, septic shock, and high Hilf's severity score were associated with poorer prognosis. CONCLUSION: A. baumannii bacteremia mainly affects severely ill patients who have undergone several invasive procedures, and who may have relevant associated morbidity and mortality. Among other variables, inappropriate antibiotic treatment was a risk factor for increased mortalilty.
