Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) predominantly affects those over 65 years old. There may be a substantial pool of older people with MRSA in the community. We studied the prevalence in one London general practice, screening 258 older people living in their own home. MRSA (E-MRSA 15) was found in two participants (0.78%). Past history of MRSA was the only significant risk factor. The results of this and other studies suggest that national guidelines recommending early discharge for MRSA carriers have not resulted in widespread community acquisition amongst elderly people living in their own home. Community antibiotic policies for skin and soft-tissue infection do not require amendment. Patients with previous MRSA should be isolated and screened on admission especially to high-risk units.
