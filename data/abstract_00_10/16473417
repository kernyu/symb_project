The HIV protease inhibitor P-1946 is a member of a novel family of l-Lysine derivatives. The compound is a specific HIV-1 protease inhibitor that has potent and selective in vitro antiviral activity (EC50 152 nM) against a range of isolates resistant to commercially available protease inhibitors. The presence of at least four primary and four secondary drug resistance mutations is required to achieve greater than four-fold resistance to P-1946. P-1946's favorable resistance profile makes it a good lead for the development of new agents active against existing PI-resistant virus in treatment-experienced patient.
