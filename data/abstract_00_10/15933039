The occurrence of strains that are resistant to oxolinic acid, oxytetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and nitrofurantoin among heterotrophic bacteria, including human and fish pathogens, in two freshwater eel farms was investigated. High levels of individual- and multiple-drug-resistant bacteria were detected, although sampling events were not correlated with clinical outbreaks and drug therapy.
