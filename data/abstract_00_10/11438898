Mycobacterium haemophilum, a recently described pathogen, can cause an array of symptoms in immunocompromised patients. To date, 90 patients with this infection have been described worldwide. We report our institution's experience with 23 patients who were treated from 1990 through 2000. Fourteen patients had undergone bone marrow transplantation, 5 were infected with human immunodeficiency virus, 3 had hematologic malignancies, and 1 had no known underlying immunosuppression. Clinical syndromes on presentation included skin lesions alone in 13 patients, arthritis or osteomyelitis in 4 patients, and lung disease in 6 patients. Although patients with skin or joint involvement had favorable outcomes, 5 of 7 patients with lung infection died. Prolonged courses of multidrug therapy are required for treatment. A diagnosis of M. haemophilum infection must be considered for any immunocompromised patient for whom acid-fast bacilli are identified in a cutaneous, synovial fluid or respiratory sample or for whom granulomas are identified in any pathological specimen.
