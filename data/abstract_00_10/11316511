In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) illness, the reverse transcriptase and protease (PRT) enzymes of HIV are currently the targets of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Nucleoside analogues were the first group of ARV drugs that exerted antiviral activity in patients. More recently, PRT inhibitors have provided new approaches in the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. Impressive clinical results have been obtained with combination therapies of three ARV drugs, including one PRT inhibitor. It is worth mentioning also that apart from these two main drug groups, there are many new compounds under development, including a vaccine(s) against HIV.
