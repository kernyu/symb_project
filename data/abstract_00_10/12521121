Five isolates of a slow-growing cycloheximide resistant hyphomycetous fungus were obtained from nail specimens and investigated for their relationship to Onychocola canadensis (teleomorph Arachnomyces nodosetosus), a known agent of onychomycosis. In one patient diagnosed with superficial white onychomycosis, etiology was confirmed by a nail sample showing atypical filaments in direct microscopy, and by a follow-up specimen yielding cultures of the same fungus. A case of mixed infection with Aspergillus sydowii was also confirmed after examination of cultures grown from three successive microscopic-positive hallux nail specimens. For other isolates, etiological significance could not be confirmed by repeat sampling or results of direct microscopy were negative or unknown. Mating experiments yielded setose ascomata containing smooth oblate ascospores typical of Arachnomyces species. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS 2 region sequences support the conspecificity of the isolates and their placement within the genus. A. kanei sp. nov. (anamorph O. kanei sp. nov.) is described.
