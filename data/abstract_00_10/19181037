Selective screening media for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria are needed to guide antibiotic therapy and institute appropriate infection control measures. This study evaluates a selective cefpodoxime-incorporated chromogenic agar (CCA) medium for the detection of ESBLs from clinical specimens. The medium was formulated specifically for this study. For all culture-positive urine samples and wound swabs from intensive care unit (ICU) patients, CCA was compared with standard laboratory testing procedures and HPA/BSAC guidance on ESBL detection. The CCA medium was also evaluated for ESBL faecal carriage from patients on ICU and the haematology ward. These patients had no prior evidence of colonisation or infection with ESBL-producing bacteria. All ESBL isolates underwent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing to cefpodoxime. The Miles and Misra method and the ecometric methods were used to quality control the microbiological performance of the CCA medium, which proved satisfactory. A total of 750 specimens were examined (690 urines, 40 faeces, 20 wound swabs). From urine cultures, 92 suspect colonies were followed up. Eighteen were cefpodoxime-resistant on routine disc testing and all were confirmed subsequently as ESBL-positive. Conventional laboratory methods identified only two urinary ESBLs. Wound cultures revealed two suspect colonies, both of which were ESBL-positive and were also detected by routine methods. Faecal samples produced 10 suspect colonies, six of which were ESBL-positive. All ESBLs had cefpodoxime MICs >10 mg /L (75% were >256 mg/L). Thus, primary conventional culture methods cannot be relied upon to detect suspect ESBL-producing bacteria.
