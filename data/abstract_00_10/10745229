The hepatitis C virus (HCV) interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) has been shown to suppress double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) activity in vitro in a yeast PKR expression system. Since variability of ISDR was shown to correlate with nonresponsiveness to IFN-alpha therapy in chronically HCV-infected patients, it has been suggested that prototype ISDR might be a viral inhibitor of cellular PKR. The present study evaluates the biological significance of ISDR variability in situ, relating it to PKR-mediated cellular antiviral responses within the liver. ISDR variability was determined in patients chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 3a by direct sequencing using liver-derived RNA preparations as starting material. As surrogate parameters for PKR-mediated cellular responses, hepatic endogenous IFN-alpha gene expression as well as MxA expression were analysed by a competitive, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique. Irrespectively of intra- or intergenotypic ISDR amino acid substitutions, ISDR variability was found not to correlate with endogenous hepatic IFN-alpha or with hepatic MxA gene expression. The data suggest that at least two prominent PKR-mediated cellular responses might be largely unaffected by HCV ISDR variability.
