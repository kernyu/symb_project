Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bloodstream infections (VRE-BSI) are a growing problem with few clinical trials to guide therapy. We conducted a retrospective study of management and predictors of mortality for VRE-BSI at a tertiary-care centre from January 2005 to August 2008. Univariate and multivariable analyses examined the relationship of patient characteristics and antibiotic therapy with 30-day all-cause mortality. Rates of VRE-BSI increased from 0.06 to 0.17 infections/1000 patient-days (P=0.03). For 235 patients, 30-day mortality was 34.9%. Patients were primarily treated with linezolid (44.2%) or daptomycin (36.5%). Factors associated with mortality were haemodialysis [odds ratio (OR) 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-6.3, P=0.007], mechanical ventilation (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3-10.4, P=0.01), and malnutrition (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-4.0, P=0.046). Use of linezolid, but not daptomycin (P=0.052) showed a trend towards an association with survival. In conclusion, VRE-BSI is a growing problem, associated with significant 30-day mortality. Multiple factors were associated with poor outcomes at our hospital.
