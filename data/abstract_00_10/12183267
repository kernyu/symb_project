In a general population survey in the United States, the prevalence of antiviral-agent-resistant herpes simplex virus was very low among more than 1,000 isolates from individuals with an episode of recurrent herpes labialis not treated with topical antiviral agents. Two isolates had borderline resistance to acyclovir (0.2%), and all were susceptible to penciclovir.
