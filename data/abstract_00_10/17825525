Intracellular polyamine synthesis is regulated by the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), and its inhibition by alpha-difluromethylornithine (DFMO), confers resistance to apoptosis. We have previously shown that DFMO leads to the inhibition of de novo polyamine synthesis, which in turn rapidly activates Src, STAT3 and NF-kappaB via integrin beta3 in intestinal epithelial cells. One mechanism to explain these effects involves the activation of upstream growth factor receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We therefore hypothesized that EGFR phosphorylation regulates the early response to polyamine depletion. DFMO increased EGFR phosphorylation on tyrosine residues 1173 (pY1173) and 845 (pY845) within 5 min. Phosphorylation declined after 10 min and was prevented by the addition of exogenous putrescine to DFMO containing medium. Phosphorylation of EGFR was concomitant with the activation of ERK1/2. Pretreatment with either DFMO or EGF for 1 h protected cells from TNF-alpha/CHX-induced apoptosis. Exogenous addition of polyamines prevented the protective effect of DFMO. In addition, inhibition of integrin beta3 activity (with RGDS), Src activity (with PP2), or EGFR kinase activity (with AG1478), increased basal apoptosis and prevented protection conferred by either DFMO or EGF. Polyamine depletion failed to protect B82L fibroblasts lacking the EGFR (PRN) and PRN cells expressing either a kinase dead EGFR (K721A) or an EGFR (Y845F) mutant lacking the Src phosphorylation site. Conversely, expression of WT-EGFR (WT) restored the protective effect of polyamine depletion. Fibronectin activated the EGFR, Src, ERKs and protected cells from apoptosis. Taken together, our data indicate an essential role of EGFR kinase activity in MEK/ERK-mediated protection, which synergizes with integrin beta3 leading to Src-mediated protective responses in polyamine depleted cells.
