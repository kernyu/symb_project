Highly ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC, 512 microg/ml) strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi were isolated from the blood of typhoid patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The strains were indistinguishable by their antibiograms, biotypes, and variable-number tandem repeat types and had matching point mutations at positions 83 and 87 of the gyrA gene. The isolation of these strains in an area of high endemicity indicates the need for continuous surveillance of antibiotic resistance of S. enterica serovar Typhi and for the rationalized use of ciprofloxacin.
