BACKGROUND: Day-care children in Oslo had a high proportion of infections (97 %) and a high consumption of antibiotics (65 %) in 2000. The study from 2000 was repeated in 2006 to see if prescriptions for antibiotics had changed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Parents in 22 randomly chosen day-care centres in Oslo answered a questionnaire about their children (concerning infections, contact with physicians and antibiotic treatment). RESULTS: 605 parents (53 %) participated. The proportion of children treated for infections was reduced from 65 % (95 % confidence interval 61 - 69 %) in 2006 to 50 (46 - 54) % in 2000 and infections treated were reduced from 29 (26 - 32) % to 20 (17 - 23) %. Ear infections were treated in 62 % of the children in 2006 (75 % in 2000) and throat infections in 53 % (85 % in 2000) of the cases. Medical consultations resulted in prescription in 50 % of the cases in 2006 and 80 % in 2000. INTERPRETATION: Day-care children in Oslo used significantly less antibiotics and had significantly fewer medical consultations in 2006 than in 2000.
