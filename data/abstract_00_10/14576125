TD-6424, a rapidly bactericidal agent with multiple mechanisms of action, is more potent in vitro and more rapidly bactericidal than currently available agents against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. TD-6424 produces a postantibiotic effect with a duration of 4 to 6 h against these organisms. The results suggest potential efficacy against susceptible and resistant strains of S. aureus.
