Short-course antibiotic therapy for specific pediatric infections allows the clinician to minimize toxicities related to antibiotic exposure, to limit antibiotic resistance, and to improve compliance and cost without compromising microbiologic efficacy. Future studies of short-course therapy in children should address the pharmacokinetics of antibiotic exposure to the pathogen at the site of infection, the pharmacodynamics of pathogen eradication, and the many host factors involved in clinical and microbiologic outcomes. By using a mathematic model that integrates all important variables, one may be able to predict the probability of a cure with short-course therapy for each pathogen, antibiotic, site of infection, and host interaction.
