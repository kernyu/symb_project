2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) and arabinosylcytosine (araC) are nucleoside drugs that are used to treat various leukaemias, although 2-CdA has not been tested extensively in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Nucleoside cytotoxicity depends on the conversion of these agents to 5'-phosphate derivatives, following drug entry into cells via nucleoside transport (NT) processes. This study compared es nucleoside transporter content, determined using a flow cytometric assay with SAENTA [5'-S-(2-aminoethyl)-N6-(4-nitrobenzyl)-5'-thioadenosine] fluorescein, and cytotoxicities of 2-CdA and araC in fresh lymphoblasts from previously untreated paediatric ALL patients and the human T-lymphoblast cell line, CCRF-CEM. Lymphoblast samples from individual patients ranged widely in sensitivity to both 2-CdA (IC50, 6 nmol/l to > 5 micromol/l; mean = 418 nmol/l; n = 8) and araC (IC50, 59 nmol/l to > 5 micromol/l; mean = 1050 nmol/l; n = 7), although IC50 values for the two drugs were correlated (r = 0.78, P = 0.032, n = 7). Cellular es nucleoside transporter content varied more than 35-fold among samples from 10 patients. The correlation between es nucleoside transporter content and drug sensitivity was statistically significant for araC (r = -0.93, P = 0.023, n = 5), but not for 2-CdA (r = -0.57, P = 0.23, n = 6). Exposure of CCRF-CEM cells to araC resulted in a substantial araC concentration-dependent increase in the relative survival of es transporter-deficient cells, whereas the increase was slight following exposure to 2-CdA. We conclude that, in ALL lymphoblasts, es nucleoside transporter content is a determinant of araC sensitivity and that a deficiency in NT may impart resistance to araC.
