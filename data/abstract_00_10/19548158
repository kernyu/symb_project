This article highlights potential public health effects of India's Patents Act of 2005, which was implemented to conform to the requirements of the World Trade Organisation's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPS), a new legal regime that will likely have a significant impact on access to HIV/AIDS medications in much of the world. This new patent law may play a role in keeping new antiretroviral (ARV) medications, including improved first-line medications and second-line drugs that are being developed for first-line drug resistant HIV, financially out of reach for many people living with HIV/AIDS in poor countries. India's drug industry, which had thrived under earlier patent laws that protected processes but not products in the case of medications, had brought down the price of ARV drugs in South Asia and Africa by more than 90%. While most existing drugs are grandfathered under the new patent laws, newer ARV medications may be barred from manufacture by Indian companies. This article analyses the effects of the coming together of this new legal regime, the global political economy and emerging resistance to HIV/AIDS medications, and evaluates efforts to mitigate the negative public health effects of the new patent laws.
