A 39-year-old man with Candida glabrata endophthalmitis was successfully treated with a 28-day course of intravenous caspofungin. Presence of underlying renal insufficiency and infection with a drug-resistant strain precluded use of amphotericin B or fluconazole. Intravitreal administration of antifungals and vitrectomy were not required. The role of caspofungin in Candida endophthalmitis is discussed.
