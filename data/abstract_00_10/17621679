Onychomycosis is a challenging fungal infection to treat topically, likely due to the unique properties of the nail plate. This seemingly impenetrable barrier has high resistance to the passage of antifungal drugs in sufficient concentrations to kill the causative fungi deep in the nail bed. Recently, a new class of antifungal agent was described, termed oxaboroles, which have broad-spectrum activity. These oxaboroles were designed with properties believed to be required to allow for easier transit through the nail plate. Herein, we report (i) the nail penetration results of four oxaboroles that led to the selection of AN2690, (ii) the results of the nail penetration of AN2690 from four vehicles, and (iii) the nail penetration of AN2690 in its chosen vehicle compared to a commercial control, ciclopirox. AN2690 has superior penetration compared to ciclopirox, and achieves levels within and under the nail plate that suggest it has the potential to be an effective topical treatment for onychomycosis.
