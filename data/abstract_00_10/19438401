We report the possible transmission of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 2. A 66-year-old woman from rural Guinea Bissau who had no obvious antiretroviral exposure was found to harbor a variant with the multidrug-resistance mutation Q151M. Finding this mutation among a drug-naive population presents an important public health issue that needs to be addressed for treatment to be effective.
