Human filarial nematodes cause river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, both of which are diseases that produce considerable morbidity. Control of these diseases relies on drug treatments that are ineffective against macrofilariae and are threatened by the development of resistance. New validated drug targets are required to allow development of new classes of antifilarial drugs. To identify and validate potential new drug targets, we propose a collaborative research strategy utilizing bioinformatic filters and assessment of gene function by RNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans and Brugia malayi.
