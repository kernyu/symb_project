HIV patients co-infected with hepatitis B can be successfully treated with lamivudine, adefovir and tenofovir. However, in a variable portion of patients resistance against these agents may occur. The application of pegylated interferon alfa in combination with ribavirin represents an advance in the treatment of hepatitis C and HIV co-infected patients. In patients with markers of advanced liver cirrhosis a substantial risk for the development of hepatic decompensation under interferon-based therapy was observed. Antiretroviral therapy with didanosine may further enhance this risk.
