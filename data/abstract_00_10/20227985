Mortality due to febrile neutropenia has decreased since the concept of empiric therapy became standard care. However, infectious complications remain the most common adverse events of chemotherapy. bacterial epidemiology has changed during the past decades. There is currently an increasing trend in infections due to Gramnegative bacteria which have higher rates of resistance for a variety of reasons.The use of biomarkers for diagnosis remains a domain of further investigation. Since the patient population with febrile neutropenia is very heterogeneous, models of risk assessment have been developed with the most commonly used today being the mASCC score.Oral antibiotic treatment seems to be appropriate in low-risk patients. In moderate or high-risk patients monotherapy is the most common option. However, due to emerging resistance this could change by next year. Some new antibiotics have been developed, but experience in the treatment of neutropenic fever is limited. The use of antibiotics for prophylaxis remains controversial, although recent studies suggest a reduction in death from all causes.
