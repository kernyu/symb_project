In basic studies on campylobacteriosis, we tested 53 strains from human diarrhea stools and 102 strains from chicken meat and feces obtained between 2002 and 2006 for drug sensitivity to different drugs and gene mutation in quinolone-resistant strains. 1) Of 15 drugs tested, all were resistant to one or more of the following 10 drugs: CEX, 99.4%: ABPC, 59.4%; NA, 40.6%; NFLX, 40.0%; TC and CPFX, 39.4%; PIPC, 38.1%; MINO, 30.3%; KM, 3.2%; and SM, 2.6%. 2) Of 155 drug-resistant strains, 28 (18.1%) were resistant to single drugs and 127 (81.9%) were resistant to multiple drugs. The most frequent pattern of multipledrug resistance was ABPC/PIPC/CEX, followed by ABPC/PIPC/CEX/TC/MINO/NA/NFLX/CPFX. 3) Mutation of GyrA (Thr86 --> Ile) was detected in 43 (97.7%) of 44 quinolone-resistant strains. We found that resistance to beta-lactams, quinolones, and tetracycline antibiotics was high, and most resistant strains were resistant to multiple drugs. We also found that most quinolone-resistant strains had GyrA mutation.
