In light of increasing bacterial drug resistance, novel agents and/or modes of bactericidal action are required. In particular, agents that can act at multiple sites within the bacterial cell appear to offer less potential for the development of resistance. This effect may be achieved using combinations of established drugs. Similar effects have been reported as a result of photodynamic antimicrobial action alone. The photoactivation requirement suggests the utility of such agents in light-accessible presentations such as skin and soft-tissue infections. This approach also offers considerable potential in decreasing conventional antibacterial use and allowing the conservation of important life-saving systemic agents.
