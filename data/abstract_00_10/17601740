A series of anacardic acid analogues possessing different side chains viz. phenolic, branched, and alicyclic were synthesized and their antibacterial activity tested against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The maximum activity against this bacterium occurred with the branched side-chain analogue, 6-(4',8'-dimethylnonyl)salicylic acid, and the alicyclic side-chain analogue, 6-cyclododecylmethyl salicylic acid, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.39 microg/mL, respectively. This activity was superior to that of the most potent antibacterial anacardic acid isolated from the cashew Anacardium occidentale (Anacardiaceae), apple and nut, that is, the 6-[8'(Z),11'(Z),14'-pentadecatrienyl]salicylic acid.
