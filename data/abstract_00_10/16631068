We report a 32-year-old woman who presented with infectious keratitis in the right eye 3 weeks after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). On microbiological investigations, the microorganism isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa that was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. To our knowledge, this is the only case report in the literature of post-LASIK infectious keratitis caused by P aeruginosa.
