Linezolid is the first of an entirely new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones, in decades. It has a spectrum of activity against virtually all important Gram-positive pathogens. The unique mechanism of action of linezolid makes cross-resistance with other antimicrobial agents unlikely. Linezolid has both intravenous and oral formulations and the latter is 100% bioavailable. Since its first approval and marketing in March 2000 in the US, linezolid has gained approval for use in many other countries for the treatment of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and soft-tissue infections, and infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, including cases with concurrent bacteraemia. Several earlier comprehensive reviews summarised the chemistry, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety profile of linezolid. The present review provides an update on the latest data regarding the antimicrobial activity of linezolid versus other commonly used agents, the clinical and health-economic outcomes of linezolid versus vancomycin and teicoplanin, and safety issues.
