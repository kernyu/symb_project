The main Plasmodium falciparum genes known to be associated with drug resistance are pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr pfdhps, pfcytb, pfmrp, pfnhe1, pfmdt, pfserca and pftetQ. Molecular markers for resistance to chloroquine, amodiaquine, mefloquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, cycloguanil and atovaquone have been validated and used to predict the parasitological and clinical efficacy of these drugs (i.e. based on in vivo tests). These molecular markers have numerous advantages. They allow evaluation of large series of samples in less time than in vivo tests. Collection, transport and storage of samples are much easier than for in vitro tests. These markers can be used for epidemiological monitoring of resistance for an entire country as well as for prediction of therapeutic outcome for a single individual. Development of high-throughput molecular biology techniques, availability of the nucleotidic sequences of P. falciparum genomes, and close collaboration between fundamental researcher workers, clinical practitioners, and officials in charge of the national malaria control programs are major assets in the research and development of molecular markers for P. falciparum resistance to antimalarial drugs.
