The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility rates and patterns in P. aeruginosa strains isolated from 2002 to 2005 in a teaching Hospital of Tunisia. Susceptibility to antibiotics was assessed according to CA-SFM guidelines. During this period, 1368 strains of P. aeruginosa were identified, they were isolated mainly from pus (52.9%), respiratory samples (19.5 %), urine (10.6%), and blood cultures (5%). The percentages of resistant isolates were as follows: ticarcilline: 26.2%; ceftazidime: 21.8%; imipenem: 19.6%; gentamicin: 39.3%; amikacin: 19.2%, and ciprofloxacin: 21.6%. Nosocomial infections in P. aeruginosa are responsible for important morbidity and mortality rates, the survey of resistance to antibiotics is necessary for an efficient treatment.
