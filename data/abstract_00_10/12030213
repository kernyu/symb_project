Antiretroviral research presented recently at the 9th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections demonstrates that investigators and pharmaceutical companies continue to strive for the next highly potent and easily tolerated anti-HIV drug. Among the new approaches are entry inhibitor drug and second-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. New studies also looked into potency against multidrug-resistant virus and medication regimens that are simpler to take and have fewer side effects.
