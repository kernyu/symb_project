BACKGROUND: The empirical therapy of urinary tract infections (UTI) relies on the predictability of the agents causing UTI and knowledge of their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. METHODS: In a prospective study undertaken over a 14-month period, 5136 samples from patients suspected of having a UTI were analyzed, of which 676 were culture-positive. Isolated bacteria were identified by standard tests, and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method. RESULTS: According to our results, Escherichia coli was the most common etiological agent of UTI (74.6%), followed by Klebsiella spp (11.7%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (6.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.2%). Analysis of the frequency of isolated bacteria according to the age of the patients revealed that Klebsiella infections are more prevalent in the older age groups (>10 years) and Pseudomonas infections are more prevalent in children and the elderly (<9 years and >60 years). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility analysis for E. coli, as the most prevalent cause of UTI, to commonly used antibiotics are as follows: amikacin (97.8%), gentamicin (97%), ciprofloxacin (94%), nitrofurantoin (87.1%), nalidixic acid (93.7%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (48.2%), cephalexin (76%), and ampicillin (6.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the antimicrobial resistance patterns of the causes of UTI are highly variable and continuous surveillance of trends in resistance patterns of uropathogens is important.
