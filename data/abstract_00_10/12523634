Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have frequently been isolated from Norwegian poultry production following the prohibition of the glycopeptide growth promoter avoparcin since 1995. In the present study, a close genetic linkage between the vanA and erm(B) determinants in an Enterococcus hirae isolate of poultry origin is demonstrated, a result that indicates a mechanism for co-selection and maintenance of vancomycin resistance in absence of selective pressure from avoparcin. A total of 36 vanA-positive enterococci of poultry origin, also phenotypically resistant to erythromycin and/or tetracycline, were analyzed by PCR for identification of erm and tet resistance determinants. An E. hirae isolate harbored erm(B) and tet(K), and in this isolate vanA and erm(B) were located on a BamHI fragment of an approximately 50-kb plasmid. Approximately 3 kb of this fragment was amplified by PCR with vanA and erm(B) primers. Sequence analysis of the region between erm(B) and vanZ of Tn1546 showed a truncated IS1216V inserted downstream of the erm(B) stop codon, aligned with a conserved copy of the 3'-inverted terminal repeat of Tn1546. Mating experiments with the E. hirae isolate as donor and E. faecalis JH2-2 as recipient did not result in any transconjugants, indicating that the vanA/erm(B)-carrying plasmid was nonconjugative under the given experimental conditions.
