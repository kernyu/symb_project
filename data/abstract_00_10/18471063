Treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is increasingly difficult, because of emerging resistance to antibiotics. Recombinant Cpl-1, a phage lysin specific for S. pneumoniae, was evaluated for antimicrobial therapy in experimental pneumococcal meningitis using infant Wistar rats. A single intracisternal injection (20 mg/kg) of Cpl-1 resulted in a rapid (within 30 min) decrease in pneumococci in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by 3 orders of magnitude lasting for 2 h. Intraperitoneal administration of Cpl-1 (200 mg/kg) led to an antibacterial effect in CSF of 2 orders of magnitude for 3 h. Cpl-1 may hold promise as an alternative treatment option in pneumococcal meningitis.
