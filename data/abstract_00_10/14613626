The clinical features of the primary Plasmodium falciparum infections in 25 children, and of the recrudescent infections that emerged after pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (PS) treatment of the children had failed, were evaluated. In addition, the gametocyte sex ratios in these children and in age- and gender-matched controls who had PS-sensitive (PS-S) infections were also examined. Compared with the primary infections, the recrudescent infections were accompanied by significantly fewer symptoms and lower levels of parasitaemia but significantly higher gametocytaemia:parasitaemia ratios. Although the mean gametocyte sex ratio was female-biased pre-treatment, in both the PS-resistant (PS-R) and PS-S infections it became male-biased on days 7 and 14 post-treatment. The times taken to attain a sex ratio of 1 were similar in both groups. The predominance of macrogametocytes seen 'early' post-treatment (on day 3) was later replaced by a predominance of microgametocytes (on days 7 and 14). Analysis of the disposition of gametocytaemia, from the time to attain a sex ratio of 1, showed that the area under the curve of the plot of the level of microgametocytaemia upsilon. time and the mean half-life of the microgametocytaemia were significantly greater and microgametocytaemia clearance was significantly slower than the corresponding values for macrogametocytaemia. Although sex ratios in Plasmodium may naturally become more male-biased as the infection progresses, it is possible that PS treatment may have contributed to the male-biased sex ratios observed post-treatment.
