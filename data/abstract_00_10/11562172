Previous results have demonstrated an essential role of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in resistance against Yersinia enterocolitica. Hence, we investigated the course of Yersinia infection in mice deficient for the IFN-gamma-inducing cytokines interleukin-12 (IL-12 p40(-/-)) or interleukin-18 (IL-18(-/-)). The experiments described herein argue for a critical role of both cytokines in protective immune responses against this pathogen.
