OBJECTIVE: Apricitabine (formerly AVX754 and SPD754) is a deoxycytidine analogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in clinical development for patients with HIV disease. This study evaluated the antiretroviral efficacy, tolerability and safety of apricitabine monotherapy, administered for 10 days in antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1 infected adults. METHODS: Adult patients (> or = 18 years) with HIV infection (CD4 count > or = 250 cells/microl; plasma HIV-1 RNA level 5000-100 000 copies/ml) were randomized to 10 days' double-blind oral therapy with placebo or apricitabine 400 mg/day, 800 mg/day, 1200 mg/day, or 1600 mg/day. RESULTS: At 7 days, all apricitabine doses produced statistically significant log10 reductions in plasma HIV RNA levels from baseline relative to placebo (n = 13; P < 0.0001), as follows: -1.16 (400 mg; n = 11), -1.28 (800 mg; n = 12), -1.44 (1200 mg; n = 14), -1.30 (1600 mg; n = 13). After 10 days, the log10 viral load reductions with apricitabine 1200 mg (-1.65; P = 0.01) and 1600 mg/day (-1.58; P = 0.04) were significantly greater than that with the 400-mg dose (-1.18). No clinically relevant changes were observed in CD4 or CD8 cell indices. Apricitabine was well tolerated and showed no tendency to select any particular resistance mutation. CONCLUSION: Apricitabine monotherapy showed promising antiretroviral efficacy, good tolerability and a low propensity for resistance selection in antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients treated for 10 days. These results warrant further evaluation of the long-term clinical efficacy and tolerability of apricitabine.
