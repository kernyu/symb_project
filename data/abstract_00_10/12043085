Patients with new HIV infection have been shown to benefit from therapy interruption. Control of the virus is better, and in some cases, further drug treatment can be obviated over the long term. In the case of deep-salvage patients, opportunistic infections may occur in some cases during the period of interruption. Although patients with chronic HIV infection who have already received lengthy periods of treatment, have no immunologic or virologic benefit from such interruptions, metabolic side effects are reduced, and a 20% to 50% drug-saving effect can be achieved. On the basis of our current knowledge, the question whether treatment interruption may be deleterious, for example, due to the development of resistance, would appear unlikely.
