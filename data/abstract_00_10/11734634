Although continuous highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is effective for many HIV-infected patients, it can be toxic and prohibitive in cost. By decreasing the total amount of time patients receive medications, intermittent HAART could reduce toxicity and cost. Therefore, we initiated a pilot study in which 10 HIV-infected individuals receiving effective therapy that resulted in levels of HIV RNA <50 copies per ml of plasma and CD4(+) T cell counts >300 cells per mm(3) of whole blood received repeated cycles of 7 days on HAART followed by 7 days off of HAART. Patients maintained suppression of plasma viremia for 32-68 weeks. There was no significant increase in HIV proviral DNA or replication-competent HIV in peripheral CD4(+) T cells or HIV RNA in peripheral blood or lymph node mononuclear cells. There was no significant change in CD4(+) T cell counts, no significant increase in CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells expressing activation markers or producing IFN-gamma in response to HIV, no increase in CD4(+) T cell proliferation to p24 antigen, and no evidence for the development of resistance to HAART medications. There was a significant decrease in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Thus, in this proof-of-concept study, short-cycle intermittent HAART maintained suppression of plasma viremia as well as HIV replication in reservoir sites while preserving CD4(+) T cell counts. In addition, there was a decrease in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Intermittent therapy may be an important strategy to reduce cost and toxicity for HIV-infected individuals.
