In this work molecular simulations are performed to investigate protein interactions with hydroxylated and methylated mannitol and sorbitol terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces in the presence of explicit water molecules. The role of surface hydrogen bond donor versus acceptor groups is evaluated by comparing the hydration layer structure and resulting forces generated by the two classes of sugar SAM surfaces. Both hydroxyl and methyl-terminated sugar SAM surfaces interact with hydrating water molecules. Regardless of hydrogen bond donor or acceptor groups, both classes of sugar SAM surface groups interact strongly with hydrating water molecules to induce significant repulsive forces and resistance to protein adsorption. Our results indicate that the repulsive force generated on the probe protein is related to the ability of the surface to orient the hydration layer water. The repulsive force is also proportional to the number of hydrating water molecules interacting with the protein. The repulsive force and subsequent resistance to protein adsorption are dependent on the surface hydration, not the origin of that hydration.
