Conventional antimicrobial activity analyses such as the broth dilution method and disk diffusion test are considerably demanding processes for new antimicrobial agent discovery and sensitive diagnosis of infectious diseases. Here, we developed a new antimicrobial activity analysis system using CE-based SSCP (CE-SSCP) combined with 16S rRNA gene-specific PCR (PCR/CE-SSCP). Using this method, the population change in the microbial community in response to specific antimicrobial agents could be quantified with a high sensitivity and accuracy from a small sample amount. Using a mixture of microorganisms comprising Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Staphylococcus aureus as a model system, the linear correlation between the genomic DNA concentrations and peak areas in 16S rRNA gene-specific PCR/CE-SSCP was determined; consequently, quantification of cell concentrations could be demonstrated using this method. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values from the conventional broth dilution method, this new system provided almost the same MIC values for popular antimicrobial agents such as kanamycin, spectinomycin, and streptomycin. The results demonstrated that the newly developed method can be a substitute for the conventional antimicrobial analysis method and highlighted its high potential in the areas of new antimicrobial agent discovery and clinical diagnosis.
