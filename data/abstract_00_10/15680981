The atomic structures of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui and its complexes with substrates and antibiotics have provided insights into the way the 3000 nucleotide 23S rRNA folds into a compact, specific structure and interacts with 27 ribosomal proteins as well as the structural basis of the peptidyl transferase reaction and its inhibition by antibiotics. The structure shows that the ribosome is indeed a ribozyme.
