A system is described for typing isolates of the pathogenic fungus Candida tropicalis, based on sequence polymorphisms in fragments of six genes: ICL1, MDR1, SAPT2, SAPT4, XYR1, and ZWF1a. The system differentiated 87 diploid sequence types (DSTs) among a total of 106 isolates tested or 80 DSTs among 88 isolates from unique sources. Replicate isolates from the same source clustered together with high statistical similarity, with the exception of one isolate. However, a clade of very closely related isolates included replicate isolates from three different patients, as well as single isolates from eight other patients. This clade, provisionally designated clade 1, was one of three clusters of isolates with high statistical similarity. Five of six isolates in one cluster that may acquire clade status were resistant to flucytosine. This study adds C. tropicalis to Candida albicans and Candida glabrata as Candida species for which a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) system has been set up.
