The results of four expert working groups on the risk analysis process on anti-microbial resistance are described. They focus on the procedure recommended by the FAO/WHO CODEX Alimentarius Commission in 1999 including hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment and risk characterization. In all four areas, the current scientific knowledge was evaluated and recommendations for risk management options were given. They will form the basis for mitigating the health risk caused by resistant micro-organisms.
