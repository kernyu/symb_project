A series of novel 5-amino-6-fluoro-1-[(1R,2S)-2-fluorocyclopropan-1-yl]-8-methylquinolones bearing fluorinated (3R)-3-(1-aminocyclopropan-1-yl)pyrrolidin-1-yl substituents at the C-7 position (2-4) was synthesized to obtain potent drugs for infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, which include resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). These fluorinated compounds 2-4 exhibited potent antibacterial activity comparable with that of a compound bearing a non-fluorinated (3R)-3-(1-aminocyclopropan-1-yl)pyrrolidine moiety at the C-7 position (1) and had at least 4 times more potent activity against representative Gram-positive bacteria than ciprofloxacin (CPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), or moxifloxacin (MFLX). Among them, the 7-[(3S,4R)-4-(1-aminocyclopropan-1-yl)-3-fluoropyrrolidin-1-yl] derivative 3 (=DQ-113), which showed favorable profiles in preliminary toxicological and nonclinical pharmcokinetic studies, exhibited potent antibacterial activity against clinically isolated resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
