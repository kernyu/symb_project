Advice from the Food & Drug Administration and the European Medicines Commission indicates that tenofovir is likely to be licensed shortly for use in patients failing antiretroviral therapy as part of a regimen constructed by the clinician. Tenofovir is a nucleotide (NtRTI) that acts in a similar way to nucleoside analogues by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, producing similar HIV plasma viral load fall. In use up to 48 weeks it appears to be safe without evident toxicity. It has particular value because it has activity against many HIV viruses with mutations which render them insensitive to other nucleoside analogues. Its eventual optimal role in treatment, particularly whether it should be part of a first line regimen, awaits the outcome of further studies.
