We determined the in vitro activity of fluconazole against 1565 clinical Candida spp. isolates collected from different specimens of non-AIDS outpatients and inpatients in 3 different regions of Italy. Susceptibility testing was performed by agar disk diffusion using the NCCLS document M44-A guidelines. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated yeast (68%) followed by C. glabrata (15%), C. tropicalis (5%), C. parapsilosis (5%), and C. krusei (5%). Other yeasts represented 4% of all isolates. Of the 1565 isolates tested, 1449 (92.6%) were susceptible (S) to fluconazole, 43 (2.7%) were susceptible dose-dependent (S-DD) and 73 (4.7%) were resistant (R). Almost all (98.2%) of the C. albicans isolates were classified as S or S-DD. Despite its widespread use, fluconazole displayed good activity against the isolates we tested, and the disk diffusion method was confirmed as a reliable approach to the evaluation of in vitro susceptibility of yeasts to this antimycotic agent.
