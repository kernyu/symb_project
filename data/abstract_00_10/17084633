We report the synthesis, in vitro antiprotozoal (against Plasmodium and Leishmania), antimicrobial, cytotoxicity (Vero and MetHb-producing properties), and in vivo antimalarial activities of two series of 8-quinolinamines. N1-{4-[2-(tert-Butyl)-6-methoxy-8-quinolylamino]pentyl}-(2S/2R)-2-aminosubstitute damides (21-33) and N1-[4-(4-ethyl-6-methoxy-5-pentyloxy-8-quinolylamino)pentyl]-(2S/2R)-2-aminosubst itutedamides (51-63) were synthesized in six steps from 6-methoxy-8-nitroquinoline and 4-methoxy-2-nitro-5-pentyloxyaniline, respectively. Several analogs displayed promising antimalarial activity in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum D6 (chloroquine-sensitive) and W2 (chloroquine-resistant) clones with high selectivity indices versus mammalian cells. The most promising analogs (21-24) also displayed potent antimalarial activity in vivo in a Plasmodium berghei-infected mouse model. Most interestingly, many analogs exhibited promising in vitro antileishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani promastigotes, and antimicrobial activities against a panel of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Several analogs, notably 21-24, 26-32, and 60, showed less MetHb formation compared to primaquine indicating the potential of these compounds in 8-quinolinamine-based antimalarial drug development.
