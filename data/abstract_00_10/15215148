In vitro activities of ABT-492, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and gemifloxacin were compared. ABT-492 was more potent against quinolone-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive organisms, had activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin against certain members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and had comparable activity against quinolone-susceptible, nonfermentative, gram-negative organisms. Bactericidal activity of ABT-492 was also evaluated.
