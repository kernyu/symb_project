SETTING: A national survey of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance was conducted for the first time in Madagascar between October 2005 and July 2007. OBJECTIVE: To determine resistance rates among new and previously treated cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: In a cluster sampling representative of the general population of the country, 1275 smear-positive tuberculosis patients recruited at 34 sites, 926 new patients and 87 previously treated patients underwent drug susceptibility testing against rifampicin (RMP), isoniazid (INH), streptomycin and ethambutol on Lowenstein-Jensen medium using the indirect proportion method. RESULTS: Resistance among new cases was 6.5% (95%CI 4.9-8) and among previously treated cases it was 11.5% (95%CI 4.8-18.2). Monoresistance among new cases was 5.8% (95%CI 4.2-7.3), mainly to INH (3.7%). Multiresistance to INH and RMP was 0.2% (95%CI 0-0.5) among new cases and 3.4% (95%CI 0-7.2) among previously treated cases. No significant difference was noted with regard to sex or age. CONCLUSION: The rates of resistance among new and previously treated cases remain relatively low in Madagascar.
