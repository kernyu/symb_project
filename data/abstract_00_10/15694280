The tropical forage legume Clitoria ternatea (L.) has important agronomic traits such as adaptation to a wide range of soil conditions and resistance to drought. It is resistant to a number of pathogens and pests. These important traits gave us reasons to look more closely at the plant. A highly basic small protein was purified from seeds of C. ternatea to homogeneity by using ultrafiltration with Centricon-3 membrane tubes and preparative granulated-bed isoelectric focusing (IEF). A single protein band was obtained on both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and IEF gels. The protein, designated 'finotin', has broad and potent inhibitory effect on the growth of various important fungal pathogens of plants, namely Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Pyricularia grisea, Bipolaris oryzae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. It also inhibits the common bean bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli. Moreover, finotin has powerful inhibitory properties against the bean bruchids Zabrotes subfasciatus and Acanthoscelides obtectus.
