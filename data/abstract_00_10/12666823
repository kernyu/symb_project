Although it has been unclear why more than 50% of children with chronic hepatitis B virus infection do not respond to interferon therapy, in some instances resistance to interferon probably is caused by an inability to stimulate appropriately cellular immune responses to hepatitis B virus. It is known that immune integrity is tightly linked to zinc status. We examined the relationship between serum zinc levels and response to interferon (INF)-alpha therapy in children with chronic hepatitis B. Twenty-five children with chronic hepatitis B infection were injected with 5 x 10(6) units/m2 recombinant IFN-alpha 2b subcutaneously three times weekly for 9 mo. Children were followed for at least 9 mo after the end of therapy. Sustained response was obtained in eight (32%) patients. Although initial serum zinc and alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly higher; initial hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-DNA values, hepatic activity index, periportal necrosis, and fibrosis scores were significantly lower in sustained responders than in nonresponders. Mean baseline serum zinc, alanine aminotransferase and HBV-DNA values, histologic activity index, periportal necrosis, and fibrosis scores were predictive of response to IFN-alpha 2b therapy. These findings suggest that serum zinc levels might be used as a factor predicting response to interferon-alpha 2b therapy, and so may help in identifying those children with a better chance of response.
