This review provides an overview of considerations particular to the delivery of antimicrobial agents to food animals. Antimicrobial drugs are used in food animals for a variety of purposes. These drugs may have therapeutic effects against disease agents, or may cause changes in the structure and/or function of systems within the target animal. Routes of administration, quantity, duration, and potency of an antimicrobial drug are all important factors affecting their action(s) and success. Not only might targeted pathogens be affected, but also bacteria residing in (or on) the treated food animals, especially in the intestines (gastrointestinal tract microflora). Resistance to antimicrobial agents can occur through a number of mechanisms. The extent to which resistance develops is greatly affected by the amount of drug [or its metabolite(s)] a bacterium is exposed to, the duration of exposure, and the interaction between an individual antimicrobial agent and a particular bacterium. The impact of antimicrobial agents on the emergence of resistance in vitro and in vivo may not readily correlate.
