We investigated, in the protease and GAG cleavage sites, the role of minority populations on the evolution of resistance to a subsequent boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen after a first failure to nelfinavir. Two pathways were observed: the addition of mutations to a currently dominant genotype when minority variants are not shown, or the emergence of a minority variant as a dominant strain. These minor species, not detected by standard genotype, may influence PI susceptibility.
