As part of the response to pathogen infection, potato plants accumulate soluble and cell wall-bound phenolics such as hydroxycinnamic acid tyramine amides. Since incorporation of these compounds into the cell wall leads to a fortified barrier against pathogens, raising the amounts of hydroxycinnamic acid tyramine amides might positively affect the resistance response. To this end, we set out to increase the amount of tyramine, one of the substrates of the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-transferase reaction, by placing a cDNA encoding a pathogen-induced tyrosine decarboxylase from parsley under the control of the 35S promoter and introducing the construct into potato plants via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. While no alterations were observed in the pattern and quantity of cell wall-bound phenolic compounds in transgenic plants, the soluble fraction contained several new compounds. The major one was isolated and identified as tyrosol glucoside by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry and NMR analyses. Our results indicate that expression of a tyrosine decarboxylase in potato does not channel tyramine into the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)-transferase reaction but rather unexpectedly, into a different pathway leading to the formation of a potential storage compound.
