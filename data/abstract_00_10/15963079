BACKGROUND: A standard third-line treatment is lacking, and European guidelines recommend performing culture in these patients. However, the use of this procedure as 'routine practice' is definitively not feasible. AIM: To evaluate the eradication rate of a 10-day levofloxacin-based triple therapy in patients who have failed two eradication courses for Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: A total of 151 patients with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection after two treatments were studied. Patients were considered positive if two of three endoscopic tests were positive. Susceptibility testing was also performed. Patients received a standard dose of proton-pump inhibitors twice daily, levofloxacin 250 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, for 10 days. Endoscopic follow-up was carried out 4-6 weeks after the end of eradication therapy. RESULTS: About 76% (95% CI: 68.8-82.3), and 85% (95% CI: 77.5-89.7) of patients were eradicated according to intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis, respectively. Eradication rates of the strains showed as 92% (95% CI: 83.2-96.7) of those resistant to both metronidazole and clarithromycin but susceptible to levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who failed previous regimens, the 10-day levofloxacin-based triple therapy is safe and effective, allowing eradication in almost 80% of the patients.
