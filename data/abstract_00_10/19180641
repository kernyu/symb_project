In a previous paper we reported the construction of a S. cerevisiae strain lacking the essential gene LSM4, which could survive by the introduction of a truncated form of the orthologous gene from Kluyveromyces lactis. This strain showed apoptotic hallmarks and other phenotypes, including an increased sensitivity to caffeine and acetic acid. The suppression of the latter phenotype by overexpressing yeast genes allowed the isolation of PGK1, the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase. This gene restored normal ageing, oxygen peroxide resistance and nuclear integrity in the mutant. Other phenotypes, such as caffeine sensitivity and glycerol utilization, were also suppressed.
