We report 12 uncomplicated falciparum-malaria cases from semi-immune people from Central Africa treated with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar) in a Spanish hospital. We resolved by PCR-RFLP the mutations in dhfr and dhps genes related to resistance to antifolate drugs. The 12 patients presented high frequencies of combined mutations in both genes but they were completely cured after treatment.
