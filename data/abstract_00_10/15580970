BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Almost all patients develop iritis following argon laser peripheral iridoplasty. Numerous adverse effects, particularly elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and reduced microbial resistance, complicate therapy with topical corticosteroids. An immunomodulator, such as cyclosporin A (CsA), avoids these undesirable effects, yet may suppress ocular inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty was performed on anesthetized rabbits with pigmented iris epithelium. Rabbits were randomly assigned to the untreated control, CsA (2%), or dexamethasone (0.1%) groups. Postoperative inflammation was documented by digital photography, IOP, and protein in aqueous humor. RESULTS: Iris injection, aqueous flare, and fibrin decreased most rapidly in the control group, as did protein in aqueous humor. Decreases in IOP of 49% to 58% were similar in all three groups. There were no differences in conjunctival congestion between the CONCLUSION: Neither treatment with antiinflammatory drugs that inhibit phagocytosis (e.g., topical steroids) nor treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs that suppress T-lymphocytes (e.g., topical sA) significantly attenuated inflammation following iridoplasty.
