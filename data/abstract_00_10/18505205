Escherichia coli (n = 1439), isolated from the feces of apparently healthy grow-finish pigs in 20 herds in Alberta and Saskatchewan, were tested for susceptibility to 16 antimicrobials. All isolates were susceptible to amikacin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin and less than 1% was resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, gentamicin, and nalidixic acid. Resistance was most common to tetracycline (66.8%), sulfamethoxazole (46.0%) and streptomycin (33.4%). Twenty-one percent of the isolates were susceptible to all drugs, while 57% were resistant to 2 or more antimicrobials. Unconditional associations between resistances provided insight into the potential for co-selection. Every resistance-outcome was associated with at least 2 other drug-resistances. These associations illustrate the propensity for resistance phenotypes to occur together and the importance of considering co-selection in antimicrobial use decisions. A 2nd analysis explored the associations between resistance phenotypes in E. coli and Salmonella spp. from the same herd. Only 2 resistances in Salmonella were associated with herd-level E. coli resistance, indicating that E. coli is a poor sentinel for Salmonella AMR within herds. Herd-level management, including antimicrobial use, could affect antimicrobial resistance. The intra-class correlation between isolates within herds ranged from 0.1 to 0.46, which confirmed resistance clustered within herds. This suggests herd-level interventions might mitigate antimicrobial resistance. Overall, these results reflect the on-farm selection pressure for resistance and the potential food-safety risk from near-market animals. These data provide a baseline for comparisons with future on-farm monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli.
