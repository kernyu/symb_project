We report the characteristics of four optochin-resistant (Opt(r)) Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from Brazil. All four Opt(r) isolates presented mutations in the nucleotide sequence coding for the c subunit of F(0)F(1) ATPase. Two isolates showed mutations in codons 23 (leading to the deduced amino acid substitution isoleucine instead of alanine) and 49 (serine instead of alanine, a novel type of mutation detected at this position), respectively. Two additional novel mutations, both located in codon 45, were detected in the other two isolates, corresponding to leucine or valine (instead of phenylalanine). The data indicate that three previously unrecognized alterations were detected in the atpC gene of S. pneumoniae and that Opt resistance among Brazilian pneumococcal isolates is not related to a specific pneumococcal serotype, antimicrobial-resistance profile, or clonal group.
