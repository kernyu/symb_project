Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is inherently resistant to a variety of antibiotics including aminoglycosides, macrolides, polymyxins, and beta-lactam antibiotics. Despite resistance to many beta-lactams, ceftazidime and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations are commonly used for treatment of melioidosis. Here, we examine the enzyme kinetics of beta-lactamase isolated from mutants resistant to ceftazidime and clavulanic acid inhibition and describe specific mutations within conserved motifs of the beta-lactamase enzyme which account for these resistance patterns. Sequence analysis of regions flanking the B. pseudomallei penA gene revealed a putative regulator gene located downstream of penA. We have cloned and sequenced the penA gene from B. mallei and found it to be identical to penA from B. pseudomallei.
