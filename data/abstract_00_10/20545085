Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported to be a leading cause of nosocomial infections. We evaluated the characteristics using 903 P. aeruginosa strains that were isolated in Fukuoka University Hospital from 2006 to 2008. Clinical specimens of P. aeruginosa were detected 47.8% from respiratory tract, 24.4% from urine, and were detected from the pus by 18.9%. Age distribution of the patients was 70 years old or older. Antimicrobial susceptibility ratio of isolates of P. aeruginosa from the outpatients against all agents tested except amikacin had more susceptible than it of isolates from the inpatients. In P. aeruginosa isolates detected from the inpatients, susceptibilities to other antibiotics were about 60% though 93.3% and 83.2% were susceptible to amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam respectively. Isolation rate of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRP) in all clinical isolates was 3.3%. The report of carbapenem use was obligated in our hospital from the experience of the outbreak by MDRP in 2007, and the infection control team came to regulate the administering of antimicrobial agents more than before. Afterwards, the amounts of the antimicrobial agent use except piperacillin/tazobactam have decreased to 69% compared with the previous year. The susceptibility rates of various antimicrobial agents except amikacin have recovered by 10-17%. These results suggest that there is a necessity for attending to the drug susceptibility and the amount of the antimicrobial agent use.
