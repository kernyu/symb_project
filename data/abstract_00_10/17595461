As it was shown previously, detailed bacteriological analyses of 159 strains, among them museum and newly isolated strains of diarrheal patients from various clinics and bacteriology laboratories of Tbilisi was carried out. Study of antibiotic susceptibility of 52 strains of Salmonella groups A, B, C, D, E and 42 Shigella strains, among them 30 Shigella flexneri and 12 Shigella sonnei strains to 20 antibiotics and 1 chemical preparation was performed. 63% of Salmonella strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and 46% to impenem and virtually all strains-about 93% were resistant to lincomycin. Resistance to penicillin and erythromycin reaches to 69%. About 100% resistance of Shigella dysentery pathogen to antibacterial preparations of tetracycline group, macrolides, penicillin, lincomycin was determined. It was established that ciprofloxacin and imipenem revealed the highest antibacterial activity to dysentery pathogen (Shigella flexneri) (46% of strains correspondingly). Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were active to 66% of Shigella sonnei strains. Virtually all studied strains revealed total resistance to antibacterial activity of chemical preparation - furazolidone.
