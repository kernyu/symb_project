Infection of maize both pre- and postharvest by Aspergillus flavus is a severe agricultural problem in the southern United States. Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites produced by A. flavus and are carcinogenic to humans and animals upon ingestion. Extensive research has been conducted to identify sources of resistance to A. flavus in maize. Some maize genotypes exhibit greater resistance to A. flavus than others. Many research groups have validated the role of plant trypsin inhibitors (TIs) as a means of plant defense against fungal infection. Research consisting of the cloning, expression, and partial characterization of one previously uncharacterized TI protein has been conducted. The overexpressed protein displayed TI activity, as expected, and some ability to alter germination of conidia (8%) from several fungal pathogens and to inhibit hyphal growth (30%). This effect on fungal growth, although less than that of previously investigated TIs, marks this protein as a potential source of resistance to aflatoxin accumulation in maize.
