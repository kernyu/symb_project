OBJECTIVES: Determining Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage, antibiotic susceptibility and association with potential risk factors in residents from the Hogar Asilo de Ancianos San Pedro Claver nursing-home in Cartagena during the second semester of 2007. METHODS: Nasal swabs were taken from each person participating in the study after they had signed an informed consent form. Staphylococcus aureus strains were identified by classical methods; antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion methods, according to CLSI standards. SPSS for Windows 13.0 statistical package was used for analysing data collected from medical records and from a questionnaire for analysing association with potential risk factors. RESULTS: 11 Staphylococcus aureus isolates were obtained from 69 participants, corresponding to 15.9% prevalence. No methicillin-resistant strains were detected. Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage was significantly associated with limited mobility and skin lesions. There was no significant association with the other risk factors analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage found in this study was lower than that reported from other similar studies in other countries, taking into account that this is a population at risk for colonisation by this pathogen.
