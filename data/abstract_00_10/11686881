Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have emerged worldwide. In many countries and regions, these resistant strains constitute a serious threat to the efficacy of tuberculosis control programs. An important element in gaining control of this epidemic is developing an understanding of the molecular basis of resistance to the most important antituberculosis drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. On the basis of this information, more exacting laboratory testing, and ultimately more appropriate and timely treatment regimens, can be developed.
