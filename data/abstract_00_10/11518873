BACKGROUND: Plasmid-mediated and chromosomal-mediated resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin, tetracycline, thiamphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has spread dramatically in Africa. Monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility is a key element in the control of sexually transmitted diseases. GOAL: To document antimicrobial susceptibilities of gonococci isolated during the past 15 years in Kigali, Rwanda. STUDY DESIGN: Minimal inhibitory concentrations of recently collected gonococcal isolates of eight antimicrobials were determined. The results were compared with data collected for isolates obtained since 1986. RESULTS: In 1986, 35% of the gonococcal isolates were penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae. Tetracycline-resistant N gonorrhoeae appeared in 1989. The prevalence of penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae and tetracycline-resistant N gonorrhoeae increased significantly to 70.5% and 89.2%, respectively. Chromosomal resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, and thiamphenicol increased temporarily, then decreased significantly. Chromosomal resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appeared in 1988 and increased to 21.6%. All the isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin, and kanamycin. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated the rapidly increasing frequencies of penicillinase-producing N gonorrhoeae and tetracycline-resistant N gonorrhoeae. Chromosomal resistance to thiamphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole excludes these drugs as alternative treatment. Programs for antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance of N gonorrhoeae should urgently be established in Africa.
