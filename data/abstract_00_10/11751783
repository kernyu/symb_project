Isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Salmonella typhimurium were recovered from children admitted to the IbnRochd University Hospital of Casablanca in 1994. These isolates produced TEM-3 as shown by PCR, isoelectric focusing and sequencing. Production of TEM-3 and resistance to gentamicin were encoded by a 10 kb plasmid that could be transferred by conjugation and transformation. This report extends the list of ESBLs produced by S. typhimurium and stresses the need for continuous surveillance of non-typhoidal Salmonella to adapt antibiotic treatment and preventive measures.
