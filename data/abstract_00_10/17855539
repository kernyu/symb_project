Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients does not clear the infection and can select for drug resistance over time. Not only is drug-resistant HIV-1 a concern for infected individuals on continual therapy, but it is an emerging problem in resource-limited settings where, in efforts to stem mother-to-child-transmission of HIV-1, transient nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) therapy given during labor can select for NNRTI resistance in both mother and child. Questions of HIV-1 persistence and drug resistance are highly amenable to exploration within animals models, where therapy manipulation is less constrained. We examined a pigtail macaque infection model responsive to anti-HIV-1 therapy to study the development of resistance. Pigtail macaques were infected with a pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT-SHIV) to examine the impact of prior exposure to a NNRTI on subsequent ART comprised of a NNRTI and two nucleoside RT inhibitors. K103N resistance-conferring mutations in RT rapidly accumulated in 2/3 infected animals after NNRTI monotherapy and contributed to virologic failure during ART in 1/3 animals. By contrast, ART effectively suppressed RT-SHIV in 5/6 animals. These data indicate that suboptimal therapy facilitates HIV-1 drug resistance and suggest that this model can be used to investigate persisting viral reservoirs.
