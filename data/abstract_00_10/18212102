A-790742 is a potent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor, with 50% effective concentrations ranging from 2 to 7 nM against wild-type HIV-1. The activity of this compound is lowered by approximately sevenfold in the presence of 50% human serum. A-790742 maintained potent antiviral activity against lopinavir-resistant variants generated in vitro as well as against a panel of molecular clones containing proteases derived from HIV-1 patient isolates with multiple protease mutations. During in vitro selection, A-790742 selected two primary mutations (V82L and I84V) along with L23I, L33F, K45I, A71V/A, and V77I in the pNL4-3 background and two other mutations (A71V and V82G) accompanied by M46I and L63P in the HIV-1 RF background. HIV-1 pNL4-3 clones with a single V82L or I84V mutation were phenotypically resistant to A-790742 and ritonavir. Taking these results together, A-790742 displays a favorable anti-HIV-1 profile against both the wild type and a large number of mutants resistant to other protease inhibitors. The selection of the uncommon V82L and V82G mutations in protease by A-790742 suggests the potential for an advantageous resistance profile with this protease inhibitor.
