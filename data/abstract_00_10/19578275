We investigated 66 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae strains isolated from pigs affected with swine erysipelas in Japan from 1994 to 2001 for serotype, pathogenicity towards mice, protection in vaccinated mice and antimicrobial susceptibility. Most of the isolates (84.8%) were serotype 1 or 2. For the first time, strains belonging to serotype 21 were isolated from cases of septicemia. Fifty isolates (75.8%) were highly virulent, 12 isolates (18.2%) were weakly virulent and 4 isolates were avirulent strains. All the mice vaccinated with the Koganei 65-0.15 vaccine strain survived challenge exposure with 50 highly virulent isolates. Six isolates (9.1%) grew on TPB-T80 agar containing 0.02% of acriflavine, and this was identical to the growth of the vaccine strain. Forty-seven isolates (71.2%) were resistant to oxytetracycline. The number of strains resistant to oxytetracycline among field isolates increased rapidly each year. Tylosin-resistant strains were also isolated (6.1%). These results suggest that certain characteristics, particularly antimicrobial susceptibility of E. rhusiopathiae isolates, change yearly in the field. Therefore, further investigation of the characteristics of E. rhusiopathiae field isolates is necessary.
