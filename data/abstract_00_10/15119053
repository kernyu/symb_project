Antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the clinical laboratory is becoming more complex. We can no longer be concerned with simply determining accurate susceptibilities. Microbiologists must now possess knowledge of bacterial-resistance mechanisms and implement procedures to reliably detect them. The traditional susceptibility test will most likely need to be supplemented with testing methods and software that allow for phenotypic identification of resistance mechanisms. Resistance mechanisms can be present in apparently susceptible bacterial populations. Accurate identification of these mechanisms will help to control emergence of new resistance by encouraging use of the most appropriate antibiotics.
