BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate cases of Shigella and determine the pattern of antimicrobial resistance of shigella species in central Turkey. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight patients with shigella gastroenteritis presenting to Sami Ulus Children's Hospital from June 2002 to December 2002 were included in the study. The clinical and laboratory data of the patients with shigellosis were collected by chart review. Male/female ratio was 1.35 and mean age was 4.83 +/- 3.2 years (range: 1-16 years). Shigella sonnei (83.3%) was the most common serogroup. This was followed by S. flexneri (10.1%), then S. dysenteria (5.1%), and S. boydii (1.5%). The antibiotic susceptibility of the shigella strains was determined. Most strains of Shigella species were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (90.4%). All strains were found to be sensitive to ciprofloxacin (100%). Ampicillin susceptibility was 86.4% and cefotaxim (and/or ceftriaxon) susceptibility was 98%. CONCLUSION: Ampicillin is the drug of choice in the treatment of shigella infection in this region of Turkey. Cefotaxim or ceftriaxon was the second choice of antibiotics. Thus, Shigella is an important etiologic agent of diarrhea in Turkey. To determine the antibiotic susceptibility of the Shigella strains and appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment in Turkey, further studies will be needed.
