In order to further understanding of how different isolates of Burkholderia cepacia complex persist, spread and cause disease, B. cepacia-complex isolates from 60 patients attending the Cystic Fibrosis Centre of Verona, Italy, between 1997 and 2002 were analyzed. Strains were examined for species, presence of putative epidemic and virulence markers (i.e., cblA and the B. cepacia epidemic-strain marker [BCESM]), genetic relatedness and antibiotic susceptibility. Forty-five percent of patients were infected with B. cenocepacia recA subgroup B, 28% with B. cenocepacia recA subgroup A, 5% with B. multivorans and 5% with B. cepacia. No isolate carried cblA but 35% of B. cenocepacia and one of B. cepacia carried the BCESM transmissibility marker. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) identified 40 types; 22 of these corresponded to sporadic isolates and 18 to clusters of identical or genetically related strains. Piperacillin, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active antibiotics (43.3, 31.1 and 35.5% of resistance, respectively). These results confirm the prevalence of B. cenocepacia in cystic fibrosis patients with rapid clinical deterioration and in those with stable cases of infection. The rates of multiple-source and cross infection were relatively low.
