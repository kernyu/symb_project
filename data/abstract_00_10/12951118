Transposition of the pyridyl nitrogen from the P(3) substituent to the P(1)' substituent in HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PI) affords compounds such as 3 with an improved inhibitory profile against multiple P450 isoforms. These compounds also displayed increased potency, with 3 inhibiting viral spread (CIC(95)) at <8 nM for every strain of PI-resistant HIV-1 tested. The poor to modest bioavailability of these compounds may correlate in part to their aqueous solubility.
