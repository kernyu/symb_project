Eighty-five Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates resistant to various antibiotics were selected from the intensive care unit of a Brazilian hospital and analyzed for integron content by PCR. Fifty-four of them had class-1-related integrons, some of which were identical. Integron-positive isolates were statistically more resistant to aminoglicoside, quinolone and beta-lactam compounds. Ribotyping of integron-positive isolates demonstrated the presence of identical integrons among genetically unrelated strains in the hospital environment, confirming its role in the spread of gene cassettes in bacterial populations of clinical importance.
