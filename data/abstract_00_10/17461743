Dalbavancin is a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide that is derived from teicoplanin with an extended half-life that enables once-weekly dosing. It has potent in vitro activity against most gram-positive organisms, with lower minimum inhibitory concentration values than vancomycin and other investigational lipoglycopeptides. Dalbavancin is active against multi-drug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, except for strains exhibiting vanA resistance. Several Phase II and III trials have established similar efficacy and safety of dalbavancin with comparator agents in the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and in catheter-related bloodstream infections. Dalbavancin may serve as an appealing alternative agent in the treatment of gram-positive infections, especially with its convenient once-weekly regimen.
