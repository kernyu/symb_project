Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATS1 (alpha-tubulin suppressor 1) was originally identified as a high-copy suppressor of class two alpha-tubulin mutations and was proposed to have a regulatory role in coordinating the microtubule state with the cell cycle. Here, we show that Ats1p interacts with Nap1p, a cytoplasmic protein that regulates the activity of the Cdc28p/Clb2p complex. Loss of Nap1p results in a delayed switch from polar to isotropic bud growth. The delayed switch results in elongated buds. Nap1p and Ats1p interact in two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Both nap1Delta and ats1Delta cells have a Clb2p-dependent elongated bud morphology. Deletion of ATS1 partially suppresses the elongated bud morphology and benomyl resistance of nap1Delta mutants. Our results suggest Ats1p might regulate coordination of the microtubule state with the cell cycle through an interaction with Nap1p.
