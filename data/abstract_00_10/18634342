The aim of this study was to evaluated susceptibility to selected antibiotics and occurrence in clinical materials ESBL-positive and ESBL-negative K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca strains. The susceptibility to selected antibiotics were tested by disk-diffusion method. None of the analysed strains was resistant to imipenem. Among non beta-lactam antibiotics thwe most strains were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. The most frequently K. pneumoniae strains were isolated from urine, K. oxytoca trains were isolated from wounds.
