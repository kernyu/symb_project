A prospective study was set up to evaluate the emergence of HIV-1 resistance after a switch from an effective protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen to a multitherapy regimen including nevirapine (NVP). After 6 months with an undetectable viral load under a PI-containing regimen, the patients were switched to NVP with conservation of the associated nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Patients were followed-up at 1 month and then every 3 months after switching therapy. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the pol gene was performed at the first points of virologic failure. Thirty-four patients were included. The NRTI-naive group (22 patients) had begun antiretroviral therapy with a PI-containing regimen, whereas 12 patients (experienced group) had been previously treated by nucleoside mono-and/or dual therapy. After a median follow-up of 40 weeks, no patient of the naive group, versus 41% of the experienced group, developed a virologic failure after the change toward NVP ( p =.003). The virologic failures were associated with the appearance of NNRTI-resistant mutations. All rebound mutants also presented NRTI-resistance mutations. These results are consistent with a higher risk of virologic failure after a switch to an NNRTI in patients with prior suboptimal treatment and suggest the hypothesis that archived resistant viruses may facilitate the emergence of NNRTI resistance.
