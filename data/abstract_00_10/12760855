The resistance patterns and macrolide resistance mechanisms of 910 Finnish invasive pneumococci isolated during 1999 and 2000 were studied. Macrolide resistance was detected in 6.9% of isolates. Penicillin resistance was detected in 1.5% of isolates, and penicillin intermediate resistance was detected in 4.0% of isolates. Active macrolide efflux, mediated by the mef(A) gene, was the most common macrolide resistance mechanism. Four macrolide-resistant isolates had mutations in rRNA or ribosomal protein L22.
