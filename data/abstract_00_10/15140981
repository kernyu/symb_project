The diketo acids are potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase (IN). Mutations in IN, T66I, S153Y, and M154I, as well as T66I-S153Y and T66I-M154I double mutations, confer resistance to diketo acids (D. J. Hazuda et al., Science 287:646-650, 2000). The effects of these IN mutations on viral replication, enzymatic activity, and susceptibility to other HIV inhibitors are reported herein. By immunofluorescence assay and real-time PCR, all mutant viruses demonstrated a modest delay in viral spread compared to that of reference HIV. These viruses also showed a statistically significant defect in integration without defects in reverse transcription. Recombinant IN containing S153Y, T66I, and M154I-T66I mutations had an approximately twofold decrease in both disintegration and 3'-end-processing-strand transfer activities in vitro. In contrast, IN containing M154I demonstrated a greater than twofold increase in specific activity in both reactions. All mutant HIVs were resistant to l-chicoric acid, a dicaffeoyltartaric acid IN inhibitor, both in tissue culture and in biochemical assays, yet remained susceptible to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine and nevirapine. Thus, IN mutations conferring resistance to the diketo acids can yield integration defects, attenuated catalysis in vitro, and cross-resistance to l-chicoric acid.
