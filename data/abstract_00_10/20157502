The antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative pathogens has become problematic. In some cases related to Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., no antimicrobials on the market can be utilized at standard doses. We report a case of resistant Acinetobacter infection in a patient in the intensive care unit. In this scenario, we successfully treated the infection with doripenem at a higher dose of 1 g with a 4-hour infusion time along with the combination of tigecycline and colistin.
