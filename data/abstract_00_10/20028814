Anidulafungin Etest and CLSI MICs were compared for 143 Candida sp. isolates to assess essential (within 2 log(2) dilutions) and categorical agreements (according to three susceptibility breakpoints). Based on agreement percentages, our data indicated that Etest is not suitable to test anidulafungin against Candida parapsilosis and C. guilliermondii (54.4 to 82.4% essential and categorical agreements) but is more suitable for C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis (87.9 to 100% categorical agreement).
