Four hundred ninety seven strains of Vibrio cholerae selected from isolates in Romania in the last decade 1990-1999 were investigated for antibiotic resistance and for classical and putative virulence factors. V. cholerae O1 strains predominated in clinical cases and non O1 strains in the environment, excepting in 1992 when non O1 strains were frequent in clinical and environmental sources. V. cholerae O1 strains previously susceptible to tetracycline acquired clinically significant resistance to this drug during 1993-1994, but this trend was reversed in 1995, following the introduction of nalidixic acid in cholera treatment in 1994. V. cholerae O1 and non O1 clinical isolates acquired simultaneous resistance to the vibriostatic agent O/129 and cotrimoxazole during 1994-1995. High levels of intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics were exhibited by all strains examined. The presence of cholera toxin (CT) was concentrated in clinical V. cholerae O1 strains and was substituted in clinical non O1 strains by four putative virulence markers (Kanagawa haemolysin, slime, lipase, and colonial opacity). Colonial opacity (30%) was present only in clinical isolates of V. cholerae non O1. Pigmentogenesis (11.7%) has present only in environmental sources. Antibioresistance profiles differ for V. cholerae O1 and non O1 strains with respect to their source of isolation. This aspect may imply a role in virulence and survival of V. cholerae in the natural environment where they may serve as a reservoir of virulence and multiple drug resistance genes.
