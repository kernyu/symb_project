OBJECTIVE: To write a guideline for the management and prevention of nosocomial infections in South Africa in view of the following: Nosocomial infections are a common and increasing problem globally, including South Africa. Widely varying standards of prevention and management of these important infections. Increasing and emerging antimicrobial resistance among commonly isolated pathogens. The significant economic burden of these infections on the health care system as well as their impact on patient morbidity and mortality. The main aims of the guideline are to provide recommendations for the initial choice of antimicrobial agents and the appropriate management of these infections encompassing the following conditions: (i) nosocomial pneumonia, health care-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia; (ii) nosocomial bloodstream infections; (iii) nosocomial intravascular infections; (iv) nosocomial urinary tract infections; (v) nosocomial intra-abdominal infections; and (vi) nosocomial surgical skin and soft-tissue infections. EVIDENCE: Working group of clinicians from relevant disciplines, following detailed literature review. RECOMMENDATIONS: These include details of the likely pathogens, an appropriate diagnostic approach, antibiotic treatment options and appropriate preventive strategies. ENDORSEMENT: The guideline document was endorsed by the South African Thoracic Society, the Critical Care Society of Southern Africa and the Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa.
