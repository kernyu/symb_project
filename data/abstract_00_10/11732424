The Ad hoc Group of experts on antimicrobial resistance, appointed by the Office International des Epizooties, has developed an objective, transparent and defensible risk analysis process, providing a valid basis for risk management decisions in respect to antimicrobial resistance. The components of risk analysis and of different possible approaches in risk assessment (qualitative, semiquantitative and quantitative) are defined. The Ad hoc Group recommended the following: an independent risk assessment based on scientific data; an iterative risk analysis process; a qualitative risk assessment systematically undertaken before considering a quantitative approach; the establishment of a risk assessment policy; and the availability of technical assistance for developing countries.
