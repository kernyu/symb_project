AIM OF THE STUDY: Oncological patients are particularly prone to the onset of septic complications such as abdominal abscesses. The aim of our study was to analyze clinical and microbiological data in a population of oncological patients, submitted to percutaneous ultrasound-guided drainage (PUD) for postoperative abdominal abscesses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 24 patients operated on for neoplastic pathologies and treated with PUD for abdominal abscesses during the postoperative period were reviewed. In all cases cultural examination with antibiogram was performed. RESULTS: In 5 out of 24 patients (20.8%), the abdominal abscesses appeared after the discharge, with a mean hospital stay of 34.2 +/- 24.9 days. In six out of 24 patients (25%) there were multiple abscesses localizations. The cultural examination was positive in 23 patients and negative only in one patient. Abscesses localized only in the upper abdominal regions had a significant prevalence of monomicrobial cultural examinations (57.1%) with respect to the results for abscesses placed in the lower abdominal regions, that were polymicrobial in 88.8% of cases (p = 0.027). An antibiogram demonstrated a stronger activity of beta-lactamines, chinolones, and glycopeptides with respect to aminogycosides, cephalosporins, and metronidazole. CONCLUSIONS: In oncological patients, the planning of the empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the anatomotopographic localization of the abdominal abscess and on the typology of the operation performed giving preference to beta-lactamines, chinolones and glycopeptides.
