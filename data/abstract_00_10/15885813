Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) is a gamma-herpesvirus with no clear disease association, and due to its biological characteristics, has been suggested as a gene delivery vector. It was demonstrated previously that recombinant BoHV-4 carrying a neomycin-resistance gene was able to infect a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD-4), resulting in no detectable cytopathic effect (CPE) and allowing selection of G418-resistant persistently-infected cells containing circular episomal viral DNA [Donofrio, G., Cavirani, S., van Santen, V.L., 2000a. Establishment of a cell line persistently infected with recombinant BoHV-4. J. Gen. Virol. 81, 1807-1814.]. Those cells produce infectious virus and infection is predominantly non-permissive and non-cytopathic. Starting from these results, the ability of RD-4 cells to sustain persistent infection was combined with positive selection activity conferred by the neomycin-expression cassette insert, as an easier way to select recombinants of BoHV-4 following homologous recombination in permissive cells. A tool for selecting BoHV-4 recombinants was developed by drug positive selection.
