We investigated the role of NKT cells in immunity to Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia muridarum infections using a combination of knockout mice and specific cellular activation approaches. The NKT-deficient mice showed exacerbated susceptibility to C. pneumoniae infection, but more resistance to C. muridarum infection. Activation of NKT reduced C. pneumoniae in vivo growth, but enhanced C. muridarum infection. Cellular analysis of invariant NKT cells revealed distinct cytokine patterns following C. pneumoniae and C. muridarum infections, i.e., predominant IFN-gamma in the former, while predominant IL-4 in the latter. The cytokine patterns of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells matched those of NKT cells. Our data provide in vivo evidence for a functionally diverse role of NKT cells in immune response to two intracellular bacterial pathogens. These results suggest that distinct NKT subsets are induced by even biologically closely related pathogens, thus leading to differential adaptive immune response and infection outcomes.
