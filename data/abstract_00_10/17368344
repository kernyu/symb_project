The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance gained by filling root canals of simulated immature teeth with either Resilon, gutta-percha, a self-curing flowable composite resin (BisFil 2B), or a self-curing hybrid composite resin (BisFil II). Seventy-two sheep incisors were divided into six groups of 12 teeth each. Negative controls received no treatment. Teeth in all other groups were prepared until a size 120 LightSpeed LSX instrument could be passed out the apex. After apical placement of a mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) barrier, the canals were filled with their respective test material to the facial CEJ. The positive control canals were left unfilled. The access openings (including positive controls) were restored with BisFil II. Each root was horizontally fractured through the test material using an Instron. The mean peak loads to fracture were recorded. The hybrid composite resin (BisFil II) was the only material significantly more fracture resistant than positive controls (p < 0.017).
