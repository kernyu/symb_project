Two hundred and five isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were collected from Nantes University Hospital in 2002. A new 30bp deletion was detected downstream of the -10 box of the SHV-1 promoter in a clinical K. pneumoniae isolate with a high amoxicillin/clavulanic acid minimum inhibitory concentration. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed increased transcription of bla(SHV-1) mRNA. All conjugation mating assays failed. This new promoter was cloned upstream of the cat gene of the reporter plasmid pKK232-8 and compared with previously described bla(SHV-1) promoters. The deletion induced a 15-fold increase in promoter strength compared with the usual weak promoter. This study reports a new genetic event that increases bla(SHV-1) chromosomal gene expression, which may be of clinical relevance when associated with porin deficiency.
