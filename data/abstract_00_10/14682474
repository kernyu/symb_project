1alpha,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25D3) activates conventional PKC and may subsequently lead to insulin resistance. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that pretreatment with 10 nM-10 microM 1,25D3 dose-responsively suppressed insulin-induced glucose. To assess PKC(beta)-mediated inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake in rat adipocytes, we preincubated with Go6976 and LY379196, conventional PKC inhibitors, and found they abolished the 1,25D3-mediated inhibitory effect on insulin-induced 2-deoxyglucose (DOG) uptake. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of 1,25D3 on insulin-induced DOG uptake was abrogated in adipocytes overexpressed with dominant negative PKC(beta), but not in those overexpressed with wild type PKC(beta). These results suggest that 1,25D3 reduces insulin-induced glucose uptake via activation of PKC(beta) in rat adipocytes.
