Influenza viruses are etiological agents of deadly flu that continue to pose global health threats, and have caused global pandemics that killed millions of people worldwide. The global crisis involving the avian H5N1 influenza provides compelling reasons to accelerate fast track development of novel antiviral drugs against the potential pandemic virus. The availability of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir (tamiflu) improves our ability to defend against influenza viruses, but the incidences of tamiflu-resistance are rising rapidly. Nucleic acid-based antiviral drugs are promising classes of experimental antiviral drugs that have been shown in pre-clinical studies to be effective against seasonal and avian influenza viruses. The potency and versatility of these drugs make them potential candidates to be used in seasonal and pandemic influenza scenarios. The review will assess the recent patents, research and development of antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, immunomodulating RNA for the prevention and treatment of influenza infection.
