Additional to epidemic methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (haMRSA) which had been disseminated in and between hospitals, MRSA emerged in the community independent upon the nosocomial setting (caMRSA). caMRSA possess the capacity to form Panton-Valentine-Leukocidin (PVL) as a special virulence factor. In general PVL-positive S. aureus isolates are associated with necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections as well as with necrotizing pneumonia. caMRSA are less "broad" resistant against different groups of antibiotics as haMRSA and require special attention when performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Prevention of further dissemination of caMRSA requires appropriate diagnosis, therapy and sanitation of the carrier state. Hygienic measures have not only to be taken in ambulant treatment but also in households of affected patients.
