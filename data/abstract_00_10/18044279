Recent emphasis on the prevention of surgical wound infection has highlighted the role of the anesthesiologist as the physician responsible for administering appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients often report a distant or unclear history of penicillin allergy. Administering an antibiotic to which the patient has a true allergy can provoke a life threatening reaction. The anesthesiologist should be aware of the prevalence, severity, and manifestations of allergies to antibiotics, as well as the available alternatives. Unnecessary administration of more powerful broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to the development of antimicrobial resistance and should be avoided. It is the anesthesiologists' duty to balance these issues when selecting appropriate antibiosis.
