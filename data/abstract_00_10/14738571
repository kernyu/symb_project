Bacterial meningitis causes 125,000 deaths each year in infants and young children and 96% of these occur in less developed countries where up to 50% of children with this disease die and 25-50% of survivors have neurological sequelae. Although 3rd-generation cephalosporins are optimal empirical therapy for bacterial meningitis, they are unaffordable in many developing countries. The majority of children worldwide are currently treated with cheaper alternatives. This paper reviews the challenges facing clinicians treating bacterial meningitis in developing countries, highlighting the problem of changing patterns of antibiotic resistance. In particular, it details the evidence for the use of chloramphenicol and 3rd-generation cephalosporins.
