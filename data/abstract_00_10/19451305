The previously reported CXCR4 antagonist KRH-1636 was a potent and selective inhibitor of CXCR4-using (X4) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) but could not be further developed as an anti-HIV-1 agent because of its poor oral bioavailability. Newly developed KRH-3955 is a KRH-1636 derivative that is bioavailable when administered orally with much more potent anti-HIV-1 activity than AMD3100 and KRH-1636. The compound very potently inhibits the replication of X4 HIV-1, including clinical isolates in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from different donors. It is also active against recombinant X4 HIV-1 containing resistance mutations in reverse transcriptase and protease and envelope with enfuvirtide resistance mutations. KRH-3955 inhibits both SDF-1alpha binding to CXCR4 and Ca(2+) signaling through the receptor. KRH-3955 inhibits the binding of anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibodies that recognize the first, second, or third extracellular loop of CXCR4. The compound shows an oral bioavailability of 25.6% in rats, and its oral administration blocks X4 HIV-1 replication in the human peripheral blood lymphocyte-severe combined immunodeficiency mouse system. Thus, KRH-3955 is a new promising agent for HIV-1 infection and AIDS.
