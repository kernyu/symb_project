The present study was carried out to assess the prevalence of motile Aeromonas spp. in the faeces of clinically healthy sheep, cattle and horses and evaluate their susceptibility to some anti-microbial agents. Rectal swabs from 120 sheep, 85 cattle and 20 horses were examined for Aeromonas species using alkaline peptone water (pH 8.4) as the enrichment medium and Aeromonas Selective Agar containing 5 mg/l ampicillin as the isolation medium. Identification and antibiotic resistance of motile Aeromonas strains was performed using Gram Negative Enteric ID panel. Motile aeromonads were isolated from 12 (10%) sheep, 7 (8.2%) cattle and 1 (5%) horse. Of these 20 aeromonad isolates, 13 were A. caviae, 6 were A.sobria and 1 was A. hydrophila. Aeromonas species in the faeces of livestock might pose a public health problem for humans who are in direct contact with contaminated animals. However, further studies should be performed on aeromonads relating to their transmission between animals and humans.
