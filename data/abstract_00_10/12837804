The crystal structure of the ketolide telithromycin bound to the Deinococcus radiodurans large ribosomal subunit shows that telithromycin blocks the ribosomal exit tunnel and interacts with domains II and V of the 23S RNA. Comparisons to other clinically relevant macrolides provided structural insights into its enhanced activity against macrolide-resistant strains.
