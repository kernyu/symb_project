INTRODUCTION: European Centre for Diseases Control (ECDC), involved in the surveillance of nosocomial infections (NI) and resistance to antimicrobials (AMR) in Europe, estimates 4 million IN/year, among whom 37,000 deceased, out of which half are determined by multiresistant germs (MDR). A phenomenon encountered more and more often is that of pan-resistance of germs, without the option for an optimal antibiotherapy. The allarming increase of AMR is a phenomenon which our country also faces in the present. MATERIAL, METHOD, RESULTS: Resistance rate registered in Intensive Care Units in Timisoara during 2005-2007 (when we participated in the Helics European network) situates us among the last places among the European countries that participated--with 50-60% MRSA strains, 24% E. coli BLSE strains, 62,7% K. pneumoniae BLSE strains, 34% P. aeruginosa BLSE. Furthermore, data registered in ambulatory in the South-West part of Romania during 2006-2007 (processed by the greatest private laboratory in the region) are not more optimistic--26% MRSA strains, 4,25% E. coli BLSE, 12,49% K. pneumoniae BLSE, 8,69% P. aeruginosa BLSE. CONCLUSIONS: As the management of MDR produced infections requires huge costs, a better antibiotic policy in the Romanian hospitals and ambulatory is compulsive, being more efficient to spend for control than for the treatment of these infections.
