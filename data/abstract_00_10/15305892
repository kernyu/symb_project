BACKGROUND: In the context of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy, adiponectin concentrations have been shown to be related to lipodystrophy, metabolic alterations and HIV-protease inhibitor (PI) use. The replacement of PI by nevirapine has improved the lipid profile of patients under antiretroviral therapy. The aim of the present study was to examine whether adiponectin concentration or insulin sensitivity level correlate with the modifications of lipid parameters after the switch of PI by nevirapine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The evolution of metabolic parameters before and after 6 months of substitution of nevirapine for protease inhibitors was evaluated in a cohort of 55 HIV-1 infected patients. Adiponectin concentration, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) mass concentration and triglyceride enrichment of HDL were determined before and after the replacement of PI by nevirapine. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by the HOMA model assessment. RESULTS: Twenty-four weeks of treatment with nevirapine improved significantly the lipid profile with a significant reduction of apoB (from 0.98 to 0.92 g L(-1); P = 0.005) and triglyceride (from 2.02 to 1.66 mmol L(-1); P = 0.02). HDL cholesterol and apoA1 increased significantly (from 0.99 to 1.19 mmol L(-1); P = 0.001 and from 1.40 to 1.57 g L(-1); P < 0.001, respectively). The triglyceride enrichment of HDL significantly decreased after the replacement of PI by nevirapine (from 0.248 +/- 0.092 to 0.213 +/- 0.093; P = 0.003). At baseline, and after 24 weeks of nevirapine treatment, we observed significant correlations between adiponectin level and lipid parameters [(HDL-cholesterol (r = 0.66, P = 0.001 and r = 0.69, P = 0.001); triglycerides (r = -0.42, P = 0.002 and r = -0.57, P = 0.001), and triglyceride enrichment of HDL (r = -0.43, P = 0.005 and r = -0.53, P = 0.005)]. Twenty-four weeks of treatment with nevirapine did not significantly change adiponectin concentrations (from 984 to 1086 micro g L(-1), P = 0.22), CETP mass and insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSION: This study shows that even though a strong correlation was found between adiponectin and some metabolic parameters at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment by nevirapine, the improvement of lipid profile observed after the replacement of PI by nevirapine was not in relation to the change of plasma adiponectin concentration. The significant decrease of triglyceride enrichment of HDL after the replacement of PI by nevirapine probably leads to a decreased catabolism of HDL lipoprotein, and consequently explains the increase of plasma HDL concentration observed in this study.
