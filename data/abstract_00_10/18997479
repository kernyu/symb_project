AIMS: We studied whether verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, affects cardiovascular symptoms in alcohol withdrawal. METHODS: Cardiovascular effects of verapamil (5 mg intravenously) were compared in 20 alcohol-dependent subjects during alcohol withdrawal (n = 10) on days 1, 2 and 10 and during early recovery (n = 10; duration 45 +/- 4.1 days). The heart rate was obtained from the electrocardiogram. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured with a sphygmomanometer by Korotkoff. Stroke volume was studied by impedance cardiography. RESULTS: Significant differences in verapamil effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and stroke volume and total peripheral resistance were observed in patients with withdrawal when compared with those in early recovery. CONCLUSION: L-type Ca2+ channels may modify vascular tone in alcohol withdrawal.
