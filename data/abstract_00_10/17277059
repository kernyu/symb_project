MgrA is a known regulator of the expression of several multidrug transporters in Staphylococcus aureus. We identified another regulator of multiple efflux pumps, NorG, by its ability, like that of MgrA, to bind specifically to the promoter of the gene encoding the NorA efflux pump. NorG is a member of the family of the GntR-like transcriptional regulators, and it binds specifically to the putative promoters of the genes encoding multidrug efflux pumps NorA, NorB, NorC, and AbcA. Overexpression of norG produces a threefold increase in norB transcripts associated with a fourfold increase in the level of resistance to quinolones. In contrast, disruption of norG produces no change in the level of transcripts of norA, norB, and norC but causes an increase of at least threefold in the transcript level of abcA, associated with a fourfold increase in resistance to methicillin, cefotaxime, penicillin G, and nafcillin. Overexpression of cloned abcA caused an 8- to 128-fold increase in the level of resistance to all four beta-lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, MgrA and NorG have opposite effects on norB and abcA expression. MgrA acts as an indirect repressor for norB and a direct activator for abcA, whereas NorG acts as a direct activator for norB and a direct repressor for abcA.
