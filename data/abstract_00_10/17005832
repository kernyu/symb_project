Construction and integration of recombinant mini-Tn7 expression vectors into the chromosome of a surrogate, efflux-sensitized, and biosafe Pseudomonas aeruginosa host was validated as a generally applicable method for studies of uncharacterized bacterial efflux pumps. Using this method, the Burkholderia pseudomallei bpeEF-oprC operon was shown to encode a chloramphenicol and trimethoprim efflux pump.
