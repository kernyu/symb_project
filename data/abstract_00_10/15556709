Mesenterocins 52A and 52B belong to class II of lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins. To study susceptibility, insensitivity and resistance to these mesenterocins, four wild-type bacterial strains and four resistant strains, all from Leuconostoc or Weissella genus, were compared. Several cell envelope features were investigated: susceptibilities to antibiotics and to lysozyme, cell morphology and membrane phospholipids contents. The strain insensitive to the two mesenterocins appeared to be resistant to lysozyme and exhibited the highest resistance to antibiotics. Resistant strains displayed cell morphology modifications, several increases in antibiotic resistance and modifications in lysozyme susceptibility. Moreover, mesenterocin 52A-resistant strains displayed modifications in their membrane phospholipids, leading to a more cationic membrane. Insensitivity and resistance of Leuconostoc or Weissella strains seem to be due to various minor modifications of the membrane and/or of the cell wall.
