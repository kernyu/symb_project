The in vitro activity of HMR 3562, a new 2-fluoro-ketolide drug, was investigated against 95 enterococci, including 36 vancomycin-resistant strains. HMR 3562 inhibited 90% of enterococci susceptible or resistant to erythromycin A at 0.005 and 0.6 mg/L, respectively. HMR 3562 was highly active in murine peritonitis induced by five enterococci, irrespective of resistance phenotype, displaying effective doses in the range 3.4-21.8 mg/kg. The results demonstrate the potential of HMR 3562 in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant enterococci.
