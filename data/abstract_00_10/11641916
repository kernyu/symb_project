Multiple drug resistance is exhibited by coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus isolated from hospitals. Prevalence of MRSA due to prolonged stay in the hospital, instrumentation/invasive procedure, surgical intervention and misuse of antibiotics have been reported. Antibiogram of 200 coagulase staphylococci showed 10% MRSA strains. Predominant phage type 81 belonged to unclassified group followed by phage type 84 belonged to group 3. As the management of MRSA is not easy, efforts should be made to eradicate the MRSA by taking strict aseptic conditions and the severe infections should be treated according to the sensitivity pattern of the strain.
