CASE REPORT: A twenty-eight year old woman with necrotitizing retinitis and herpes simplex virus type 1 isolated in aqueous humor with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An Acyclovir and corticosteroid therapy was started with unsuccessful response, Foscarnet was added getting quiescence of lesions. DISCUSSION: Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome (ARNS), induced by a virus of the herpes family, could develop in immunocompetent people. A characteristic clinical case with uveitis and vitritis, white retinitis areas and occlusive vasculitis is reported. Antiviral therapy with acyclovir and antiinflammatory treatment must be established quickly. Foscarnet can effectively treat ARNS in inmunocompetent patients. In spite of therapy, this is a potentially blinding retinal disease.
