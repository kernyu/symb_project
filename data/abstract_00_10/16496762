Statistics for the last 6 years show a trend to growing number of new cases with tuberculosis of the lungs with drug-resistant pathogen. In recurrent tuberculosis multiple drug resistance (MDR) was three times higher than in new cases. Treatment efficacy depended on MDR and patients' compliance. The results of the basic treatment course were unstable: many patients had exacerbation within 3-4 years after therapy, many patients died, especially those with M. tuberculosis resistant to many drugs.
