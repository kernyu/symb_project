We collected 312 samples from hospitalized patients in two hospitals in Timisoara between September-December 2003. We isolated 83 strains with nosocomial potential. Identification of the germs was performed using the automatic API system, and the susceptibility tests were performed using disc-diffusion and the agar dilution test. By analyzing the extended antibiograms we categorized the germs considering their phenotypes of resistance and we remarked a high percentage of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae and S. aureus with multiple resistance to antibiotics.
