The amides 7 were synthesized from the annulated methyl 4-pyridone-2-carboxylates 4 via the carboxylic acids 5 and their acid chlorides by reacting with the novaldiamine base 6. The alcohol 8b, obtained from DIBAH reduction of the ester 4b, was transformed to the chloromethyl derivative 9 which reacted with 6 and 18-crown-6 leading to the 2-novaldiaminomethyl-4-pyridone 10. Compound 10 was obtained with higher yield from DIBAH reduction of the amide 7b. The substances 7 and 10 were inactive when tested against the chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain Dd2.
