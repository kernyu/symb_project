We compared tomato defense responses to Phytophthora infestans in highly compatible and partially compatible interactions. The highly compatible phenotype was achieved with a tomato-specialized isolate of P. infestans, whereas the partially compatible phenotype was achieved with a nonspecialized isolate. As expected, there was induction of the hypersensitive response (HR) earlier during the partially compatible interaction. However, contrary to our expectation, pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression was not stimulated sooner in the partially compatible interaction. While the level of PR gene expression was quite similar in the two interactions, the LeDES gene (which encodes an enzyme necessary for the production of divinyl ethers) was expressed at a much higher level in the partially compatible interaction at 48 h after inoculation. Host reaction to the different pathogen genotypes was not altered (compared with wild type) in mutant tomatoes that were ethylene-insensitive (Never-ripe) or those with reduced ability to accumulate jasmonic acid (def-1). Similarly, host reaction was not altered in NahG transgenic tomatoes unable to accumulate salicylic acid. These combined data indicate that partial resistance in tomato to P. infestans is independent of ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid signaling pathways.
