Fusidic acid-resistant epidemic Staphylococcus aureus strains causing impetigo bullosa have been reported in Scandinavia. We show that these strains form part of a European epidemic clonotype that carries the fusB determinant. In contrast, resistance to fusidic acid in a collection of nonepidemic strains resulted primarily from mutations in fusA.
