BACKGROUND: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated SSTIs (cSSTIs), particularly those caused by Gram-positive pathogens, are among the most common human bacterial infections. The emergence of resistance to antibiotics such as methicillin and vancomycin has compromised treatment options for these infections and stimulated the search for new antimicrobial therapies. Daptomycin, the first in a class of agents known as cyclic lipopeptides, is a novel antibiotic with potent activity against most Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. SCOPE: This review examines the novel properties of daptomycin and describes its therapeutic efficacy and tolerability, particularly in the treatment of cSSTIs. The data search strategy included identification of original research papers, review articles, meeting reports and editorials by searches of MEDLINE and references from relevant articles. FINDINGS: In vitro studies have demonstrated that daptomycin has superior bactericidal activity compared with vancomycin and the newer anti-Gram-positive agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid. Robust, randomised, phase III clinical trials have shown daptomycin to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of cSSTIs caused by Gram-positive bacteria, with equivalent clinical success rates and a similar safety profile to those of comparator agents. Data from these studies suggest a trend toward shorter duration of therapy and faster resolution of symptoms with daptomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Given the pressing need for new antibiotics to combat infections caused by Gram-positive organisms, and to overcome the problem of resistance to conventional antibiotics, daptomycin is a welcome addition to the treatment options for the management of cSSTIs.
