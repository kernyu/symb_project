Ceftazidime and cefotaxime are beta-lactam antibiotics with dose-related affinities for penicillin-binding protein (PBP)-3 and PBP-1. At low concentrations, these antibiotics inhibit PBP-3, leading to filament formation. Filaments are long strands of non-dividing bacteria that contain enhanced quantities of endotoxin molecules. Higher concentrations of ceftazidime or cefotaxime cause inhibition of PBP-1, resulting in rapid bacterial lysis, which is associated with low endotoxin release. In the present study, 37 isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. were studied over a 4-h incubation period in the presence of eight concentrations of ceftazidime or cefotaxime. As resistance of Gram-negative bacteria is an emerging problem in clinical practice, 14 isolates of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were also investigated. Morphological changes after exposure to the beta-lactam antibiotics revealed recognisable patterns in various bacterial families, genera and isolates. In general, all isolates of Enterobacteriaceae produced filaments within a relatively small concentration range, with similar patterns for E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. produced filaments in the presence of clinically-relevant concentrations of both antibiotics as high as 50 mg/L. In all genera, filament-producing capacity was clearly related to the MIC. Ceftazidime induced filament production in more isolates and over wider concentration ranges than did cefotaxime. Interestingly, ESBL-producing isolates were not protected against filament induction. The induction of filament production may lead to additional risks during empirical treatment of severe infections.
