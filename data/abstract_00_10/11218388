Susceptibility testing of mupirocin (MUP) was performed by an agar dilution method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS) to detect the MUP resistance. A total of 434 isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci were examined and all of 205 isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from 43 hospitals nationwide in 1993 were sensitive to MUP. However, MUP resistance emerged among 228 isolates [185 isolates (88 cases) of MRSA and 43 isolates (28 cases) of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (MR-CNS)] from nasal swabs of patients with MUP treatment between Sep 1996 and Feb 2000 in the Nagoya University Hospital. The high-level MUP resistance (MIC > or = 512 micrograms/mL) was isolated from two patients, one isolate of MRSA and four of S. hominis, respectively. Low-level MUP resistance (MIC 8-128 micrograms/mL) was isolated from three patients, 11 isolates of MRSA, one of S. chromogenes and five of S. epidermidis, respectively. The mupA which encodes the MUP resistant isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IRS) were investigated by PCR in these MUP resistant isolates. The mupA was detected only in high-level MUP resistant S. hominis, but not detected in high-level MUP resistant MRSA and low-level MUP resistant isolates. We also investigated the characteristics of the patients with MUP resistance. All of MUP resistant staphylococci were isolated after initiation of MUP treatment. Four patients with MUP resistant MRSA and low-level MUP resistant MR-CNS had MRSA infectious disease and MUP resistant strains were successfully eradicated with vancomycin treatment in two patients. MUP high-level resistant S. hominis, has emerged after MUP treatment for eradication of MRSA. Clinical guidelines for the prudent use of MUP should be generally adopted with careful monitoring of emergence of MUP resistance.
