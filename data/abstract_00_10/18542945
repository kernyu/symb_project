Improvement of pristinamycin production by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis was performed by using recursive protoplast fusion and selection for improved resistance to the product antibiotic in a genome shuffling format. A 100-microg/ml pristinamycin resistant recombinant, G 4-17, was obtained after four rounds of protoplast fusion, and its production of pristinamycin reached 0.89 g/l, which was increased by 89.4% and 145.9% in comparison with that of the highest parent strain M-156 and the original strain CGMCC 0957, respectively. The subculture experiments indicated that the hereditary character of high producing S. pristinaespiralis G 4-17 was stable. It is concluded that genome shuffling improves the production of pristinamycin by enhancing product-resistance in a stepwise manner. Pristinamycin fermentation experiments by recombinant G 4-17 were carried out in a 5-l fermentor, and its production of pristinamycin reached 0.90 g/l after 60 h of fermentation.
