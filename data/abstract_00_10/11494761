Survival of lytic bacteriophages active against Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and ssp. cremoris was determined after treatment with sodium hypochlorite and during storage at 4 degrees C. Three phages were isolated from dairy plants in Argentina (ARG) and the other phages were isolated in the United States of America (US). All of them represent phages that infected cheese manufacture industries and belong to different morphological or serological groups. These phages showed higher survival in M17 broth, buffered with sodium glycerophosphate, than in trypteine soy broth (TSB). Phage populations did not decrease significantly during 14 weeks in M17 broth, whereas in TSB the titers of phage suspensions began to decline around 9 days. In addition, the effect of sodium hypochlorite was more marked in broth than in milk. A higher surviving fraction was obtained in milk, even when tenfold higher concentrations of chlorine were used. The effect of hypochlorite on phages of the same serological group was quite similar and independent of phage morphology. However, phage 137-1, which belongs to other serological group, showed lower resistance to sodium hypochlorite. Comparing the hypochlorite inactivation for ARG and US phages, it was observed that they have their own inactivation values, independently of their origin and morphological group. Long periods of time and high concentrations of chlorine were necessary to reduce the surviving fraction in milk. This indicates that hypochlorite concentrations and times of contact can be critical for the efficiency of the operative sanitization processes.
