We recently reported that NCX-4016, a derivative of aspirin containing a nitro moiety that releases nitric oxide (NO) in a sustained fashion in biologic systems, is a potent cytotoxic agent inhibiting the proliferation of cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that NCX-4016 possesses antiangiogenic properties. Our study with the bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells (BLMVECs) revealed that NCX-4016 significantly induced the loss of redox-dependent cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as assayed by the redox-sensitive Alamar blue cell viability assay. Fluorescence microscopy of cells labeled with NO-specific fluorophore (DAF-FM) confirmed that NCX-4016 generated significant levels of intracellular NO. NO donors, including S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, spermine NONOate, and isosorbide dinitrite, were less effective in causing loss of cell viability. Thiol-protectant, N-acetylcysteine, significantly attenuated the NCX-4016-induced loss of cell viability, suggesting the role of alteration of thiol-redox status therein. NCX-4016 also suppressed oxygen consumption, decreased transendothelial electrical resistance (EC barrier dysfunction), and induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization in BLMVECs. The in vitro assay with human umbilical vein ECs and BLMVECs revealed that NCX-4016, in a dose-dependent manner, significantly inhibited angiogenesis with almost complete inhibition at a 100-microM concentration, suggesting that NCX-4016 can act as an antiangiogenic drug.
