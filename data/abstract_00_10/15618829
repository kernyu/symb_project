Chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after renal transplantation. Administration of immunosuppressive drugs facilitates viral replication and may lead to increased frequency of progressive chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HBV infection adversely affects both patient and graft survival. Because of increased risk of death HBV-seropositive renal graft recipients require prophylaxis and treatment of hepatitis B. Interferon due to its immunomodulating effects, risk of activation of rejection is not recommended for transplant recipients. Lamivudine seems to be efficacious and useful for treating hepatitis B in renal transplant recipients. The main disadvantages of lamivudine are relapse after withdrawal of the agent and emergence of lamivudine resistant strains due to mutations in the YMDD locus of the HBV polymerase gene during prolonged lamivudine therapy. Optimal lamivudine treatment regimen for HBsAg-positive renal transplant recipients should be defined. It seems better to initiate lamivudine therapy before or immediately after transplantation to prevent viral replication. The clinical course of hepatitis in most patients with lamivudine resistant HBV mutants seems relatively benign and long-term resistance was well tolerated. Discontinuation of lamivudine in order to minimize the emergence of drug resistant HBV mutants is safe in selected groups of patients. Lamivudine therapy has become the treatment of choice in HBV positive renal transplant recipients and improves prognosis and outcome of infected patients.
