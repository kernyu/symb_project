The 1995 guideline on pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has been updated. The general practitioner should consider PID whenever a woman of childbearing age complains of lower abdominal pain; the diagnosis should then be based on 5 criteria: (a) non-acute lower abdominal pain; (b) pain on upward movement or adnexal tenderness during vaginal touch; (c) painful or swollen adnexae; (d) ESR > or = 15 mm in the 1st hour or a temperature > 38 degree C, and (e) no indications for other diseases, such as appendicitis or an extra-uterine pregnancy. In case of diagnostic doubt, a gynaecologist must be consulted. Rapid treatment with antibiotics diminishes symptoms, shortens the course of disease, and may prevent complications such as infertility or extra-uterine pregnancy. Treatment should be started with ofloxacin and metronidazole. Due to the increasing antibiotic resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, when there are indications for this pathogen the medicinal treatment should immediately be directed at it by means of cefotaxim, doxycycline and metronidazole. In his or her information to the patient, the general practitioner should devote attention to the major role of sexually transmissible micro-organisms and give advice, if necessary, regarding high-risk behaviour.
