We report a linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis infection in a cord blood stem cell transplant recipient previously treated with linezolid for bloodstream infections by vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Sequencing showed a G2576U mutation in the 23S rRNA gene. Because of the important niche of linezolid in cancer treatment, linezolid-resistant E. faecalis is noteworthy.
