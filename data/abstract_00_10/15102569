Keratomycoses have recently emerged as an important cause of ocular morbidity, especially in third-world countries. Available antifungal agents are limited in their efficacy, due to limited penetration into the cornea, the fungistatic nature and the development of drug resistance. Effective usage of the available drugs is hampered by the inefficiency of currently available antibiotic sensitivity tests for fungal organisms. There is also limited knowledge regarding the ideal combination(s) of antifungal agents, including issues of synergism and antagonism. Despite these problems, recent publications indicate encouraging outcomes in the treatment of a large series of fungal keratitis. Advances include better drug formulations, new agents and novel methods of drug delivery into the eye. As our ability to deal with advanced fungal keratitis remains limited, the importance of early diagnosis has been stressed and molecular biological techniques may play an important role in the future. This article summarises the important new advances in these areas in the past 2 years and provides guidelines for the management of these serious corneal infections.
