We investigated the effects of high protein intake on host resistance to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Two-d fasted mice were infected with P. brasiliensis and refed on diets with three different levels (54%, 20%, and 5%) of casein. The mice refed the 54% casein diet showed reduced antifungal activity in the spleen and liver as compared with the mice refed the 5% or the 20% casein diet. After infection, increases in spleen and liver mRNA levels of myeloperoxidase, cathepsin-G, and elastase-2 were more profound in the mice refed the 54% casein diet as compared with the mice refed the 5% or the 20% casein diet. Infected mice refed the 54% casein diet exhibited greater interferon (IFN)-gamma production in the spleen and liver and higher levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) in the liver as compared with those refed the 5% casein diet. These results indicate that high protein intake impairs host resistance to P. brasiliensis.
