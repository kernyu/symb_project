We report the detection and characterization of the first vancomycin-resistant VanB-type Enterococcus faecium to be isolated in a Spanish hospital. Sequence analysis of the vanB gene showed that this isolate belonged to subtype vanB2. Moreover, PCR amplification analysis indicated that the vanB gene cluster was linked to a Tn5382-like transposon.
