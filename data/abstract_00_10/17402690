Portopulmonary hypertension is characterized by a chronic liver disease associated with a mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg at rest, an increased pulmonary vascular resistance and a capillary pulmonary pressure <15 mmHg with portal hypertension. Schistosomiasis may be an aetiology of this syndrome, however, few cases have been reported. We describe the first cases of portopulmonary hypertension with schistosomiasis in Malagasy patients. There were 2 men aged of 18 and 20 from hyperendemic area of schistosomiasis in Madagascar Both had a history of repeated water contact. They presented a dyspnea associated with ascites and oedema. Clinical examination showed portal and pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular heart failure. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur and splint of the second heart pulmonary Pulmonary hypertension was confirmed by cardiac ultrasonogaphy Serology of bilharzias was positive. Parasitological examination showed eggs of S. mansoni. The treatment based on salt-free diet, spironolactone and praziquantel led to a better evolution of symptoms (case 1). Symptoms of right heart failure remained for the second patient even though improvement was noted. In tropical countries, schistosomiasis may be one of the cause of portopulmonary hypertension and may appear in early age. Its treatment remains difficult as the drugs recommended are not affordable.
