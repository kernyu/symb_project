We present a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia who developed subcutaneously disseminated aspergillosis after allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT). Disseminated aspergillosis after stem cell transplantation has a high mortality despite treatment with amphotericin B or one of the azoles. Aspergillosis in our patient was refractory to amphotericin B and itraconazole but was successfully treated with caspofungin acetate.
