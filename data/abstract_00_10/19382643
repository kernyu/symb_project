Forty-one pulmonary tuberculosis patients (32 males and 9 females) excreting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) with extensive drug resistance to antituberculous drugs were examined. The process was first detected in 14.6% of the patients. At the previous stage of treatment, the vast majority of patients (85.4%) received antituberculous drugs. Fibrocavernous tuberculosis was a predominant form (73.1%). The acutely progressive course of the process was observed in 29.3% of patients. Lung destructive changes and bacterial excretion were revealed in all (100%) patients. Resistance to streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, and fluoroquinolones was seen in all (100%) patients. The fact that in this cohort of patients the resistance of MBT to reserve drug, such as kanamycin, amikacin, and cycloserine, is observed at a rather high rate (from 58.5 to 73.1%) is concerned about. For evaluation of the efficiency of treatment, all the examinees were divided into 2 groups, which were equal in clinical and laboratory characteristics. Group 1 patients (n = 19) were given chemotherapy regimen 2b (in new cases of tuberculosis) and individual chemotherapy regimens. Collapse therapy was additionally used in the treatment of Group 2 patients (n = 22). After 3-month chemotherapy, negative sputum was established in 4 (9.8%) and 6 (14.6%) patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Following 6-month therapy, MBT excretion ceased in 13 (31.7%) and 15 (36.6%) patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. After 3- and 6-month therapy, decay cavity closure occurred in 2 (4.8%) and 7 (17%) Group 1 patients and in 4 (9.8%) and 15 (36.6%) Group 2 patients, respectively (p < 0.05).
