A rise of resistance in uropathogens to all agents used for the management of urinary tract infections has been observed in Moscow. However, because of the broad spectrum and favourable safety parameters, fluoroquinolones remain the drugs of choice for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections. Among them levofloxacin is preferable. When the use of fluoroquinolones is contraindicated, the 1st-3rd generation cephalosporins are advisable. Nitrofurans are expedient in the treatment of acute and relapsing cystitis. By the antibacterial activity and bioavailability sodium furasidin is advantages among the nitrofurans.
