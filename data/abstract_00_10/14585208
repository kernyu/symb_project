Maturation of infectious human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles requires proteolytic cleavage of structural polyproteins by viral protease. Inhibition of protease is a powerful tool for the treatment of HIV infection. Using a well-established phenotypic drug susceptibility assay, we found that sequences outside of the protease gene can modulate the susceptibility to protease inhibitors (PIs). Chimeric viruses carrying p1-p6/p6* sequences from patient isolates in the context of an NL4-3 molecular clone exhibited increased PI susceptibility. Furthermore, this phenotype was associated with a delay in protease autoprocessing in virions and a reduction in replication capacity. We propose that the interplay between protease and the C terminus of Gag is critical for proper protease activity and mismatches between these regions can reduce viral replication and increase drug susceptibility.
