Only a few drugs are available for the treatment of malaria. Artemisinin combination treatment is advocated because of its efficacy and to prevent the development of resistance. In the Netherlands, falciparum malaria is treated with atovaquone-proguanil or artemether-lumefantrine, both registered as 3-day treatments. In a recent study, 21 patients were treated with artemether-lumefantrine for 5 days. There are arguments in favour of a 5-day course: absorption of lumefantrine is dependent on food intake and the serum levels of lumefantrine are higher on day 7 after a 5-day course than after a 3-day course. As shown by studies in Thailand, the serum level is related to the relapse rate, although these studies revealed no difference in relapse rate between the 3- and 5-day courses. In endemic countries, short courses of treatment are favoured to further patient compliance. Artesunate for i.v. administration is urgently needed.
