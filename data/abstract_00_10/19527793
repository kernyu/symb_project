Overexpression of MDR1 efflux pump is a major mechanism contributing to drug resistance in Candida albicans, the most common human fungal pathogen. To elucidate the regulatory pathway of drug resistance, we have identified a negative regulator of MDR1 and named it Regulator of Efflux Pump 1 (REP1). Overexpression of REP1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae increased susceptibility to fluconazole. Furthermore, null mutations on REP1 decreased the susceptibility to antifungal drugs in C. albicans resulting from increased expression of MDR1 mRNA. Hence, Rep1p is involved in drug resistance by negatively regulating MDR1 in C. albicans.
