The in vitro activity of levofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin were examined by conventional in vitro tests against 150 clinical isolates of staphylococci, subdivided according to species and susceptibility to methicillin. Although the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all quinolones were highest in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, the activity of levofloxacin was almost complete in methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis and methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus when compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, which showed more than 30% resistance. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to all quinolones with few differences between the antibiotics tested. The minimal bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was within the double dilution range of MIC values for all strains tested, demonstrating its potent role against staphylococci. In time-kill studies, levofloxacin exerted bactericidal activity within 3 h against all staphylococci. These in vitro results suggest that levofloxacin is a potent fluoroquinolone against coagulase-negative staphylococci and that it is both methicillin-susceptible and resistant. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of this drug in the treatment of infections sustained by these microorganisms.
