Transcriptional organization of bla(CTX-M-2) present in a multiresistance plasmid of Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis suggests the presence of more than one promoter involved in the expression of the beta-lactamase gene. At least two bla(CTX-M-2)-specific mRNAs (near to 1 kb and 5 kb) were evidenced. Two +1 signals were detected at -22 bp and -59 bp of bla(CTX-M-2) defining two putative promoters.
