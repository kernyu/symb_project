An increasing number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients have detectable viraemia despite treatment with multiple-drug combinations or have developed resistance to all available classes of antiretroviral therapy. HIV entry has become an important pharmacological target. Enfuvirtide is the first HIV entry inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of drug-experienced patients but several other agents are progressing through preclinical and clinical trials. However, because different entry inhibitors target different parts of the entry process their combined effects could be synergistic or generate different distinct profiles of drug-resistance. The HIV envelope glycoprotein that drives HIV entry is highly variable. Its plasticity allows HIV to escape the immune system and its variability is associated with HIV tropism, fitness and replicative capacity. Thus, mutations that confer resistance to entry inhibitors will modify these parameters. Therapeutic strategies that aim at blocking virus entry may also be used to alter the natural evolution of HIV in an unprecedented way. Here, we will describe the structure and function of the envelope glycoprotein complex that constitute the basis for the emergence of resistance to HIV entry inhibitors, review those HIV entry inhibitors for which drug-resistance has been evaluated and discuss the interplay between viral resistance to inhibitors of HIV entry and the pathogenicity of HIV and AIDS.
