Sixty-three Staphylococcus aureus strains (40 from clinical sources and 23 from food sources) were examined for toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) using PCR, phage typed using the international phage set (IPS) and tested for their susceptibility to antibiotics. Only three strains (all from clinical sources) were positive for the TSST-1 gene (tst). The majority of S. aureus strains that were typeable by IPS belonged to group II. Resistance to one or more antibiotics was detected in 47.5 and 73.9 % of clinical and food strains, respectively. This is the first time that PCR detection of tst in S. aureus has been reported from Libya, and further studies are needed on the occurrence of toxic shock syndrome in the community and the role of TSST-1-producing S. aureus in this disease in Libya.
