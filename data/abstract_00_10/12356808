One hundred and twenty-four erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were examined for the presence of macrolide resistance genes. The erm(B) gene was detected in 118 (95.2%) isolates and the mef(A) gene in 83 (66.9%) isolates. Both the mef(A) and erm(B) genes were detected in 77 (62.1%) isolates. DNA macrorestriction analysis of these isolates identified them as belonging to a single multi-resistant clone.
