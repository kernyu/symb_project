The efficacy of telavancin, a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide, was compared to that of vancomycin and linezolid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a murine pneumonia model. Telavancin produced greater reductions in lung bacterial titer and mortality than did vancomycin and linezolid at human doses equivalent to those described by the area under the concentration-time curve. These results suggest the potential utility of telavancin for treatment of MRSA pneumonia.
