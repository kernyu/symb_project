AIMS: To determine the occurrence of Escherichia coli harbouring virulence markers of shiga- or entero-toxins and resistance to antimicrobials in surface waters. METHODS AND RESULTS: Surface water samples were collected at six locations of the river Gomti. E. coli isolates (n = 90) were characterized for their pathogenic potential using polymerase chain reaction to detect virulence genes as well as their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents using disc diffusion methods. In this study, 57.8% of E. coli isolates exhibited resistance to three or more antimicrobial agents. Sensitivity to cephotaxime, gentamicin and norfloxacin was observed in 7.8%, 48.9% and 77.8% of isolates, respectively. Both stx1 and stx2 genes were present in 15.6% of isolates while remaining isolates had either stx1 (17.8%) or stx2 (6.7%). The stx1 gene (33.3%) was more prevalent than stx2 (22.2%). The results indicate that the LT1 and ST1 genes were positive in 21.2% of isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of multi-drug resistance and virulence genes in E. coli isolated from surface water being used for domestic and recreational purposes may result in waterborne outbreaks. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The data will be useful in monitoring surface waters for forecasting and management of waterborne outbreaks.
