This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) isolates on poultry and pig farms in England and Wales. A total of 217 VREF isolates were obtained from fresh feces and environmental swabs collected from conventional and organic farms. A predominant pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profile was found for each VREF-positive farm, together with less frequent types. All isolates presented the vanA genotype and were esp negative. Seventy-six percent of the VREF isolates were additionally resistant to nine or more antimicrobials, presenting a diverse range of resistance phenotypes. The multiresistance traits did not appear to be specific to individual farms or sample types (i.e., environmental or fecal), nor did they correlate with any specific PFGE type. Ninety-three percent of the isolates were resistant to penicillin, 89% were resistant to tetracycline, 87.5% were resistant to erythromycin, and 50% were resistant to quinupristin-dalfospristin (Synercid). The lack of clonality among these populations may suggest the horizontal transfer of resistance genes and/or a dynamic replacement of clonal lines rather than persistence.
