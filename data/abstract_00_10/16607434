OBJECTIVE: To survey the antibiotic susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates. DESIGN: This was a cohort analytical study. SETTING: Three clinics serving different areas in Port Elizabeth. Outcome measures. Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 35 isolates (60%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin, while 28 (80%) showed resistance to erythromycin, 17 (48.6%) to penicillin, 3 (8.6%) to doxycycline, 11 (31.4%) to spectinomycin and 33 (94.3%) to tetracycline. CONCLUSION: To ensure effective treatment of gonorrhoea, continued surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility is necessary.
