The incidence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, antimicrobial susceptibility, and outcomes of nosocomial imipenem-resistant A. baumannii (IRAB) infections during a 5-y period (2003-2007) were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 720 patients with 925 episodes of A. baumannii infection were included in the study. A. baumannii infections were seen mostly in intensive care units. The incidence was 6.2 per 1000 admissions. The most common infections were pneumonias and bloodstream infections. Imipenem resistance among Acinetobacter strains increased significantly each y of the study (from 43.3% to 72.9%). Mortality was related to the presence of imipenem resistance, stay in intensive care unit, female gender, old age, and pneumonia. Haemodialysis, malignancy, and mechanical ventilation were significant risk factors for IRAB infections. Imipenem resistance was higher in strains isolated from patients with pneumonia. IRAB strains showed higher resistance rates to other antibiotics than imipenem-susceptible strains. The most active antimicrobial agents against A. baumannii were cefoperazone-sulbactam and netilmicin. The incidence of A. baumannii infections and imipenem resistance increased during the study period. IRAB infections should be considered in patients on mechanical ventilation and haemodialysis and in patients with malignancies.
