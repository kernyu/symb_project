Although resistance to quinolones is commonly chromosomally-encoded in Enterobacteriaceae, the emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) has also been reported, with at least three known resistance mechanisms to date, i.e., Qnr, aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(6')-Ib-cr and QepA. Qnr proteins protect target enzymes (DNA gyrase and type IV topoisomerase) from quinolone inhibition, the AAC(6')-Ib-cr enzyme acetylates norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and the QepA efflux pump extrudes hydrophilic fluoroquinolones. Although these PMQR determinants confer only low-level resistance to quinolones and/or fluoroquinolones, they may provide a favourable background in which the selection of additional chromosomally-encoded quinolone resistance mechanisms can occur.
