BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with an imbalance in cytokine production and defective intestinal barrier function. Previous studies indicate that IL-4, a cytokine increased in food allergy and in early Crohn's disease, enhances epithelial permeability. Here, we characterized the mechanism of action of IL-4 on cultured epithelial cells and examined if the anti-inflammatory cytokines, TGF-beta or IL-10, can modulate the effects of IL-4. METHODS: Confluent monolayers of human T84 epithelial cells were cultured with IL-4 alone or in combination with IL-10 or TGF-beta or with inhibitors of protein synthesis and blockers of IL-4 receptor signalling pathways. Permeability was evaluated by measuring transepithelial resistance (TER), flux of (3)H-fMLP (a small bacterial tripeptide) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (a macromolecule). RESULTS: T84 cells cultured with IL-4 showed a significant drop in TER as well as an increased flux of (3)H-fMLP and HRP. Co-treatment with IL-10 did not improve TER, whereas TGF-beta attenuated the resistance drop. However, neither TGF-beta nor IL-10 were able to correct the increased (3)H-fMLP flux. In contrast, the increased HRP flux caused by IL-4 was inhibited by both IL-10 and TGF-beta. TGF-beta and IL-10 significantly reduced IL-4-enhanced values for endosomal area and paracellular spaces containing HRP. Inhibitor studies indicated the requirement for protein synthesis and the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new insights into the regulation of intestinal barrier function and may suggest a novel approach in the treatment of intestinal inflammation.
