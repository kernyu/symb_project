BACKGROUND: Recent data has suggested the use of antibiotics acquired without a prescription by Latinos in the United States. We explored Latino adults' experience in treating common infections particularly in regards to self-medication with antibiotics. METHODS: We conducted 3 focus groups (n = 28) in Charleston, South Carolina, with Latino adults (>or=18 years of age) recruited throughout the community: 12 women and 16 men, ranging in age from 18 to 52 years. All of the participants were immigrants, 89% noted Mexico as their country of origin. Focus groups were conducted in Spanish and audiotaped. Transcripts were translated into English and then translated back to Spanish to assure consistency of the language. Themes were identified using an editing style. RESULTS: Participants' previous experiences in countries with limited restrictions on antibiotics influenced acquisition of antibiotics without a prescription in the United States. Participants believed that physician visits for a diagnosis and prescription were unnecessary when the patient was familiar with the symptom and it had previously responded to antibiotic treatment. Access to care was not reported to be a significant barrier to a physician visit when individuals felt they were "sick" or children were the patients. Participants reported using local tiendas (small stores in Latino neighborhoods that sell ethnically consistent and imported products) and importation of medication to meet their need for self-medication with antibiotics. The role of self-medication in the development of antibiotic resistance was essentially unknown among the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Successful interventions to improve use of antibiotics need to be culturally sensitive to specific attitudes and behaviors found in the Latino population.
