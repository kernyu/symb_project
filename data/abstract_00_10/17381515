Correspondence between two distinct genetic traits, 16S rRNA gene sequences and repetitive element-sequence-based BOX-PCR DNA fingerprints, and antibiotic inhibition and resistance phenotypes was explored for a spatially explicit sample of Streptomyces from a prairie soil. There was no correspondence between 16S rRNA gene sequence groups and antibiotic phenotypes. However, 16S rRNA gene sequence groups differed significantly in mean inhibition zone sizes. Specific antibiotic phenotypes may reflect local selection pressures, as suggested by the significant differences in mean inhibition zone sizes against specific test isolates by Streptomyces from the same 16S rRNA gene sequence group but from different locations in soil. Significant correlations between antibiotic phenotypes and BOX-PCR fingerprints were found, but were small (r=0.19-0.22). Although genetic characterizations alone were not predictive of specific antibiotic phenotypes, 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses may identify isolates that are most or least likely to possess substantial inhibitory potential, providing insight into the broad ecological strategy for individual isolates.
