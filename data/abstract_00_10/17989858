BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is one of the main obstacles for an effective eradication of H. pylori infection. AIM: To determine the susceptibility of H. pylori strains obtained from gastric biopsies to metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Susceptibility to metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin was determined using E-test in 46 isolates of H. pylori obtained from gastric biopsies of 54 adult patients. RESULTS: Thirty three percent of isolates were resistant to metronidazole and 2% were resistant to clarithromycin and amoxicillin. One isolate was resistant to metronidazole and clarithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial susceptibility of these strains of H. pylori obtained from Paraguayan patients, may help to decide the initial therapy to eradicate this infection.
