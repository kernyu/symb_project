Emergence of multi and pan-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial infections in intensive care settings has become a challenge for clinicians. The mortality rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is known to increase when the initial microbiological diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy are inappropriate. We present a case of a 18-year-old man, who after being admitted following an accident, had developed VAP due to multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and had a downhill clinical course despite broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The strains were found to be Col-S, as the susceptibility was tested. Colistin was instituted, with remarkable recovery. It is imperative to diagnose VAP with multi-drug resistant strains as early as possible; colistin, the 'last resort' antibiotic, if instituted with proper monitoring at the right time, can be life saving.
