Escherichia coli isolates obtained from faeces (n=85) and blood (n=123) were susceptibility tested against 17 antimicrobial agents and the presence of 9 virulence genes was determined by PCR. Positive associations between several antimicrobial resistances and 2 VF genes (iutA and traT) were found among blood isolates, sometimes among faecal isolates.
