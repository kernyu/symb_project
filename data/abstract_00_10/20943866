We analyzed a collection of 60 Salmonella enterica 4,5,12:i:- phage type U302 multidrug-resistant monophasic variant strains, isolated in Spain between 2000 and 2007. Most strains showed resistance to ampicillin (A), chloramphenicol (C), sulfamethoxazole (Su), gentamicin (G), streptomycin (S), tetracycline (T), and co-trimoxazole (SxT) (an ACSuGSTSxT resistance pattern). Only one pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type was detected, with 19 subtypes (Simpson's index of diversity [SID]=0.89). Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) showed more variability, with 32 profiles (SID=0.97), but only showed diversity at the STTR5 and STTR6 loci. PCR and sequencing demonstrated all strains contained the same allantoin-glyoxylate pathway deletion. Four types of deletions were detected in the fljAB operon, all starting at the same position, at the STM2758 gene, and followed by an IS26 insertion. Furthermore, a representative set of strains of the four deletion types harbored plasmids with IS26. We propose that a Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium U302 multidrug-resistant (ACSuGSTSxT) strain, defective for the allantoin-glyoxylate pathway and containing IS26 at plasmid pU302L, could be the ancestor of the variant in Spain.
