The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of antituberculosis ofloxacin resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain isolates in Spain. Over a period of one month, 213 M. tuberculosis strains collected from 14 different hospitals were studied, including strains both susceptible and resistant to primary antituberculosis drugs. In 28.1% of the strains, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ofloxacin of 0.25 microg/ml was obtained; in 43.6% the MIC was 0.5 microg/ml; in 22.06% it was 1 microg/ml; and in 6.1% it was > or =2 microg/ml. Ofloxacin currently seems to be an effective antimicrobial in vitro against susceptible or multiresistant strains of M. tuberculosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative or HIV-positive patients in Spain.
