The emergence of resistance to antibiotics is a serious problem often related to suboptimal drug dosing; such suboptimal dosing results in the preferential killing of drug-susceptible microbial subpopulations, allowing amplification of drug-resistant microbial subpopulations. We determined the effect that fluctuating concentrations of quinolone drugs have on both the total population and the resistant subpopulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, by employing, over a 48-h period, human pharmacokinetics and multiple regimens in an in vitro-infection model. All data were simultaneously modeled by use of 3 parallel inhomogeneous differential equations. Model parameters were used to derive the minimal, or breakpoint, drug exposure necessary to suppress amplification of the resistant subpopulation. In a prospective-validation study, we found that a drug exposure near to but below the calculated breakpoint amplified the resistant subpopulation, whereas a drug exposure at the breakpoint suppressed it. This approach allows delineation of target drug exposures (area under the concentration/time curve for 24 h : minimal inhibitory concentration [AUC(24) : MIC] = 190) that will suppress amplification of the antibiotic-resistant subpopulation, thereby preserving the susceptibility of target pathogens.
