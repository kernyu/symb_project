OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical applications, and safety of ramoplanin, a lipoglycodepsipeptide antibiotic. DATA SOURCES: Information was obtained from MEDLINE and BIOSIS databases (1984-August 2004) and Oscient Pharmaceuticals using the key words ramoplanin, A 16686, A 16686A, and MDL 62198. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Available English-based articles and abstracts were reviewed, along with information from Oscient Pharmaceuticals. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ramoplanin exerts its bactericidal activity against gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria by blocking peptidoglycan synthesis via lipid II. In vitro susceptibility reports have demonstrated efficacy against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive pathogens. Cross-resistance has not been documented with vancomyin and other glycopeptides. Clinical trials are investigating ramoplanin's oral administration for treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Previous clinical trials had evaluated the suppression of colonization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus with ramoplanin. Adverse effects are minimal, and drug-drug interactions have not been documented. CONCLUSIONS: The completion of clinical trials will determine whether ramoplanin has a promising role as a treatment option for diarrhea due to C. difficile.
