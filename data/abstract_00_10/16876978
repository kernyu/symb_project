This report describes the serotypes and antimicrobial resistance patterns of 860 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from nasopharyngeal (NP) carriers and clinical specimens collected from Taiwanese children during the years 1997 to 2003. The 6 most common serotypes/groups were 23F, 19F, 6B, 14, 6A, and 3. These accounted for 652/716 (91.1%) of the NP and 131/144 (91.0%) of the clinical isolates. Serotype 23F was the most common isolate in the NP carriers (25.7%, 184/716). Serogroup14 was most common in the clinical isolates (29.2%, 42/144) and the most frequent invasive isolate (43.4%, 33/76). It was more frequently associated with invasive infection than all other serotypes/groups (odds ratio = 7.2; 95% confidence interval, 4.16-12.46; P < .0001). Resistance to macrolides was high in all serotypes/groups, which ranged from 70% to 97%. Resistance to penicillin varied among the 6 leading serotypes/groups, ranging from 3% in serogroup 3 to 99% in serotype 19F. Serotype 23F was most likely to be multidrug resistant to penicillin, macrolides, and chloramphenicol compared with all others (107/150 [71%] versus 105/461 [23%], P < .0001). The potential coverage by the pentavalent and heptavalent vaccines was 83% for all isolates, but was significantly lower for NP than clinical isolates (81% versus 92%, P< .01). These findings provide baseline data to compare trends in the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns with the introduction of childhood pneumococcal vaccination in Taiwan and other countries.
