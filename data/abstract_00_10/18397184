The incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after liver transplantation (LT) has decreased in recent years. Advances in immunosuppression and CMV prophylaxis have improved the management of CMV disease. Organ involvement is infrequent and gastrointestinal CMV disease is quite rare. Few cases of an antral mass due to CMV infection have been described; those reported to date have mostly been in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We describe a case of a CMV-seronegative liver transplant patient who received a seropositive liver graft. Owing to gastrointestinal complaints, CMV prophylaxis was stopped one month after LT. The patient developed an antral mass due to CMV infection and an anastomotic biliary stricture. Antigenemia became negative with ganciclovir, but this treatment did not eliminate the mass. Ganciclovir resistance was ruled out as well as other causes of antral mass, especially malignancy. The patient finally required gastrectomy and hepaticojejunostomy. We conclude that CMV disease is less common today but should be included in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal mass after transplantation.
