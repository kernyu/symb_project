Because few data are available in Italy regarding antimicrobial susceptibility and serotype distribution of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, meningeal isolates collected at Italian hospitals during the years 1997-1999 were studied. The 12 most common serogroups, representing > 85% of the isolates, were 14, 23, 6, 4, 3, 9, 19, 8, 1, 12, 18, and 7 (in order of frequency). The serogroups identified in children < 5 years old were more limited in number: 80% are included in the 7-valent conjugate vaccines. Penicillin resistance was observed in 14 (9.5%) of 148 strains and increased from 5% in the first part of the study to 13% in the last part. Only 2 strains were fully penicillin resistant, and these belonged to serotype 9V. Thirty percent of the strains, mostly belonging to serogroups 14 or 6 and carrying either the ermB or the mef genes, were resistant to erythromycin.
