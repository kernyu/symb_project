OBJECTIVES: To investigate the pattern of antibiotic use in the hospital over a 3-year period according to individual drugs and hospital departments. SETTING: 335 adult beds of a tertiary hospital in Northern Israel during the years 1998-2000. An antibiotic control policy restricts the use of the most expensive antibiotics and those with broad spectrum of activity and a major impact on bacterial resistance. METHODS: The ATC/DDD and DU 90% methodologies were used. The use of antibiotics was expressed as the number of defined daily doses (DDD) per 100 bed-days. RESULTS: The total antibiotic use varied during the study period from 93.7-101.0 DDD/100 bed-days (p < 0.1). Thirteen drugs accounted for 90% of the total volume. The use of broad spectrum penicillins was the highest of all drugs followed by cephalosporins and oral quinolones. The highest rates of antibiotic use were found in the departments of ENT, urology, gynecology and orthopedics and in the intensive care unit (ICU). The total restricted antibiotics use was 7.2 DDD/100 bed-days and was the highest in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The ATC/DDD methodology provided delineation and interpretation of antibiotic usage patterns in the hospital. Although the overall use is higher then that found in several reports from European hospitals, stratification by individual drugs and by hospital department yielded similar trends.
