Susceptibility data for 10 049 Escherichia coli isolates derived from community-acquired urinary tract infections in Greece during the period January 2000 to June 2002 indicated 8.1% resistance to nalidixic acid and 36% resistance to ciprofloxacin. In a sample of 170 E. coli isolates, mutations in gyrA (25 isolates) and parC (15 isolates) were consistent with the levels of resistance to quinolones. Previous exposure to quinolones and underlying chronic disease were independent risk factors for infection by quinolone-resistant E. coli strains.
