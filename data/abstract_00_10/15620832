Cefdinir is an oral cephalosporin approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for the treatment of community-acquired (CA) respiratory tract and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of cefdinir against recent clinical isolates collected from CA-urinary tract infections (UTIs), a possible expanded indication. A total of 456 isolates from CA-UTI were collected from medical centres in North America (NA; United States and Canada) in 2003 and susceptibility tested by NCCLS reference broth microdilution methods. Cefdinir and cefpodoxime were the most active compounds tested against Escherichia coli (98.7% susceptibility), followed by nitrofurantoin (97.0%) and ciprofloxacin (95.0%). Cefdinir was 8- to 16-fold more potent than cefuroxime axetil and cefprozil against E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. The activity of cefdinir was most similar to that of cefpodoxime against E. coli and Klebsiella spp., but cefpodoxime showed inferior activity against S. saprophyticus. The cefdinir spectrum was significant superior (+3.8 to 16.5%) to that of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole against all pathogens evaluated. The cefdinir spectrum and potency were comparable or superior to other orally administered beta-lactams tested against recent (2003) clinical isolates from CA-UTI.
