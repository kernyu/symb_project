The antimycobacterial activity of "Hikari-Gintech" powder, which has photocatalytic activity, was examined in vitro. Both powder dissolved in liquid and Hikari-Gintech-coated cloths showed strong antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, M. bovis BCG Pasteur, multi-drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (a clinical isolate) and M. avium. Hikari-Gintech powder appeared to affect mycobacterial cell wall metabolism rather than mycobacterial DNA because no damage to mycobacterial DNA was detected after spraying with Hikari-Gintech solution.
