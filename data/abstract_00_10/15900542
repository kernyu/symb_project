Serpentine soils collected from Saddle Hills, Chidyatapu and Rutland of Andaman Islands, India were analyzed for physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and compared with those from adjacent non-serpentine localities. The serpentine soils contained high levels of nickel (1740.0-8033.4 mg/kg dry soil), cobalt (93.2-533.4 mg/kg dry soil) and chromium (302.9-4437.0 mg/kg dry soil), in addition to 62-152 g of iron and 37-60 g of magnesium per kg dry soil. Characteristically the serpentine soils showed low microbial density (6.2-11.3 x 10(6) colony forming unit/g soil) and activity (1.7-3.5 microg fluorescein/g dry soil/h) than non-serpentine outcrops. Serpentine microbial population was dominated by bacteria which represented 5.12 to 9.5 x 10(6) cfu/g of soil, while the fungal population ranged from 0.17 to 3.21 x 10(6) cfu/g of soil. A total of 342 (200 from serpentine and 142 from non-serpentine soils) isolates were compared for Ni, Co and Cr resistance. Serpentine microflora was in general, highly resistant than non-serpentine ones and showed a metal-resistance profile of Cr > Ni > Co. Amongst the serpentine isolates, 8 and 11 bacteria tolerated > 12.0 mM Ni and > 16.0 mM Cr respectively, while 6 fungal isolates showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value > 8.0 mM Co. These 25 serpentine strains also showed co-resistance to Cu, Zn and Mn but were sensitive to Hg and Cd. The selected bacterial isolates were resistant to ampicillin, penicillin G and polymyxin B, whereas fungal strains showed resistance to amphotericin B, nystatin and fusidic acid.
