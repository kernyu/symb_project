AIM: To study cyclosporin A (CsA) aerosol for anti-airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in sensitized rats. METHODS: Sensitized Sprague-Dawley rats were given cyclosporin A (5, 20 g.L-1) and sodium cromoglycate (SCG, 20 g.L-1) by aerosol (5 min per day), dexamethasone (DXM, 0.5 mg.kg-1) i.p. once per day for 7 d before antigen challenge. The respiratory resistance(R(aw)) and lung dynamic compliance(Cdyn) of the rats induced by methacholine (Mch) were measured 24 h after ovalbumin(OA) challenge. The PC50 changes of R(aw) and PC25 changes of Cdyn were also investigated. RESULTS: Pretreatment with CsA, sodium cromoglycate and dexamethasone inhibited the increase of R(aw) and decrease of Cdyn caused by inhaling Mch. The value of R(aw) PC50 in the CsA(5 g.L-1) group 5.6 g.L-1, the CsA(20 g.L-1) group 6.4 g.L-1, the SCG group 8.3 g.L-1 and the DXM group 9.2 g.L-1, was significantly higher than that of the model group 1.9 g.L-1 (P < 0.05). The value of Cdyn PC25 in the CsA(5 g.L-1) group 4.3 g.L-1, the CsA(20 g.L-1) group 5.4 g.L-1, the SCG group 6.4 g.L-1 and the DXM group 6.2 g.L-1, was significantly higher than that of the model group 1.1 g.L-1 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Anti-AHR of CsA by aerosol in animal model offered an experimental evidence for topical inhalation of CsA in treatment of asthma.
