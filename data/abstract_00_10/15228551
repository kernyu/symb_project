Quinolone-resistant (QR) mutants of Mycoplasma bovirhinis strain PG43 (type strain) were generated by stepwise selection in increasing concentrations of enrofloxacin (ENR). An alteration was found in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the parC gene coding for the ParC subunit of topoisomerase IV from these mutants, but not in the gyrA, gyrB, and parE gene coding for the GyrA and GyrB subunits of DNA gyrase and the ParE subunit of topoisomerase IV. Similarly, such an alteration in QRDR of parC was found in the field isolates of M. bovirhinis, which possessed various levels of QR. The substitution of leucine (Leu) by serine (Ser) at position 80 of QRDR of ParC was observed in both QR-mutants and QR-isolates. This is the first report of QR based on a point mutation of the parC gene in M. bovirhinis.
