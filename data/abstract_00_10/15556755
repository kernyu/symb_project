Predicting a bioactive conformation of a ligand is of paramount importance in rational drug design. The task becomes very difficult when the receptor site possesses a region with unusual conformational flexibility. Significant conformational differences are present in the active site regions in the available crystal structures of the core domains of HIV-1 integrase (IN). Among all reported IN inhibitors, the beta-diketoacid class of compounds has proved to be of most promise and indeed S-1360 was the first IN inhibitor to enter clinical studies. With an aim to predict the bioactive (active site bound) conformation of S-1360, we performed extensive docking studies using three different reported crystal structures where the active site or partial active site region was resolved. For comparison we extended our studies to include 5CITEP (the first compound cocrystallized with IN core domain) and a bis-diketoacid (BDKA). We found that the conformation of S-1360 when bound in one of the active sites matches that of the experimentally observed results of IN escape mutants resistant to S-1360. Therefore, we propose that this active site conformation is the biologically relevant conformation and can be used for the future structure-based drug design studies selectively targeting IN.
