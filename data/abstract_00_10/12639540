A series of P1/P1' substituted cyclic urea analogues were prepared in an attempt to increase the intra-cellular antiviral potency of the nonsymmetrical 3-aminoindazoles DMP 850 and DMP 851. The effect of alkyl substitution of the P1/P1' residues on cellular antiviral potency, protein binding, resistance profile and pharmacokinetics are described.
