The antibacterial activities of seven fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, BAYy3118, clinafloxacin, gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin) against isogenic efflux-mediated multidrug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia, were compared. The results indicate that these fluoroquinolones are all substrates for the multidrug efflux systems of these organisms. Clinafloxacin was found generally to be the most active agent against multidrug-resistant strains.
