The level of resistance to antibiotics of various chemical structure in actinobacteria of the genus Streptomyces is shown to be regulated by Ca2+ ions. The inhibitors of Ca2+/calmodulin and Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine protein kinases (STPK) are found to reduce antibiotic resistance of actinobacteria. The effect of Ca2+ -dependent phosphorylation on the activity of the enzymatic aminoglycoside phosphotransferase system protecting actinobacteria from aminoglycoside antibiotics was studied. It is shown that inhibitors of Ca2+/calmodulin and Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent STPK reduced the Ca2+ -induced kanamycin resistance in Streptomyces lividans cells transformed by a hybrid plasmid which contained the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase VIII (APHVIII) gene. In S. coelicolor A3(2) cells, the protein kinase PK25 responsible for APHVIII phosphorylation in vitro was identified. It is suggested that STPK play a major role in the regulation of antibiotic resistance in actinobacteria.
