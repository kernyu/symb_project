BACKGROUND: Despite it importance standardized treatment outcome-monitoring in tuberculosis patients is not officially done in Germany. METHODS: In this retrospective study we investigated tuberculosis outcome in 494 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis using the international recommended definitions. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 62 month (36-180 month). A successful treatment could be observed in 378 (76.1%) of all patients. Treatment success was mostly documented as cure (n = 375). No documented treatment success was seen in 119 patients (23.9%). The most important reason for unsuccessful treatment was lost for follow up (transfer out) in 60/119 patients (51.2%), followed by death (24/119; 19.8%), an interrupted treatment (22/199; 18.3%) and treatment failure (13/119; 10.7%). No documented treatment success was significantly more common in retreatment cases compared to new cases (p = 0.0003) and in patients with at least a single drug resistance (p = 0.04). Beside these parameters treatment outcome was significantly superior in patients receiving a standard antituberculosis therapy including at least isoniazid and rifampin compared to patients treated with other regimens during both the initial phase (p = 0.0039) and the continuous phase (p = 0.0021) of therapy. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study the use of the international definitions for outcome monitoring showed a substantial proportion of patients with unsuccessful therapy. For the evaluation of the success of the tuberculosis programme in Germany a prospective documentation of treatment outcome data in all patients using the international definitions seems essential.
