We conducted a study in order to confirm the eligibility of fosfomycin trometamol as an alternative treatment to quinolones for urinary tract infections. Among 102 quinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains, resistance rates to first line-prescribed antibiotics were above 77%. The resistance rate to fosfomycin was 2%.
