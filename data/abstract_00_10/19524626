To investigate the molecular mechanisms of bacterial resistance in susceptible and resistant cultivars of tomato, a proteomic approach was adopted. Four cultivars of tomato were selected on the basis of their response to bacterial (Pseudomonas solanacearum) inoculation wherein cultivar Roma and Riogarande, and cultivar Pusa Ruby and Pant Bahr were considered as resistant and susceptible cultivars, respectively. Proteins were extracted from leaves of 3-week-old seedlings of the four cultivars and separated by 2-DE. A total of nine proteins were found to be differentially expressed between the susceptible and resistant cultivars. Amino acid sequences of these proteins were determined with a protein sequencer. The identified proteins belongs to the categories of energy, protein destination and storage, and defense. Of these proteins, a 60kDa chaperonin and an apical membrane antigen were significantly upregulated in resistant cultivars compared with susceptible cultivars. Application of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid resulted in significant changes in levels of apical membrane antigen and protein disulfide-isomerase. Taken together, these results suggest that apical membrane antigen might be involved in bacterial resistance process through salicylic acid induced defense mechanism signaling in tomato plants.
