Antibiotic susceptibilities of Propionibacterium acnes in Japan were determined. Erythromycin-resistance was found in 10.4% (5/48) of the strains, and four of these were cross-resistance to clindamycin. Although the erythromycin ribosome methylase gene erm(X) was looked for, no strain carrying erm(X) was found. Sequencing analysis revealed that all of the erythromycin-resistant strains had a mutation in the peptidyl transferase region of the 23S rRNA gene: G2057A, A2058G, or A2059G. Consequently, our results show that P. acnes resistance to macrolides is caused by a mutation in the 23S rRNA gene, and has been increasing in Japan.
