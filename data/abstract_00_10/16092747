OBJECTIVE: To assess quantitatively the clinical impact of using an alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) in the hospital environment, measuring impact as the incidence of new, nosocomial isolates of drug-resistant organisms. DESIGN: An observational survey from 1998 to 2003 comparing the first 3 years of no ABHR use with the 3 years following, when an ABHR was provided for hand hygiene. SETTING: An inner-city, tertiary-care medical center. INTERVENTION: At baseline, an antimicrobial soap with 0.3% triclosan was provided for staff hand hygiene. The intervention was placement in all inpatient and all outpatient clinic rooms of wall-mounted dispensers of an ABHR with 62.5% ethyl alcohol. Data were collected on change in the incidence of three drug-resistant bacteria. RESULTS: During the 6 years of the survey, all new, nosocomially acquired isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea were recorded. On comparison of the first 3 years with the final 3 years, there was a 21% decrease in new, nosocomially acquired MRSA (90 to 71 isolates per year; P = .01) and a 41% decrease in VRE (41 to 24 isolates per year; P < .001). The incidence of new isolates of C. difficile was essentially unchanged. CONCLUSION: In the 3 years following implementation of an ABHR, this hospital experienced the value of reductions in the incidence of nosocomially acquired drug-resistant bacteria. These reductions provide clinical validation of the recent CDC recommendation that ABHRs be the primary choice for hand decontamination.
