AIMS: Despite availability of active antimicrobial agents for its treatment, the mortality from pneumococcal bacteraemia (PB) may reach 30% to 40% in high-risk groups. Greater vaccine use may reduce the incidence of PB. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with PB who had indications for, but had not received, pneumococcal vaccination. METHODS: From December 1998 to March 2000, all episodes of PB in adults in four Auckland hospitals were followed prospectively. Underlying disease, outcome, and pneumococcal vaccination history were recorded. RESULTS: 96 patients had PB: the median age was 63 years, range 16 to 93 years. 42 (44%) were > or = 65 years. The relative risk (RR) of acquiring PB for Maori and Pacific Island people was more than two times that of both European and other ethnic groups: RR 2.3 (95% CI 1.5 - 3.6) and 2.4 (1.6 - 3.8), respectively. The most common presentation was pneumonia; 84 (88%), of which 74 (88%) were community acquired. Five (5%) patients had meningitis. The overall mortality was 18%. Eleven (11%) pneumococcal isolates had intermediate susceptibility to penicillin and six (6%) were resistant. 69 (72%) patients had one or more condition for which pneumococcal vaccination is recommended but only two (2%) patients had received it. 82 (85%) patients were infected with serotypes included in the current pneumococcal vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Most adult patients with PB have underlying medical conditions for which vaccination is recommended but only rare patients get vaccinated. Emerging antimicrobial resistance is a further incentive to increase the use of pneumococcal vaccination. Greater use of pneumococcal vaccine will probably require a change in its funding status, similar to the current policy for influenza vaccine. It may also be appropriate to consider targeted use of the vaccine in Maori and Pacific Island people given their higher rates of disease.
