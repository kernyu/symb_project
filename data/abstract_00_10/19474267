All patients admitted to our tertiary care hospital from 1 December 2007 to 10 June 2008 were screened for methicillin (meticillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal colonization, and the isolates were tested for mupirocin susceptibility by using Etest. Mupirocin resistance (MR) was noted to occur in 3.4% of MRSA carriers, and high-level MR was noted to occur in 0.62% of carriers.
