The frequency of alterations in the GyrA subunit of DNA gyrase and the ParC subunit of topoisomerase IV in 19 clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae obtained in Tokyo in 2002 was studied. The frequencies of GyrA and ParC mutations in these 19 isolates were 100% (19 of 19) and 84.2% (16 of 19), respectively, and these results were 1.48-fold (100%/67.6%) and 3.58-fold (84.2%/23.5%) higher, respectively, than the frequencies reported in 1998 in 68 isolates obtained in Fukuoka during the period from 1992 to 1996. Isolates with increasing numbers of mutations were more resistant not only to levofloxacin but also to other antibiotics. The 50% and 90% minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to levofloxacin during the period from 1995 to 1996 were 0.063 and 1 micro g/ml, and they increased to 4 and 8 micro g/ml, respectively, in the present study. All 19 cases of gonoccocal urethritis in the present study were cured with a single intramuscular injection of 2 g spectinomycin.
