INTRODUCTION: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV patients is considered successful when plasma viral load (VL) reaches < 50 copies/ml. However, many patients have a persistent VL of 50 to 1000 copies/ml, and treatment guidelines do not recommend genotypic resistance testing at these levels because of poor performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a concentration technique for HIV-1 sequencing in samples with < 1000 copies/ml, and determine the virological consequences of HAART treatment changes guided by resistance testing in this scenario. METHODS: Observational study performed in 51 patients with plasma VL between 50 and 1000 copies/m; 27 patients had these levels for at least 12 consecutive months. Prior to RNA extraction, virions were concentrated from 3-ml plasma samples and then genotyped following standard procedures. RESULTS: Forty-seven of the 51 samples were successfully sequenced, resulting in a sensitivity of 92%. Among these 47 patients, 27 showed a persistent viral load of 50-1000 copies/ml for 12 months, and 20 patients achieved undetectable viral load following the genotype-guided HAART change (intention-to-treat analysis: NC = F; 20 of 27 [74.1%]; on-treatment analysis: 20 of 23 [86.9%]). CONCLUSIONS: We report a simple method for genotype sequencing in patients with persistent low-level viremia that allowed a modification of the HAART regimen leading to undetectable plasma viremia.
