20 patients were infected with a new group of verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) strains of serotype O117:K1:H7 during a 5-y period. The main symptoms were persistent watery diarrhoea with abdominal cramps; 2 persons of the 20 were healthy carriers. The duration of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients was median 11 weeks with 80% being ill for more than 30 d. In 19 cases the infection was acquired during travel (Asia, Africa and Cuba), and 1 case was laboratory acquired. All strains were positive for the vtx1 gene and negative for the vtx2, the eae, the saa and the ehxA genes. 13 strains (65%) were resistant to 4 or more antimicrobial agents. By PFGE using the restriction enzyme XbaI, the strains were clonally related, but not identical. O117:K1:H7 is a clonal group of VTEC that should be considered in patients returning from Africa and Asia with long-lasting watery diarrhoea.
