This work for the first time estimated apparent oxygen diffusivity (D(app)) of two types of aerobic granules, acetate-fed and phenol-fed, by probing the dissolved oxygen (DO) level at the granule center with a sudden change in the DO of the bulk liquid. With a high enough flow velocity across the granule to minimize the effects of external mass transfer resistance, the diffusivity coefficients of the two types of granules were estimated with reference to a one-dimensional diffusion model. The carbon source has a considerable effect on the granule diameter (d) and the oxygen diffusivity. The diffusivity coefficients were noted 1.24-2.28 x 10(-9) m2/s of 1.28-2.50 mm acetate-fed granules, and 2.50-7.65 x 10(-10) m2/s of 0.42-0.78 mm phenol-fed granules. Oxygen diffusivity declined with decreasing granule diameter, in particular, the diffusivity of acetate-fed granules is proportional to the size, whereas the diffusivity of phenol-fed granules is proportional to the square of granule diameter. The existence of large pores in granule, evidenced by FISH-CLSM imaging, was proposed to correspond to the noted size-dependent oxygen diffusivity. The phenol-fed granules exhibited a higher excellular polymer (ECP) content than the acetate-fed granules, hence yielding a lower oxygen diffusivity.
