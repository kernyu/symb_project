Agarose-supported BLMs were prepared by the tip-dip and painting methods, and single-channel recordings of gramicidin were examined for the development of an ion-channel sensor. The supported BLMs formed by the tip-dip method had an electric resistance of >1.0 x 10(11) omega and a longer lifetime as compared with unsupported ones, which enabled single-channel recordings of gramicidin. The supported BLMs formed by the painting method also enabled single-channel recordings, but the lifetime was shorter than that of unsupported planar BLMs formed by the monolayer folding method.
