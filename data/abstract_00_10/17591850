The rate of nonsusceptibility of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains to ceftriaxone increased significantly in Taiwan in 2005. Approximately 90% of the ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible isolates were found to be of four major serotypes (serotypes 6B, 14, 19F, and 23F). Seven amino acid alterations in the penicillin-binding protein 2B transpeptidase-encoding region specifically contributed to the resistance.
