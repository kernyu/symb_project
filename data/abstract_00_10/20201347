BACKGROUND: The most common infection following surgical treatment, when mechanical ventilation and tracheal intubation are used, is ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) induced by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Its treatment is difficult due to increasingly high antimicrobial drug resistance observed recently. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old patient was admitted to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting and cardiac aneurysm excision. Additionally, chronic circulatory insufficiency (NYHA 2) with ejection fraction of 30% together with hypertension and type 2 diabetes were diagnosed. After extracorporeal circulation, she was given adrenaline/noradrenaline and intra-aortic balloon pump. Postoperatively, elevated levels of CRP (70 mg L(-1)) and of procalcitonin (22.4 ng mL(-1)) were detected. Empiric therapy with cefepime 1 g x 2 iv was started. X-ray revealed atelectasis in the middle left lung lobe and Enterobacter cloacae was isolated from the bronchial tree. Patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Antibiotic therapy with cefepime was continued for 10 days and resulted in improvement of patient's general condition. On postoperative day 7, she was transferred from ITU to the cardiac surgery ward. CONCLUSION: Cefepime applied empirically to a VAP patient can effectively treat the lung infection and improve his/her general condition.
