Acinetobacter baumannii infections have become increasingly common among critically-ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. A. baumannii clinical isolates are frequently resistant to most antimicrobial agents and evidence of pan-drug resistance among A. baumannii isolates (i.e., resistance to all available antimicrobial agents, including polymyxins) has been reported. These facts constitute an alarming development in the field of infectious diseases, with major public health implications. More intensive efforts are urgently required to elucidate the epidemiological and infection control issues related to these organisms and to improve the management of patients with such infections.
