Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) causes a bacterial speck disease in tomato and Arabidopsis. In Chinese cabbage, in which host-pathogen interactions are not well understood, Pst does not cause disease but rather elicits a hypersensitive response. Pst induces localized cell death and H2O2 accumulation, a typical hypersensitive response, in infiltrated cabbage leaves. Pre-inoculation with Pst was found to induce resistance to Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, a pathogen that causes soft rot disease in Chinese cabbage. An examination of the expression profiles of 12 previously identified Pst-inducible genes revealed that the majority of these genes were activated by salicylic acid or BTH; however, expressions of the genes encoding PR4 and a class IV chitinase were induced by ethephon, an ethylene-releasing compound, but not by salicylic acid, BTH, or methyl jasmonate. This implies that Pst activates both salicylate-dependent and salicylate-independent defense responses in Chinese cabbage.
