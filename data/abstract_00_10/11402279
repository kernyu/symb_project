OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of Listerine Antiseptic, Tartar Control Listerine Antiseptic, and Peridex mouthrinses and a 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution against known pathogenic fungi. STUDY DESIGN: Standardized methods were used to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of the above agents versus representative fungal species. Minimum inhibitory concentration-minimum fungicidal concentrations in macrobroth dilutions, suspension kill-time, and effectiveness against an artificial biofilm-attached population were studied. RESULTS: All antimicrobials tested were effective against the fungal species under investigation at the concentration available commercially. Listerine Antiseptic showed a greater efficacy against attached artificial biofilm populations than the other antimicrobials tested. CONCLUSIONS: Listerine Antiseptic, Tartar Control Listerine Antiseptic, and Peridex mouthrinses show promise as a means to control the pathogenic fungal species under investigation and may have applications to reduce oral colonization.
