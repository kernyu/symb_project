The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of antimicrobial-resistance and serotypes of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal isolates from adolescents. Clinical data and nasopharyngeal specimens for culture were collected from 1,013 adolescents as a part of a population-based study. A total of 83 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified (8.2%). Seventy-four of the 83 isolates were serotyped. The median age of the 83 adolescents colonized by pneumococci was 14 years (mean 14 +/- 2.2 yrs); 55.4% were males. Intermediate resistance to penicillin was detected in 7.2% (6/83). No strain showed high resistance to penicillin. All isolates were susceptible to clindamycin, chloramphenicol, rifampin, and vancomycin; 37.3%, 18.1%, and 4.8% were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and erythromycin, respectively. The most frequent serotypes (5-10% of strains each) were 6B, 6A, 23F, and 18C among 28 serotypes/serogroups identified; 18.9% of the strains were nontypeable (NT). Intermediate resistance to penicillin was detected in serotypes 6B, 14, and NT. The rate of resistance to penicillin of nasopharyngeal isolates is low considering data from other studies about invasive strains recovered from children in Brazil. Serotype patterns are similar, except for type 14, which was unusually infrequent.
