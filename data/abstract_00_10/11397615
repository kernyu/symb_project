We measured the susceptibility of Canadian isolates of three respiratory tract pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae) to several currently approved antimicrobial agents by two different methods. We also measured the susceptibility of isolates to seven fluoroquinolones. Beta-lactamase was produced by 123/566 (21.7%) of H. influenzae isolates compared with 178/200 (89%) of M. catarrhalis isolates. For S. pneumoniae 83/374 (22.2%) isolates were penicillin resistant and of these 2.1% (8/374) showed high level resistance (MIC > or = 2 mg/l). Regardless of methodology, all fluoroquinolones were highly active against H. influenzae (MIC(90) < or = 0.031 mg/l) and M. catarrhalis (MIC(90) < or = 0.064 mg/l) isolates. Susceptibility of H. influenzae to cefuroxime and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid was 99-100% whereas 84-85.5% were susceptible to cefaclor and cefprozil. Azithromycin susceptibility ranged from 82.6 to 99.2% depending on the method. M. catarrhalis isolates were uniformly susceptible to all agents tested except amoxycillin. Cross-resistance in S. pneumoniae to all non-quinolone agents was concurrent with increasing penicillin resistance as shown by increasing MIC90 values. For the fluoroquinolones tested, the rank order of potency based on MIC(90) values was as follows: gemifloxacin (0.031-0.063 mg/l), trovafloxacin (0.125 mg/l), moxifloxacin (0.125-0.25 mg/l), grepafloxacin (0.125-0.25 mg/l), gatifloxacin (0.5 mg/l), levofloxacin (1 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (2 mg/l). Our study confirms either a high or increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant respiratory pathogens in Canada and also compares the new and old fluoroquinolones and their potential role as therapy for community-acquired infections. The prevalence of beta-lactamase positive H. influenzae may have decreased from levels reported in previous studies.
