Causes of HAIs vary, but include the transient immunodeficiency associated with surgery,immobility, and the presence of indwelling devices. With rates of antimicrobial resistance increasing, prevention remains the best solution. The investigators review the most frequently encountered health-care-associated infections with an emphasis on preventative strategies.
