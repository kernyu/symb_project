Voriconazole susceptibility testing was performed on 7191 Candida spp. from 78 centers worldwide between 2004 and 2007. Voriconazole was very active in vitro (MIC(50)/MIC(90), 0.008/0.25 microg/mL; 98% susceptible). In comparison to 5866 Candida spp. isolates collected during global surveillance from 1997 to 2001, there were no changes in voriconazole mean MIC or MIC distribution.
