In this study 45 epidemic and sporadic isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii were investigated by antimicrobial resistance, integron identifications and genotyping. Isolates were genotyped by random amplified polymorphism (RAPD) DNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Four different RAPD patterns were observed among the isolates of our collection, further discerned in six PFGE types. Two prevalent genotypes were identified, one corresponding to a carbapenem resistant epidemic clone, causing an outbreak at the intensive care unit of a hospital of Rome. Two class 1 integrons, carrying different gene cassette arrays, were identified among the two prevalent genotypes. Nucleotide analysis of the integron-variable regions revealed the presence of the aacA4, orfO, bla(OXA-20), and aacC1, orfX, orfX', aadA1 gene cassette arrays, respectively. All the carbapenem resistant strains analyzed in this study carried the bla (OXA-58) gene located on plasmids.
