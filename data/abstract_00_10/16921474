Testing for resistance to antiretrovirals is considered to be standard of care and is widely used in the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. Despite the widespread use of resistance testing, the clinician still faces a number of challenges when applying these technologies in the optimal management of antiretroviral therapy. Both genotype and phenotype tests require interpretation, and available interpretative algorithms for genotypes and resistance cutoffs for phenotypes are incomplete and evolving. Even experts in HIV resistance do not completely agree in their interpretation of genotypes. Moreover, discordant results between genotypes and phenotypes are a common source of confusion when both tests are used to evaluate resistance in a patient. Finally, newer indicators, such as replication capacity, are clinically available and appear to have prognostic value, but how this in vitro measure should be used in the management of antiretroviral therapy remains to be fully defined.
