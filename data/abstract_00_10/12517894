A single Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate with an UT2 phage type producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was identified in Canada in 2000. The isolate harbored two plasmids, one containing a bla(TEM-1) gene and the other containing a bla(SHV-2a) gene. The ESBL gene was located on a 70-kb transferable plasmid which also carried tetracycline and trimethoprim resistance elements.
