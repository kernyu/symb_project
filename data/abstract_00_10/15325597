OBJECTIVES: To analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility of Acinetobacter spp. isolates collected from Latin American medical centers as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and also to evaluate the dissemination of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter spp. strains in the region. METHODS: A total of 826 isolates of Acinetobacter spp. from multiple infection sites were collected from January 1997 to December 2001 in ten medical centers and susceptibility tested to >25 selected agents by broth microdilution. Multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter spp. isolates were molecular typed. RESULTS: Resistance rates to carbapenems varied significantly among countries. A continued annual increase occurred in the Argentinean medical centers. In contrast, carbapenem resistance was rare in Chilean centers, and decreased significantly in the Brazilian institutions. Acinetobacter spp. isolates recovered from lower respiratory tract and bloodstream infections were associated with lower antimicrobial susceptibility rates. Resistance rates to imipenem were higher among isolates collected from intensive care units (13.5%) than among isolates from other units. A major ribogroup pattern (521-1) was detected among eight Acinetobacter spp. strains isolated from three distinct Latin American countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that antimicrobial resistance is still a major issue among Acinetobacter spp. isolates collected from some Latin American countries. The dissemination of a major bacterial cluster in different regions reinforces the importance of longitudinal surveillance programs, such as SENTRY, as valuable tools for monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility rates and guiding local interventions.
