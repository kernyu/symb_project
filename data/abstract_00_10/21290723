Given the association between H. pylori and peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and B-cell MALT lymphoma, there is an urgent need for the development of intervention strategies to prevent the spread of this bacterium. Although development of a vaccine against H. pylori is progressing well, it is highly likely that it will be 5 to 10 years before such a vaccine becomes available. Given the increasing levels of resistance to current antimicrobial therapies used against H. pylori and the high cost of such an approach, mass programs to treat H. pylori-infected individuals is clearly out of the question. In many other diseases with an infectious etiology, public health measures based on epidemiological data have been extremely successful in preventing the spread of pathogenic agents. Before such measures can be implemented, clarification of the route of transmission of H. pylori will be essential.
