In view of the changing policy towards artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), the efficacy, tolerance, and degree of re-infection of two ACTs were investigated: artesunate plus sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (As + SP) and AS plus sulfamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (As + SMP). One hundred three children were assigned to receive As + SP and 109 to receive As + SMP. In spite of the high incidence of resistance to SP, As + SP showed satisfactory results consistent with recent recommendations for ACTs (adequate clinical and parasitologic response on day 28 [ACPR] > or = 90%), but results with As + SMP fulfilled the most stringent criteria (ACPR > or = 95%). The absence of side effects and the low price of these drugs make them it worth to reconsider national therapies in favor of either of these two drug combinations.
