From May 2004 to October 2006, a prospective study was carried out in Dakar, Senegal, to update information about the antimicrobial susceptibility of Shigella spp. isolated from stool specimens. Among the 165 non-duplicate strains collected, 81 (49%) were identified as Shigella flexneri, 75 (45%) as Shigella sonnei, 5 (3%) as Shigella boydii, and 4 (2%) as Shigella dysenteriae. Disk diffusion testing revealed that the majority of isolates were resistant to sulphonamides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, and tetracycline (respective overall resistance rates: 90, 90, 96, and 94%). More than half of the S. flexneri isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and chloramphenicol (respective resistance rates: 59, 58, and 52%), and almost all of the S. sonnei isolates were susceptible to these antimicrobials (respective resistance rates: 4, 1, and 4%). Only one isolate (belonging to the species S. sonnei) was resistant to nalidixic acid and displayed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.
