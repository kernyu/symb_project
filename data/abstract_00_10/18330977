Although earlier pleuromutilin analogues showed potent in vitro antibacterial activity against some Gram-positive pathogens, their in vivo efficacy was low because of insufficient pharmacokinetic properties. We designed novel thioether pleuromutilin derivatives having a purine ring as a polar and water solubilizing group and identified a promising pleuromutilin analogue 6 with good solubility in water ( approximately 50 mg/mL). Compound 6 exhibited excellent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against some Gram-positive strains, including drug-resistant pathogens.
