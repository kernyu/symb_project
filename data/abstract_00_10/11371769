Tuberculosis affects more than 8 million people and has serious repercussions on economic, psychologic, and social status. Since its declaration as a global emergency in 1993 by the World Health Organization, significant development in the treatment and control of tuberculosis has been the implementation of the short-course directly observed treatment along with fixed dose combinations of existing drugs. However, the currently available therapeutic regimens have inherent disadvantages of long treatment duration, patient noncompliance, and risk of drug resistance. Hence, new antituberculosis drugs that are potent, are active against resistant strains and latent forms, and reduce the treatment period are needed to combat this disease. In this review, the authors discuss new chemical entities that in their opinion have a potential to become new antituberculosis drugs. This article emphasizes the role of biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics as an indispensable part in the development of new antituberculosis drugs to overcome the common hurdles such as exorbitant cost, time, and attrition rate involved in the process.
