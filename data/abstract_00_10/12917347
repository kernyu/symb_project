Guanylic nucleotides are essential cellular players, and the critical enzyme in their tightly regulated synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is encoded by the IMD2 gene. The transcription of IMD2 is subject to general repression by nutrient limitation through the cis nutrient-sensing element. It is also subject to specific feedback regulation by the end products of the guanylic nucleotide synthesis pathway. The critical cis element for this latter mechanism is the guanine response element (GRE), a TATAATA sequence which is located 202 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and which functions as the IMD2 TATA box. We show that the GRE functions in conjunction with a 52-nucleotide stretch near the transcription start site. This very unusual promoter structure ensures low, basal expression of IMD2 and the recruitment of TFIID to the GRE in response to guanylic nucleotide limitation.
