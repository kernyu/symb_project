We have isolated the aph(3")-Ic gene, encoding an aminoglycoside 3"-O-phosphotransferase [APH(3")-Ic], from a genomic library of an environmental Mycobacterium fortuitum strain, selecting for streptomycin resistance. APH(3")-Ic phosphorylates and inactivates streptomycin. Similar genes have been described in Streptomyces griseus and plasmid RSF1010. It is also present in some M. fortuitum clinical isolates.
