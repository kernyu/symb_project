Extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms have captured the attention of clinicians and laboratorians and are agents of nosocomial and community onset infections (J. D. Pitout and K. B. Laupland, Lancet Infect. Dis. 8:159-166, 2008). ESBLs in many enterobacteriaceae and in nonfermenting Gram-negative organisms have been described (K. Bush and G. A. Jacoby, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 54:969-976, 2010). We present the first case of a clinical isolate of multidrug-resistant Escherichia fergusonii expressing an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL).
