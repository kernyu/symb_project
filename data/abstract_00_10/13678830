Structural variants of phenylpiperidine selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (P-SSRIs) inhibited the function of two unique Staphylococcus aureus multidrug efflux pumps. The most active compound was the paroxetine isomer NNC 20-7052, which had an IC(50) for ethidium, acriflavine, and pyronin Y efflux of 9, 53, and 18% of its MIC, respectively, against the NorA pump. The unbalanced effect of NNC 20-7052 on the efflux of different substrates suggests the possibility that P-SSRIs function by a physical interaction with NorA. Under the conditions employed pump inhibition partially extended to the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) pump AcrAB-TolC, but not to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa RND pumps MexAB-OprM or MexCD-OprJ.
