As in other Gram-negative bacteria, mechanisms of resistance to quinolones in Salmonella include target gene mutations, active efflux, and decreased outer membrane permeability. However, the exact contribution of these individual mechanisms to resistance, which may nevertheless interplay to reach high-level resistance, has not yet clearly been defined as in other bacteria such as Escherichia coli. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of quinolone resistance mechanisms in Salmonella by comparison with that of E. coli and future directions of research with particular attention to the recent development of efflux pump inhibitors as possible means of avoiding the emergence and spread of fluoroquinolone resistance.
