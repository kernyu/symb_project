The regulation of S6K1 by nutritional status and insulin has been recently reported in vivo in chicken muscle despite the relative insulin resistance of this tissue as estimated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activity. The present work aimed to study the impact of amino acids on S6K1 activity in quail muscle (QM7) myoblasts. Firstly, we characterized S6K1 in QM7 cells and demonstrated the absence of insulin receptors in these cells. Secondly, we showed that amino acids in the absence of insulin induced S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr389 and concomitantly increased its enzymatic activity. Amino acid-induced S6K1 activation was inhibited by LY294002 (PI3-kinase inhibitor) and rapamycin (inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR), suggesting the involvement of an avian homolog of mTOR. The availability of individual amino acids (methionine or leucine) regulated S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr389 and QM7 protein synthesis. In conclusion, amino acids regulate S6K1 phosphorylation and activity in QM7 cells through the mTOR/PI3-kinase pathway in an insulin-independent manner.
