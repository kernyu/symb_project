In recent years, general and urinary tract infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have became an increasing problem worldwide. Catheterization of the urinary bladder is one of the most significant risk factors for MRSA contamination of the urine. In vitro tests have documented the antimicrobial activity of the catheter lubricants Instillagel and Endosgel against MRSA specimens within 5 min. These findings support recommending the use of these lubricants in high-risk patients in hospitals and old people's homes for prophylaxis of MRSA bacteriuria.
