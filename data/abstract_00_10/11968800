PURPOSE: We reviewed the clinical data of male urethritis diagnosed as sexually transmitted disease with the aim of revealing its clinical features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a total number of 414 males diagnosed as having acute urethritis transmitted by sexual activities between January and December in 2000, clinical data were collected and analyzed. In addition, questionnaire concerning the awareness of pharyngeal infection was obtained. RESULTS: Their ages ranged from 16 to 60 years with a mean of 31 years. The source of infection was a commercial sexual worker (CSW) in 288 (69.6%) out of 414 cases. In 241 cases in whom an infection route was determined, 199 cases (82.6%) were considered to have an infection through oral sex. Microbiological examinations isolated Neisseria gonorrhea alone in 206 (49.8%), Chlamydia tracomatis alone in 47 (11.3%) and both in 46 (11.1%) cases. In our study, 57.5% and 20.8% of Neisseria gonorrhea strains were resistant to penicillin and new quinolones, respectively. Based on questionnaire, 174 (57.8%) out of 301 cases were not aware of possible infection from the pharynx through oral sex. CONCLUSION: The remarkable prevalence of gonococcal urethritis might be in part due to the lacking of awareness of infection through oral sex and sexual activities without a condom. Instruction on the prevention as well as the actual situation of urethritis is needed for general population with a broad age spectrum. The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents with sufficient susceptibility and less inductivity of drug-resistance is also of clinical importance.
