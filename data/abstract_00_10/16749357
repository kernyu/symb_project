This study aims to find out factors associated with anti-malarial drug resistance in some selected areas in Ibadan. One thousand one hundred and two subjects were interviewed using a semi structured questionnaire. Respondents were put into two groups (high and low resistant areas). The Results revealed a high level of drug use for treating malaria particularly choloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ("Fansidar"). The Results also showed that the two groups were not significantly different with respect to clearance of infection, but there was a significant difference between clearance of infection and whether or not the respondent completed the course of treatment in each group (P<0.05). When both groups were combined, the Mantel-Haenszel test showed that the response difference between the two groups was significant. (OR = 3.44 (CI = 1.8 to 6.51)) i.e those that completed the treatment were 3 times more likely to have their infection cleared than those that did not complete the treatment. A significant finding was that non-compliance with treatment was a major factor associated with treatment failure The prevalence of drug resistance was a little higher in the high resistant group compared to the low resistant group; but this difference was not statistically significant. These results underscore the need for adequate health education about the treatment of malaria and the importance of compliance in this community.
