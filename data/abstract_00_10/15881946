A salmonellosis outbreak, caused by S. typhimurium, was investigated with the use of some microbiological and molecular-biological methods of typing. This investigation revealed that the outbreak was caused by the "outbreak" electrotype of the multi-resistant variant of the infective agent, found to have several plasmidovars. The possibilities and limitations of typing by sensitivity to antibiotics and plasmid DNA profile were shown. These methods of intraspecific typing were regarded as methods making it possible to establish the heterogeneity of S. typhimurium with the use of intraclonal markers.
