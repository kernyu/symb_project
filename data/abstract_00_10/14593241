Two protocols are used by French neonatologists for the treatment of suspected maternofetal infection (SMFI). Three groups of premature and term neonates were included to study the impact of antibiotics on fecal flora: 10 infants with SMFI treated with amoxicillin and netilmicin (group BI), 10 infants with SMFI treated with amoxicillin, cefotoxime and netilmicin (group TRI) and 10 infants without antibiotic therapy as controls (group C). Group BI samples were colonized with Klebsiella oxytoca and Escherichia coli resistant to amoxicillin and by Eneterococcus faecium and coagulase-negative staphylococci. In group TRI biodiversity of the intestinal flora was low, with rapid growth of staphyloccoci and occurrence of Candida spp. These modifications of the intestinal flora should encourage us to use antibiotic treatment as targeted as possible.
