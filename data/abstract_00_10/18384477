OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in patients with gastro-duodenal pathologies and the susceptibility patterns of isolates to the currently recommended antibiotic treatment regimen used in Cameroon. METHODS: Consecutive dyspeptic patients referred to Douala General Hospital, Cameroon for endoscopy were recruited in the study. Gastric biopsies were collected from the patients and H. pylori isolated and identified following standard microbiology and biochemical techniques. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion and agar dilution methods against clarithromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin and metronidazole. Data were analysed using chi-square test and significance considered at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Seventy-one (92.2%) of the 77 patients (mean age 44.5 +/- 15.7, range 15-77 years) were positive for H. pylori. The antibiotic susceptibility rates were 56% for tetracycline, 55.3% for clarithromycin, 14.4% for amoxicillin and 6.8% for metronidazole. The prevalence of clarithromycin resistance in males vs. females was 42.1%vs. 46.7%, while for metronidazole it was 89.5%vs. 94.7% (P > 0.05). Antimicrobial susceptibility results also revealed 12 antibiotypes based on resistance to the antimicrobial agents investigated. The resistance pattern, amoxicillin and metronidazole (AMR(R) MET(R)) was the most common (23.7%) amongst the isolates. More than 60% of the isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance to three or four antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Multi-drug resistance is common against the current treatment regimen in Cameroon and, therefore, calls for urgent studies involving newer and broad spectrum antibiotics to address the problem.
