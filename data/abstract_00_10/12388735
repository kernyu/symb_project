The recovery of recombinant influenza A virus entirely from cDNA was recently described (9, 19). We adapted the technique for engineering influenza B virus and generated a mutant bearing an amino acid change E116G in the viral neuraminidase which was resistant in vitro to the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir. The method also facilitates rapid isolation of single-gene reassortants suitable as vaccine seeds and will aid further investigations of unique features of influenza B virus.
