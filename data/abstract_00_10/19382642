The results of surgical treatment were analyzed in 481 patients who had been preoperatively found to have drug resistance. Patients with fibrocavernous, cirrhotic tuberculosis, chronic pleural empyema, and cavernous pneumonia constituted the vast majority (83.2%). Chemotherapy was performed by individual schemes, by taking into account MBT susceptibility. Glutoxim and pentaglobin were used as pathogenetic therapy for immunity correction. Resection-type operations [n = 368 (68.9%)], thorocoplastic interventions [n = 78 (14.6%)], thoracostomy or cavernostomy [n = 35 (6.5%)], pleurectomy [n = 26 (4.9%)], operation on the stump of the main bronchus [n = 15 (2.8%)], and mediastinal lymphadenectomy [n = 12 (2.2%)] were predominant. Postoperative complications occurred in 15.5% of cases; mortality was 1.7%. The mycobacterium resistance to drugs verified by laboratory studies exerted no evident impact on the number and pattern of postoperative complications. The results of treatment depended on the extent and presence of complications of a tuberculous process, comorbidity, suppressed immunity, and the scope of a surgical intervention.
