OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spread and antimicrobial susceptibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at hospital. METHODS: Totally 110 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) were isolated from the clinical samples of patients in 4 hospitals and 30 strains of SA were isolated from the hospital environment and personnel in Xiangya Hospital. MRSA was detected using oxacillin disk diffusion test, cefoxitin disk diffusion test and MecA, FemA gene PCR assay. Beta-lactamase was detected using nitrocephin sticks. The antimicrobial susceptibility of MRSA was tested by K-B disk diffusion test. RESULTS: Among the 140 strains, 89 were MRSA, accounting for 63.57% of the total SA. The isolation rates of MRSA in clinical strains and environment strains were 64.55% and 60.00% (P > 0.05). All MRSA strains were sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid, 87 MRSA strains (97.75%) were sensitive to teicoplanin, most of which, however, were resistant to other antibiotics. Among the 89 strains, 85 MRSA strains (95.51% ) expressed beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA is highly prevalent in hospitals. Most MRSA strains are multi-drug resistant, but are still sensitive to vancomycin, linezolid, and teicoplanin.
