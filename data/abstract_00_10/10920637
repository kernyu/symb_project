Efficient monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (AR) can produce timely and important data and information that will benefit patients and could assist in the detection of a bioterrorist event. The microbiology laboratory staff of the largest U.S. Air Force medical facility attempted to improve AR monitoring at their hospital by reviewing their current capabilities and the capabilities of other available monitoring systems. The systems reviewed included the DataTrac System (Vitek bioMerieux, Hazelwood, Missouri) and the military Composite Health Care System, which were already in use, and the WHONET 5 (World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland) and The Surveillance Network (MRL Pharmaceutical Services, Herndon, Virginia). The Surveillance Network was selected for incorporation into the hospital AR monitoring program with modifications to comply with military command requirements. Information gathered during the review and selection process are presented and may be helpful to others who are looking to improve their hospital AR monitoring programs.
