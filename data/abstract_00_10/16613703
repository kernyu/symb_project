OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the pathogen distribution and resistance patterns in childhood urinary tract infection in order to provide references for optimal use of antibiotics in the treatment of this disorder. METHODS: The clinical data of 152 children with community acquired urinary tract infection (urinary culture positive) between December 2001 and December 2004 were studied retrospectively. The bacterial pathogens of urinary tract infection and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacilli was predominant pathogenic bacteria, accounting for 79.0% of the cases, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) was most commonly found (56.2%). Gram-positive cocci accounted for 18.4%, including 15.1% of Enterococcus faecalis. Fungi was rarely seen, accounting for only 2.6%. E. coli had a resistance rate of more than 50% to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulate, co-trimoxazole, cefradine, and fosomycin, but a very low resistance rate (< 4%) to 3rd generation cefalosporin, nitrofurantoi, azactom and amikacin. Enterococcus faecalis had a low resistance rate (< 20%) to ampicillin, vancomycin, penicillin, and nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli is the major pathogen in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection, and Enterococcus has been become another important pathogen. Selection of antibiotics for the treatment of this disorder should base on drug-sensitive test results.
