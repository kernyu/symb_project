During 2003, a total of 1,397 Candida isolates, 73 Aspergillus isolates, 53 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates, and 25 other fungal isolates from infected, normally sterile, body sites in patients hospitalized in North America, Europe, and Latin America were studied as a component of the longitudinal SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. The MICs for seven antifungal agents were determined in a central laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, IA) using testing methods promulgated by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards). The rank order of Candida spp. occurrence was as follows: C. albicans (48.7%), C. parapsilosis (17.3%), C. glabrata (17.2%), C. tropicalis (10.9%), C. krusei (1.9%), and other Candida spp. (4.0%). C. albicans accounted for 51.5, 47.8, and 36.5% of candidal infections in North America, Europe, and Latin America, respectively. Ravuconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole were highly active against C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis, with both former agents being more potent (MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited [MIC90] of < or =0.008 to 0.12 microg/ml) than fluconazole (MIC90 of 0.5 to 2 microg/ml). C. glabrata isolates were less susceptible to these agents, with MIC90s of 1, 1, and 64 microg/ml, respectively. Ravuconazole and voriconazole were the most active agents tested against C. krusei (MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml). Among Aspergillus spp., A. fumigatus was the most commonly (71.2% of isolates) recovered species; 96.2, 96.2, 84.6, and 11.5% of strains were inhibited by < or =1 microg/ml of ravuconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B, respectively. Of the antifungal agents tested, ravuconazole and voriconazole displayed the greatest spectrum of activity against pathogenic Candida and Aspergillus spp., regardless of geographic origin. These results extend upon previous findings from SENTRY Program reports (1997 to 2000), further characterizing species composition as seen in local clinical practice and demonstrating the potent activity of selected, newer triazole antifungal agents.
