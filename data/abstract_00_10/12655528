BACKGROUND: Therapy for patients with Richter syndrome (RS) or fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unsatisfactory. A Phase II study was conducted to evaluate an alternating combination cytotoxic regimen given with rituximab and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in these patients. METHODS: Fludarabine-refractory CLL was defined as failure to respond to most recent prior fludarabine-containing regimen. Patients received up to six cycles of fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, liposomal daunorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVXD) plus rituximab and GM-CSF alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine plus rituximab and GM-CSF. Response, toxicity, and survival data were compared with data from prior therapy with hyper-CVXD alone in this patient group. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with RS (n = 30 patients) or refractory CLL (n = 19 patients) were treated on study. Nine patients (18%) achieved a complete remission, and 11 patients achieved a partial remission (22%), for an overall objective response (OR) rate of 41%. With a median follow-up of 7.5 months and a maximum follow-up of 15.2 months, the 12-month failure free survival (FFS) rate was 27%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 39%. Nine patients (18%) died during the first cycle of therapy, and two patients (4%) died during the second cycle. There were no significant differences between the rates of OR, OS, and FFS in the current study and those obtained with hyper-CVXD alone on a prior study. CONCLUSIONS: The study regimen had activity and significant toxicity in patients with RS or fludarabine-refractory CLL. It was not clearly better compared with hyper-CVXD alone in this patient population.
