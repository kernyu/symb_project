A study on the antibiotic resistance of enterococcal isolates (n = 280) was carried out in a teaching hospital in Naples. Strains were isolated from different sources, identified by conventional tests and their antibiotic susceptibility was tested by E-test method. Thirty-two enterococcal isolates (11.5%), phenotypically identified as E. faecium (n = 26), E. gallinarum (n = 3), E. faecalis (n = 2) and E. hirae (n = 1), showed resistance to glycopeptides. The vanA gene was found in all 32 VRE. Molecular typing was performed by RAPD analysis which showed two majors patterns.
