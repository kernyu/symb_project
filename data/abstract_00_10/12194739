Resistance testing for treatment-naive, recently HIV-infected persons is not currently recommended; its clinical value will depend on the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations among recently infected persons. To estimate this prevalence, specimens were collected during 1997-1999 in Seattle and Los Angeles from drug-naive, recently HIV-infected persons. HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) RNA sequences were amplified from plasma by RT-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), sequenced, and analysed. Of 69 patients, five (7%) had resistance-associated mutations: three (4%) had primary mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) or non-nucleoside-RTIs, and three patients (4%) had secondary NRTI mutations. No primary mutation associated with resistance to protease inhibitors was observed. Mean age of the five persons with resistance-associated mutations (38 years) was higher than that of the 64 persons without resistance-associated mutations (31 years, P=0.04). The findings suggest that the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations among persons recently infected with HIV in these cities is low.
