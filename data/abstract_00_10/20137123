This study was purposed to investigate the reversal effect of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor D, L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) hydrochloride, on multidrug resistance in K562/A02 cells and its mechanism. The IC(50) (the half maximal inhibitory concentration) of PDMP was measured by MTT method. Cell apoptosis and intracellular daunorubicin (DNR) concentration were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of GCS and mdr1 genes were assayed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The results showed that the IC(50) of DNR in K562 and K562/A02 cells were 0.23 +/- 0.02 and 7.15 +/- 0.24 microg/ml respectively. When the concentration of PDMP was equal to or less than 20 micromol/L ( < / = 20 micromol/L), the obviously inhibitory effect on proliferation of K562 and K562/A02 cells was not observed, but both 20 micromol/L and 10 micromol/L PDMP could enhance the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to DNR (p < 0.01) and the reversal multiples were 2.59 and 1.69 respectively. After treating with 20 micromol/L and 10 micromol/L PDMP for 48 hours, the concentration of DNR in K562/A02 cells increased (p < 0.05) and the apoptotic rate also was elevated (p < 0.01). The expressions of GCS and mdr1 genes were down-regulated at mRNA and protein levels after treating K562/A02 cells with 20 micromol/L PDMP for 48 hours. It is concluded that PDMP can enhance the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to DNR by increasing cell apoptosis rate and accumulation concentration of DNR in cells, which may be related to down-regulated expressions of GCS and mdr1 genes.
