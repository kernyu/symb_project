We describe mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a new immunosuppressive agent, to be a therapy of two children with lupus nephritis which were refractory to both cyclophosphamide (CyP) and cyclosporine (CsA). After 11- to 12-month course of MMF treatment, all clinical symptoms of lupus disappeared and serum antibodies became negative. MMF might be a promising curative for cyclophosphamide-resistant lupus nephritis in children. Cyclophosphamide intravenous bolus therapy is generally considered to be the treatment for patients with lupus nephritis. However, there is little guidance about what to do if such therapy fails. Recently, a new immunosuppressive agent, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), has been used to treat cyclophosphamide-resistant lupus nephritis [Dooley et al. 1999, Gaubitz et al. 1999, Glicklich and Acharga 1998] in adults and has been recognized as a promising curative for lupus nephritis. Up to now, MMF has been adopted widely with solid organ transplantation to prevent or reverse acute rejection [Mathew 1998, Morris-Stiff and Jurewicz 1998] and has been used successfully to treat for rheumatoid arthritis refractory to a variety of other drugs. But there is no report about MMF treatment in children with cyclophosphamide-resistant lupus nephritis. We describe our experience with MMF treatment in two Chinese children with lupus nephritis that were refractory not only to cyclophosphamide but also to cyclosporine.
