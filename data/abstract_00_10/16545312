BACKGROUND: Since 1992 AIDS-related multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) has been detected among patients admitted to the Hospital Muniz in Buenos Aires (Argentina). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures adopted against the nosocomial spread of MDRTB/AIDS, which affected 803 patients between 1992 and 2002. METHODS: An action plan was applied that included bacilloscopy screening on admission, isolation rooms for patients with TB/AIDS, an isolation ward for patients with MDRTB/AIDS, a radiometric method for the diagnosis of multidrug-resistance, a reserve supply of second line drugs, and respiratory protection for health care workers. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2002, a statistically significant decreasing trend in cases of MDRTB/AIDS and admissions for TB/AIDS was observed (33.9% vs 80.5%). Mortality among patients with MDRTB/AIDS also significantly decreased. Bacilloscopy screening allowed the diagnosis of 63.4% of patients admitted with TB/AIDS. Respiratory isolation facilities and effective treatment of patients with MDRTB diagnosed through the radiometric method were progressively implemented. Admission of patients with AIDS showed no significant variations throughout the study period. The CD41 count of patients requiring admission did not vary significantly. CONCLUSION: The nosocomial epidemic curve of MDRTB in patients with AIDS significantly decreased, despite the persistence of susceptible patients with low CD41 levels. The decreasing tendency of MDRTB/AIDS cases could be attributed to the impact of the control measures implemented.
