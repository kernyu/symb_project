The complexity of invasive Aspergillosis management, which needs many interventions, is the cause of important controversies. Resistance to azoles is increasingly common due to the selective pressure from antifungals. The response rates to caspofungin of 40% to 56% have been observed in invasive aspergillosis treatment, indicating that it is comparable to other first-line options. Combination therapy is often used in clinical practice for invasive aspergillosis treatment. But for the choice of therapy, an individual approach to patient management that considers immunosuppression, comorbidities, and site of infection, is necessary. Currently, early diagnosis, judicious use of azoles, caspofungin, and lipid amphotericin B alone or in combination, and immune restoration are keys for treatment success.
