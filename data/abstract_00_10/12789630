PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of topical and combined topical and subconjunctival interferon alfa 2b (IFN alfa 2b) in the treatment of recurrent conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in those patients who present resistance or intolerance to topical mitomycin C (MMC) treatment or when it is not indicated. METHODS: Four patients (age range from 52 to 70) with histological confirmation of recurrent CIN were studied prospectively. Two patients were resistant to topical MMC, another one did not tolerate it, and in the last case, this treatment was not indicated due to a stem cell insufficiency associated to a trophic corneal ulcer. Three patients were given just topical interferon (1 million IU/ ml four times a day for three months), while the last one received topical therapy and subconjunctival IFN alfa 2b injections (3 millions IU/ 0.5 ml). RESULTS: Complete regression of the tumour was evident in all cases. sixteen to 24 months after treatment no patient had clinical evidence of recurrence. No side effects were observed in any patient, not even with subconjunctival administration. CONCLUSIONS: IFN alfa 2b is effective as an alternative treatment to topical MMC in selected cases of recurrent CIN.
