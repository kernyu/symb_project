Management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains surprisingly controversial. Optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy reflects one of the open questions due to the lack of sufficient randomized clinical trial data. Recently, there have been efforts to rationalize antimicrobial therapy of this disease. Trials addressing the issue of short-course antimicrobial therapy for CAP have revealed no adverse outcomes with a treatment duration of 5 days when compared with conventional courses of 7-10 days. There is accumulating evidence that a shorter duration of antimicrobial therapy may have benefits in patients with CAP, as it might enhance compliance, decrease the development of antimicrobial resistance, decrease the incidence and shorten the duration of adverse drug effects, reduce treatment costs and improve patient satisfaction with therapy. Nevertheless, remaining questions regarding the influence of patient selection, disease severity or choice of antimicrobial for short-course therapy indicate the need for further randomized controlled clinical trials in this area of research. This article summarizes current evidence for short-course therapy in patients with CAP and draws conclusions for clinical practice.
