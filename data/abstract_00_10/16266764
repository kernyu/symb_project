Risk assessment seeks to estimate the probability and impact of human health effects due to antimicrobial resistance arising from antimicrobial use in animals. Potential ecological pathways for the flow of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and resistance determinants through the food supply and environment are diverse and complicated and this has been a logistical barrier to direct epidemiological measure of risk. Consequently, a number of indirect approaches to assessment have been developed. This paper provides some examples of risk assessments that have been conducted with and without antimicrobial use data, and identifies possible benefits and applications of quantitative antimicrobial use data for risk assessment.
