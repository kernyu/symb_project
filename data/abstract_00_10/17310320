A plasmid, pBGFP, carrying green fluorescent protein (gfp) and benomyl-resistance genes was constructed and transformed into Metarhizium anisopliae. The transformants grew normally and GFP fluorescence was detected. No change was found in virulence for the transformants. Fluorescence was detected in hyphae from the haemolymph of the infected locust, and the benomyl-resistance was maintained. Results suggested that the two markers provided a useful tool for screening and monitoring the engineered strains even after infection.
