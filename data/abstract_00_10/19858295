Major surface protease (MSP or GP63) is the most abundant glycoprotein localized to the plasma membrane of Leishmania promastigotes. MSP plays several important roles in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis, including but not limited to (i) evasion of complement-mediated lysis, (ii) facilitation of macrophage (Mo) phagocytosis of promastigotes, (iii) interaction with the extracellular matrix, (iv) inhibition of natural killer cellular functions, (v) resistance to antimicrobial peptide killing, (vi) degradation of Mo and fibroblast cytosolic proteins, and (vii) promotion of survival of intracellular amastigotes. MSP homologues have been found in all other trypanosomatids studied to date including heteroxenous members of Trypanosoma cruzi, the extracellular Trypanosoma brucei, unusual intraerythrocytic Endotrypanum spp., phytoparasitic Phytomonas spp., and numerous monoxenous species. These proteins are likely to perform roles different from those described for Leishmania spp. Multiple MSPs in individual cells may play distinct roles at some time points in trypanosomatid life cycles and collaborative or redundant roles at others. The cellular locations and the extracellular release of MSPs are also discussed in connection with MSP functions in leishmanial promastigotes.
