In the 2004 Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), 14 centres from six countries in Asia-Pacific collected 1198 unique aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli from intra-abdominal infections for susceptibility testing to 12 antimicrobial agents. Enterobacteriaceae comprised 82% of the total isolates. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated species (43%). Resistance rates were generally higher in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from Asian centres than those isolated from Oceania centres. There was little difference in susceptibility rates between community- and hospital-acquired Enterobacteriaceae for carbapenems. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producers typically had a more resistant profile than non-ESBL-producers, but were usually susceptible to carbapenems. Of the antimicrobial agents tested, carbapenems were the most reliably active in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae recovered from patients in Asia-Pacific with intra-abdominal infections.
