INTRODUCTION: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotyping resistance test (GRT) has been considered essential for HIV-1 drug resistance monitoring. However, it is not commonly used in some developing countries in Asia and Africa due to its high running cost. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate a new low-cost in-house GRT for both subtype B and non-B HIV-1. STUDY DESIGN: The in-house GRT sequenced the entire protease and 410 codons of reverse transcriptase (RT) in the pol gene. Its performance on drug resistance interpretation was evaluated against the FDA-approved ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System. Particularly, a panel of 235 plasma samples from 205 HIV-1-infected patients in Hong Kong was investigated. The HIV-1 drug resistance-related mutations detected by the two systems were compared. The HIV-1 subtypes were analyzed through the REGA HIV-1 Genotyping Tool and env phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Among the 235 samples, 229 (97.4%) were successfully amplified by both in-house and ViroSeq systems. All PCR-negative samples harbored viral RNA at <400 copies/mL. The in-house and ViroSeq system showed identical drug resistance-related mutation patterns in 216 out of 229 samples (94.3%). The REGA pol genotyping results showed 93.9% (215/229) concordance with the env phylogenetic results including HIV-1 subtype A1, B, C, D, G, CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG, CRF06_cpx, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, CRF15_01B and other recombinant strains. The cost of running the in-house GRT is only 25% of that for the commercial system, thus making it suitable for the developing countries in Asia and Africa. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our in-house GRT provided comparable results to those of the commercial ViroSeq genotyping system on diversified HIV-1 subtypes at a more affordable price which make it suitable for HIV-1 monitoring in developing countries.
