Fifteen unique isolates of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were selected for time-kill studies to assess the bactericidal activity of cefepime (CFP) and ceftazidime (CZD) (at 4 and 16 microg/mL), alone and associated with amikacin (AMK) (4 microg/mL). CFP proved more active than CZD (p < 0.05, Student's t test). Bactericidal activity after 24-h incubation was only achieved by the combination of CFP (16 microg/mL) plus AMK. The higher in vitro activity of cefepime over that of ceftazidime against imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains highlights the differences of these drugs beyond Enterobacterspp. and Staphylococcus aureus.
