Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the first human retrovirus and causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) in the leukemic cells is essential for their growth and survival. Thus, NF-kappa B inhibitors have been attracting attention as a potential strategy to treat ATL. Recently, the field of retrovirus research has been stimulated by the discovery of an innate host defense factor, APOBEC3, against the retroviruses. HTLV-I is relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of APOBEC3. To clarify the resistance of HTLV-I against APOBEC3 might contribute to the design of effective therapeutic approaches.
