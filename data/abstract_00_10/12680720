Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and serovar Paratyphi A with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (MICs of ciprofloxacin, 0.25 to 2 microg/ml) have a mutation at codon either Ser-83 or Asp-87 of gyrA gene. A screening method by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was designed to screen the mutations at codon Ser-83 and Asp-87 of the gyrA gene of S. enterica serovar Typhi and serovar Paratyphi A clinical isolates. This method successfully screened the gyrA mutations of S. enterica serovar Typhi and serovar Paratyphi A with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones.
