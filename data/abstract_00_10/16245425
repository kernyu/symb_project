P. aeruginosa are opportunistic microorganisms which caused serious hospital infections. The resistance of 763rd strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to selected antibiotics (beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones) were tested by disk-diffusion method. The least of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem and ceftazidime. Multiresistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are often isolated from clinical specimens.
