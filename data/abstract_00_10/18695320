PURPOSE: The present study was undertaken to detect metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) in nosocomial isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by four different phenotypic methods. METHODS: Ninety-one consecutive P. aeruginosa isolates were subjected to susceptibility testing by disc-diffusion assay and Vitek 2. Imipenem resistance was determined by three different methods (disc-diffusion, Vitek 2 and E test). Screening for MBL production was done by imipenem-EDTA combined disc test, imipenem-EDTA double-disc synergy test, imipenem-EDTA MBL E test and EDTA disc potentiation using four cephalosporins. RESULTS: Of 63 imipenem resistant isolates, MBL screening could be done in 56 isolates, of which 48 were MBL positive by combined disc test and 36 by the double disc synergy test. For confirmation of MBL production, MBL E test was done in 30 isolates. All the 30 isolates were confirmed to be MBL positive by the MBL E test method. EDTA disc potentiation using four cephalosporins was not very useful for MBL detection. CONCLUSIONS: Imipenem-EDTA combined disc test and imipenem-EDTA MBL E test are equally effective for MBL detection, but given the cost-constraints, combined disc test can be used as a convenient screening method in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
