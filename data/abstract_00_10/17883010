Mycobacterial colonies of two different morphologies were isolated from one sputum sample of a HIV-positive patient. One morphological type was resistant to streptomycin (STR) and susceptible to isoniazid (INH), while the other isolate with different colony morphology was resistant to both of these anti-TB drugs. A mycobacterial isolate of one pus from a lymph node sample was resistant to these two anti-TB drugs, while the other isolate from another pus sample was resistant to STR but susceptible INH. IS6110 RFLP based finger printing revealed that the HIV-positive patient was infected with different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A subculture of isolates on solid medium is useful to examine mixed infection.
