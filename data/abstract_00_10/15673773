A novel gene for quinolone resistance was cloned from a transferable plasmid carried by a clinical isolate of Shigella flexneri 2b that was resistant to fluoroquinolones. The plasmid conferred low-level resistance to quinolones on Escherichia coli HB101. The protein encoded by the gene showed 59% amino acid identity with Qnr.
