A new class of phosphate and phosphonate prodrugs, called HepDirect prodrugs, has been developed to deliver drugs to the liver while simultaneously diminishing drug exposure to extra-hepatic tissues. The technology combines liver-selective cleavage and kinase by pass with high plasma and tissue stability to achieve increased drug levels in the liver. Lamivudine (LMV), a nucleoside analogue, is a currently approved treatment for hepatitis B infection, but shows modest efficacy and significant drug resistance due to inefficient phosphorylation. LMV is inadequately phosphorylated to the corresponding nucleoside triphosphate in rat and human hepatocytes. A HepDirect prodrug of LMV monophosphate generated 34-fold higher levels of the triphosphate in rat hepatocytes and 320-fold higher triphosphate levels in the liver of treated rats relative to LMV.
