Little is known about the diversity and distribution of resistance determinants in human commensal bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for high-level erythromycin resistance among five human vaginal Lactobacillus rhamnosus isolates. PCR screening for the presence of ermA, ermB and ermC methylase genes revealed no determinants responsible for detected erythromycin resistance. Therefore, sequences of 23S rRNA genes from L. rhamnosus strains were studied by PCR-RFLP analysis and sequencing of 23S rRNA genes. According to the results, in all erythromycin-resistant L. rhamnosus strains, the presence of a A-->G transition mutation at position 2058 was discovered. Additionally, the isolates exhibited heterozygosity for the A2058/G2058 mutation among 23S rRNA gene copies. Presumably, the greatest number of mutated 23S rRNA operons was observed for the L. rhamnosus BGHV1' strain that also had the highest MIC for erythromycin (MIC=2048 microg mL(-1)). This study reports the presence of transition mutations in the V region of 23S rRNA genes that most probably account for high-level erythromycin resistance observed for the first time in human vaginal lactobacilli.
