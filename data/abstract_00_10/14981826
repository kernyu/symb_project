OBJECTIVE: To survey the antibiotic resistance of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in Chengdu and Chongqing area and guide the rational antibiotics usage in the treatment of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection. METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 9 antibiotics against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were measured using two-fold agar dilution method. RESULTS: A total of 154 strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are multi-drug resistant. But the resistant ratios of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ticarcillin-clavavulanic acid and fluoroquinolones are lower; especially, new fluoroquinolones have stronger antimicrobial activities. CONCLUSION: The rate of isolating Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains from clinical samples has been rising. In the therapy of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or fluoroquinolones is empirically the medicine of choice. For the treatment of serious infection, the administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with ticarcillin-clavavulanic acid or new fluoroquinolones is rational.
