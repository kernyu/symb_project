We describe here the sequence of the Plasmodium vivax mdr1 gene from 10 different isolates differing in chloroquine sensitivity. The deduced amino acid sequence of PvMDR1 shares more than 70% similarity with other malarial MDR proteins and it displays consensus motifs of an ABC family transporter including two transmembrane domains and two ATP binding cassettes. Similarity and dendrogram analyses revealed that sequences could be grouped according to their geographical origin. Within each geographical group however, no correlation was found between chloroquine resistance and specific mutations.
