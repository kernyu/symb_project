Twenty-two vertically human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected Brazilian children were studied for antiretroviral drug resistance. They were separated into 2 groups according to the administration of antiretroviral therapy into those who presented disease symptoms or without symptoms and no therapy. Viral genome sequencing reactions were loaded on an automated DNA sampler (TruGene, Visible Genetics) and compared to a database of wild type HIV-1. In the former group 8 of 12 children presented isolates with mutations conferring resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs), 7 presented isolates resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 2 presented isolates resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Ten children were included in the antiretroviral na ve group. Eight were susceptible to NRTIs and all of them were susceptible to PIs; one presented the V108I mutation, which confers low-level resistance to NNRTIs. The data report HIV mutant isolates both in treated and untreated infants. However, the frequency and the level of drug resistance were more frequent in the group receiving antiretroviral therapy, corroborating the concept of selective pressure acting on the emergence of resistant viral strains. The children who presented alterations at polymorphism sites should be monitored for the development of additional mutations occurring at relevant resistance codons.
