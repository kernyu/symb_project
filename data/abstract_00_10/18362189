Against 300 strains of pneumococci and 100 group A streptococci of differing beta-lactam, macrolide, and quinolone resistance phenotypes, AR-709 was very active, with all MICs being < or =2 microg/ml. Furthermore, AR-709 was active against strains that were both susceptible and resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
