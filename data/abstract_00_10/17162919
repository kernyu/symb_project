PURPOSE: To study cyclosporine A inhibition on the fresh retinoblastoma cells in vitro and increasing the drug sensitivity after combined with different antineoplastic drugs. METHODS: To study the growth curve of cyclosporine A on 27 samples of primary retinoblastoma cells by MTT assay and to study the change of the drug sensitivity by cyclosporine A combined with seven antineoplastic drugs. RESULTS: The average IC50 of cyclosporine A on the 27 retinoblastoma cells is 67.81microg/ ml and the average inhibitive rate of these samples is 26.1% when cyclosporine A is in the concentration of 2microg/ml. The inhibitive rates all got improved after the seven antineoplastic drugs combined with cyclosporine A and the increasing average inhibitive rate is more than 5. CONCLUSION: Cyclosporine A can inhibit retinoblastoma cells in vitro and its inhibitive effect is dose dependent. Moreover it can enhance the inhibition of multiple antineoplastic drugs on retinoblastoma cells.
