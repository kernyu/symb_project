Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has posed an immense problem for clinicians in the hospital setting for years, emerging as the most frequent nosocomial infection. To deal with this problem pathogen and others, infectious disease specialists have developed a variety of procedures for their control and prevention, involving options from preventative measures such as decolonization and isolation of MRSA-confirmed patients, to the more simple procedures of hand washing, expanding glove use, and reducing time in the hospital. With the realization that MRSA is now a community problem, there are expanded efforts toward more direct intervention, such as the use of anti-MRSA antibacterials and vaccines, in an attempt to reduce the overall burden of MRSA.
