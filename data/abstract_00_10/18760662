BACKGROUND: Salvage therapy based on foscarnet plus a thymidine analog is effective in patients with advanced-stage HIV disease and viruses harbouring multiple drug-resistance mutations. OBJECTIVE: To identify viral genetic determinants associated with the virological efficacy of foscarnet salvage therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Thirteen patients received foscarnet at a fixed dose of 80 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days, in combination with zidovudine or stavudine. RESULTS: The baseline median HIV viral load and CD4 cell count were 5.10log(10) copies/ml and 23 cells/mm(3), respectively. Following foscarnet therapy, viral load fell by a median of 1.84log(10)copies/ml (range: -0.29 to -2.82), and by at least 1log(10)copies/ml in 11 patients, all of whom harboured viruses with at least three thymidine-associated mutations (TAMs). The two patients with smaller declines in viral load (<0.50log(10)copies/ml) harboured viruses with only one or zero TAMs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings corroborate, in vivo, the impact of TAMs on HIV susceptibility to foscarnet. The virological response to foscarnet salvage therapy in multiclass-experienced patients may thus differ according to the number of TAMs.
