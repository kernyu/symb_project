Genetic and biochemical approaches to studies of drug resistance mechanisms in Plasmodium falciparum have raised controversies and contradictions over the past several years. A different and novel chemical approach to this important problem is desirable at this point in time. Recently, the molecular basis of drug resistance in P. falciparum has been associated with mutations in the resistance genes, Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (PfCRT) and the P-glycoprotein homologue (Pgh1). Although not the determinant of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum, mutations in Pgh1 have important implications for resistance to other antimalarial drugs. Because it is mutations in the aforementioned resistance genes rather than overexpression that has been associated with drug resistance in malaria, studies on mechanisms of drug resistance and its reversal by chemosensitisers should benefit from a chemical approach. Target-oriented organic synthesis of chemosensitisers against proteins implicated in drug resistance in malaria should shed light on mechanism of drug resistance and its reversal in this area. The effect of structurally diverse chemosensitisers should be examined on several putative resistance genes in P. falciparum to deal with antimalarial drug resistance in the broadest sense. Therefore, generating random mutations of these resistance proteins and subsequent screening in search of a specific phenotype followed by a search for mutations and/or chemosensitisers that affect a specific drug resistance pathway might be a viable strategy. This diversity-oriented organic synthesis approach should offer the means to simultaneously identify resistance proteins that can serve as targets for therapeutic intervention (therapeutic target validation) and chemosensitisers that modulate the functions of these proteins (chemical target validation).
