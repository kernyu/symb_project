Some properties concerning conjugal transmission of chromosomal genes for resistance to antibiotics lincomycin, spectinomycin, and erythromycin that occurs upon contact of cells, which carry a large plasmid p19, and p19 plasmid-free cells are considered in the soil strain Bacillus subtilis 19. Genes were transferred at different rates, depending on the order of their transfer. The transfer of chromosomal genes occurred irrespective of the transmission of self-transmissible autonomous conjugative plasmid p19.
