Beta lactamase continues to be the leading cause of resistance to beta lactam antibiotics in gram-negative bacteria. A total of 50 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied to determine the prevalence of ESBL production in hospital strains and also to study their susceptibility to various other antimicrobial agents. ESBL production was observed in a total of 18/50 (36%) of cases. Most of the ESBL positive isolates showed resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins including multidrug resistance (MDR) to antibiotics like piperacillin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin and tobramycin. The ESBL producers however showed good susceptibility to drugs like meropenem, gatifloxacin and amikacin.
