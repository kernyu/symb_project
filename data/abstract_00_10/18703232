A 4-year-old boy had surgical debulking of a cerebral astrocytoma followed by chemotherapy. He developed a subdural empyema with a teicoplanin and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. He was successfully treated with surgical drainage and 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy which included linezolid, rifampicin and metronidazole. Linezolid may be successful in treating other CNS infections caused by antibiotic resistant gram-positive organisms.
