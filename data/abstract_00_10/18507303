OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antimicrobial resistance in uropathogenic bacteria in northern Utah. DESIGN: One hundred twenty bacterial isolates from community-acquired UTI in the northern Utah area (Davis and Weber Counties) were tested. Samples were taken from otherwise healthy women, ages 18 to 50. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT/TMP), ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin comprised the process. SETTING: The Clinical Laboratory Science Department at Weber State University, with samples coming from clinics in the northern Utah area (Davis and Weber Counties). PARTICIPANTS: Urine samples were taken from otherwise healthy women, ages 18 to 50, who suffered from uncomplicated urinary tract infections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Antimicrobial resistance was measured using antimicrobial susceptibility testing and shown with other national resistance rates. RESULTS: Of bacterial isolates, 21.3% were resistant to SXT/TMP, 14.4% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 13.9% were resistant to nitrofurantoin. The resistance rates for ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin were acceptable for empirical UTI treatment (< 20% resistance), but local bacterial populations were found to demonstrate an increase in resistance to these two drugs as compared to previously observed national data. SXT/TMP resistance was above the recommended resistance threshold of 20% for effective empirical treatment, as advised by the IDSA. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that uncomplicated community-acquired UTI be treated with nitrofurantoin. Other recommendations include continued monitoring of local uropathogenic antimicrobial resistance.
