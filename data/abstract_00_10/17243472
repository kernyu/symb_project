The present study was undertaken to determine the occurrence, distribution and antimicrobial resistance pattern of Salmonella serovars in apparently healthy slaughtered sheep and goats in central Ethiopia. A total 1224 samples consisting of faeces, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and abdominal and diaphragmatic muscle samples were collected from 104 sheep and 100 goats. Salmonella was isolated from 12 of 104 (11.5%) sheep and 3 of 100 (3%) goats. Of the total 624 and 600 samples examined from sheep and goats, 18 (2.9%) and 4 (0.7%), respectively, were Salmonella positive. The 22 Salmonella isolates belonged to 9 different serovars. The common serovars isolated were S. typhimurium, followed by S. heidelberg, S. reading, S. give, and S. poona. Seven of the 22 isolates (31.8%) were multidrug-resistant to various antimicrobials.
