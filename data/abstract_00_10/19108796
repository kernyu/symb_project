BACKGROUND: Based on antimicrobial resistance patterns found in Swiss university hospitals, treatment with a third-generation cephalosporin is currently advised for Swiss children with urinary tract infection. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the susceptibility of Escherichia coli strains isolated from children with symptomatic community-acquired urinary tract infection. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility of E coli strains causing symptomatic community-acquired urinary tract infections was assessed in outpatient children attending the emergency management unit at the Department of Pediatrics, Mendrisio and Bellinzona Hospitals, Switzerland. Strains from children receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis or prescribed antimicrobials in the previous 4 weeks were excluded. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods were used for culture and identification of pathogens. E coli susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: Strains from 100 consecutive outpatient children (73 girls, 27 boys; aged 5 weeks-17 years [median, 33 months]; 100% white) were assessed. High rates of ampicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance (39 and 21 strains, respectively) and low rates of nitrofurantoin resistance (4 strains) were identified. No resistance was identified for coamoxiclav or third-generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: In these Swiss outpatient children with symptomatic community-acquired urinary tract infection, without antimicrobial prophylaxis or recent prescription of antimicrobials, uropathogenic E coli strains resistant in vitro to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole were common. However, in vitro resistance to nitrofurantoin, coamoxiclav, and third-generation cephalosporins was uncommon.
