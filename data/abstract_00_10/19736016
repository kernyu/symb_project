A series of novel 6-desfluoro [des-F(6)] and 6-fluoro-1-[(1R,2S)-2-fluorocyclopropan-1-yl]-8-methoxyquinolones bearing 3-(1-aminocycloalkyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl substituents at the C-7 position (1-6) was synthesized to obtain potent drugs for nosocomial infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. The des-F(6) compounds 4-6 exhibited at least four times more potent activity against representative Gram-positive bacteria than ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin. Among the derivatives, 7-[(3R)-3-(1-aminocyclopropan-1-yl)pyrrolidin-1-yl] derivative 4, which showed favorable profiles in preliminary toxicological and non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies, exhibited potent antibacterial activity against clinically isolated Gram-positive pathogens that had become resistant to one or more antibiotics.
