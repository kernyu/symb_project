The chloramphenicol-resistant cassette with short shared sequences of ptsG gene on both ends was PCR-generated from plasmid pKF3 and ligated to pMD18-T to construct pMD18-PC. The sdh gene for sorbose dehydrogenase was generated from plasmid pQE60-SDH and inserted into pMD18-PC, then pMD18-PC-SDH was constructed. It was digested with Pvu II and the target fragment ptsG1-cat-sdh-ptsG2 was recovered and electroporated into Escherichia coli JM109/pKD46. Homologous-recombination between linear DNA cassettes and Escherichia coli chromosomes took place by Red recombination. The detection result showed that the integron JM109s was of sorbose dehydrogenase activity. The PCR products assay using the upstream and downstream sequences of ptsG gene as primers and JM109s genomic DNA as template, indicated that sdh gene had been integrated at the ptsG gene site in Escherichia coli.
