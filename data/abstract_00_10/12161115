Building on the lead from antimalarial isonitriles 1-4 of marine origin, several easily accessible synthetic isonitriles were assessed for their antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum (in vitro) and multidrug resistant Plasmodium yoelii in Swiss mice model (in vivo). Isonitrile 11 has shown promising activity in both these assays.
