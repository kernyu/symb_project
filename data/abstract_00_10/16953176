Clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori is a principal cause of failure of eradication therapies, and its prevalence varies geographically. The IceA gene is a virulence factor associated with clinical outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine the current state of clarithromycin resistance prevalence, and to investigate the role of iceA genotypes in 87 Turkish adult patients (65 with functional dyspepsia and 22 with duodenal ulcer). A2143G and A2144G point mutations were tested by PCR-RFLP for clarithromycin resistance. Among the patients in the study, 28 patients were tested by agar dilution as well. Allelic variants of the iceA gene were identified by PCR. A total of 24 (27.6%) strains evidenced one of the mutations, either A2143G or A2144G. IceA1 was found to be positive in 28 of the strains (32.2%), iceA2 was positive in 12 (13.8%) and, both iceA1 and iceA2 were positive in 22 (25.3%) strains. In conclusion, we discovered no relationships between iceA genotypes and functional dyspepsia or duodenal ulcer, nor between clarithromycin resistance and iceA genotypes. Clarithromycin resistance appears to be more prevalent in Turkish patients.
