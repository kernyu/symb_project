Antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from patients with complicated urinary tract infections (CUTIs) between 1988 and 2000. Imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting Gram-negative rods. Resistant strains (MIC>16 mg/l) were observed in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterococcus avium (8%), Serratia marcescens (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over the period. Resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. These results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.
