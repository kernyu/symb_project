OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a mucolytic drug with insulin sensitizing properties, as an adjuvant therapy in subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) resistant to clomiphene citrate (CC). DESIGN: Placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial. SETTING: University-based hospital and private infertility practice. PATIENT(S): One hundred fifty women diagnosed with CC-resistant PCOS, aged 18-39 years undergoing therapy for infertility were included. INTERVENTION(S): The patients were assigned randomly to receive either NAC 1.2 g/d (group I) or placebo (group II) with CC 100 mg/d for 5 days starting at day 3 of the cycle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ovulation rate and pregnancy rate (PR). RESULT(S): Combination of CC and NAC significantly increased both ovulation rate and PR in women with CC-resistant PCOS (49.3% vs. 1.3% and 21.3% vs. 0%, respectively). No cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) were reported in the NAC group; two cases of miscarriage (12.5%) were reported. CONCLUSION(S): The NAC as an adjuvant to CC was more effective than placebo for CC-resistant patients with PCOS. It is safe and well tolerated.
