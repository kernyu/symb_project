AIMS: The purpose of this study was to determine the susceptibility of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates to antimicrobial agents and to investigate the presence of plasmid DNA. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 15 clinical isolates from children faeces, and 29 animal isolates of Campylobacter jejuni (n=22) and Campylobacter coli (n=22) were tested for susceptibility to 9 antimicrobial agents using a disc diffusion method, and screened for the presence of plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis. Of the 44 isolates, 56.8% were resistant to sulphonamide, 25% to norfloxacin, 18.2% to erythromicin, ciprofloxacin and ampicillin, and 13.6% to tetracycline. All isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, chloramphenicol and cefotaxime. Plasmids were detected in one Camp. jejuni (4.54%) strain isolated from sheep and in six (27.27%) Camp. coli strains isolated from rhesus monkey(3), swine(2), and poultry(1) with sizes ranging from 3.4 to 50 kb. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the human isolates were susceptible to antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of campylobacteriosis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The origin and spread of Campylobacter resistance to antibiotics are discussed, with particular respect to the current situation in Brazil.
