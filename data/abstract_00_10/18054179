Salmonella Typhimurium strains isolated in Italy in the period 2002-2004 from human and animal sources were examined for their antimicrobial susceptibility. Resistance to tetracycline (T, 73.6%), sulfonamides (Su, 73.3%), ampicillin (A, 67.6%), streptomycin (S, 65.4%) and chloramphenicol (C, 32.3%) were frequently observed. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was only observed in a swine strain, but most human strains resistant to nalidixic acid showed reduced susceptibility to that drug (MIC > or = 0.125 mg/l). Overall, 64% of the strains were resistant to four or more drugs. The most common resistance profiles were ACSSuT, prevalent in strains belonging phage type DT104 and ASSuT, prevalently associated with strains unable to be typed.
