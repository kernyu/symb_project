BACKGROUND: Current anti-Helicobacter pylori treatment regimens are costly and because of the increasing antibiotic resistance, are becoming ineffective. AIM: To evaluate a triple-layer tablet containing 100 mg bismuth subcitrate, 250 mg metronidazole, and 250 mg tetracycline in a single triple-layer tablet. METHODS: H. pylori-infected adult patients received bismuth-metronidazole-tetracycline (two tablets, t.d.s.) and ranitidine (300 mg) once daily for 14 days. Efficacy was determined using 13C-urea breath testing. RESULTS: Thirty-three of 35 enrolled patients were available for evaluation; using the protocol-specified modified intention-to-treat analysis, five failed treatment, two were lost to follow-up (cure rate per-protocol = 85.7%, intention-to-treat = 78.7%). The cure rate among metronidazole-susceptible strains was 100% (22 of 22) (95% confidence interval 84-100%) compared with 55% (five of nine intention-to-treat) (95% confidence interval 21-86%) among metronidazole-resistant strains. In four cases, therapy was truncated at 4-7 days because of side-effects; yet the treatment was effective in three. The three metronidazole-susceptible but clarithromycin-resistant infections were cured. CONCLUSION: This novel triple-layer tablet combination therapy was effective in all patients with metronidazole-susceptible H. pylori and many of those with resistant organisms. A greater degree of acid suppression may further improve effectiveness.
