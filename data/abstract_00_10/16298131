Following computational analyses, potential non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase have been pursued through synthesis and assaying for anti-viral activity. The general class Het-NH-Ph-U has been considered, where Het is an aromatic heterocycle and U is an unsaturated, hydrophobic group. Results for compounds with Het=2-thiazoyl and 2-pyrimidinyl are the focus of this report.
