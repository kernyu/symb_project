We report a patient with Enterococcus faecalis native-valve endocarditis who relapsed after 4 weeks of treatment with ampicillin plus gentamicin. The relapse was cured with ampicillin plus ceftriaxone, which was introduced after gentamicin-induced acute renal failure. This double beta-lactam combination showed a bactericidal effect in time-killing curve studies.
