This study was conducted to determine the susceptibility of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from food products to antimicrobial agents commonly used for treatment of infections with gram-positive bacteria, and to disinfectants. A total of 114 L. monocytogenes retail isolates were tested for susceptibility to ceftiofur, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, florfenicol, penicillin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, tiamulin, trimethoprim, and co-trimoxazole, and the disinfectants benzalkonium chloride and triclosan, by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). All isolates were resistant to ceftiofur, but susceptible to the other antibiotics. A single isolate had a MIC of 4 mg/L for ciprofloxacin. For tiamulin. the MIC values were around the breakpoint used. Most isolates had MICs for triclosan at 16 mg/L. The MICs for benzalkonium chloride formed a bimodal distribution, with 105 isolates having a MIC of 4 mg/L and 9 isolates MICs of 16 and 32 mg/L. This study showed that Danish isolates of L. monocytogenes have not developed or acquired resistance to antimicrobial agents used for treatment or disinfection, except for benzalkonium chloride. The MICs for triclosan was high compared to other gram-positive bacteria, suggesting that triclosan might not be useful against L. monocytogenes if incorporated in materials in the food industry.
