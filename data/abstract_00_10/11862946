An Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, esa1, that shows enhanced susceptibility to the necrotrophic pathogens Alternaria brassicicola, Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina, but has wild-type levels of resistance to the biotrophic pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and Peronospora parasitica. The enhanced susceptibility towards necrotrophic pathogens correlated with a delayed induction of phytoalexin accumulation and delayed induction of the plant defensin gene PDF1.2 upon inoculation with pathogens. Two reactive oxygen generating compounds, paraquat and acifluorfen, were found to cause induction of both phytoalexin accumulation and PDF1.2 expression in wild-type plants, but this induction was almost completely abolished in esa1. This finding suggests that esa1 may somehow be involved in transduction of signals generated by reactive oxygen species.
