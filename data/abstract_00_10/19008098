Bacterial peptide deformylase (PDF) belongs to a subfamily of metalloproteases catalyzing the removal of the N-terminal formyl group from newly synthesized proteins. We report the synthesis and biological activity of highly potent inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) PDF enzyme as well as the first X-ray crystal structure of Mtb PDF. Structure-activity relationship and crystallographic data clarified the structural requirements for high enzyme potency and cell based potency. Activities against single and multi-drug-resistant Mtb strains are also reported.
