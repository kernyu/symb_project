When considering educational issues and the need to update the curriculum for clinical pharmacologists for the new millennium, a number of questions must be raised. Who are our audiences? What are the specialized needs? This educational article identifies the audience, which includes those with diverse degrees such as MDs, PhDs, PharmDs, RNs, DVMs, and other non-MD prescribers working in academia, industry, clinical research organizations, and government in multifaceted disciplines requiring a knowledge base of physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, anatomy, microbiology, pathology, medicine, and the drug development process of preclinical and clinical studies complete with protocols, pharmacokinetics, and statistics. One specialized current educational issue for clinical pharmacologists to understand is the impact of animal therapeutic and subtherapeutic use of antimicrobials on antibiotic use in human medicine.
