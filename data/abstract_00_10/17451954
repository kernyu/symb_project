High-throughput screening hit 1 was identified as a potent, broad-spectrum, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV-1 replication. Analysis of the bound conformation of analogs of this inhibitor via molecular modeling and NMR contributed to the design of novel tertiary amide, carbamate, and thiocarbamate based NNRTIs.
