Rates of metallo-beta-lactamase and 16S rRNA methylase production were investigated in 51 imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates collected from hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Of them, 57% and 75% produced SPM-1 and RmtD, respectively. Of note, 51% produced both enzymes, suggesting that their coproduction is already common in this geographic area.
