The enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strain Ec2173, causing post weaning diarrhoea in swine, harbours six plasmids ranging from 13 to 200 kb in size. The heat stable toxin genes sta, stb and a tetracycline resistance gene were located on a self conjugative 120-kb plasmid, called pTC. In the cloned ColE1 type origin of replication of pTC a deletion was detected compared to other ColE1 replicons affecting the replication modulator gene rom. Epidemiological studies on ETEC isolates showed that pTC-like plasmids are widely distributed among porcine ETEC strains; thus representing an example of co-evolution of antibacterial resistance and virulence in pathogenic E. coli.
