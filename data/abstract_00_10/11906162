In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we previously reported that glucosamine impairs insulin stimulation of glucose transport, which is accompanied by impaired insulin stimulation of serine/threonine kinase Akt. To examine the role of Akt in glucosamine-induced insulin resistance, we investigated time course for insulin stimulation of Akt activity and glucose transport during recovery from glucosamine-induced insulin resistance. After induction of insulin resistance by glucosamine, we washed cells to remove glucosamine and incubated them for various times. After one hour, insulin stimulated-glucose transport was significantly increased and continued to increase up to 6-24 h. Insulin stimulation of Akt, however, did not increase after 1-3 h and began to slightly increase after 6 h. Next, we investigated effects of osmotic shock and vanadate on glucose transport in glucosamine-treated cells and found that glucosamine completely inhibited their actions in these cells. These data suggest that an Akt-independent mechanism is operative in glucosamine-induced insulin resistance and glucosamine impairs glucose transport stimulated by various stimuli involving and not involving Akt activation.
