Association of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant QnrA and the bla(VEB-1) gene was identified in a single Enterobacter cloacae isolate from K.-Bicetre, France, and in 11 out of 23 bla(VEB-1)-positive enterobacterial isolates from Bangkok, Thailand. This result may explain in part the association between quinolone and extended-spectrum beta-lactam resistance.
