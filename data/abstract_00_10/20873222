The isoniazid resistance of mycobacteria tuberculosis (MBT) is associated with point mutations in the codon 315 of katG gene of MBT. The two PCR-techniques for detection of point mutations in codon 315 have been developed. A use of two sets of primers comprising the additional competitive blocking primer with 3'-terminal phosphate group (in order to eliminate unspecific amplification) allowed to identify most frequent point mutations AGC-->ACC and AGC-->AGA in the codon 315. PCR with a set of two primers one of which contained 5 LNA-monomers allowed to discriminate between wild type and isoniazid-resistant MBT isolates; any of 6 known mutations in codon 315 of kafG gene being detected. A structure and purity of the LNA-containing oligonucleotides (length of 17 nucleotides) was characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry; the duplex formed by two LNA-containing complementary oligonucleotides (length of 17 b.p.) was anlyzed by thermal denaturation.
