A retrospective study of major aerobic bacterial isolates from pus/wound swabs taken from patients admitted to the burn unit at Govt. Medical College Hospital, Chandigarh, India, over a period of 5 years (June 1997-May 2002) was undertaken. The study was carried out to determine the bacterial profile and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates and to describe the change in trends over the study period. The pus/wound swabs yielded very high culture positivity (96%) for 665 total isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be most common isolate (59%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (17.9%), Acinetobacter spp. (7.2%), Klebsiella spp. (3.9%), Enterobacter spp. (3.9%), Proteus spp. (3.3%) and others (4.8%). Although P. aeruginosa continued to remain the predominant isolate over the five years, a constant and significant increase in the incidence of Acinetobacter spp. was found. Amikacin was found to be the most effective drug against gram negative bacteria, however, resistance to it was significantly increased over 5 years. For S. aureus and P. aeruginosa netilmicin and piperacillin were found to be the most effective drugs. Most of the isolates showed high level resistance to antimicrobial agents.
