This case describes almost continual daptomycin use for approximately 18 months in a patient with osteomyelitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The case is notable for only a brief episode of myalgia-associated creatine kinase elevations, which quickly resolved. Daptomycin demonstrated efficacy against this strain, which was tolerant to other antibiotics.
