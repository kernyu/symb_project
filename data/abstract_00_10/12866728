Treatment of the patients suffering from therapy-resistant unipolar depression with joint administration of imipramine (twice daily, 100-150 mg/day) and amantadine (twice daily, 150 mg/day) for four to six weeks resulted in the significant increase in the binding of [3H]7-OH-DPAT to dopamine D3 receptors in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. This effect correlated well with the clinical improvement, estimated with Hamilton's Depression Rating Scale. In the light of the above data, it seems justified to postulate that joint therapy with imipramine and amantadine may be successful in the treatment-resistant unipolar depression.
