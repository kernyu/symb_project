We examined the susceptibility of HIV-1 group M and O isolates to the fusion inhibitors T-20 and T-1249. Unexpectedly, HIV-1 O isolates were as sensitive as group M viruses to inhibition by T-20 but were usually less susceptible to T-1249. Our data suggest that T-20 has broad antiretroviral activity and would be effective in individuals with HIV-1 O infection. However, polymorphisms in gp41 might affect the sensitivity of HIV-1 O to second-generation fusion inhibitors.
