Transferring of Lesquerella fendleri genetically transformed plastids to Brassica napus plants has been performed with the somatic hybridization method. The plastome of the previously engineered transplastomic L. fendleri plants contained the aadA16gfp selective marker gene conferring spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance and green fluorescence under UV light. The protoplasts of B. napus chlorophyll-deficient plants were fused with gamma-irradiated protoplasts of L. fendleri transplastomic plants. A total of 59 green hybrid colonies have been isolated followed by spectinomycin/streptomycin selection. Shoot regeneration has been observed for two cell lines. Morphologically normal plants have been regenerated for one of them. PCR and isozyme analyses showed that the plants were transplastomic cybrids containing B. napus nuclei and L. fendleri transformed chloroplasts.
