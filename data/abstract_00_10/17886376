Self-obtained data about study of enterococci as etiologic agents of infectious complications after cardiovascular and transplantation surgery are presented in the article. 465 strains of enterococci were isolated from different biosubstrates. Isolation rate of different species of enterococci in blood, urine, fromwounds, trachea, cardiacvalves, as well as in the environment and on wear of healthcare workers were determined. Most frequently enterococci were isolated from urine (47.7% of cases) and from trachea (24.3% of cases). Enterococcal bacteremia was determined in 9.7% of cases and represented a significant part in Grampositive microflora--38.5% of all isolates. High resistance of enterococci to antibiotics and well lysis by phages were noted.
