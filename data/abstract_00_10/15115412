Conformationally restricted bisbenzamidines and related congeners have been synthesized and evaluated for activity against two Plasmodium falciparum strains. The most active compounds, bisbenzamidines linked by a 1,4-piperazinediyl core, had IC(50) values between 3 and 18 nM against both chloroquine-susceptible and -resistant parasites and IC(50) values for cytotoxicity greater than 5 microM, using the A549 human lung epithelial cell line. DNA binding affinity, as estimated by DeltaT(m), did not correlate with either antiparasite effects or cytotoxicity. Each of the active bisbenzamidines interfered with the formation of hemozoin in cell-free systems.
