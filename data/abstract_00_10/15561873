A fragment of the gyrA gene was sequenced from 34 isolates of Campylobacter coli, including 23 isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin. All ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates examined by DNA sequencing carried a point mutation at position Thr-86 on the gyrA gene product, involving the replacement of Thr-86 by Ile. A combined PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique using RsaI was developed to detect this mutation.
