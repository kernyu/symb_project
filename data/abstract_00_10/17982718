A recent study indicated that Neisseria subflava, one of the commensal Neisseria species, may play an important role in the emergence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with chromosomally mediated resistance to penicillin or cephalosporin by the horizontal genetic exchange of penA genes encoding the target site for penicillin or cephalosporin. The present investigation examined the antimicrobial susceptibility of 45 isolates of N. subflava from the oral cavities of Japanese men and women to various agents used for the treatment of gonococcal infections. Of the 45 isolates, 40 (88.9%) and 4 (8.8%) were intermediately resistant and resistant to penicillin, respectively, with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)(50) and MIC(90) of penicillin being 0.5 mg/l and 1 mg/l, respectively. Of the 45 isolates, 13 (28.9%) and 14 (31.1%) were resistant to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, respectively, and 3 (6.7%) showed reduced susceptibility to cefixime (although the susceptibility category was not determined). These results indicate that several isolates of N. subflava have acquired resistance or intermediate resistance to various antimicrobial agents, including penicillin, cephalosporin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin. The present study may thus confirm that N. subflava may be involved in the emergence of N. gonorrhoeae strains with either intermediate or total resistance to penicillin or cephalosporin by the horizontal genetic exchange of the penA gene.
