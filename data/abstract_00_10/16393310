BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance and duration of therapy influence the success of proton-pump inhibitor-containing Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. Clarithromycin resistance is associated with treatment failure. AIM: To examine the success of a 7-day rabeprazole-clarithromycin-amoxicillin therapy in the study population. METHODS: Adults from Ciudad Juarez with H. pylori infections identified by culture or histology received rabeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 0.5 g and amoxicillin 1 g, each b.d. for 7 days. Outcome was assessed by 13C-urea breath test carried out 4+ weeks after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were enrolled and evaluated by urea breath test; 102 completed the full 7 days therapy. Two deviated from protocol, and five stopped because of adverse events. The cure rate (intention-to-treat) was 85% (95% CI: 78-91%); the per-protocol cure rate was 85% (95% CI: 78-91%). Side-effects were not serious and only 6.6% of those with adverse events stopped medication. Only three isolates were clarithromycin-resistant and none was cured. Compliance explained most of the successes. CONCLUSIONS: In the study population a 7-day rabeprazole triple eradication therapy was both effective and well-tolerated. Clarithromycin resistance was uncommon. We observed a slightly better outcome but consistent with results from recent large studies in US populations.
