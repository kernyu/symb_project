Treatment of HIV infection is typically carried out using a combination of at least three drugs. Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that acts by non-competitive inhibition of the viral enzyme. Efavirenz-based regimens have performed favorably compared with protease inhibitor-based therapies either in naive patients or as simplification strategies in pretreated subjects. Efavirenz is administered once-daily and its simple dosing schedule improves adherence to therapy allowing for durability of the virologic and clinical responses. In the case of viral rebound, K103N is the most commonly efavirenz-selected viral mutation. As non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have a distinctive adverse-event profile, protease inhibitor-sparing regimens may reduce the risk of metabolic complications, insulin resistance and peripheral fat redistribution.
