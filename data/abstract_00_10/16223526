Three cases of infection due to Mycobacterium lentiflavum, a recently described species characterized by multiple resistance to anti-mycobacterial drugs, are reported here. While one case simply adds to the number of cervical lynphadenitis reported in literature, the others concern the first isolations from pleural effusions, in a young boy with leukaemia and in an elderly patient with lung disease, respectively.
