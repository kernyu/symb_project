Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are an emerging problem in children. The following are 2 case reports of unsuspected MRSA infections: the first is an infant with cervical adenitis and the second is a child with a deep infection of the toe. Both patients failed outpatient therapy with oral cephalosporins and required hospitalization for surgical drainage. Both patients had cultures positive for MRSA at surgery. Neither patient had any risk factors for acquiring MRSA. Thus, outpatients with presumed staphylococcal infections who fail oral therapy with cephalosporins may be infected with MRSA.
