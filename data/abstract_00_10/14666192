Mutations in the rpoB, katG, inhA, oxyR/ahpC genes in rifampicin- and isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis strains isolated from residents of Moscow, Astrakhan', and Moldova Republic were studied by molecular biological methods (heteroduplex analysis, single strand conformational polymorphism, biochips). Twenty-five combinations of mutations were detected. Some differences in the type distribution of detected mutations were found. The use of biochips is the most perspective method for determining the type of mutation.
