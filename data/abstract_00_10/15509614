OBJECTIVES: Fifty isolates of Burkholderia pseudomallei and 15 isolates of Burkholderia mallei were tested for their susceptibilities to 35 antimicrobial agents, including agents not previously tested against these bacteria. METHODS: MICs were determined by agar dilution in Mueller-Hinton medium. RESULTS: Among the antibiotics tested, lower MICs were obtained with imipenem, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, doxycycline and minocycline. Fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides had poor activities. A single clinical isolate of B. pseudomallei was resistant to ceftazidime, co-amoxiclav and doxycycline but remained susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Although B. mallei MICs are often lower, the overall results underline the importance of resistance in both species. The susceptibilities measured are consistent with the current recommendations for the treatment of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei infections.
