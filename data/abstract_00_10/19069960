In this research we evaluated the antibacterial activity of water soluble green tea extracts on isolates of Acinetobacter. A total of 20 strains were collected from burn wounds at different hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The susceptibilities of isolates to different antibiotics were tested using agar disk diffusion method. Antibacterial activity of water soluble green tea extract was measured by Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBCs). Seventy five percent of isolated strains showed resistance to at least 12 antibiotics or more and all the strains were Multi-drug Resistant (MDR) strains. The average MBCs of the extract against all strains of Acinetobacter were 387.5 +/- 127.6 microg mL(-1). Present study suggests that green tea has significant bactericidal action on multi-drug resistant strains of Acinetobacter.
