Eight hundred Erysipelothrix strains isolated between 1992 and 2002 from swine with erysipelas in Japan were serotyped. Thirty-seven, 47, 73, and 643 strains were isolated from animals with acute septicemia, urticaria, chronic endocarditis, and chronic arthritis, respectively, of which 381, 146, 254, and 19 isolates belonged to serotypes 1a, 1b, and 2b and other serotypes, respectively. All serotype 1a isolates were further examined for acriflavine resistance and their genotypes to discriminate them from the attenuated live vaccine strain, defined as serotype 1a, which is resistant to 0.02% acriflavine and which shows low levels of pathogenicity in mice. Of the serotype 1a isolates, 64.6% were acriflavine resistant, with 98.4% of these acriflavine-resistant strains having been isolated from animals with chronic arthritis. By randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, almost all the acriflavine-resistant serotype 1a strains showed the 253-bp band characteristic of vaccine strains and were easily discriminated from all 113 strains of acriflavine-sensitive serotype 1a strains from animals with acute and subacute swine erysipelas. The incidence of acriflavine-resistant strains of the distinctive RAPD type 1-2 was markedly higher than that of the other RAPD types and serotypes. RAPD type 1-2 strains also included a specific group identifiable by restriction fragment length polymorphism DNA analysis. Furthermore, the pathogenicities of 29 isolates of RAPD type 1-2 for mice were lower than those of the 21 isolates of other RAPD types. Our results indicate that RAPD type 1-2 strains are live vaccine strains and that 37% of the cases of chronic swine erysipelas detected in the past 11 years in Japan have occurred as a side effect of live vaccine use.
