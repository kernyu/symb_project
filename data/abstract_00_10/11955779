Fourteen and 22 each of Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) were isolated from animals from 1983 to 1999 in Korea and tested for their antibiotic resistance patterns, phage types and resistance gene patterns. S. Typhimurium isolates were highly resistant to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole and tetracycline, 95, 95 and 86%, respectively. The incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance (resistant to more than two drugs tested) of S. Typhimurium isolates was extremely high (100%) comparing to S. Enteritidis isolates (21%). Two of the five ACSSuT (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole and tetracycline) resistant type S. Typhimurium isolates were phage type definitive type 104 (DT104). For the detection of resistance related genes in S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium isolates, particularly ACSSuT type S. Typhimurium, antibiotic resistance genes, cmlA/tetR, bla(PSE-1) and bla(TEM), and genus Salmonella specific gene, sipB/C, were amplified using four pairs of primers in a hot-start multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two Korean isolates of S. Typhimurium DT104 showed bla(TEM) amplicons instead of bla(PSE-1) for the ampicillin resistance and they were susceptible to florfenicol. The multiplex PCR used in this study was useful in characterization of multiple drug resistant Salmonella isolates, especially ACSSuT type S. Typhimurium, and identification of beta-lactamase gene distribution among Salmonella isolates.
