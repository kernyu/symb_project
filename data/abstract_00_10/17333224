Trichophyton rubrum isolates were used in susceptibility testing for azoles by E-test. Voriconazole was the most and fluconazole was the less-active drug. Our results are in agreement with susceptibility data observed by researchers that used others' methodologies. E-test seems to be a reliable methodology to susceptibility-testing for T. rubrum.
