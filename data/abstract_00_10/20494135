Enterobacter sakazakii is an emerging foodborne pathogen associated with severe diseases in neonates. Infant formula milk (IFM) has been identified as one of the major contaminated sources and a transmission vehicle. To determine the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of this pathogen, 22 E. sakazakii strains isolated from IFM by an FDA-recommended method and PCR on the alpha-glucosidase gene were subtyped by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR, and antibiotic resistance patterns. At a similarity threshold of 80%, 16 ERIC-PCR fingerprint types were identified with a discriminatory power (D) of 0.933, and 18 RAPD-PCR types were identified with D of 0.973. Resistance to 9 antibiotics tested by disk diffusion assay revealed 6 antibiotic resistance patterns with D of 0.749. The comparison of characterization indicated that RAPD-PCR and ERIC-PCR have high discriminatory power showing genetic diversity of E. sakazakii isolates, and ERIC-PCR patterns showed a closer correlation than RAPD-PCR patterns to phenotypic characterization and the brands of IFM. Overall, the ERIC-PCR typing method could be used for tracing sources of E. sakazakii isolates in the food chain.
