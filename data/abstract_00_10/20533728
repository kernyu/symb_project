ESBL organisms provide a continuing challenge in the geriatric community. They are increasingly prevalent, and pose unique challenges in treatment. Carbapenems are the mainstay of therapy; however they are expensive medications that require prolonged intravenous administration. Carbapenem resistance is a growing concern among frequently hospitalized patients and nursing home residents, and options for treatment of MDROs are limited. Attempts at minimizing the spread of beta-lactamase producers through hygiene and contact precautions are imperative, as is ongoing research into more effective antimicrobial agents.
