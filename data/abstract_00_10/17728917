Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common causes of medical visit and antimicrobial use in children. A rationale management approach requires a thorough clinical exam and updated knowledge on local patterns of microorganisms involved and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Clinical diagnosis should be performed with pneumatic otoscopy. The most common microorganism causing AOM in Santiago, Chile according to local studies are Streptococcus pneumoniae (40%o), non-capsulated Haemophilus influenzae (29%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (4%). S. pneumoniae has acquired resistance to penicillin in the last decade, resistance that has been extrapolated to other (b lactams such as amoxicillin, reason why broader spectrum antimicrobials are routinely prescribed. Clinical practice has consistently shown although that the great majority of children receiving amoxicillin at a dose of 80-100 mg/kg/day resolve their AOM. Recent studies from our group have demonstrated that resistance to penicillin can not be extrapolated to amoxicillin. In vitro high level resistance to penicillin vs amoxicillin is 18%> vs 0.5%. Based on this data, our current recommendation for AOM is amoxicillin 80 mg/kg/day, q 12 hours for 10 days in infants and for 5-7 days in children > 2 years of age who have not had an episode within the previous month. For amoxicillin failures, amoxicillin + (b lactam inhibitor or a second generation cephalosporin are recommended, especially in areas with a high prevalence of (b lactam producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Treatment of children with AOM universally require appropriate follow-up in order to comply with the proposed algorithm.
