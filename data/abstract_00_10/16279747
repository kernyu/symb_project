The main indications for nebulized antibiotic use are as maintenance therapy for patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and in treatment protocols aimed at eradicating early P. aeruginosa infection. Daily nebulized antibiotic therapy has been used extensively in Europe for the last 25 years and recently in North America following the introduction of tobramycin solution for inhalation (TSI). The antibiotic is delivered directly to the site of infection, maximizing its efficacy and reducing its potential for toxicity. The efficacy of nebulized antibiotic therapy has been confirmed by meta-analyses of early studies which usually involved only small numbers of patients, and recently by large scale randomized control trials. These studies have shown that regular aerosolized antibiotic treatment results in improved respiratory function, less hospital admissions and respiratory exacerbations, and a significant reduction in the load of P. aeruginosa respiratory tract infection. Concerns about increasing bacterial resistance do not yet seem to have had any clinical impact. Successful eradication of early P. aeruginosa infection has been reported with nebulized colistin (in combination with oral ciprofloxacin), tobramycin and TSI. No advantage has been shown in studies comparing nebulized and intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone in the treatment of acute respiratory exacerbations. Inhalation of antibiotics may provoke bronchospasm and patients should be assessed before and after treatment prior to continuing long-term therapy at home.
