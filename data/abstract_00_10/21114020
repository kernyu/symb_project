Enterococci were considered as not requiring iron. The aim of study was evaluation of relationship between enterococci and iron. This study examined these relationships in a 71 strains belonging to two species--Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, which are often isolated from human infections. The iron is an essential nutrient for enterococci. Demonstrated that iron--regardless of the concentration in the medium--is collected during growth. Iron deficiency in the nutrient medium resulted in changes in the kinetics of growth of enterococci. Inhibiting the growth of enterococci by iron chelators and lack of inhibition are further proof of this demand for iron bacteria. Enterococci have the ability to acquire this important element of its connections with natural and synthetic chetators with different strength of chemical bonding and structure. Bacteria of the genus Enterococcus have a natural resistance to many antimicrobial agents. In the hospital environment can easily acquire resistance genes to many other classes of antimicrobial compounds. For these reasons, treatment of enterococal infections poses more difficulties. Inhibition of iron uptake in enterococci can be helpful in reducing and combating enterococal infections.
