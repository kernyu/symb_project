The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program regularly monitors global susceptibility rates for a spectrum of both novel and established antifungal agents. Anidulafungin and the other echinocandins displayed sustained, excellent activity against Candida spp. and Aspergillus fumigatus, with >or=98% of MIC results at <or=2 microg/ml. Six yeast isolates (all Candida glabrata) showing caspofungin MIC values of >or=0.5 microg/ml were further analyzed for potential fks hot spot (HS) mutations; three isolates had confirmed mutations in the fks1 HS1 region (S645P), and three exhibited mutations in the fks2 HS1 region (S645F and S645P).
