The technology of maize without plough land possible to apply in USA and other countries with advanced agriculture, only by atrazine and simazine herbicides synthesis by J. Geigy Company from Switzerland Phillips and Young (1973) said in their book that in USA is practicing no-tillage system on millions acres. After recently dates published by Derpsh (2001) in USA no-tillage is practice on 21,120,000 ha, in Brazil on 14,330,000 ha, in Argentina 10,500,000 ha etc. The chernozem soil in Romania is very properly for no-tillage system. First experiments with no-tillage system have been since 1965 at maize, and at soybean since 2002 until 2005, obtaining remarkable results concerning maize and soybean yields. At genetically modified soybean crop the economic efficiency is very big because fuel consumption was 75 l/ha at classic system and only 21 l/ha at no-tillage system. The expenses with mechanical working were 217 Euro/ha at classic system and only 45 Euro/ha at no-tillage system.
