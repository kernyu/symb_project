We have identified the iscR (PA3815) gene encoding an iron-sulfur cluster assembly regulator homologue as one of the genes required for peroxide resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. Here, we present the phenotypic characterization of an iscR deletion mutant in terms of KatA expression, stress responses, and virulence. The iscR null mutant exhibited reduced KatA activity at the posttranslational level, hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and virulence-attenuation in Drosophila melanogaster and mouse peritonitis models. These phenotypes were fully restored by multi-copy-based expression of katA. These results suggest that the requirement of IscR in P. aeruginosa is related to the proper activity of KatA, which is crucial for peroxide resistance and full virulence of this bacterium.
