Three new (1-3) and five known (4-8) partially acetylated oligorhamnoside derivatives were obtained from Cleistopholis patens via high-throughput natural products chemistry procedures. The rapid structure elucidation and dereplication were performed primarily utilizing a capillary-scale NMR probe and LR-/HRESIMS spectroscopic methods. Compounds 1, 2, and 6 were found to possess significant in vitro antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 33591 and S. aureus 78-13607A with MICs of < or =16 microg/mL. Furthermore, 2 and 6 were found to show significant in vitro antibacterial activity against an expanded panel of Gram-positive pathogens including either ATCC strains or well-characterized clinical isolates from the global SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
