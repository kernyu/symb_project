The review gives data on the reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the existing influenza vaccines, such as inactivated (conjugate, subunit, virosomal, cultural vaccines with adjuvants) and live vaccines, as well as on the new directions in the design of influenza vaccines. It also provides data on specific medications against influenza and discusses the problem associated with the occurrence of influenza viruses resistantto these drugs. The economic efficiency of the prevention of influenza with vaccines and drugs is under debate.
