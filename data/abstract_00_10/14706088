Teicoplanin dosage recommendations for specific infections have been modified in recent years. However, there was no significant increase in the proportion of pre-dose concentrations > 20 mg/L between 1994 and 1998 in samples sent for teicoplanin assay at the Regional Antimicrobial Reference Laboratory, Bristol, UK. A questionnaire on the use of teicoplanin and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was sent to all UK National External Quality Assurance Scheme antibiotic assay users. Teicoplanin was widely used in the UK, although vancomycin was more popular as a choice of glycopeptide. Fewer than 25% recommended teicoplanin TDM during routine use, the main reasons being perceived lack of toxicity and lack of evidence for the use of teicoplanin TDM. Pre-dose concentrations < 20 mg/L were considered appropriate for treatment of bacteraemia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by 53% of those responding. Data sheet advice was relied upon more than TDM as an indication of therapeutic dosing. Microbiologists who mainly used vancomycin tended to perform more TDM and seek higher serum concentrations when using teicoplanin than those who preferentially used teicoplanin.
