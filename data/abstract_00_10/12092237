S. pneumoniae implicated in severe infections presents now a high frequency of the resistant strains to Penicillin G or multiresistance in the whole world. Our study on 136 strains of invasive pneumococcus isolated in the last 10 years showed a medium resistance to penicillin of 22.8% with yearly variations. The resistance to Rifampin, Cloramphenicol and Eritromycin was of 4.4%, 7.8% and 8.0%. The treatment of pneumococcal infections must be adapted to actual antibiotypes. These results present therapeutic implications.
