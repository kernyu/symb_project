BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is difficult to control. Due to a dramatic increase in the nosocomial MRSA infection rate at our hospital from 2000 to 2001, this study was conducted to identify the source of these infections and the effectiveness of control measures. METHODS: 179 healthcare workers (HCWs) were screened for carriage of MRSA. Starting in April 2001, all patients with MRSA infection or colonization were put in strict contact and cohort isolation. The bacterial isolates of HCW carriers and patients with MRSA infection from April 2001 to September 2001 were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk-diffusion method and molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Fifteen HCWs were found to be carriers of MRSA. They were all given topical mupirocin treatment. After these interventions, the nosocomial MRSA infection rate decreased from 1.23 to 0.53 per 1000 patient-days. All 61 MRSA isolates available for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular typing were multidrug resistant. PFGE study revealed 2 predominant types, type C and type Y, comprising 36 and 12 isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates the importance of measures to control nosocomial MRSA infections in hospitals that already have a high incidence of endemic MRSA infection. Elimination of carriage by healthcare workers, and strict contact and cohort isolation are the main effective measures.
