The Lactococcus lactis multidrug resistance ABC transporter protein LmrA has been shown to confer resistance to structurally and functionally diverse antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs. Using a previously characterized photoreactive drug analogue of Rhodamine 123 (iodo-aryl azido-Rhodamine 123 or IAARh123), direct and specific photoaffinity labeling of LmrA in enriched membrane vesicles could be achieved under non-energized conditions. This photoaffinity labeling of LmrA occurs at a physiologically relevant site as it was inhibited by molar excess of ethidium bromide>Rhodamine 6G>vinblastine>doxorubicin>MK571 (a quinoline-based drug) while colchicine had no effect. The MDR-reversing agents PSC 833 and cyclosporin A were similarly effective in inhibiting IAARh123 photolabeling of LmrA and P-glycoprotein. In-gel digestion with Staphyloccocus aureus V8 protease of IAARh123-photolabeled LmrA revealed several IAARh123 labeled polypeptides, in addition to a 6.8kDa polypeptide that comprises the last two transmembrane domains of LmrA.
