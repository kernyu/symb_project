Epidemiological, animal and biological studies provide compelling evidence for the role of Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric carcinogenesis. The finding that H. pylori-induced chronic atrophic gastritis is the major cause of gastric cancer suggests that eradication of the bacterium may prevent this malignancy. Computer-simulation studies have confirmed the cost-effectiveness of eradication in high-risk subjects; however, unresolved issues complicate active testing for and treatment of H. pylori infection among asymptomatic carriers. Concerns include the enormous costs for developing countries to implement strategies, the inconclusiveness of data from randomized controlled studies, the potential induction of antimicrobial resistance, and the uncertain effect of eliminating this organism on the spectrum of modern disease. Although current evidence is insufficient to recommend universal testing and treatment, it is possible to identify highly susceptible individuals who are most likely to benefit from treatment. Novel biomarkers for predicting risk are under extensive investigation, including genetic, epigenetic and proteinomic factors. The emerging evidence suggests that treatment of H. pylori infection in asymptomatic carriers may decrease the burden of gastric cancer. However, confirmation of long-term benefits remains a long way off.
