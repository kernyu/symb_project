Most tropical diseases imported by travelers can be treated quite effectively. Human endoparasites belong to the protozoa and worms. Protozoa can be seen as microparasites, characterized by short generation periods and high rates of reproduction within a host--consequently the diseases mainly are of short duration. Effective drugs are available for malaria, amebiasis and other intestinal protozoa as well as for leishmaniasis. Resistance, however, sometimes is a problem. Worms are macroparasites that generally do not reproduce within a host--teleologically speaking because otherwise they would rapidly damage their own basis of living. Accordingly, severe worm disease is rarely found in travelers. Levels of anthelminthic resistances so far are low. The most important worm disease in travelers is schistosomiasis, a disease that also can be treated effectively if diagnosed early.
