The recent creation of several mouse models of mitochondrial diseases has provided new insights into the understanding of human mitochondrial disorders. Whether these animals have clinical or histologic ophthalmologic abnormalities is of great interest given the high frequency of such abnormalities in humans with mitochondrial disorders. In this article, we describe the currently available mouse models for mitochondrial diseases with special emphasis on their ocular phenotype. These mouse models demonstrate multiple and varied ophthalmologic manifestations.
