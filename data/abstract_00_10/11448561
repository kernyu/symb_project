ABT-773, a novel ketolide, was compared to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and gemifloxacin against antibiotic-resistant strains recently isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections. MICs were determined by agar dilution using standard NCCLS methodology. ABT-773 (MIC(90) 0.06 mg/L) was more active than the macrolides (MIC(90) > or = 2 mg/L) and fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) > or = 0.5 mg/L) against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The fluoroquinolones were the most active agents tested against beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90) < or = 0.01-0.06 mg/L), against which ABT-773 (MIC(90) 4 mg/L) was comparable to azithromycin and two- and four-fold more active than erythromycin and clarithromycin, respectively. Against beta-lactamase positive Moraxella catarrhalis, the activity of ABT-773 (MIC(90) 0.06 mg/L) was comparable to gemifloxacin, trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (MIC(90) 0.03-0.06 mg/L) and 4- to eightfold greater than that of clarithromycin, gatifloxacin, and erythromycin. These data suggest ABT-773 could be a valuable compound for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including those resistant to usual oral therapy.
