The antimicrobial susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents of 41 Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from sheep with meningoencephalitis and from feedstuff was tested by both microdilution and disk diffusion methods. Both sets of isolates of L. monocytogenes were susceptible to penicillin G, amoxicillin, cephalothin, erythromycin, vancomycin, rifampicin, gentamicin, kanamycin, trimethoprim, sulfisoxazole, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin, but resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline (7.3 and 4.9%, respectively). Tetracycline was the most frequent resistance trait in L. monocytogenes strains of animal origin. Four strains (9.8%) also exhibited reduced susceptibility (MIC 4 mg/l) to doxycycline suggesting the need of surveillance studies to monitor the antimicrobial resistance of Listeria strains of animal origin.
