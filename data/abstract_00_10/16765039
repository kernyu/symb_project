The aim of this study was assess the activity of thalidomide in patients with progressive relapsed or platinum-refractory germ-cell tumours (GCT). Between April 2002 and January 2003, 15 patients with inoperable progressive GCT were treated with escalated daily doses of 200-600 mg thalidomide. All patients had failed first-line and salvage chemotherapy with a median of 6 (range 4-12) cisplatin-based treatment cycles, 13/15 (87%) patients had received high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and 8/15 (53%) patients were considered platinum-refractory or absolute refractory; 8/15 (53%) patients had previously received other palliative chemotherapy regimens. No patient achieved a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR). However, 5/15 (33%) patients achieved serological PR and 1 additional patient had stable disease for 3 months. The median duration of remissions was 3 months (range 2-12 months) including 2 patients with a progression-free survival of 9 and 12 months. Responses occurred mainly in patients with a low tumour burden, slow disease progression and alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) elevations. Responses to thalidomide were independent from platinum-sensitivity. Toxicity was mild, with lethargy and constipation in the majority of patients. Skin rash grade II developed in 2 patients and peripheral neurotoxicity grade II/III developed in 4 patients. One responding patient died suddenly from an unknown cause. It is concluded that thalidomide shows single-agent activity in patients with heavily pre-treated GCT, AFP elevations and slowly progressive disease.
