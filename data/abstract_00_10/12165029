BACKGROUND: One week of quadruple therapy including metronidazole is recommended for Helicobacter pylori treatment failures after first line therapy regardless of resistance status. This study investigated whether a quadruple regimen containing furazolidone could be effective as a third-line (salvage) therapy. METHODS: All patients with previous H. pylori treatment failure after a clarithromycin-metronidazole +/- amoxicillin combination plus acid suppression were given lansoprazole 30 mg twice a day (bid), tripotassiumdicitratobismuthate 240 mg bid, tetracycline 1 g bid, metronidazole 400 mg (PPI-B-T-M) three times a day (tid) for 1 week. In the case of treatment failure with this second-line therapy, the same regimen was applied for 1 week except for using furazolidone 200 mg bid (PPI-B-T-F) instead of metronidazole (sequential study design). RESULTS: Eighteen consecutive patients were treated with PPI-B-T-M. Eleven of those 18 remained H. pylori positive (38.9% cured). Pretherapeutic metronidazole resistance was associated with a lower probability of eradication success (10% vs. 75%, p=.04). Ten of these 11 patients agreed to be retreated by PPI-B-T-F. Final cure of H. pylori with PPI-B-T-F was achieved in 9/10 patients (90%) nonresponsive to PPI-B-T-M. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of metronidazole resistance, PPI-B-T-M as a recommended second-line therapy by the Maastricht consensus conference achieved unacceptable low cure rates in our metronidazole pretreated population. In this population, metronidazole based second-line quadruple therapy may be best suited in case of a metronidazole-free first line-regimen (e.g. PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin) or a low prevalence of metronidazole resistance. Furazolidone in the PPI-B-T-F combination does not have a cross-resistance potential to metronidazole and is a promising salvage option after a failed PPI-B-T-M regimen.
