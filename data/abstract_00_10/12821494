The in vitro activity of the new triazole albaconazole (UR-9825) in comparison with those of flucytosine, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole against 70 strains of Malassezia spp. was determined by a microdilution method using a colorimetric indicator for metabolic activity. Albaconazole showed an in vitro profile similar to those of the different antifungals tested (MIC <or= 0.06 microg/ml for all the strains).
