Oral infections with the opportunistic pathogenic yeast Candida albicans are one of the earliest and most frequent infections in immunosuppressed individuals. In these populations, drug-resistant isolates have emerged with the widespread use of antifungal azole drugs. Many molecular mechanisms of resistance have been identified, including overexpression of two types of efflux pumps, the major facilitator MDR1 and the ABC-transporters (CDR1 and CDR2), and the overexpression or mutation of the target enzyme, ERG11. With overexpression of these four genes implicated in multidrug resistance, identification of regulatory regions of the promoters is important. 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was used to identify transcription initiation sites for genes associated with multidrug resistance (CDR1, CDR2, MDR1 and ERG11). These results were confirmed by cloning and sequencing of 5' RACE products and by primer extension. This research will allow further analysis of the regulation of transcription for these genes.
