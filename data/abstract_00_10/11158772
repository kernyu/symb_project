The genetic basis of macrolide resistance was investigated in a collection of 48 genotypically unrelated clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained between 1987 and 1997 in France. All strains were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, and streptogramin B, exhibiting a macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance phenotype, and harbored the erm(B) gene. None of the strains carried the mef(A) or erm(A) subclass erm(TR) gene.
