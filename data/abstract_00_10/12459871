We studied the correlation between genetic transfer of tetM determinant in Tn916 conjugative transposon by urogenital mycoplasmas (Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum) and changes in the bacterial repertoire during treatment with a tetracycline antibiotic. Basic conditions favoring the nonspecific transfer of tetM determinant into mollicute cells are determined and the allele polymorphism of tetM determinant in clinical strains of M. hominis and U. urealyticum is evaluated. The structure of tetM gene in clinical mycoplasma and ureaplasma strains is characterized by a peculiar mosaic pattern and differs from all previously described alleles of this gene. The results suggest that tetracycline resistance in mollicutes is determined by mechanisms alternative to genetic transfer of tetM determinant.
