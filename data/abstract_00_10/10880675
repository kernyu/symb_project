Earlier studies using the grid test have indicated a negative genetic correlation between sensitivity to ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and ethanol-induced motor incoordination in FAST and SLOW mice, lines selectively bred for differential sensitivity to ethanol's stimulant effects. Because different tests of motor coordination may not measure the same behavioral competencies or physiological substrates, the present experiments tested adult ethanol- or saline-exposed FAST and SLOW mice of two replicates (FAST-1, FAST-2, SLOW-1, and SLOW-2) using three additional tests of coordination: a stationary dowel, fixed-speed rotarod, and accelerating rotarod. After ethanol treatment, FAST-1 mice fell from the stationary dowel at shorter latencies than SLOW-1 mice, suggesting that they had relatively greater sensitivity to ethanol. However, brain ethanol concentrations (BrECs) were similar at time of fall, and no differences were found between replicate-2 lines. SLOW-1 mice fell from the fixed-speed rotarod at lower BrECs than FAST-1 mice, suggesting possibly greater sensitivity of the SLOW-1 line. Again, no replicate-2 line differences were found. No significant differences were detected for the accelerating rotarod. These results provide little support for a negative genetic relationship between sensitivity to the stimulant and ataxic effects of ethanol using these measures of motor coordination.
