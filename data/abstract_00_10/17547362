Adefovir dipivoxil is an analogue nucleotide recently approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis HBV-related. Some recent studies have evidenced that treatment with 10 mg/die orally with adefovir dipivoxil is efficacy and well tolerate in patients with chronic hepatitis B, both HBeAg-positive and anti-HBe-positive, with LAM-resistance. Also, adefovir dipivoxil effectively suppresses lamivudine-resistant HBV in patients with chronic hepatitis B after liver transplantation, compensated or decompensated liver disease and co-infection with HIV. Other studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of prolonged treatment in relation to emerge of adefovir-resistant HBV mutants.
