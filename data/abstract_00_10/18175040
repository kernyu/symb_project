Since the appearance of resistance to antiretroviral treatment is unavoidable, the host cell's transcription factor NF-kappaB is a novel HIV target. The goal of this study was to characterize the effect of two immunomodulators, curcumin (Cur) and sulfasalazine (Sul), with a protease inhibitor, indinavir (IDV), on HIV-1 persistently infected CD4+ T-cells. Viral p24 antigen production, viral infectivity (tested on MAGI cells) and viral relative infectivity (viral infectivity/p24) were analysed. When used alone, both immunomodulators were able to reduce viral infectivity. When in combination, both 10 microM IDV plus 10 microM Cur and 10 microM IDV plus 250 microM Sul showed a significant reduction in viral infectivity and viral relative infectivity when compared to the reduction produced by IDV alone. Thus, the use of immunomodulators with IDV could help to reduce HIV-1 production in persistently infected cells.
