OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanism of generation of L-form of M. tuberculosis and its significance on the development, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. METHODS: M. tuberculosis was inoculated into the non-high osmotic medium with rifampin, isoniazid or ethambutol and then the L-form was observed by microscopy daily. The cultures were filtrated to get the pure cultures of stable L-form by subculture with the non-high osmotic medium and characteristics of morphology, growth, susceptibilities to the antibacterial drugs and the special gene of M. tuberculosis were observed when the pure subcultures of the L-form were isolated. RESULTS: L-form of M. tuberculosis was induced by the concentrations of routine inhibition test of rifampin, isoniazid or ethambutol. The L-form would not be susceptible to the above mentioned antituberculosis drugs but susceptible to streptomycin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin and others. The morphologies of L-form were irregular or spherical with single, paired or chain form, and growth under the bottom of the medium but not movement or adhere to the glass. The L-form was negative by acid-fast stain and negative or positive by Gram stain. The gene of L-form reacted with the PCR kit for the M. tuberculosis and showed the same band. CONCLUSIONS: M. tuberculosis could be killed by rifampin, isoniazid or ethambutol but also could be induced to become the L-form by these antituberculosis drugs, and it is one of the important factor that affecting the effect of treatment of the tuberculosis. The cell wall deficient variants of M. tuberculosis could be determined by the PCR of M. tuberculosis. It is recommended that the L-forms should be noticed during the treatment with the antituberculosis drugs and combination treatment with antituberculous drugs to which the L-forms were susceptible, is also very important.
