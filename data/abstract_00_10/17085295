We studied here the effect of aqueous extracts of Larrea divaricata Cav on the growth of Helicobacter pylori. Results show that cold extract, infusion, decoction and simulated digestion had inhibitory activity at 0.04-0.1 mg/l against clarithromycin and metronidazole susceptible and resistant H. pylori strains. These results support the popular use of L. divaricata Cav in gastric disturbances and prompt further research to characterize these compounds with a therapeutic potential against gastric ulcers and gastric cancer associated with H. pylori.
