The main aim of this study was to determine the frequency of antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli isolates recovered in Levine agar plates from 54 fecal samples of captive ostriches from a farm in the South of Portugal. Fifty-four nonselected E. coli isolates were obtained (one/sample) and the phenotypes and genotypes of antibiotic resistance were characterized. The following numbers of isolates showed antibiotic resistance: ampicillin (nine), tetracycline (seven), streptomycin (three), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, or gentamicin (one), and cefotaxime, ceftazidime, azthreonam, imipenem, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (zero). The bla(TEM) gene was identified in six out of nine ampicillin-resistant isolates, and the tet(A) or tet(B) genes in five out of seven tetracycline-resistant isolates. Mutations at positions -42, -18, -1, and +58 of ampC promoter region were identified in one cefoxitin-resistant isolate. Further, the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates was estimated in the 54 fecal samples of ostriches using cefotaxime-supplemented Levine agar plates for ESBL-positive E. coli recovery. Three samples contained ESBL-positive E. coli isolates of which one isolate/sample was characterized, leading to the detection of the following beta-lactamases: bla(CTX-M-14a) + bla(TEM-1b) (two isolates) and bla(TEM-52c) (one isolate). The three ESBL-positive isolates were classified into the phylogroup B1, and contained class 1 integrons with the gene cassettes dfrA17 + aadA5 (one isolate) and aadA1 (two isolates). This study adds to our knowledge about the wide dissemination of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in different ecosystems, including captive ostriches, that could be transferred to humans through the food chain.
