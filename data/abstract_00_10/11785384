Humoral and cellular mechanisms of Abies sibirica polyprenol effects on nonspecific resistance of mice to influenza A/Aichi/2/68 virus were investigated. Two aerosol doses of polyprenols had a high protective effect in mice challenged with influenza virus. Aerosol polyprenol preparations in the studied doses induced no interferon or tumor necrosis factor production in the lungs. Lung macrophage counts and capacity to produce superoxide anion radicals increased in survivors after influenza in comparison with intact animals. Double aerosol administration of polyprenols prior to influenza infection promoted an increase in the thymus weight, bronchoalveolar tract cell counts (predominantly at the expense of lymphocytes), and of superoxide-producing potential of macrophages, which, in turn, can contribute to improvement of the defense potential of the organism towards influenza virus.
