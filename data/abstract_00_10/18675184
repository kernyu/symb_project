Patients with chronic hepatitis C have frequently other morbidities, either because they are frequent in the general population (metabolic syndrome) and/or because the route of contamination (chronic alcohol consumption succeeding to drug abuse). These co-morbidities have a harmfull impact on fibrosis progression during the natural history of HCV infection and reduce the efficacy of antiviral treatments. Thus, it is crucial to diagnose early and treat these different diseases which may be combined. They are the metabolic syndrome and/or chronic alcohol consumption resulting in insuline resistance, infection by the human immune deficiency virus or by the hepatitis B virus as well as chronic tobacco use or excessive consumption of cannabis. An optimal is based on a multidisciplinary approach to reduce fibrosis progression and improve the efficiency of antiviral therapies. However, the hepatologist has to come back to a global care, which is mandatory at the individual level as well as for the public health.
