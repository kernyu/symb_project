Case reports have previously identified linezolid resistance in 6 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. We describe an additional case and discuss clinical characteristics of these patients. Invasive procedures, deep organ involvement, and presence of foreign material were predominant in these cases. Resistance followed prolonged (>21 days) linezolid therapy in most cases. The development of resistance to linezolid should be taken into account when selecting this drug as a therapeutic option.
