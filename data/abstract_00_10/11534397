Multiple drug resistance can form in bacteria by functioning the membrane transport systems, responsible for release of antibacterial compounds from the cell into the environment. These transport mechanisms activated in the majority of cases by energy of proton transmembrane gradient are presented by solitary membrane transporting proteins and by functionally related transporter groups, periplasma proteins, and external membrane porines. Many bacterial drug transporters can bind and transfer a number of structurally heterogeneous substrates. Drug transporters known today have different origin and primary physiological functions. The genetic system of transporter type drug resistance is as a rule characterized by a cluster structure and related to mobile genetic elements. Transport mechanisms of drug resistance create an extra adaptation potential of microorganisms under conditions of selective pressure.
