The oral cavity is colonized by a large number and highly diversified communities of micro-organisms. Bacterial biofilm present on tooth or root surface is a major cause of gingivitis and periodontitis. Chemical antimicrobial agents are widely used in prophylactic and therapeutic regimens for dental plaque related diseases, which are among the most common human infections. As these agents are difficult to maintain at therapeutic concentrations in the oral cavity and can be rendered ineffective by resistance development in target organisms, there is a need for an alternative antimicrobial approach. A novel approach, photodynamic therapy (PDT), could be a solution to these problems. Lethal photosensitization of many bacteria, both Gram positive and Gram negative was found in many studies. The advantage of this new approach includes rapid bacterial elimination, minimal chance of resistance development and safety of adjacent host tissue and normal microflora. Thus, the available knowledge of photodynamic therapy should encourage a more clinically oriented application of this technique.
