BACKGROUND: Early discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia can reduce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, the occurrence of adverse drug events, and the cost of therapy. Evidence suggests that discontinuation of therapy by day 3 may be appropriate for patients with a clinical pulmonary infection score of 6 or less at baseline and on day 3. OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of patients eligible for antimicrobial discontinuation on day 3 and day 7 of therapy and to determine the proportion of eligible patients for whom antimicrobials were discontinued within these timeframes. METHODS: A 6-month observational study was conducted from October 3, 2005, to March 31, 2006, in a 27-bed medical-surgical tertiary care intensive care unit. Clinical pharmacists attended daily rounds and prospectively identified patients for inclusion in the study. A study pharmacist retrospectively calculated clinical pulmonary infection scores. Other data were obtained from the quality-improvement database and patient health records for the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia during the study period, of whom 49 were included in the analysis. At day 3, 17 (35%) of the 49 patients were eligible for early discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy, but therapy was discontinued for only 2 (12%) of these 17 patients. At day 7, 10 (32%) of 31 patients were eligible for antimicrobial discontinuation, but therapy was discontinued for only 1 (10%) of these 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: A significant opportunity exists at the authors' institution to develop and implement an antimicrobial discontinuation policy that uses the clinical pulmonary infection score to guide antimicrobial use for patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.
