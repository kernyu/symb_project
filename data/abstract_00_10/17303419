The recent emergence of clinically oppressive superbugs, some with resistance to nearly all frontline drug therapies, has challenged our ability to combat such infectious organisms as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Our medicinal chemistry program targeting this pathogen has identified several potent galactofuranose-based in vitro inhibitors of mycobacterial growth. The most potent compound, the Galf N,N-didecyl sulfenamide 8d, displayed anti-mycobacterial activity (MIC) of 1 microg/mL in a cell based assay against a representative strain of Mycobacterium smegmatis.
