The role of Aspergillus fumigatus 14alpha-sterol demethylase (Cyp51A) in azole drug susceptibility was assessed. Targeted disruption of cyp51A in azole-susceptible and -resistant strains decreased MICs from 2- to 40-fold. The cyp51A mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from the wild-type strain, retaining the ability to cause pulmonary disease in neutropenic mice.
