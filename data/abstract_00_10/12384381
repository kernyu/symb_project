Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined for 150 Haemophilus influenzae isolates obtained during population-based surveillance for meningitis in Salvador, Brazil. Ten (6.7%) isolates were resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Of these, two isolates, a beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producer, were resistant to amoxacillin-clavulinic acid. These findings indicate that present antibiotic regimens in Brazil may not be appropriate for the treatment of H. influenzae meningitis.
