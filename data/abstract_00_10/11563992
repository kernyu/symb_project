Standard eradication therapies against Helicobacter pylori appear to be effective in most cases, but in clinical practice a failure rate higher than the 5-10% reported in clinical trials is often observed. Among the various reasons responsible for therapeutic failure, antibiotic resistance is becoming a major issue in some countries. A range of different antibacterial agents is currently under investigation: several macrolides, new fluoroquinolones, furazolidone and rifabutin. Although not formally tested in refractory cases, azithromycin, spiromycin, levofloxacin and furazolidone represent the most promising antibacterial agents for possible inclusion in eradication regimens. Rifabutin has been evaluated in H. pylori infections resistant to standard therapies. Although very effective, the drug is expensive and its use should be restricted to the most difficult cases to avoid the development of rifabutin resistance in Mycobacterium spp.
