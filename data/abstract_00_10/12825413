Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2001 to March 2002 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, four hundred and twenty strains were isolated from 175 (79.2%) of 221 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and eighty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 234 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp., E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
