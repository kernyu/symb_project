A 269-kilobase conjugative plasmid, pK29, from a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain was sequenced. The plasmid harbors multiple antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding CMY-8 AmpC-type and CTX-M-3 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in the common backbone of IncHI2 plasmids. Mechanisms for dissemination of the resistance genes are highlighted in comparative genomic analyses.
