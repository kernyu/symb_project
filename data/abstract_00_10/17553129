BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant entrococci (VRE) are increasing in prevalence at many institutions, and are often reported in dialysis patients. The aim of this cross-sectional prevalence study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of VRE colonization in chronic hemodialysis patients in two hemodialysis centers in Shiraz, Iran. METHODS: Rectal swabs were obtained from all consenting patients and were streaked on the surface of Cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar (CAA) and incubated at 37 degrees C in air for 24 h. The vancomycin susceptibility of each isolate was confirmed by disk susceptibility testing. The MICs of vancomycin and teicoplanin were confirmed by the E test. To identify risk factors, a questionnaire was completed for all the studied patients and the data of VRE positive and negative groups were compared using Man-Withney U test for continues data and the Fisher exact test for categorical data. RESULTS: Of 146 patients investigated, 9 (6.2%) were positive for VRE. All VRE strains were genotypically distinguishable. Risk factors for a VRE-positive culture were "antimicrobial receipt within 2 months before culture" (P = 0.003) and "hospitalization during previous year" (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: VRE colonization is an under-recognized problem among chronic dialysis patients in Iran. VRE colonization is associated with antibiotic consumption and hospitalization.
