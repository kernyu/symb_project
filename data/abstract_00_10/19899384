Most important news are the reimbursement of post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV, change in treatment of gonococcal infections, increase of syphilis and sexually transmitted hepatitis C infections among HIV-infected men who have sex with men. Vaccination against papillomavirus (HPV) is not discussed here. Animal and human studies have shown that 28 days post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV initiated within 72 hours after the contact at risk could reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. This prophylaxis is now reimbursed in Belgium if it is prescribed by a HIV reference center, based on the Belgian consensus for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis. A single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone 125 mg is now the best choice for the treatment of gonococcal infection, due to the resistance more and more frequent to penicillin, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone. If a concomitant infection with Chlamydia trachomatis has not been ruled out, a single dose of azithromycin 1 g or doxycycline for 7 days will be added. Syphilis is shortly reviewed and addresses of few very useful Internet sites are given.
