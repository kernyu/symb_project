AIM: To investigate the occurrence of emerging macrocyclic lactone (ML) resistance and of resistance to benzimidazole anthelmintics on a number of sheep farms in the North Island of New Zealand. METHODS: On commercial sheep farms (n=30) in the Taihape district in the North Island of New Zealand, 30 animals were randomly allocated to one of two equal-sized groups and treated with either half of the recommended dose rate of ivermectin (half of 0.2 mg/kg), or with the full recommended dose rate of oxfendazole (4.5 mg/kg). The ivermectin treatment only was used on a further six properties. Faecal egg counts, accompanied by pooled larval cultures, were conducted on all samples at the time of treatment and 7-10 days later. RESULTS: Resistance, as indicated by a <95% faecal egg count reduction (FECR) in both instances, was found to oxfendazole on 13/30 (43%) farms and to a half dose of ivermectin on 12/36 (33%) properties. For oxfendazole, such resistance was found to involve all six nematode genera whereas for ivermectin it was almost entirely restricted to Ostertagia and Cooperia infections. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that emerging ML resistance may be more common on sheep farms in New Zealand than is generally realised. They also suggest that the half-dose ivermectin faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) may offer some very practical benefits for parasite control by providing early warning of developing resistance to ML drenches and by signalling the possible imminent failure of these at their therapeutic dose rates. The sensitivity and reliability of this procedure may be further enhanced by the inclusion of larval cultures.
