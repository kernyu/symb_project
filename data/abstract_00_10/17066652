BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance in common respiratory tract pathogens is a growing public health threat, especially in the southeastern United States. The excessive use of antibiotics for common infections is a major contributing factor in the emergence of antibiotic resistance. We report results from a multi-site outpatient pilot project in North Carolina to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for acute nonbacterial upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). METHODS: Primary care practices were provided education and symptom therapy kits for patients with URIs, as an alternative to antibiotics, in a project to reduce the overuse of antimicrobial therapy The feasibility of this approach was evaluated with interviews and surveys. A methodology for claims-based evaluation of intervention efficacy in reduction of antibiotics use was developed as part of this project. RESULTS: Of eight contacted practices, four agreed to participate and three participated fully. Physicians reported that symptom therapy kits were useful for patients with URIs and resulted in a meaningful change in antibiotic prescribing behaviors. A claims-based approach is a feasible and promising method to evaluate efficacy in subsequent post-pilot large-scale implementations. LIMITATIONS: Due to the small number of outpatient practices and the lack of controls in this pilot study, the efficacy of the intervention in reducing antibiotic use could not be determined. CONCLUSIONS: Education combined with symptom therapy kits as an alternative to oral antibiotics is a feasible intervention that warrants additional studies to evaluate the efficacy of this approach in the reduction of antibiotic use for URIs.
