Ceftibuten is an oral third-generation cephalosporin active against a wide range of bacteria and shows an improved stability to hydrolysis by several beta-lactamases because of the carboxyethilidine moiety at position 7 of the ss-acyl side chain. The kinetic interactions between ceftibuten and active-site serine and metallo-ss-lactamases were investigated. The activity of several TEM-derived extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESbetaLs) against ceftibuten, cefotaxime and ceftazidime was compared using K(m), K(cat) and K(cat)/K(m). Ceftibuten behaved as a poor substrate for class A and B beta-lactamases compared with cefotaxime. The chromosomal class C beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae 908R gave a high K(cat) value (21 s(-1)), whereas there was poor activity with enzymes from Acinetobacter baumannii and Morganella morganii and ceftibuten. Ceftibuten resists hydrolysis in the presence of typical respiratory or urogenital-tract pathogens producing beta-lactamases.
