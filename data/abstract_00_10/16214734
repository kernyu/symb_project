PURPOSE: To assess the clinical utility of genotypic resistance testing among HIV-1-infected patients with limited prior exposure to antiretroviral drugs. METHOD: Patients experiencing virological failure were randomly allocated to either centralized genotypic resistance testing or to no testing and were followed for a minimum of 1 year. RESULTS: 55 patients were recruited from 14 centers in the United Kingdom. There were no demonstrable differences between the groups in terms of virological or immunological response. For patients allocated to resistance testing, there was an increased tendency to recycle previously used drugs. CONCLUSION: The study did not demonstrate a benefit of genotypic resistance testing in this population, although statistical power was low. However, testing did alter prescribing behavior, and clinical effects may become manifest in the longer term.
