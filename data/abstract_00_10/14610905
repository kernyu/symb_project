Chronic viral hepatitis is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Here, we will briefly review common indications and current therapies for chronic hepatitis B and C and discuss practical aspects of these therapies. Current therapies for hepatitis C aim at viral eradication. With the introduction of pegylated interferon and ribavirin viral eradication is successful in about 55% of treated patients. The goal of therapy of HBe antigen positive chronic hepatitis B is seroconversion to anti-HBe which can be achieved with interferon alpha in 25-45% of patients. A loss of HBs can be achieved in approximately 10%. Responders proceed significantly less to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-HBe positive patients can be treated with interferon alpha or lamivudine. The former requires longer treatment and the results are disappointing. Lamivudine is a promising agent in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, but the success is hampered by a high relapse rate and the emergence of viral resistance.
