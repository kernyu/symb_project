The possibility of producing valued devices from low cost natural resources is a subject of broad interest. The present study explores the preparation and characterization of silk fibroin dense membranes using waste silk fibers from textile processing. Morphology, crystallinity, thermal resistance and cytotoxicity of membranes as well as the changes on the secondary structure of silk fibroin were analyzed after undergoing treatment with ethanol. Membranes presented amorphous patterns as determined via X-ray diffraction. The secondary structure of silk fibroin on dense membranes was either random coil (silk I) or beta-sheet (silk II), before and after ethanol treatment, respectively. The sterilized membranes presented no cytotoxicity to endothelial cells during in vitro assays. This fact stresses the material potential to be used in the fabrication of biomaterials, as coatings of cardiovascular devices and as membranes for wound dressing or drug delivery systems.
