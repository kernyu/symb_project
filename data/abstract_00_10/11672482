Antimicrobial-resistance in Gram-positive bacteria is reported with increasing frequency in strains isolated from food animals. Their isolation from commercial poultry carcasses and meat products constitute a potential risk that resistant strains or resistance genes might spread to humans via the food chain. As bacterial inactivation by thermal process is a critical control point in the safe preparation of many ready-to-eat foods, it is important to determine the thermal resistance of these organisms. The present study was undertaken to investigate the thermal tolerance (D and Z values) of antimicrobial-resistant, Gram-positive cocci in ground chicken meat. The antimicrobial-resistant, Gram-positive cocci for this study were isolated from two poultry processing plants in Western Australia. D and Z value data indicate that these isolates do not exhibit enhanced thermal resistant characteristics. The estimated lethal effect of the cooking process for chicken meat indicates that an internal temperature of 70 degrees C for 2.1 min would provide a 7-log reduction of all cell suspensions tested.
