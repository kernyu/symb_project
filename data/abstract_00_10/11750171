The spectrum and potency of ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin was compared to that of 10 other agents against urinary tract isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa among patients in the year 2000 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (Europe, Latin America, North America). Dramatic differences were observed between isolates in geographic areas with the most fluoroquinolone-resistant strains detected in Latin America (54.5% resistance) compared to resistance rates of 40.8-43.7% and 28.3-29.2% for Europe and North America, respectively. Overall, no significant differences were observed between the spectrums of these fluoroquinolones (37.1-38.8% resistance) for therapy of P. aeruginosa urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients. Generally, in this world wide sample, aminoglycosides, carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem), cefepime, and piperacillin with or without tazobactam possessed a wider range of activity and spectrum versus current P. aeruginosa clinical isolates.
