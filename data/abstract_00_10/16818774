Daxx has been shown to play an essential role in type I IFN-mediated suppression of B cell development and apoptosis. Recently, we demonstrated that Tyk2 is directly involved in IFN signaling for the induction and translocation of Daxx, which may result in growth arrest and/or apoptosis of B lymphocyte progenitors. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of how Daxx acts on growth suppression of B lymphocytes, we examined functions of a sumoylation-defective Daxx KA mutant (Daxx K630/631A), which substituted Lys 630 and Lys 631 to Ala. Importantly, Daxx KA localized in the cytoplasm, whereas wild-type Daxx localized in the nucleus. Murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 expressing Daxx KA revealed a resistance to the IFN-induced growth suppression. It is noteworthy that treatment with an exportin inhibitor, leptomycin B, resulted in nuclear localization of Daxx KA and recovery of the IFN-induced growth suppression in Ba/F3 cells. Moreover, Daxx KA decreased the binding potential to promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), and overexpression of PML recruited Daxx KA into PML oncogenic domains. Notably, a Daxx-small ubiquitin-related modifier fusion protein exhibited increased nuclear localization and ability to suppress cell growth in Ba/F3 cells. These results demonstrate that the IFN-induced growth suppression of B lymphocytes requires nuclear localization of Daxx through its sumoylation and proper interactions with PML.
