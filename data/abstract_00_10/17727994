Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) non-O157 serogroups are among the most important emerging food-borne pathogen groups. In particular, the O26 serogroup is able to cause a large spectrum of illnesses in humans which have a significant public health impact as they may range from haemorrhagic colitis (HC) to haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). It is known that VTEC organisms are associated with animal reservoirs, i.e. ruminants, and foods of animal origin, especially undercooked meat and raw milk, are often involved in outbreaks. In this study, 250 minced beef samples collected at retail outlets in southern Italy were tested for the presence of E. coli O26 and the isolates were characterized and studied for their antimicrobial resistance properties. Three minced beef samples (1.2%) tested positive for E. coli O26; one isolate per positive sample was characterized. One isolate harboured the genes encoding for virulence factors intimin (eaeA) and enterohaemolysin (hlyA), while none presented verocytotoxin-encoding genes (stx1 and stx2) and all were negative at the verotoxicity assay. All the isolates showed resistance properties to at least four antimicrobial agents tested and two were multi-drug resistant (MDR). Although no verocytotoxin-encoding genes were found in the isolates, the presence of potentially pathogenic E. coli O26 strains in minced beef points to the need for proper hygiene during meat production to reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses and transmission of MDR organisms via foods to humans. This paper is the first report on the presence and characterization of E. coli O26 in minced beef marketed in Italy.
