A new cycloartane, monocarpinine (1), incorporating a fused tetrahydrofuranyl ring, and a cytotoxic tetracyclic lactam, monomarginine (2), were isolated from a stem bark extract of the Malayan species Monocarpia marginalis. The structures of these compounds were determined using NMR and MS analysis. Monomarginine (2) showed appreciable cytotoxicity toward human KB (both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant) and Jurkat cells.
