BACKGROUND: Lack of progress in developing new antimicrobials, particularly new classes, as opposed to variants of existing agents, has contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. METHODS: Data synthesis after review of pertinent English-language literature. RESULTS: The development of new classes of antimicrobial agents is crucial, considering the increasing prevalence of nosocomial pathogens resistant to empiric as well as second- and third-line antibiotic choices. Tigecycline has recently been approved for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure as well as intra-abdominal infections. Published data on the in vitro and in vivo properties of tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, are reviewed. CONCLUSION: It is plausible that tigecycline could to some extent replace available broadspectrum agents for approved indications and thereby reduce the selective pressure for some currently prevalent multi-resistant pathogens in the hospital setting.
