Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy is described for rapid identification of clinically relevant methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that targets mecA and coagulase genes. In this study, 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates were used that included 40 isolates of MRSA, 55 isolates of methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 44 isolates of methicillin susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (MS-CoNS) and 11 isolates of methicillin resistant coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (MR-CoNS). Out of 55 S. aureus strains, three strains demonstrated mecA gene, which appeared to be oxacillin sensitive by disc diffusion. When (MS-CoNS) were evaluated, 10 isolates classified as oxacillin sensitive phenotypically, yielded positive results in PCR method. The results for mecA detection by PCR were more consistent with disk susceptibility tests in case of MRSA (100%) and MSSA (95%) isolates. In contrast to above results with MRSA and MSSA, mecA detection by PCR in MS-CoNS showed less correlation with disk susceptibility tests (77%). The results for coag detection by PCR were consistent with phenotypic tests in all isolates.
