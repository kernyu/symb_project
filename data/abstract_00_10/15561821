Enterobacter aerogenes clinical isolate LOR was resistant to penicillins and ceftazidime but susceptible to cefuroxime, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefepime. PCR and cloning experiments from this strain identified a novel TEM-type beta-lactamase (TEM-121) differing by five amino acid substitutions from beta-lactamase TEM-2 (Glu104Lys, Arg164Ser, Ala237Thr, Glu240Lys, and Arg244Ser) and by only one amino acid change from the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) TEM-24 (Arg244Ser), with the last substitution also being identified in the inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamase IRT-2. Kinetic parameters indicated that TEM-121 hydrolyzed ceftazidime and aztreonam (like TEM-24) and was inhibited weakly by clavulanic acid and strongly by tazobactam. Thus, TEM-121 is a novel complex mutant TEM beta-lactamase (CMT-4) combining the kinetic properties of an ESBL and an inhibitor-resistant TEM enzyme.
