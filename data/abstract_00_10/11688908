Neonatal Citrobacter koseri (diversus) meningitis is often complicated by the formation of brain abscesses and has a poor neurological outcome with seizures, mental retardation and paresis as sequelae in 50% of the cases. As there is emerging resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin and third-generation cephalosporins, we attempted to treat this infection with carbapenems. Carbapenems in combination with cefotaxime and surgical drainage may play an important role in treating C. koseri meningitis.
