The etiologies and forms of congenital neuropathic bladder are described: contractile (25%), acontractile (15%), and intermediate (60%). The terminology relating to neuropathic bladder is defined and the principles of bladder management are highlighted: (1) must achieve a bladder that can fill at low pressure, (2) must achieve a bladder that can store urine at low pressure, (3) must achieve sphincter resistance that is sufficient to allow urine storage, and (4) must put in place a mechanism of achieving complete voluntary bladder emptying. The approach to investigation is set out in a logical sequence, and the methods of achieving the goals highlighted above are described. All of this is put in the context of managing the handicapped patient as a whole. It also is stressed that the aim is not just to achieve continence but perhaps even more importantly to protect renal function.
