The occurrence and phenotypic, and genotypic properties of 24 Staphylococcus isolates from canine dermatitis were investigated. The predominant staphylococcal species was Staphylococcus intermedius. The other species such as Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus capitis were only occasionally isolated. The study showed low level biochemical diversity among S. intermedius isolates. Resistance to antibiotics was frequently observed, with 87.5% of the isolates showing resistance to at least one drug. The most active antimicrobial agents against all staphylococci were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalexin and gentamicin. Resistance to carbenicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cephadroxil, erythromycin, clinadmaycin and neomycin was common. No correlation was observed between antibiotic resistance and plasmid profile. PFGE analysis revealed a high degree of genetic polymorphism of S. intermedius, even among isolates collected in a restricted area over a short time.
