A study was conducted to determine the nature and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens in Mauritius in order to provide guidance on the empirical treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The study was based on urine samples sent for bacteriological investigation at the Central Health Laboratory from unhospitalized patients over a 3-month period. Information on organisms isolated in pure growth and their antibiotic susceptibility was collected and analyzed. Entero - bacteriaceae accounted for over 80% of the 260 isolates obtained during the study period, and showed high rates of resistance to ampicillin (80%), co-trimoxazole (50%), nalidixic acid (34%) and ciprofloxacin (26%). Resistance to mecillinam and fosfomycin were only 2% and 0% respectively. The high rate of antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in urine is cause for concern. Fluoroquinolones may not be very reliable for empirical treatment of urinary tract infections in Mauritius. Alternatives such as pivmecillinam and fosfomycin should be considered.
