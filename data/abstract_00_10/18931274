In hepatitis B virus (HBV) monoinfection, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are linearly correlated with HBV DNA levels and lamivudine resistance. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV co-infection, little is known about the association between ALT, HBV DNA, and lamivudine resistance. We assessed HBV DNA, lamivudine resistance and ALT levels in 45 time points in 11 patients with HIV/HBV co-infection during lamivudine-containing antiretroviral therapy. High HBV DNA levels (>10(6) copies/mL) and lamivudine resistance developed in 45% and 91% of patients, respectively. However, ALT levels were not elevated in the setting of high HBV DNA levels (mean ALT, 48 IU/mL) or lamivudine resistance (mean ALT, 44 IU/mL). HBV viraemia and lamivudine resistance during extended lamivudine-containing antiretroviral therapy are common in HIV/HBV co-infection, occurring in the absence of significant ALT elevations. In HIV/HBV co-infection, measurement of HBV DNA and HBV resistance mutations may identify HBV virological failure before biochemical changes and should be routinely used in the management of HIV/HBV co-infection.
