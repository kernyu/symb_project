PURPOSE: The development, activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage and administration of daptomycin are reviewed. SUMMARY: Daptomycin, a novel cyclic lipopeptide antimicrobial, is bactericidal against a range of gram-positive bacteria, including many multiple-drug-resistant isolates. It has only minimal activity against anaerobic bacteria and no activity against gram-negative bacteria. Daptomycin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, and the plasma concentration-versus-time relationship is best described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination. The initial bactericidal activity is rapid, extensive, and concentration related. In clinical trials, daptomycin has shown efficacy in treating complicated skin and skin-structure infections (CSSSIs); the drug carries FDA-approved labeling for same. The adverse effects of daptomycin appear comparable to those of vancomycin and semisynthetic penicillins. The dosage for CSSSIs is 4 mg/kg by i.v. infusion every 24 hours. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin is bactericidal against gram-positive organisms and offers an option in the treatment of CSSSIs.
