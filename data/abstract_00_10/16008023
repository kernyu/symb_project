Infections account for the second leading cause of mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease. Many of these infections are due to sepsis, primarily arising from the vascular access site. Septicemia alone accounts for almost 11% of mortality in hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis patients are also a sentinel population for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, especially with regards to gram-positive cocci (vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (VISA), and vancomycin resistant S. aureus [VRSA]). It is extremely important to follow infection control recommendations designed to prevent these types of adverse events from occurring in the hemodialysis population. The campaign to prevent antimicrobial resistance in dialysis includes four strategies: Prevent infection; diagnose and treat infection; use antimicrobials wisely; and prevent transmission. In addition, efforts to prevent infection should include avoiding use of hemodialysis catheters, whenever possible, and meticulous care of hemodialysis catheters and other vascular access sites. These efforts would improve patient outcomes and quality-of-life issues by reducing hospitalizations and mortality due to infection and vascular access complications.
