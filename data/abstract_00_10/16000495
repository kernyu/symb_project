CTX-M-14-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was first detected in Salmonella enterica serovar London strains which were isolated from three hospitalized pediatric patients with gastroenteritis. The isolates had pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns identical to those of the previously isolated antimicrobial-susceptible strains from community-acquired gastroenteritis, suggesting the susceptible clone acquired the resistance.
