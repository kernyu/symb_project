We compare epidemiological data from two twelve-month periods, before and after the introduction of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines at Carlo Poma hospital in Mantova, Italy, in June 2003. Considering the results from the microbiology laboratory and the data from the pharmacy, concerning the consumption of some antimicrobials, we noted a significant decrease in the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in surgical wards, where the incidence of MRSA had previously exceeded that in medical wards. At the same time, analysis of antibiotic consumption revealed a considerable decrease in third and fourth-generation cephalosporins and an increasing use of cephazolin, in compliance with prophylaxis protocol rules. This trend was confirmed by analysis of the same data regarding the first six months of 2006.
