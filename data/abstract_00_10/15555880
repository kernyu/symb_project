MIC distribution and susceptibility to four antimicrobial agents were determined by E-test for 94 Helicobacter pylori isolates from Costa Rica. Disk diffusion was evaluated as an alternative method to determine susceptibility and compared with the E-test results by linear regression analysis and an error-rate bounded method. Thirty-eight (40.4%) of the isolates were resistant to metronidazole, 5.3% to clarithromycin and 5.3% to amoxicillin. No isolate was resistant to tetracycline. Multiple resistance was found in 4.3% of the isolates. H. pylori isolates were categorised as resistant to amoxicillin, clarithromycin and tetracycline when inhibition diameters were less than 25, 21 and 25 mm, respectively, in the disk diffusion assay. A breakpoint diameter for metronidazole with disk diffusion could not be firmly established.
