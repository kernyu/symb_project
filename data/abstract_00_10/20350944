Eumycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis is treated surgically and with high doses of ketoconazole. Therapeutic responses are poor, and recurrent infections are common. In search of therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of mycetoma, we determined the in vitro susceptibilities of M. mycetomatis isolates against caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin. As a comparator fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus was used. Minimal effective concentrations (MECs) and MICs were assessed and compared to those of ketoconazole. M. mycetomatis isolates were not susceptible to the echinocandins.
