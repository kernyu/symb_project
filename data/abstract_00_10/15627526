The antimicrobial susceptibility of 151 clinical Streptococcus suis strains isolated from diseased pigs in Spain was determined by a microdilution method. Isolates were mostly susceptible to beta-lactam antimicrobials, aminoglycosides, enrofloxacin, novobiocin and spectinomycin. More than 87% of the S. suis isolates were resistant to tetracyclines, sulphonamides, macrolides and clindamycin. Strains of serotype 9 were significantly more resistant than strains of serotype 2 (P<0.05) to tylosin (94% versus 77%) and clindamycin (94% versus 64%). Eighty-seven percent of the S. suis isolates were resistant to at least four antimicrobials and nine isolates (6%) were resistant to at least six antimicrobials. The most frequently identified multidrug pattern involved resistance against tetracyclines, sulphonamides, macrolides and lincosamides, with 69% of the isolates exhibiting this resistotype. Fifteen out of the 22 strains of serotype 2 (68.2%), and 84 out of the 98 of the strains of serotype 9 (85.7%) exhibited this resistotype, indicating its widespread distribution among the strains of the two most frequently isolated serotypes.
