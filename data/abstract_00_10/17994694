Phenolic compounds are ubiquitous in plant foods, and they have been reported to have multiple biological effects. This study investigates the ability of derivatives of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids to influence the development of ciprofloxacin resistance in the antibiotic-sensitive strain Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. We have found that cinnamic acid and its hydroxy derivatives increase the frequency of mutations leading to ciprofloxacin resistance in comparison with spontaneous mutagenesis. Derivatives of hydroxybenzoic acid showed no or very little effect. Interestingly, gallic acid caused only phenotype resistance but not arising of mutant strains. Vanillic acid decreased spontaneous mutation frequency, leading to resistance not only to ciprofloxacin but also to tetracycline and gentamicin, and also decreased mutation frequency induced by 3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylic acid, sodium azide, and hydrogen peroxide leading to ciprofloxacin resistance.
