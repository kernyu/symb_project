Today there are recognized global "hot spots" that are areas in which nontyphoid Salmonella serotypes have been reported to have a high prevalence of quinolone resistance. There is concern that resistant strains can be disseminated from these localized geographical areas by travelers or via commercial food products. The objective of this article is to report a high frequency of reduced susceptibility to first- and second-generation quinolones among nontyphoid Salmonella isolates from poultry at slaughter in two processing plants belonging to the largest poultry integration companies in Zulia State, Venezuela. Nearly all (74 of 77; 96.1%) of the isolated strains were resistant to nalidixic acid, and 3.7% were resistant to ciprofloxacin; most (45 of 77; 58%) exhibited reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin (15 of 77; 19.5%). In contrast, all of the isolates were susceptible to beta-lactamic antimicrobial drugs. Ninety-three percent (72 of 77) of the isolates were either Salmonella Parathyphi B or Salmonella Heidelberg, which have been reported as invasive Salmonella. The predominant serotypes in each slaughter plant showed different antimicrobial susceptibilities, only having in common their high resistance to nalidixic acid, suggesting that different clones disseminated in each commercial integration. The detection of high frequency of reduced susceptibility to first- and second-generation quinolones among nontyphoid Salmonella isolates from fresh poultry during processing is noteworthy. Resistance to quinolone drugs will not only make antimicrobial therapy more complicated if foodborne disease results, but also these quinolone-resistant strains can disseminate from this local hot spot to other geographical areas, spreading the resistance against this important antimicrobial drug.
