Trichosporon asahii (Trichosporon beigelii) infections are rare but have been associated with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from superficial involvement in immunocompetent individuals to severe systemic disease in immunocompromised patients. We report on the recent recovery of T. asahii isolates with reduced susceptibility in vitro to amphotericin B (AMB), flucytosine, and azoles from six nongranulocytopenic patients who exhibited risk factors and who developed either superficial infections (four individuals) or invasive infections (two individuals) while in intensive care units. The latter two patients responded clinically and microbiologically to AMB treatment. All six isolates were closely related according to random amplified polymorphic DNA studies and showed 71% similarity by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis, suggesting a common nosocomial origin. We also review the literature pertaining to T. asahii infections and discuss the salient characteristics of this fungus and recent taxonomic proposals for the genus.
