Nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome (TSS) due to Staphylococcus aureus can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. While drotrecogin alfa (DA) has been employed in patients with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) severe sepsis and septic shock, its utility in TSS remains unclear. The authors report a case of severe sepsis in the setting of MRSA-associated TSS that responded to treatment with DA. This case illustrates a potential role for DA in the treatment of toxic shock syndromes and emphasizes the importance of aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic modalities in approaching these conditions.
