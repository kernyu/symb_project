The aim of the study was to compare the resistance patterns of Escherichia coli isolates from pig herds with or without prophylactic use of anti-microbial substances. The presented pig units received either antibiotics or oregano as preventive feed additives. The trial was performed from April to October 2001, in the large 'country-corner', Hungary-Rumania-Serbia. Thirty of 39 evaluated herds suffered E. coli O139 K88 ac or ad LT STb caused losses, the remaining were negative for E. coli O139. Thirteen of the selected 30 herds produced with oregano feed supplementation (Oregpig Pecs, Hungary) antibiotic-free pigs. These units had no history of prophylactic antibiotic use since 1995. The remaining 17 herds routinely used prophylactic antibiotic feed supplementation. In each herd, pigs of four different age groups (suckling piglets, weaners. fattening swine and breeding sows), showing the clinical symptoms of wasting, were investigated. E. coli O139 K88 ac or ad LT STb were tested for their resistance to antibiotics, available in this region. Oregano-fed herds demonstrated high significantly (P < 0.001) lower MICs (microg/ml) for ampicillin, doxycyclin, enrofloxacin, gentamycin, oxytetracyclin and sulfamethacin compared to herds with prophylactic use of antibiotics. Resistance to ceftiofur revealed significant (P < 0.05) differences between the antibiotic- or oregano-treated units. The present results confirm literature data, that prophylactic use of antibiotics likely plays a role in inducing resistance of E. coli and other intestinal bacteria. Thus, imposing greater restrictions on antibiotic use in animal agriculture is likely to reduce but not eliminate the occurrence of resistant isolates.
