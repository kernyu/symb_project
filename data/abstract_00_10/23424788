Ninety strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis and respiratory infections at "William Soler" pediatric hospital were studied in the period from February to August, 2001, as part of a joint research project of the two hospitals. In vitro susceptibility of these strains to 10 antimicrobials, that is, azlocylline, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacine, ofloxacine, chloranphenicol and trimethroprim/sulfamet-hoxazole was studied by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion. The reference strain was ATCC 27853. The research work results showed that antimicrobial susceptibility values were within the allowable limits. Increased resistance to chloranphenicol (87.03%) and trimethoprim/sulfametoxazole (92.28%) as well as high sensitivity to azlocylline (85%), ceftazidime (87.09%), gentamicyn (94.09%), ciprofloxacine (94.8%) and ofloxacine (92.5%) were observed.
