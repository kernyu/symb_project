We review the current state of knowledge about the genetic and biochemical mechanisms that mediate quinolone resistance in Salmonella. They include modifications of topoisomerase targets, increased efflux activity and the recently described topoisomerase protection by the plasmid-encoded Qnr protein. We discuss what factors may determine the order of implementation of these various mechanisms in a particular strain, and what strategies could be used to combat resistance, from the inhibition of mutagenesis mechanisms to counteracting, during fluoroquinolone treatment, of resistance mechanisms already set in the infecting strain.
