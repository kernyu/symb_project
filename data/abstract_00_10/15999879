BACKGROUND: Worldwide, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates have increased dramatically during the last decades. Sodium benzoate (SB) is a chemical substance that is used for preparing food and drinks and in the treatment of some metabolic (urea cycle disorders and hepatic coma) diseases. No studies were found which focussed on the effects of SB in MRSA infections. The aim was to determine in vitro activity of sodium benzoate against MRSA clinical isolates. METHODS: In this study, MIC for SB in 36 MRSA and 29 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates were determined by a broth microdilution method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: The MIC at which all of the MRSA and MSSA strains were inhibited was at 32 microg/ml and higher concentrations. CONCLUSION: Sodium benzoate showed good in vitro activity against clinically relevant MRSA and MSSA isolates. It is suggested in this study that this cheap substance, which has been used for systemic and local treatment of infection in humans, may be used alternatively for the treatment of MRSA infections. However, it is clear that more comprehensive and in vivo studies are needed to further elucidate the activity of SB against MRSA infections.
