Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe disease with a high mortality despite intensive therapy. Three cases of S. aureus IE had a rapidly progressive fatal clinical course despite intensive antimicrobial therapy. One case was methicillin-sensitive S. aureus IE, which formed rapidly growing a huge vegetation on a prosthetic mitral valve, complicated with multiple systemic emboli. The other 2 cases were methicillin-resistant S. aureus IE without any predisposing heart disease.
