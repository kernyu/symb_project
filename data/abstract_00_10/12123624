We carried out a multicentre community-based study in order to describe the antibiotic therapeutic approach of paediatricians from two different areas of Italy in the treatment of respiratory tract infection (RTIs), and to assess which factors are involved in a possible variability of prescribing habits. Forty paediatricians participated in the study between October 1998 and April 1999. They had to complete a questionnaire for each therapeutic intervention resulting in an antibiotic prescription. A logistic regression model was used to identify possible predictors in choosing parenteral antibiotics for the treatment of RTIs. In 2 975 questionnaires of antibiotic treatment, RTIs represented 90.2% of the total antibiotics used. Upper respiratory tract infections were the most commonly treated diagnostic group (59.6%), followed by lower respiratory tract infections (20.4%), and middle ear infections (19.8%). Statistically significant differences between northern and southern Italy were reported in the antibiotic prescription profile and the duration of the therapy. Another marked difference was reported in the frequency of laboratory analysis requests. The logistic regression model indicated that the use of parenteral antibiotics appears significantly related to the type of infections [lower RTIs: (OR: 3.99; 95% CI: 2.49-6.37)], the geographic location [northern Italy: (OR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.20-0.39)], and the presence of concurrent diseases (OR: 3.21; 95% CI: 1.46-7.02). The lack of adherence to clinical guidelines and the marked variability of antibiotic prescription rates between different areas of the country appear to be related to factors other than bacterial resistance, and highlight the importance of carrying out educational programmes targeted at the national level for improving the antibiotic prescription habits for the treatment of RTIs.
