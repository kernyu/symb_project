Resistance among gram-negative organisms has greatly complicated the care of the septic patient. An understanding of the likely source of infection, the epidemiologic risk of the patient being exposed to an antibiotic-resistant organism, and the specific vulnerabilities of the host are essential to the proper selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. In this report, we discuss the epidemiology, antibiotic resistance mechanisms, microbiology, treatment strategies, and diagnostic and therapeutic innovations in the approach to the septic patient.
