The evolutionarily conserved Dim1 proteins belong to the TRX fold superfamily. An EST showing high identity values with genes coding for Dim1 proteins was selected from an EST library collection of Trichoderma virens T59. Here, we report the cloning, characterization, and functional analysis of a T. virens T59 TvDim1 gene. The TvDim1 gene, with a sequence size of 614 bp, was PCR-amplified and found to contain three introns. The TvDim1 gene was present as a single copy in the T. virens genome and was also present in another five Trichoderma strains investigated. Increased levels of expression and redox-activity were detected when the fungus was grown in the presence of H(2)O(2). The overexpression and silencing of TvDim1 in T. harzianum T34 gave rise to transformants, with higher and lower growth, redox-activity, and quantities of biomass, respectively, than the wild-type strain after culture under oxidative stress.
