Community-associated methicillin-resistant (CA-MRSA) infections occur in children throughout the United States and worldwide. The most common are skin and soft tissue infections. However, life-threatening invasive disease and death can occur as a result of CA-MRSA. The rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance associated with CA-MRSA further complicates antibiotic treatment therapy. This clinical paper elucidates the recent evolution in the epidemiology of CA-MRSA in otherwise healthy children within the community, and the rising antimicrobial resistance of this virulent pathogen. Furthermore, it will focus on the importance of timely diagnosis, treatment, and management of the most common presenting pediatric infections seen in the outpatient setting. The current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clinical management strategies identify the optimal prevention and treatment approach to be used by pediatric primary care providers.
