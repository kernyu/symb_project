In the scenario of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria combination therapy represents an effective approach. Artemisinin and its derivatives are of special interest because they represent the most effective group of compounds against multidrug-resistant malaria with a rapid onset of action and a short half-life. Interactions of artemisinin with amodiaquine, pyronaridine, and chloroquine were therefore investigated against three strains of P. falciparum using a 48-h in vitro culture assay. Two of the strains were chloroquine sensitive and one was partially chloroquine resistant. Observed effective concentrations (O) of the combined compounds at different concentration ratios were calculated for different degrees of inhibition (EC50, EC90, EC99) and compared to expected calculated effective concentrations (E) using a probit method. Synergism with mean O/E EC90 values of 0.25 and 0.8 were found with the combination of artemisinin and the two Mannich bases, amodiaquine and pyronaridine, respectively, whereas chloroquine showed addition with a mean value of 1.2. Although both amodiaquine and chloroquine are 4-aminoquinolines, their interaction with artemisinin appears to be different. The combination of artemisinin with amodiaquine represents an important option for the treatment of falciparum malaria.
