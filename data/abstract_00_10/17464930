This study reports an investigation of outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and colonization involving 17 newborns in the neonatal unit of a teaching hospital. A neonatal specialist colonized with MRSA that eventually became mupirocin-resistant was implicated as a recurrent source of transmission of MRSA to newborns.
