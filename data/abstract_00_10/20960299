Over 170 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of liver diseases. Current interferon-based therapy is of limited efficacy and has significant side effects and more effective and better tolerated therapies are urgently needed. HCV is a positive, single-stranded RNA virus with a 9.6 kb genome that encodes ten viral proteins. Among them, the NS3 protease and the NS5B polymerase are essential for viral replication and have been the main focus of drug discovery efforts. Aided by structure-based drug design, potent and specific inhibitors of NS3 and NS5B have been identified, some of which are in late stage clinical trials and may significantly improve current HCV treatment. Inhibitors of other viral targets such as NS5A are also being pursued. However, HCV is an RNA virus characterized by high replication and mutation rates and consequently, resistance emerges quickly in patients treated with specific antivirals as monotherapy. A complementary approach is to target host factors such as cyclophilins that are also essential for viral replication and may present a higher genetic barrier to resistance. Combinations of these inhibitors of different mechanism are likely to become the essential components of future HCV therapies in order to maximize antiviral efficacy and prevent the emergence of resistance.
