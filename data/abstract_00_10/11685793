Despite improvements in the therapies for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) over the past several years, many patients still fail to become hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) undetectable during treatment and are classified as nonresponders. Providing treatment recommendations for these patients requires that the likelihood of achieving any benefit from another course of therapy be balanced with the natural history of chronic HCV. The management of nonresponders represents the most challenging of all aspects in the care of patients with chronic HCV. Retreatment of interferon non-responders with interferon and ribavirin has yielded a long-term virologic benefit in only 10% to 25% of patients. The efficacy of peginterferon and peginterferon with ribavirin for nonresponders has yet to be defined.
