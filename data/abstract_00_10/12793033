In the Netherlands, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are regularly isolated from humans. We present the first isolation of MRSA from animal origin in the Netherlands. A coagulase positive staphylococcus was cultured from an infected wound in a Dutch dog that recently underwent surgery abroad. The staphylococcus was resistant to methicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cephalexin, erythromycin, lincomycin, tetracycline, gentamicin and enrofloxacin. It was identified as S. aureus by fermentation of mannitol and Martineau-PCR. The presence of mecA was confirmed by PCR.
