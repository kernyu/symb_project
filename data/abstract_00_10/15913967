In the current study, we found that the stress stimulus can act as a kind of elicitor, which can efficiently induce the resistance of cucumber against fungal pathogen. After the treatment of the stress stimulus on leaves, the activities of resistance-related enzymes were increased significantly. Such as phenylamine ammonia lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POD) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO), which are strongly associated with the plant disease resistance. Also the expression of pathogenesis-related protein (PR protein) were activated by stress stimulus, with the results that the activities of chitinase and beta-l,3-glucanase were increased obviously. The data showed that one of the mechanism of stress stimulus induction plant resistance may act via eliciting the metabolism related disease resistance within plant, which can produce many suppressing and antimicrobial compounds to against pathogens infection efficiently.
