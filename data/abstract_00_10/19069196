The efficiency of treatment using the routine (I) versus IIB regime was evaluated in 161 new HIV-negative cases of destructive tuberculosis within the first 3 months of chemotherapy. The IIB regimen used in the intensive phase of chemotherapy in new tuberculosis cases before obtaining data on the drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis significantly enhance the efficiency of treatment in eliminating bacterial excretion and destructive resolution in the lung. The IIB regimen used in new tuberculosis cases with primary multidrug resistance allowed bacterial excretion to be stopped in 80% by month 3 of therapy whereas this index in the similar patients treated by the I regimen was as high as 25%. Decay cavities could be also resolved significantly more frequently by month 6 of therapy in the group of patients treated by the IIB regimen in 59% versus 29% of the patients treated by the I regimen. The inclusion of fluoroquinolones into chemotherapy caused no increase in the incidence of undesirable adverse reactions.
