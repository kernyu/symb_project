To assess antibiotic susceptibility among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in urine from outpatients in Dakar, Senegal, a prospective multicenter study involving 3 laboratories had been conducted between June and October 2001. During this period, 300 strains were isolated and susceptibility testing was performed against antibiotics commonly used in treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI). E. coli and K. pneumoniae represented 89% of isolates. The overall resistance rates of ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, nalidixic acid, fluoroquinolones and cotrimoxazole were respectively 77.3%, 34.7%, 14.7%, 13.3%, and 55%. In the light of these results, a re-evaluation of first line therapies and prudent use of fluoroquinolones is advised. At the same time a continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance should be developed in Senegal in order to control the emergence of multidrug resistant strains and to establish a national therapeutic guideline for treatment of UTI.
