Hygromycin B is an aminoglycoside antibiotic active against prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomal alterations in bacteria conferring resistance to hygromycin B have not been described, prompting us to use a single rRNA allelic derivative of the gram-positive bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis for investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in ribosomal resistance to hygromycin B in eubacteria. Resistance mutations were found to localize exclusively in 16S rRNA. The mutations observed, i.e., 16S rRNA U1406C, C1496U, and U1498C (E. coli numbering), are in close proximity to the hygromycin B binding site located in conserved helix 44 of 16S rRNA. The 16S rRNA positions involved in hygromycin B resistance are highly conserved in all three domains of life, explaining the lack of specificity and general toxicity of hygromycin B.
