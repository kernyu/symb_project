OBJECTIVE: Regular colchicine treatment cannot control the typical febrile attacks of FMF in about 5-10% of the compliant patients. Here we report the effect of thalidomide and etanercept in 5 colchicine-resistant cases. METHODS: Five (4M/ 1F) FMF patients between April 2005 and March 2006, who were experiencing at least 2 attacks per month, despite regular colchicine were included to the study. Four male patients were given thalidomide 100 mg/d initially. Two of these patients unresponsive to thalidomide were prescribed subcutaneous injections of etanercept 25 mg, twice a week. The female patient received etanercept as the first choice due to potential side effects. She then had to be converted to thalidomide due to a severe injection site reaction. RESULTS: The median follow up period with thalidomide and etanercept was 8 months. Both thalidomide and etanercept lowered the number of the abdominal attacks. CONCLUSION: Thalidomide and etanercept might be effective as additional treatment in colchicine-resistant cases of FMF.
