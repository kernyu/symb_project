Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a rarely reported cause of necrotizing fasciitis. We report an unusually severe case of MRSA necrotizing fasciitis in a previously undiagnosed AIDS patient. Molecular analysis revealed that the strain had the USA300/spa1 genotype, now an abundant cause of community-acquired MRSA infection.
