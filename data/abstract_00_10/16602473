A prospective study investigated the epidemiology of malaria in an agricultural area in eastern Sudan from November 1999 to June 2000 (1 irrigation and 1 dry season). In monthly parasite surveys, 99/ 1539 blood films from 190 individuals were positive for malaria: 95% for Plasmodium falciparum, 3% P. vivax and 2% P. ovale. The slide positive rate (SPR) of malaria episodes ranged from 3.7% to 12.8% in different months of the survey, with a peak in January. There was no significant difference in SPR between irrigation and dry seasons (7.2% versus 5.1%). SPR differed significantly by age group and was highest in under 5-year-olds. However, there was no significant difference in SPR between males and females. Transmission and intensity of malaria in this area is perennial and moderate rather than low.
