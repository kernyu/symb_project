BACKGROUND: Multiresistant bacteria have become an important problem in prosthetic joint infections. Their frequent resistance against gentamicin, which is commonly used in antibiotic-loaded bone cements, makes a new prophylaxis necessary. METHODS: PMMA-cement was loaded with 1% nanoparticulate silver and its antibacterial activity tested in vitro against gentamicin-resistant MRSE and MRSA strains as well as being compared to the activity of plain and gentamicin-loaded bone cements. A quantitative elution testing was also done to study the potentially cytotoxic effects of NanoSilver cement. RESULTS: Unloaded and PMMA-cement loaded with 2% gentamicin did not exhibit any antibacterial activity against MRSE and MRSA. At 1%, NanoSilver cement completely inhibited the proliferation of MRSA and MRSE. NanoSilver bone cement did not show any significant differences compared to the non-toxic control group. CONCLUSIONS: If these promising in vitro results can be confirmed in vivo, NanoSilver bone cement may be of considerable value in total joint arthroplasty.
