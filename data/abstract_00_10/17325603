OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in metabolic parameters and body composition among 422 antiretroviral-naive patients randomized to 3 antiretroviral therapy (ART) strategies: protease inhibitor (PI; n = 141)-, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI; n = 141)-, or PI + NNRTI (n = 140)-based strategies with a median follow-up of 5 years. METHODS: At baseline and 1-month (metabolic parameters only) and 4-month follow-up intervals, fat-free mass (FFM) and total body fat were calculated, anthropometric measurements were performed, and fasting metabolic parameters were obtained. Rates of change and mean change were compared. RESULTS: The PI + NNRTI strategy resulted in greater increases in triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with the PI and the NNRTI strategies (P < 0.005), with no differences between the PI and NNRTI strategies. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly more in the NNRTI strategy than in the PI strategy (P < 0.005). Insulin and insulin resistance increased similarly with all 3 strategies. Changes in total and regional body composition (loss of subcutaneous tissue area and gains in FFM, nonsubcutaneous tissue area, and visceral tissue area) were observed but did not differ by strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of participants initiating 3 ART strategies demonstrated similar changes in total and regional fat, with no differences by ART strategy. The differential effects on lipid metabolism by strategy and the overall increases in insulin and insulin resistance with all 3 strategies necessitate close monitoring of patients on ART.
