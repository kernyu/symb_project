A study was performed to determine the frequency of the mutant MDR1 allele associated with ivermectin sensitivity in a sample of collies living in France. Buccal swab samples were collected from approximately 83 collies for determination of MDR1 genotype. DNA was extracted and the polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify a 148 bp (wildtype MDR1 genotype) or 144 bp (mutant MDR1 genotype) amplicon containing the MDR1 mutation. Sequence analysis was performed to determine the genotype of each dog. Adequate quantities of DNA for unequivocal genotyping were obtained from only 25 of 83 swabs. Twenty percent (5/25) of the collies studied were homozygous for the normal allele (normal), 32% (8/25) were heterozygous (carrier), and 48% (12/25) were homozygous for the mutant allele (affected). The results of this study indicate that a high percentage of collies presenting to veterinarians in France harbor the MDR1 mutation, thus impacting some therapeutic decisions.
