The detection of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (SA) (MRSA) refractory to glycopeptides is a serious clinical issue. The prevalence of hetero-resistant GISA (hGISA) strains at H. Marechal Joffre, France is reported.858 non-repeat SA were isolated during 1999. 367 (43%) of these, from 257 patients, were MRSA (mean incidence 11.9/1000 admissions). All MSRA detected during 1999 were screened for vancomycin (VAN) resistance (BHI+4 mg/l VAN). Isolates recovered were retested using Etest strips (2 McFarland inoculum on BHI) and population analysis profile/area under the curve (PAP-AUC) analysis with hGISA SA Mu3 as a comparator. 58 selected strains were screened for teicoplanin resistance(TEI) using SFM recommended screen (2 McFarland inoculum on MH+5 mg/L TEI) and MIC (0.5 MF inoculum swabbed on MH agar) methods. 188 (51.3%) grew on VAN screen agar (6.1/1000 admissions). 58 strains (7.6%) possessed Etest VAN MIC > 8 mg/l all others being VAN < 8 mg/l. Of these 58 isolates, 10 were stably heterogeneously resistant to both VAN and teicoplanin (MIC > 8 mg/l). PAP-AUC showed 12 strains to have PAP-AUC ratios > 0.95 but < 1.5 (ie. hGISA, not GISA). All 7 isolates defined as hGISA by both Etest and PAP-AUC comprised 1 PFGE clone (< 3 bands difference). Additionally 2 distinct PFGE types were detected among the other 5 hGISA identified PAP-AUC. The 12 hGISAs, were derived from 12 patients with severe underlying disease. None were on glycopeptide therapy prior to hGISA isolation. This is the first report of endemic hGISA, comprising 3 clonal types. The isolation of hVISA seems not to be associated with patient-specific glycopeptide therapies.
