Severe infections due to Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi are still common in sub-Saharan Africa where many patients are empirically treated for malaria. In addition to the usual clinical signs and complications of typhoid fever, clinicians practicing in high incidence areas must be aware of less common manifestations. The purpose of this report is to describe a case involving an 18-year-old boy who presented with quinine-resistant febrile coma. The final diagnosis was typhoid fever. After recovery the patient presented complete deafness. Discussion raises the question of whether deafness was secondary to typhoid fever or to drug therapy.
