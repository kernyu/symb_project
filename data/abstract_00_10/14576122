Most patients with alveolar echinococcosis are diagnosed at a late stage when the disease has advanced to unresectable hepatic lesions. These patients require lifelong therapy with benzimidazoles, the only medical treatment currently available. To date, no treatment option remains for patients with benzimidazole intolerance or treatment failure. Amphotericin B was recently shown to exert antiparasitic activity in vitro. Here, we report the efficacy of amphotericin B in human alveolar echinococcosis. In three patients with extensive disease and without further treatment options, disease progression had been documented over several months. They were treated with amphotericin B intravenously at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight three times per week. Follow-up parameters were physical examination, laboratory parameters, and imaging techniques. Amphotericin B treatment effectively halted parasite growth in all three patients. The antiparasitic effect was most evident by spontaneous closure of cutaneous fistulae in two patients and by constant size of parasitic lesions during treatment, as assessed radiologically. Metabolic activity in parasitic areas was visualized by positron emission tomography and significantly decreased during treatment. However, progressive affection of the heart in one patient could not be stopped. All patients currently continue on amphotericin B and have been treated for 25, 17, and 14 months, respectively. We introduce amphotericin B as salvage treatment for alveolar echinococcosis patients with intolerance or resistance to benzimidazoles, as it effectively suppresses parasite growth. Amphotericin B is not parasitocidal; therefore long-term treatment has to be anticipated.
