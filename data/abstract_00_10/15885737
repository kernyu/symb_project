A non-conventional technique is proposed for the enclosure of either pure bacterial cultures or entire biocoenoses, for a possible utilization in the treatment of contaminated water. Biological components have been enclosed between polyester membranes coated by silica films consisting of: (a) SiO2 and nitrocellulose, (b) SiO2, ZnS crystals and nitrocellulose, (c) SiO2, TiO2 crystals and nitrocellulose, (d) SiO2, ZnS and TiO2 crystals and nitrocellulose. Morphological, structural and mechanical features of membranes were investigated by means of optical and electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry and wear resistance tests. Degradation kinetics have been finally studied by dipping the entrapped biomass into aqueous solutions of three different model organic compounds (alpha-d-glucose, ethyl alcohol and peptone). Results are very promising: in fact, no metabolic inhibition mechanisms of microorganisms have been evidenced. The porosity of the system allows mass transfer through the membranes, hence bacteria can grow and degrade pollutants. Besides, by this system, cells are constrained, avoiding they to spread across the retainment scaffold.
