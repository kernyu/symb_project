Terbinafine is the only systemic allylamine antifungal currently available. Its mechanism of action is unique and sets it apart from other agents. Although it is primarily used for dermatophyte infections, such as onychomycosis and tinea pedis, terbinafine has broad in vitro activity against a variety of non-dermatophyte fungal pathogens, including Candida spp. and many molds. In addition, synergistic activity is noted with other antifungals, notably triazoles. Multiple case reports exist of its use for unusual and refractory fungal infections, but no systematic review is available. We review the current literature with regard to in vitro data and clinical experience with terbinafine in the treatment of rare and refractory mycoses.
