Anti-VRE and anti-MRSA activities of new quinolone derivatives [The two quinolone derivatives are 8- [3-[(ethylamino) methyl]-1-pyrrodinyl] -7-fluoro-9, 1-[(N-methylimino)methano]-5-oxo-5H-thiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone-4-carboxylic acid (compound A) and 7-fluoro-8-morpholino-9,1-[(N-methylimino) methanol-5-oxo-5H-thiazolo [3,2-a] quinolone-4-carboxylic acid (compound B)] and their synergism with commercial antibiotics were investigated. Compound A exhibited potent antibacterial activity against VRE and MRSA among the five new quinolone compounds tested, and showed superior activity to pefloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin, which are clinically in use these days. With respect to the anti-VRE activity, compound A showed synergism with fosfomycin (FOM), and partial synergism with ampicillin (ABPC), gentaicin (GM), minocycline (MINO) and vancomycin hydrochloride (VCM). Partial synergism in anti-VRE activity was also observed between compound B and GM, MINO, FOM and VCM. Compound A also showed synergism with MINO and FOM in anti-MASA activity. Partial synergism was observed with ABPC, GM and VCM. Synergism with ABPC was not detected in anti-MRSA activity. On the other hand, the synergism of compound B with FOM, and the partial synergisms with ABPC, GM and MINO were also found against MRSA. No synergism with ABPC was found against MRSA. These results suggested that compound A and B could possibly reduce the daily administration dose of these antibiotics in the treatment of nosocomial infections, and also reduce the possibility of the occurrence of nosocomial infections caused by VRE and/or MRSA.
