The backbone of effective highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens for the treatment of HIV infections currently contains at least two nucleosides. Among the features that influence the potency of each component of a regimen and the overall efficacy of the combination are the cellular uptake and bioconversion of nucleoside analogues to their active triphosphate form, and the extent of possible interactions in these steps that might occur when more than one nucleoside is used in a regimen. D-d4FC (Reverset), a new cytidine analogue with the ability to inhibit many nucleoside-resistant viral variants, was examined for these parameters. In phytohemaglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, D-d4FC was taken up in a rapid (8 h to 50% maximal value), saturable (plateau above 10 microM parent nucleoside concentration) process, resulting in levels of D-d4FC triphosphate that should provide potent antiviral activity against a variety of virus genotypes. Based on measurement of antiviral effects in cell culture, additive and in some cases, synergistic interactions were observed with protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or other nucleosides, including cytidine analogues.
