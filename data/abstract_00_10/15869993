PURPOSE: To investigate more effective chemotherapy against hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) with the combination of estramustine (EM), docetaxel, and suramin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 42 patients with symptomatic, progressive HRPC were included in this study. We evaluated the activity of the following schedule: EM 10 mg/kg orally daily on Days 1 to 21 every 28 days, docetaxel 70 mg/m(2) IV on Day 2 every 28 days and a total doses of 2150 mg of suramin in every cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression or excessive toxicity. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 23.4 months. A median of 8.8 consecutive cycles was administered per patient. In the 25 patients with lymphadenopathy, there were three (12%) complete and 18 (72%) partial responses for a measurable disease response rate of 84%. Levels of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) decreased by greater than 50% in 100% of patients and by greater than 90% in 76.2%. The median time to progression was 57 weeks and median overall survival was 132 weeks. A decline in PSA of > or =50% lasting > or =30 days was significantly associated with a prolonged median time to progression and median overall survival. Tumor volume reduction and/or antitumor treatment effects were observed in 88% of patients. A significant decrease in mean pain score from 7.8 (range, 6-10) to 2.2 (range, 0-4) (P < 0.001) was achieved in 78%. Of patients with bone metastasis, 30.5% demonstrated a partial response. The mean Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score improved from 2.8 to 1.5 at the end of treatment period. There was no therapy-related death. The predominant toxicities were Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 33.3%, anemia in 21%, thrombocytopenia in 21.4%, cardiac ischemia in 4.7%, and rash in 4.7%. CONCLUSION: The combination of docetaxel, EM, and suramin is a highly effective regimen for HRPC. Although hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities were modest, these were easily managed medically.
