Nutrition during pregnancy and lactation can program an offspring's metabolism with regard to glucose and lipid homeostasis. A suboptimal environment during fetal, neonatal and infant development is associated with impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in later adult life. However, studies on the effects of a low protein diet imposed from the beginning of gestation until adulthood are scarce. This study's objective was to investigate the effects of a low protein diet imposed from the gestational period until 4 months of age on the parameters of glucose tolerance and insulin responsiveness in Wistar rats. The rats were divided into a low protein diet group and a control group and received a diet with either 7% or 25% protein, respectively. After birth, the rats received the same diet as their mothers, until 4 months of age. In the low protein diet group it was observed that: (i) the hepatic glycogen concentration and hepatic glycogen synthesis from glycerol were significantly greater than in the control group; (ii) the disposal of 2-deoxyglucose in soleum skeletal muscle slices was 29.8% higher than in the control group; (iii) there was both a higher glucose tolerance in the glucose tolerance test; and (iv) a higher insulin responsiveness in than in the control group. The results suggest that the low protein diet animals show higher glucose tolerance and insulin responsiveness relative to normally nourished rats. These findings were supported by the higher hepatic glycogen synthesis and the higher disposal of 2-deoxyglucose in soleum skeletal muscle found in the low protein diet rats.
