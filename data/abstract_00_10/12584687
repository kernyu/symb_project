Minimum inhibitory concentrations for enrofloxacin were determined for 63 bacterial isolates from dogs with otitis externa or urinary tract infections. Development of resistant mutants was determined after exposing the isolates to enrofloxacin in vitro for up to five serial passages. Results indicated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp isolates exposed to enrofloxacin developed resistance rapidly, whereas Klebsiella, Proteus, and Streptococcus spp were less likely to develop resistance. Despite the presence of enrofloxacin pressure, no resistant bacteria developed in the Escherichia coli and staphylococcal isolates. In many isolates, susceptibility patterns changed from susceptible to intermediate.
