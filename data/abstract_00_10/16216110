A 16% decline in rates of penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in Taiwan between 1998--1999 (25%) and 2001 (9%) was associated with a 46% decrease in total penicillin and other cephalosporin usage in 2001 compared with 1999. However, erythromycin resistance in S. pneumoniae remained high (94%), despite a 45% decrease in macrolide consumption between 1999 and 2001.
