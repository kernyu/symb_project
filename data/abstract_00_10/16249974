BACKGROUND/AIMS: There are some reports showing that resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) to clarithromycin has increased in recent years. We aimed to investigate the current success of a most popular first-line eradication regimen by using two different proton pump inhibitors: lansoprazole and pantoprazole. METHODS: Ninety patients with H. pylori-positive functional dyspepsia were randomized to receive pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d. or lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. in addition to amoxicillin 1,000 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 14 days in a multicenter study. H. pylori infection was determined by histological examination and a rapid urease test. A follow-up endoscopy was performed to assess the H. pylori eradication six weeks after the end of therapy. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients completed the study protocol properly. The H. pylori eradication rates according to per protocol analysis were 70% in group pantoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin (28/40) and 69.2% in group pantoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin (27/39). The eradication rates according to intention to treat analysis were 62.2% and 60% in lansoprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, pantoprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin groups, respectively. The eradication rates were similar in both protocols (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The most popular first-line eradication protocols of H. pylori achieved only a moderate success in the current study. Alternative therapy options are needed instead of clarithromycin-based triple treatment for eradication of H. pylori. The choice of proton pump inhibitor is not important in the eradication rate of H. pylori.
