The effect of continuous in-feed administration of anticoccidial agents on antimicrobial sensitivity and the level of bacterial shedding in poultry experimentally infected with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhimurium definitive type 104 (DT104) were investigated. On day 0, 1,200 1-day-old Salmonella-free broiler chicks were placed into 50 pens, and the pens were randomly allocated to one of five treatments: nonsupplemented (negative control; T1), monensin at 120 mg/kg of diet (T2), salinomycin at 60 mg/kg of diet (T3), semduramicin at 20 mg/kg of diet (T4), or semduramicin at 25 mg/kg of diet (T5). Each bird was inoculated with a well-characterized strain of serotype Typhimurium DT104 on day 10. On day 49, the birds were euthanatized humanely. Bulk fecal samples were collected on days 13, 43, and 48 and were examined for organisms which had acquired resistance. The genetic basis of acquired resistance was determined from representative samples of isolates. Of 784 Salmonella-selective plates supplemented with antimicrobial agents, only 33 showed growth. These isolates came from all treatment regimens, including the nonsupplemented control. A number of phenotypic changes were observed; these included changes in motility, phage type, and agglutination properties. Supplementation of the diet with an anticoccidial drug does not appear to affect antimicrobial resistance or the level of excretion of salmonellae. Most of the changes observed do not seem to be related to the presence of a supplement in feed. Salmonellae appear to be capable of acquiring antimicrobial resistance and phenotypic changes independently of specific antimicrobial selection pressures.
