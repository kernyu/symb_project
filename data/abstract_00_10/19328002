HIV-1 assembly and disassembly (uncoating) processes are critical for the HIV-1 replication. HIV-1 capsid (CA) and human cyclophilin A (CypA) play essential roles in these processes. We designed and synthesized a series of thiourea compounds as HIV-1 assembly and disassembly dual inhibitors targeting both HIV-1 CA protein and human CypA. The SIV-induced syncytium antiviral evaluation indicated that all of the inhibitors displayed antiviral activities in SIV-infected CEM cells at the concentration of 0.6-15.8 microM for 50% of maximum effective rate. Their abilities to bind CA and CypA were determined by ultraviolet spectroscopic analysis, fluorescence binding affinity and PPIase inhibition assay. Assembly studies in vitro demonstrated that the compounds could potently disrupt CA assembly with a dose-dependent manner. All of these molecules could bind CypA with binding affinities (Kd values) of 51.0-512.8 microM. Fifteen of the CypA binding compounds showed potent PPIase inhibitory activities (IC(50) values<1 microM) while they could not bind either to HIV-1 Protease or to HIV-1 Integrase in the enzyme assays. These results suggested that 15 compounds could block HIV-1 replication by inhibiting the PPIase activity of CypA to interfere with capsid disassembly and disrupting CA assembly.
