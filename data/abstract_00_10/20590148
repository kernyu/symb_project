Three compounds were isolated from Acnistus arborescens, a tree commonly used in South and Central America in traditional medicine against several infectious diseases, some of which are caused by fungi. Bioassay-guided fractionation of a MeOH extract of leaves, based on its anti-Pneumocystis carinii activity, led to the isolation of compounds 1-3. Mono- and bidimensional NMR analyses enabled identification of two new withanolides, (20R,22R)-5beta,6beta-epoxy-4beta,12beta,20-trihydroxy-1-oxowith-2-en-24-enolide (1) and (20R,22R)-16beta-acetoxy-3beta,4beta;5beta,6beta-diepoxy-12beta,20-dihydroxy-1-ox owith-24-enolide (2), and withanolide D (3). Antifungal activity on 13 fungi responsible for human infections (five dermatophytes, one nondermatophyte mold, six yeasts, and Pneumocystis carinii) was examined. Cytotoxicity of these compounds was also evaluated in vitro.
