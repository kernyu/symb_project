Biocides play an important role in the preservation of white mineral dispersions (WMD). Due to the occurrence of biocide-resistant bacteria and technical limitations in the use of biocides, new preservation strategies are required-like the enhancement of biocides by non-biocidal compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biocide enhancement performance of lithium against various biocide-resistant bacteria in WMD. Subsequently, the minimal enhancing concentration (MEC) of lithium and the bioavailability of lithium in respect to the mode of introduction into WMD were investigated. The antimicrobial performance of biocidal formulations comprising isothiazolinones and formaldehyde releasers or isothiazolinones and glutaraldehyde has been evaluated against the related resistant bacterial spectrum in the presence of lithium. The MEC of lithium ranged from 1,350 to 1,500 ppm (based on the liquid phase weight of a WMD with 75% solids) for formaldehyde releasers and glutaraldehyde-based biocidal formulations, respectively. The biocide enhancing property of lithium was independent of whether lithium was introduced into WMD via a lithium-neutralised dispersant, added during the calcium carbonate grinding step, or dosed into the final product. Lithium is a non-biocidal compound which has been discovered to be a potent and universal biocide enhancer. Lithium boosts the biocidal activity of various biocides and provides a novel technique to overcome biocide resistance in WMD. Such a biocide enhancer represents a breakthrough that offers a potential tool to revolutionise the consumption of biocidal agents in the WMD producing industry.
