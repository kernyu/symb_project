AIM: To confirm the presence of multiple anthelmintic resistance on a sheep farm in New Zealand. METHODS: Three groups of 10 weaned Romney-cross lambs were treated either with an oral dose of ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg), or a benzimidazole/levamisole (BZ/LEV) combination (4.75 albendazole and 7.5 mg/kg levamisole), or were left untreated. Ten days later, animals were necropsied, and adult worms recovered and identified from the abomasa and small intestines. Pre- and post-treatment faecal nematode egg counts (FEC) were recorded, and larval cultures were performed. RESULTS: In a faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT), adjusted to reflect pre- and post-treatment larval culture results, ivermectin resistance was detected in Teladorsagia (Ostertagia), Trichostrongylus and Haemonchus spp, while BZ/LEV combination- resistant Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus spp were also present. Adult worm counts confirmed these results, and identified the species involved as Teladorsagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and H. contortus. CONCLUSION: Multiple, multi-generic anthelmintic resistance was confirmed on a sheep property in New Zealand. This included the first confirmed case of ivermectin resistance in T. colubriformis from sheep in New Zealand.
