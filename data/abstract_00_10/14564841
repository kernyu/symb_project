An epizootological study of the ticks gathered from the cattle and ground surface in the Dedoplistskaroisky and Dushetsky districts of Eastern Georgia has identified 5 Salmonella a typhimurium strains. The strains were isolated from the ticks Haemaphysalis punctata, Rhipicephalus bursa, Hyalomma plumbeum. They were found to be resistant to 10 of 16 antibiotics. The strains showed a high sensitivity only to 3 antibiotics, such as gentamicin, cirpofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin and 3 strains were highly sensitive to chloramphenicol. The above ticks seem to have been spontaneously infected with the pathogen Salmonella on the animals at the moment of bacteremia.
