A survey to study the extent of anthelmintic resistance was conducted in Maputo and Gaza, two of the ten provinces of Mozambique, during February and March, 1999. A total of 12 flocks, six in Maputo and six in Gaza, was surveyed. The faecal egg count reduction test was used to assess the efficacy of three anthelmintics most often used in Mozambique, namely albendazole, fenbendazole and levamisole. The degree of resistance was calculated using two different methods, and varied according to the method used. Using the formula of Coles, Bauer, Borgsteede, Geerts, Klei, Taylor & Waller (1992), resistance to the benzimidazoles was detected in one flock in Maputo and one in Gaza, and to levamisole in three flocks in Maputo and one in Gaza. When the formula of Dash, Hall & Barger (1988) was used, however, resistance to the benzimidazoles was detected in only one flock in Maputo, and no resistance to levamisole was detected. The 12 farms surveyed were too few for conclusions to be made on the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance in goats in Mozambique as a whole. Therefore, an extensive survey at national level is needed. This study gives evidence, however, that anthelmintic resistance in nematode parasites of goats is an emerging problem, to which special attention should be paid.
