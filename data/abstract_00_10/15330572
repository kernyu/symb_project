To investigate the effect of age, sex and marital status on the etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infection and the antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens, urine specimens collected from 270 outpatients were analysed and 121 significant monomicrobial cultures obtained. The microorganisms were identified and their susceptibility to 14 selected antimicrobial agents was determined. These results were then related to the age, sex and marital status of the patients. This study concludes that understanding the effect of the different factors on community-acquired urinary tract infections and their antimicrobial resistance will aid the proper management of this disease.
