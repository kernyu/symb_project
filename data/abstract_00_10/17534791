Intravascular catheters are the most common cause of nosocomially acquired bloodstream infections. Bacteria found adhering to the intraluminal surfaces of catheters are the principal source and cause of these infections. Adherent bacteria overtime are known to form multicellular communities which become encased within a three dimensional matrix of extracellular polymeric material known as biofilms, which are thought to be responsible for persistent infections. Consequently, a number of technologies have been developed to help prevent and control biofilms in intravascular catheters. One such approach involves impregnating catheter material with antimicrobial agents. Unfortunately these methods are not universally effective in preventing catheter-related biofilm infections. Technologies that utilise antimicrobials, as catheter locks have been shown to have more potential for preventing biofilm formation and reducing the incidences of catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). This article discusses the significance of biofilms in intravascular catheters and determines whether the treatments available today are proving to be effective for controlling biofilms and draws attention to future avenues which are being investigated to control biofilms and therefore CRBSI.
