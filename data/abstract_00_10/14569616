Namalwa cells originating from the malignant human lymphoma have been analyzed cytogenetically upon short-time exposure to subtoxic doses of inhibitors of DNA replication and synthesis, either etoposide or fludarabine. The intact cells were characterized by the modal class of the chromosomes within the diploid range with the proportion of the aberrant cells amounting to 16.0 +/- 0.5%. Upon exposure to etoposide the percentage of the aberrant cells increased amounting to 26.1 +/- 2.9 through 39.8 +/- 1.7% depending on the duration of the exposure and the dose of the drug. At the same time the number of the polyploid cells increased but the modal class retained within the diploid range. Upon exposure to fludarabine the percentage of the cells with the aberrant chromosomes increased to 57.1 +/- 2.9%. Two modal classes appeared--the first approaching the diploid number and the second being polyploid. The exposure to either etoposide or fludarabine resulted in increasing number of the chromatide aberrations with more frequent involvement of #1, #2, #5, #6, #7, #11, #13, #14, #16 and #17 chromosomes. The data obtained have shown the susceptibility of Namalwa cells to the subtoxic concentrations of the inhibitors of DNA synthesis and replication used in the study resulting in the survival of the novel clones resistant to the drugs.
