BACKGROUND: Breakthrough hepatitis (BTH), defined as a flare of transaminases alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) can occur during lamivudine monotherapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. There have been many reports of lamivudine-resistant mutations within the C domain of the viral reverse transcriptase; however, the appearance of these mutants is not necessarily correlated with BTH during lamivudine therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Entire serial HBV genomic sequences before and during lamivudine therapy for 4 patients with BTH and 1 patient without BTH were analyzed and showed changes in the pre-S region. These changes may be associated with ALT flares. Further investigation in a cohort of 36 patients with a median treatment period of 25 months showed that 21 patients had a rise in HBV-DNA titer, of whom 18 had BTH. Univariate statistical analyses showed that possible prognostic indicators for the occurrence of BTH were pre-S deletions ( P = 0.03) and L180M/M204L mutations ( P = 0.04). By multivariate Cox regression analyses, significant variables were pre-S deletions (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence internal (CI), 0.044-0.66) and precore mutations (hazard ratio, 5.70; 95% CI, 1.74-18.71) prior to the commencement of lamivudine monotherapy. Interestingly, BTH occurred after the selection of the wild-type species in the pre-S region during lamivudine monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients with HBV pre-S deletion mutants should be monitored carefully during lamivudine therapy.
