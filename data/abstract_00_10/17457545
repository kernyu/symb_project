The effect of the microenvironment in alginate-chitosan-alginate (ACA) microcapsules with liquid core (LCM) and solid core (SCM) on the physiology and stress tolerance of Sacchromyces cerevisiae was studied. The suspended cells were used as control. Cells cultured in liquid core microcapsules showed a nearly twofold increase in the intracellular glycerol content, trehalose content, and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, which are stress tolerance substances, while SCM did not cause the significant physiological variation. In accordance with the physiological modification after being challenged with osmotic stress (NaCl), oxidative stress (H(2)O(2)), ethanol stress, and heat shock stress, the cell survival in LCM was increased. However, SCM can only protect the cells from damaging under ethanol stress. Cells released from LCM were more resistant to hyperosmotic stress, oxidative stress, and heat shock stress than cells liberated from SCM. Based on reasonable analysis, a method was established to estimate the effect of microenvironment of LCM and SCM on the protection of cells against stress factors. It was found that the resistance of LCM to hyperosmotic stress, oxidative stress, and heat shock stress mainly depend on the domestication effect of LCM's microenvironment. The physical barrier of LCM constituted by alginate-chitosan membrane and liquid alginate matrix separated the cells from the damage of oxidative stress and ethanol stress. The significant tolerance against ethanol stress of SCM attributed to the physical barrier consists of solid alginate-calcium matrix and alginate-chitosan membrane.
