The DNA sequences of two IncHI2 plasmids, pEC-IMP and pEC-IMPQ, from metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter cloacae clinical isolates were determined. The two conjugative plasmids are almost identical, but pEC-IMPQ carries an additional segment containing an orf513 (ISCR1), a truncated 3' conserved sequence, and a qnrB2. Comparative analyses provide support for the proposed ISCR1-mediated gene mobilization.
