The effect of an original drug Kagocel on the reproduction of Herpes simplex virus including its mutant strains resistant to basic antiherpetic medicine Acyclovir was evaluated. Kagocel was shown to have a low cytotoxic effect on Vero cell and inhibited reproduction of Herpes virus type 1 and Herpes virus type 2 in noncytotoxic concentrations. Kagocel was also demonstrated to inhibit the reproduction of Herpes virus type 1, resistant to combination of Acyclovir and phosphonoacetic acid. Detection of direct antiherpetic activity of Kagocel in vitro opens good perspectives to its clinical application, especially in combination with Acyclovir, the medication with other antiherpetic mechanism of action.
