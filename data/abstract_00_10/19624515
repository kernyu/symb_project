We report the first international spread and dissemination of ST93-SCCmecIV (Queensland clone) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), previously identified in communities and hospitals in Australia. Ten highly genetically related MRSA isolates and one methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolate were identified in England between 2005 and June 2008. The demography and clinical features were typical for community-associated-MRSA. One female with MRSA infection died from necrotizing pneumonia. Travel between Australia and the UK, and some onward transmission, suggested that both importation and clonal dissemination of this strain had occurred, albeit to a small extent. Nosocomial transmission was not detected, but we remain vigilant for further importations and/or spread.
