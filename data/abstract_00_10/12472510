Bacterial resistance appears to be an ever-increasing problem and is threatening to spiral out of control. The scare caused by the rapid spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among hospitals in the UK is the most recent. Otorhinolaryngology is deeply involved in this problem, as one of the reasons often cited for increasing bacterial resistance is the use of antibiotics in suspected bacterial infections in ear, nose and throat by primary care physicians. This speciality is also involved in the development of guidelines for antimicrobial use by primary and secondary care. This review attempts to discuss the reason for the development of antimicrobial resistance especially in relation to otorhinolaryngology, what can be done to contain this menace and the surveillance system developed to monitor the trend in the development of bacterial resistance.
