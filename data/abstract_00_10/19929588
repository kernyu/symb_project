Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important health problem and a major cause of chronic hepatitis that can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Durable viral suppression has been documented to lower the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and disease progression. Treatment of chronic HBV infection remains a major clinical challenge because long-term use with approved oral antiviral agents is associated with drug resistance. Antiviral resistance can result in poor clinical outcomes; therefore first-line therapy with the most potent agent(s) is recommended to lower the risk. Early detection of resistance is paramount to possibly reduce the risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality. It is important that clinicians monitor for therapeutic efficacy and resistance, so as to optimize the management of chronic HBV.
