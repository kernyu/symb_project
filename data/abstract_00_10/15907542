Cryptic plasmid pRK2 of the strain Escherichia coli W (ATCC 9637), an ancestor of production strains for penicillin G acylase, was sequenced and characterized. Based on the data on replication region and origin (ori sequence AAC, 924-926nt), the plasmid was classified as ColE1-like plasmid. DNA sequence analysis revealed five orfs hypothetical products of which shared a significant sequence similarity with putative proteins encoded by DNA of plasmid pColE1. orf1 codes for protein Rom involved in the control of plasmid replication, orfs 2-5 code for putative mobilization proteins (Mob A-D) that show a high level of similarity with the ones encoded by DNA of plasmids pColE1 and pLG13 (E. coli), pECL18 and pEC01 (Enterobacter cloacae), pSFD10 (Salmonella choleraesuis), and pScol7 (Shigella sonnei). Recombinant plasmids pRS11 (4.91kbp), pRS12 (4.91kbp), pRS2 (2.996kbp), and pRS3 (2.623kbp) that bear the Spectinomycin resistance determinant (Spc(R)) were prepared on the basis of nucleotide sequence of pRK2. These constructs are stably maintained in the population of E. coli cells grown in the absence of the selection pressure for 63 generations. The copy number of Spc(R) constructs in E. coli host grown in antibiotic-free LB medium ranges from 25 to 40 molecules per chromosomal equivalent.
