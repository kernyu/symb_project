BACKGROUND: Glyphosate-resistant (GR) weed species are now found with increasing frequency and threaten the critically important glyphosate weed-management system [corrected]. RESULTS: The reported (31)P NMR experiments on glyphosate-sensitive (S) and glyphosate-resistant (R) horseweed, Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq., show significantly more accumulation of glyphosate within the R biotype vacuole. CONCLUSIONS: Selective sequestration of glyphosate into the vacuole confers the observed horseweed resistance to glyphosate. This observation represents the first clear evidence for the glyphosate resistance mechanism in C. canadensis.
