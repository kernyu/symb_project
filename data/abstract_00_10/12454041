PURPOSE: To determine the effects of immunization against lysostaphin on the bactericidal action of lysostaphin in ocular tissue and the possible induction of allergic reactions. METHODS: Rabbits were immunized against lysostaphin by subcutaneous, intranasal, or topical routes. Anti-lysostaphin antibody titers were determined by ELISA and by neutralization of lysostaphin. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was intrastromally or intravitreously injected into rabbit eyes. Eyes were treated either topically with drops of lysostaphin (0.3%) or with a single intravitreous injection (0.1 mL) of lysostaphin (0.1%). At the time of death, corneas or vitreous humors were cultured to determine the number of colony forming units (CFU). RESULTS: Rabbits in keratitis experiments that were immunized subcutaneously, intranasally, or topically had serum antibody titers of 10,240, 187, and 1,867, respectively, and neutralization titers of 8 or less. In both normal and immunized rabbits with keratitis, lysostaphin significantly reduced the log CFU to less than 1 log, whereas the untreated eyes contained more than 10(6) CFU/cornea (P < or = 0.0001). Rabbits that were subcutaneously or topically immunized for endophthalmitis experiments had serum antibody titers of 1636 or 137, respectively, and neutralization titers of 2 or less. A single intravitreous injection of lysostaphin (0.1%) sterilized all eyes of immunized and nonimmune rabbits with endophthalmitis. No adverse effects were observed with the administration of lysostaphin to either normal or immunized rabbit eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Lysostaphin treatment of immunized rabbits was effective in treating S. aureus-infected eyes, despite the presence of anti-lysostaphin antibody. No adverse reactions were produced by administration of lysostaphin to immunized rabbits.
