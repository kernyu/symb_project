Bioassay-guided fractionation of the antibacterial CH(2)Cl(2)-MeOH extract obtained from the aerial parts of the Argentinean plant Caiophora coronata led to the isolation of a new triterpene, 1beta,3beta-dihydroxyurs-12-en-27-oic acid, 1, and a new iridoid, 1alpha-methoxy-6alpha,10-dihydroxyisoepiiridomyrmecin (caiophoraenin), 2, along with the known iridoid isoboonein 3. Their structures were established by spectroscopic techniques (1D and 2D NMR, HRFABMS, FTIR). The MIC values of isolated compounds were determined against methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and -resistant (MRSA) strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis (BS), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), Escherichia coli (EC), E. coli imp (ECimp), and Candida albicans (CA). Compound 1 was found active against BS, MSSA, MRSA, VREF, and ECimp with MIC values of 2, 4, 4, 4, and 16 microg/mL, respectively.
