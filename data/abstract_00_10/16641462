Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes was investigated among 291 Escherichia coli and 282 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that showed decreased susceptibilities to extended-spectrum cephalosporins from seven Taiwanese medical centers. CTX-M-type and SHV-type enzymes were the most prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. CMY-2-like and DHA-1-like beta-lactamases were the most prevalent AmpC-type enzymes.
