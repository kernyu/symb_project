A multiply resistant strain of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Virchow was isolated in November 2002 from a catheterized patient admitted to the SSK Training Hospital in Ankara, Turkey. This isolate showed an antimicrobial susceptibility pattern compatible with the presence of a CTX-M-type ESBL, namely resistance to cefotaxime, aztreonam and cefepime, and intermediate susceptibility to ceftazidime. On checking for the presence of the bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and bla(CTX-M )resistance genes by PCR, negative results were obtained with the primers specific for SHV and TEM genes, while positive results were obtained with those specific for CTX-M-type genes. After sequencing, the beta-lactamase was identified as CTX-M-3. This is the first report of this enzyme in Salmonella Virchow and represents a further disquieting threat to the therapy of infections caused by Salmonella isolates.
