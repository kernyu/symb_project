The use of aerosolized tobramycin is an important component in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis, particularly those with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Clinicians have been concerned that long-term therapy with aerosolized tobramycin may increase the risk of colonization with multi-resistant bacteria, including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The ability of five strains (three clinical, two environmental) of S. maltophilia to survive exposure to 16000 microg/mL tobramycin, a concentration commonly found inside the atomization chamber of nebulizers used to deliver aerosolized therapy, was studied. Under a variety of different growth conditions, all five strains were able to survive exposure to 16000 microg/mL of tobramycin. Post-exposure recovery was enhanced at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C in comparison with 37 degrees C under all test conditions. The importance of these findings in relation to the epidemiology of S. maltophilia in patients with cystic fibrosis is discussed.
