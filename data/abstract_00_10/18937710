AIM: To determine the clinical characteristics of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), the Candida species involved and the antifungal susceptibility of Candida species isolated from patients with VVC. METHODS: Candida organisms were cultured from samples obtained from patients who presented with VVC to the Gynecology Department, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using a commercial agar diffusion test. RESULTS: Of the 1,070 cases of VVC reported in this study, 36.5% were uncomplicated VVC, and 63.5% were complicated VVC. Twenty-four patients were identified as having two species of Candida. Candid albicans alone was isolated from 89.5% of cases (n = 958). Candida glabrata was isolated from 85 cases (7.9%), Candida tropicalis from 10 (0.9%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae from eight (0.7%), Candida parapsilosis from six (0.6%), Candida famata from two (0.2%), and Candida krusei from one case (0.1%). All isolates of Candida albicans were susceptible to nystatin. The resistant rate of Candida albicans to azole agents was 0-4.9%. CONCLUSION: Candida albicans was the predominant Candida species isolated from this series of patients with VVC. Resistance of vaginal Candida albicans isolates to antifungal agents was infrequent.
