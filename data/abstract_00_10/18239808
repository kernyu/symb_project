Antibiotic resistance markers were analyzed in C. trachomatis clinical isolates obtained after ineffective therapy of urogenital chlamydiasis with fluoroquinolones and macrolides. Heterotypical resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides was detected in all clinical isolates. No significant mutations in the target genes were detected.
