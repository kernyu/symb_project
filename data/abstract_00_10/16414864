Pediatric bacterial infections are very rapidly growing in developing countries. Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem in the treatment of Pediatric bacterial infection. One of the most effective ways to control antibiotic resistance, is the development of surveillance programs. For this purpose isolates were collected from paediatric wards of different hospitals. The result shows that isolates were highly resistant against majority of selected antibiotics with increase in the MIC's. In Penicillin group, the most effective agent is Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid, more than 90% isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible while other agents, as Cloxacillin, Ampicillin and Amoxicillin alone shows moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
