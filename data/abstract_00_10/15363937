The efficacy of pyrimethamine or sulfadoxine administered in combination with azithromycin was examined in a rodent malaria model. Outbred Swiss mice infected with blood stage parasites were treated from day 0 to day 3 and efficacy of different regimens was monitored in terms of the curative response and the delay time to reach 2% parasitaemia (2% DT). Administration of azithromycin alone at 60 mg/kg/day produced curative response while lower doses showed marginally delayed 2% DT. A marked potentiation in activities of pyrimethamine (100-fold) or sulfadoxine (10-fold) was observed when administered at non-curative doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day in combination with azithromycin (30 mg/kg/day) against blood stage parasites. A combination of 10 mg/kg/day azithromycin with 0.3 mg/kg/day sulfadoxine was also curative. Likewise in the causal prophylactic test, a combination regimen comprising 1/16th and 1/3rd the individual curative doses of pyrimethamine and azithromycin, respectively, prevented the development of patent infection after Plasmodium yoelii sporozoite challenge. Our results suggest that a combination of azithromycin with the second line treatment regimen of fansidar may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the latter and also provide better prophylaxis against Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
