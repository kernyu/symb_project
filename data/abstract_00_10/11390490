Gamma(delta) T cells have been reported to play an essential effector role during the early immune response against a wide variety of infectious agents. Recent studies have suggested that the gamma(delta) T cell subtype may also be important for the induction of adaptive immune response against certain microbial pathogens. In the present study, an early increase of gamma(delta) T cells during murine infection with Encephalitozoon cuniculi, an intracellular parasite, was observed. The role of gamma(delta) T cells against E. cuniculi infection was further evaluated by using gene-knockout mice. Mice lacking gamma(delta) T cells were susceptible to E. cuniculi infection at high challenge doses. The reduced resistance of delta(-/-) mice was attributed to a down-regulated CD8+ immune response. Compared with parental wild-type animals, suboptimal Ag-specific CD8+ T cell immunity against E. cuniculi infection was noted in delta(-/-) mice. The splenocytes from infected knockout mice exhibited a lower frequency of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells. Moreover, adoptive transfer of immune TCR(alpha)beta+ CD8+ cells from the delta(-/-) mice failed to protect naive CD8(-/-) mice against a lethal E. cuniculi challenge. Our studies suggest that gamma(delta) T cells, due to their ability to produce cytokines, are important for the optimal priming of CD8+ T cell immunity against E. cuniculi infection. This is the first evidence of a parasitic infection in which down-regulation of CD8+ T cell immune response in the absence of gamma(delta) T cells has been demonstrated.
