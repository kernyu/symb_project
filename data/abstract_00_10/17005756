A total of 140 nonrepetitive strains of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from five different Chinese hospitals. Fourteen isolates were confirmed to contain the VIM-2 metallo-beta-lactamase gene. Twelve isolates harbored two kinds of class 1 integron, containing both VIM-2- and aminoglycoside-resistant genes.
