OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to better define changes in the bacteriology of suppurative otitis in recent years and the role of cultures in the management of these patients. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was performed. METHODS: Outpatient records from 170 patients collected over 3 years with information regarding the bacteria cultured, antibiotic resistance, and clinical diagnosis were analyzed. RESULTS: A large variety of organisms were seen, with Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most common. Forty percent of cultures showed bacteria with moderate antibiotic resistance, whereas 5% were sensitive to only intravenous antibiotics. Resistant bacteria were found in all diagnosis categories and were significantly higher in cases of chronic mastoiditis. The rate of methicillin-resistant S aureus infections was 7.8% and was significantly higher in cases of chronic myringitis. Fungus was often cultured in patients without clinical signs of otomycosis. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired ear infections may be caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a substantial number of patients. In our opinion, outpatient cultures play an important role in the management of suppurative otitis.
