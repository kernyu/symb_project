We analyzed the resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins of an Enterobacter cloacae clinical isolate, EC002, by transconjugation, isoelectric-focusing analysis, and cloning experiments. It produced two beta-lactamases with isoelectric point values of 5.4 and 8.7, corresponding to TEM-141, a novel variant of TEM-1, and CTX-M-22, encoded by a transferable plasmid.
