This study examined the effects of maternal ethanol (EtOH) consumption during pregnancy or lactation on glucose homeostasis in the adult rat offspring. Glucose disposal was determined by minimal model during an intravenous glucose tolerance test in rats that had a small or normal birth weight after EtOH exposure in utero and in rats whose mothers were given EtOH during lactation only. All three EtOH groups had decreased glucose tolerance index and insulin sensitivity index, but their glucose effectiveness was not different from that of controls. In addition, EtOH rat offspring that were small at birth had elevated plasma, liver, and muscle triglyceride levels. The data show that EtOH exposure during pregnancy programs the body to insulin resistance later in life, regardless of birth weight, but that this effect also results in dyslipidemia in growth-restricted rats. In addition, insulin resistance is also evident after EtOH exposure during lactation.
