High-level mupirocin resistance (H-Mu(r)) in S. aureus is associated with the mupA gene. The mupA Evigene test rapidly identifies this gene. This study assessed the performance of mupA Evigene compared to that of susceptibility disk testing. mupA Evigene detected H-Mu(r) in 6/179 S. aureus isolates, and the results were concordant with those of susceptibility disk testing.
