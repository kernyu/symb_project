Global increases in multi-drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), are threatening both TB and HIV treatment programs worldwide. Together, they raise concerns of a global epidemic of untreatable TB. In the developing world, the directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy is proving ineffective as available resources are being outstripped by the large number of patients needing treatment. Thus, TB treatment and outcomes are sub-optimal, and multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB are on the rise.
