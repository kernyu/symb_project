Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an issue that has led to the search for new antibacterial approaches. Drugs targeting virulence is an alternative approach to treat infections due to resistant bacteria. There is extensive literature and knowledge in the field of bacterial pathogenesis and genomic determinant of virulence. As therapeutic targets, virulence factors have been primarily addressed in the vaccine field to prevent infection by specific pathogens. Recently novel strategies to identify virulence inhibitors have been numerous and several new compounds were recently reported. This review emphasizes the new virulence inhibitors that have shown a biological activity and have made a proof of concept that disarming bacteria lead to the inhibition of bacterial infection in experimental models in vivo. Moreover, some of these new antivirulence compounds are able to inhibit the virulence of different related pathogenic species, indicating that it is possible to target common virulence mechanisms. The progress reported recently with proof of concept for antivirulence molecules at the preclinical stages should allow the antivirulence concept to become a reality as a new antibacterial approach.
