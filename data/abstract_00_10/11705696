To analyze the effects of high concentrations of zinc ions on oxidative stress protection, we developed an original model of zinc-resistant HeLa cells (HZR), by using a 200 microM zinc sulfate-supplemented medium. Resistant cells specifically accumulate high zinc levels in intracellular vesicles. These resistant cells also exhibit high expression of metallothioneins (MT), mainly located in the cytoplasm. Exposure of HZR to Zn-depleted medium for 3 or 7 d decreases the intracellular zinc content, but only slightly reduces MT levels of resistant cells. No changes of the intracellular redox status were detected, but zinc resistance enhanced H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity. Conversely, zinc-depleted resistant cells were protected against H2O2-induced cell death. Basal- and oxidant-induced DNA damage was increased in zinc resistant cells. Moreover, measurement of DNA damage on zinc-depleted resistant cells suggests that cytoplasmic metal-free MT ensures an efficient protection against oxidative DNA damage, while Zn-MT does not. This newly developed Zn-resistant HeLa model demonstrates that high intracellular concentrations of zinc enhance oxidative DNA damage and subsequent cell death. Effective protection against oxidative damage is provided by metallothionein under nonsaturating zinc conditions. Thus, induction of MT by zinc may mediate the main cellular protective effect of zinc against oxidative injury.
