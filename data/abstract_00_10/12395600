During the world AIDS conference in Barcelona it became clear that the worst-case scenario of 10 years ago has become a reality: the HIV epidemic is continuing to spread. Also in industrialised countries the incidence of HIV infections among homosexual men is once again increasing. An HIV vaccine is still not available. Although the development of antiretroviral therapy continues, HIV inhibitors do not result in an eradication of HIV. It is still not clear as to when therapy can best be started and what the consequences are of temporarily withdrawing therapy. In countries where HIV inhibitors are widely available, the life expectancy of HIV-infected persons is increasing. The life expectancy of HIV patients will possibly decrease again due to an increased resistance towards the currently available antiretroviral drugs.
