The acyclic nucleoside phosphonates [HPMPC: cidofovir, Vistide; PMEA: adefovir dipivoxil, Hepsera; and PMPA: tenofovir, Viread] have proven to be effective in vitro (cell culture systems) and in vivo (animal models and clinical studies) against a wide variety of DNA virus and retrovirus infections, for example, cidofovir against herpesvirus [herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus type 6, 7 and 8), polyoma-, papilloma-, adeno- and poxvirus (variola virus, cowpox virus, vaccinia virus, molluscum contagiosum virus and orf) infections; adefovir against herpesvirus, hepadnavirus [human hepatitis B virus] and retrovirus [HIV type-1 and 2, simian immunodeficiency virus and feline immunodeficiency virus] infections; and tenofovir against both hepadna- and retrovirus infections. Cidofovir has been officially approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS patients, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread) for the treatment of HIV infections (i.e., AIDS) and adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.
