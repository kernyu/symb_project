This study evaluated the associated antimicrobial resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in relation to an antimicrobial agent with other drugs. The associated antimicrobial resistance was calculated by means of the relative risk. There was an obvious relationship between oxacillin resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents among isolates of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (68.5%), greater than 32%, except for linezolid (6.7%). Pronounced associated resistance among drugs was observed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, particularly for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems (59.6% to 60.7%) and for aminoglycosides and carbapenems (66.3 % to 67.7 %) and other beta-lactam antibiotics (52.3% to 85.8%). The present study emphasizes the importance of diagnostic cultures and susceptibility testing for selecting the correct antimicrobial agent, with regard to the clinical impact of increased multiresistance and selection of associated antimicrobial resistance.
