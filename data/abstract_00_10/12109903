The 4-aryl-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-2-butenoic acids and their isosteric tetrazoles are among an emerging class of aryl beta-diketo (ADK)-based agents which exhibit potent inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN)-catalyzed strand transfer (ST) processes, while having much reduced potencies against 3'-processing (3'-P) reactions. In the current study, L-708,906 (10e) and 5CITEP (13b), which are two examples of ADK inhibitors that have been reported by Merck and Shionogi pharmaceutical companies, served as model ADK leads. Structural variations to both the "left" and "right" sides of these molecules were made in order to examine effects on HIV-1 integrase inhibitory potencies. It was found that a variety of groups could be introduced onto the left side aryl ring with maintenance of good ST inhibitory potency. However, introduction of carboxylic acid-containing substituents onto the left side aryl ring enhanced 3'-P inhibitory potency and reduced selectivity toward ST reactions. Although both L-708,906 and 5CITEP show potent inhibition of IN in biochemical assays, there is a disparity of antiviral activity in cellular assays using HIV-1-infected cells. Neither 5CITEP nor any other of the indolyl-containing inhibitors exhibit significant antiviral effects in cellular systems. Alternatively, consistent with literature reports, L-708,906 does provide antiviral protection at low micromolar concentrations. Interestingly, several analogues of L-708,906 with varied substituents on the left side aryl ring, while having good inhibitory potencies against IN in extracellular assays, are not antiviral in whole-cell systems.
