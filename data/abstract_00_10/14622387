In a retrospective analysis of 128 cases of Candida bloodstream infections in a London teaching hospital between 1995 and 2001, the incidence of candidaemia increased from 0.2/1000 admissions in 1995 to 0.5 and 0.4/1000 admissions in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Risk factors for candidaemia included the presence of intravascular (IV) lines (88%), admission to intensive care (51%), parenteral nutrition (35%), multiple antibiotics (74%), corticosteroid therapy (12%), cancer chemotherapy (11%), renal transplantation (5%) and neutropenia (3%). The sources of infection were IV lines (77%), the urinary tract (7%) and the gastrointestinal tract (7%). Serious infective complications (endocarditis, endophthalmitis or brain abscess) were noted in 6% of cases. The most frequently isolated species were Candida albicans (64%), C. glabrata (20%), C. tropicalis (9%) and C. parapsilosis (5%). The overall fluconazole-resistance rate of Candida spp. was 7% (MIC > or = 64 mg l-1). All the C. albicans isolates were sensitive to fluconazole (MIC < or = 8 mg l-1) whereas 20% of non-C. albicans isolates (27% of C. glabrata and 14%C. tropicalis) were resistant. The mortality rate (35%) was lower than in other reports and may be due to the early recognition of candidaemia and the prompt removal of IV lines together with the initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy. Regular surveillance of local Candida species, resistance profiles and risk factors is important in order to identify patients at risk and to develop empirical treatment protocols to reduce the incidence and mortality of candidaemia.
