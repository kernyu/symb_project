We have isolated 14 different Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutants that synthesize invertase enzyme constitutively. Analyses of invertase activities revealed that the degrees of resistance to glucose repression were not similar among different complementation groups. One of the complementation groups appeared to be associated with functional and/or regulatory defects in hexose transport. Another complementation group appeared to be specific for the regulation of the inv1 gene alone, implying that these mutations might be associated with different genes acting on the glucose sensing and signaling pathway. In addition, we found that the wild-type level glucose uptake is essential for the full-level repression of inv1 expression.
