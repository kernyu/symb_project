A total of 60 Salmonella enterica serovar Agona isolates (25 pan-susceptible isolates and 35 isolates resistant to five or more antimicrobials) submitted to the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System-Enteric Bacteria (NARMS) from 1997 through 2003 were examined for plasmids and class 1 integrons. Samples originated from cattle, turkey, chicken, and swine presented at federally inspected slaughter and processing plants. Large plasmids (33-291 kb) were present in 83% of the isolates resistant to five or more antimicrobials; however, 16% of the pan-susceptible isolates also had large plasmids. The presence of large plasmids did not correspond to the isolate source or the year the isolate was recovered but did appear to correspond to XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. Two sizes of large plasmids appeared most often: 145.4 kb and 97 kb. Class 1 integrons were not detected on plasmids but were detected on the chromosome of 8% (2/25) of the pan-susceptible isolates and 49% (17/35) of the isolates with multiple drug resistance. Expression of multiple drug resistance among S. Agona isolates occurred regardless of the presence of class 1 integrons, suggesting that plasmids play an equally important role in the development of resistant S. Agona. More research is needed to understand better the mechanisms by which S. Agona acquires, harbors, and transfers resistance determinants.
