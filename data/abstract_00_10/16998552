Daptomycin (Cubicin) is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic that was approved in February 2006 for the European market, including Norway, for the treatment of patients with complicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by Gram-positive cocci. Daptomycin is administered intravenously and eliminated mainly by the kidneys. Dose reduction is therefore necessary in patients with impaired renal function. The drug is active only against Gram-positive cocci. Daptomycin therapy of patients with complicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by Gram-positive cocci, is as effective as standard therapy with intravenous semi-synthetic penicillin or vancomycin. The agent is usually well tolerated, but side effects in skeletal muscles are more prevalent than with semi-synthetic penicillins or vancomycin. To prevent development of daptomycin resistance, the agent should be reserved for the treatment of patients with infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus that are resistant to antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections, e.g. penicillins or clindamycin.
