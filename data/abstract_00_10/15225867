We report the successful treatment with linezolid of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis in a patient with a severe allergic reaction to glycopeptides. Linezolid is a drug with well-recognised activity against S. aureus and proved to be efficacious even in the unusual site of heart valves. This drug could be a good therapeutic choice when glycopeptides treatment is not feasible.
