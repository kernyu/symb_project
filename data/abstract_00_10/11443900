A collection of actinomycin-producing Streptomyces strains, their variants with different levels of antibiotic biosynthesis, and recombinant strains were screened in order to select new strains that produce polyketide antibiotics. Screening with the use of the cloned act gene encoding a component of actinorhodin polyketide synthase (PKS) multienzyme complex from Streptomyces coelicolor revealed that many strains tested can synthesize polyketide antibiotics along with actinomycins. A relationship between biosynthetic pathways of actinomycins and polyketides is discussed.
