Between November 1998 and April 2000, the combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone was evaluated in 47 consecutive patients with multiple myeloma that was resistant to prior high-dose dexamethasone-based therapies. Remission was observed in 22 patients (47%), including six patients with complete remission. Side-effects were frequent, mild and usually reversible, but deep vein thrombosis occurred in 8% of patients. Survival and remission times were longer among patients treated for previous resistant disease rather than for resistant relapse. This experience supports the use of thalidomide-dexamethasone in myeloma patients with resistant disease and justifies further trials in newly diagnosed patients.
