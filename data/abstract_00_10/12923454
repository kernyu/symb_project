Acute rejection resistant to established immunosuppressive rescue protocols remains the most prominent risk factor after intestinal transplantation. In two patients presenting with steroid-resistant severe acute cellular rejection 9 months and 2 years after intestinal transplantation, complete resolution was not achieved despite 5 and 10 days of OKT3 treatment, respectively, and high-dose triple baseline immunosuppression with tacrolimus, rapamycin, and steroids. There was a dissociated course of rejection with persistent moderate to severe rejection in the terminal portion of the graft despite complete recovery from rejection in the proximal parts. Both patients were treated with four subsequent infusions of infliximab (3 mg/kg body weight), a chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody. There was an immediate response regarding macroscopic appearance, graft histology, and clinical symptoms. Both patients recovered. In conclusion, infliximab has proven to be an effective rescue therapy in a selected group of patients with steroid and OKT3 refractory severe acute rejection after intestinal transplantation.
