The activity of cefpirome, cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam previously unused in the hospital was evaluated in parallel with five broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, ciprofloxacin and amikacin) currently being used to treat serious infections in the National University Hospital, Singapore. Two hundred and two clinically significant, organisms consecutively isolated during 1998 were included in the study. In vitro efficacy of cefepime, cefpirome and piperacillin/tazobactam was not superior to imipenem, ciprofloxacin and amikacin which are currently used. More than 40% of Enterbacteriaceae were found to be ESBL producers. The incidence of nosocomial organisms resistant to drugs used in serious infections had increased since 1995. Imipenem-resistance occurred in 34.4% of Acinetobacter spp. and 19.2% Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No single agent appeared to be suitable for empirical monotherapy of serious sepsis.
