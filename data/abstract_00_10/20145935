Bacterial infections can affect all structures of the eye. In most cases, infections of the ocular surface are treatable with topical antibiotics, whereas intraocular infections need a combined treatment with intraocular and systemic antibiotics. Localisation, severity, expected microorganisms, and possible consequences of the infection lead to the appropriate therapy. Unwarranted use of antibiotic substances for prophylaxis or treatment of nonbacterial infection should be avoided, especially because of possible selection of multiresistant microorganisms.
