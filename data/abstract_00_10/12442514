In investigations designed to study sensitivity of 763 clinical strains of microorganisms that belonged to different taxonomic groups with respect to batumin, a new antibiotic recovered from bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, all members of the genus Staphylococcus displayed high sensitivity to batumin irrespective of their sensitivity or resistance to other antibiotics. High selectivity of batumin in respect to representatives of the genus Staphylococcus has been used to create a novel diagnostic preparation diastaph--a batch of paper disks with batumin (5 mkg) spread on them. Results of the trial given to the preparation diastaph suggest to us a high specificity of this identification option for staphylococci of different species in mono- and mixed cultures, a possibility of our using them simultaneously with or instead of the Hew-Leuffson medium, and an expediency of employment of batumin disks for a prompt preindication of staphylococci in a clinical setting while studying a material notable for a high probability that there are bacterial associations involving staphylococci.
