WRKY transcription factors play a central role in transcriptional reprogramming associated with plant immune responses. However, due to functional redundancy, typically the contribution of individual members of this family to immunity is only subtle. Using microarray analysis, we found that the paralogous tomato WRKY genes SlWRKY72a and b are transcriptionally up-regulated during disease resistance mediated by the R gene Mi-1. Virus-induced gene silencing of these two genes in tomato resulted in a clear reduction of Mi-1-mediated resistance as well as basal defense against root-knot nematodes (RKN) and potato aphids. Using Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants, we found that their Arabidopsis ortholog, AtWRKY72, is also required for full basal defense against RKN as well as to the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Despite their similar roles in basal defense against RKN in both tested plant species, WRKY72-type transcription factors in tomato, but not in Arabidopsis, clearly contributed to basal defense against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Of the five R genes that we tested in tomato and Arabidopsis, only Mi-1 appeared to be dependent on WRKY72-type transcription factors. Interestingly, AtWRKY72 target genes, identified by microarray analysis of H. arabidopsidis-triggered transcriptional changes, appear to be largely non-responsive to analogs of the defense hormone salicylic acid (SA). Thus, similarly to Mi-1, which in part acts independently of SA, AtWRKY72 appears to utilize SA-independent defense mechanisms. We propose that WRKY72-type transcription factors play a partially conserved role in basal defense in tomato and Arabidopsis, a function that has been recruited to serve Mi-1-dependent immunity.
