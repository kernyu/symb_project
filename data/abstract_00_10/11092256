BACKGROUND/AIMS: In hepatitis C virus-1b, it has been suggested that an amino acid stretch (aa 2209-2248) of the carboxy terminal half of the non-structural 5A (NS5A) region participates in the response to interferon treatment. We tested the hypothesis that absence of mutations in the NS5A (aa 2209-2248) sequence is required for interferon resistance. We also investigated the importance of different HCV-1b isolates in interferon response in France. METHODS: We determined the NS5A sequences of 70 patients with chronic hepatitis C before IFN therapy and then compared them with HCV-J prototype sequence. The isolates were determined by NS5B sequencing, the "gold standard" method for genotyping and subtyping. Pre-therapeutic viral load was also measured. RESULTS: No sustained virological response was observed in the patients without amino acid substitutions in the NS5A (aa 2209-2248) sequence, and in the patients with HCV-J isolates. Viral load was significantly higher in the patients with no amino acid substitutions in the NS5A (aa 2209-2248) sequence. CONCLUSIONS: In HCV-lb infected patients, an HCV-J strain with no amino acid substitution in the NS5A (aa 2209 2248) region indicates a poor prognosis for response to IFN therapy. The low interferon response rate in HCV-lb infection in Europe is probably not due to a difference between isolates.
