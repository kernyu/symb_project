We report the first clinical isolate of linezolid- and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) in Korea. The minimum inhibitory concentration of linezolid was in direct proportion to the number of copies of the G2576U mutation according to sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 23S rRNA gene.
