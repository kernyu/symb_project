We assessed the distribution, antifungal susceptibility, and treatment associated with 161 non-Candida albicans isolates recovered from hospitalized patients over a 6-month period. The three most prevalent species were C. glabrata (100), C. tropicalis (28), and C. krusei (15). Resistance of C. glabrata to fluconazole and itraconazole were 6% and 17% respectively; 80% of the fluconazole-resistant isolates were cross-resistant to itraconazole. Prior azole exposure significantly reduced azole susceptibility in C. glabrata and also affected its subsequent selection among colonized patients. Only 21% of the patients had clinical infections. Patients with fungemia were more likely to be treated with amphotericin versus an azole. Overall treatment success was higher in patients treated with amphotericin versus an azole (56% vs 31%). Routine susceptibility testing on all Candida species does not appear necessary except where therapy with an azole is being considered to detect resistant isolates or for epidemiologic surveillance purposes. Further studies are needed to delineate the relationship between azole MICs and treatment outcomes of invasive candidiasis due to non-C. albicans species.
