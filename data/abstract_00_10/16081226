The recent global increase in cases of tuberculosis and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis have focused attention on the molecular mechanisms of human antimycobacterial immunity. The macrophage is not only the primary site for Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth but also ordinarily provides the primary lines of host defense against invading pathogens in its role as an effector of innate immunity. The ability of M. tuberculosis to survive and replicate in the host macrophage is critical to its pathogenesis, emphasizing a need for a clearer understanding of its interactions with the host macrophage. Macrophages use varied strategies to kill and destroy invading organisms, including production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates, phagosome maturation and acidification, fusion with lysosomes, exposure to defensins and host cell apoptosis. In human, granulysin is a recently identified antimicrobial protein expressed on cytotoxic T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and NKT cells. It has been shown that granulysin contributes to the defense mechanisms against mycobacterial infection. We hypothesized that human macrophages may possess antimicrobial substances, such as granulysin, and play a role in the defense mechanism.
