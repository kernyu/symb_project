Reported here is the case of a patient with septic shock due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which developed after complicated acute pancreatitis with intra-abdominal abscess. Treatment with colistin methanesulphonate and high doses of meropenem were initiated, but since shock persisted, tigecycline was added to the regimen, resulting in successful resolution of the infection.
