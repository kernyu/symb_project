OBJECTIVES: To analyse antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria associated with ulcerative keratitis in dogs. METHODS: Bacteria isolated from 190 eyes with ulcerative keratitis were identified, and the antibiotic susceptibility of isolates was studied. RESULTS: In total, 258 species of bacteria were isolated from the 190 eyes. Of the isolates, 78 per cent were Gram-positive and 28 per cent were Gram-negative bacteria. The most commonly isolated Gram-positive bacteria in dogs were Staphylococcus spp (49 per cent), Streptococcus spp (7 per cent) and Corynebacterium spp (7 per cent); while Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6 per cent) and Escherichia coli (5.8 per cent) were the commonest Gram-negative pathogens. Resistance to commonly used ophthalmic antibiotics was seen in Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas and Escherichia species isolates. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Isolates from dogs with corneal ulcers in Taiwan may be resistant to several commonly used ophthalmic preparations. Ciprofloxacin showed good action against most isolates, with the notable exception of Streptococcus species. Chloramphenicol or cephalothin had the best in vitro action against the Streptococcus species isolates.
