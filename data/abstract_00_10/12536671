In the antiviral and antibacterial area, increasing drug resistance means that there is an ever growing need for novel approaches towards structures and mechanisms which avoid the current problems. The huge increase in high resolution structural data is set to make a dramatic impact on targeting RNA as a drug target. The examples of the RNA binding antibiotics, particularly, the totally synthetic oxazolidinones, should help persuade the skceptics that clinically useful, selective drugs can be obtained from targeting RNA directly.
