Nectin-1 is an alphaherpesvirus receptor that binds to virion glycoprotein D by the first immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain. The possibility of making animals resistant to pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection has been investigated by generating transgenic mice expressing soluble forms of porcine nectin-1. Previously, transgenic mice were generated that expressed a fusion protein made of the entire ectodomain of nectin-1 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG, or the first Ig-like domain fused to the Fc portion of porcine IgG. Here, the contribution of the second and third Ig-like domains of nectin-1 was analysed by generating transgenic mice expressing the entire ectodomain of nectin-1 fused to the porcine Fc portion. Transgenic mice expressing each of three different fusion proteins were challenged with PRV for comparison of their resistance. Altogether, mice transgenic for a chimera that carried the entire ectodomain were more resistant than those transgenic for a chimera that carried the first Ig-like domain.
