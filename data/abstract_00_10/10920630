Wide use of a succession of different manufactured antimicrobial agents during the past 60 years has prompted the eventual emergence and progressive spread through the world's interconnecting bacterial populations of a growing variety of genes expressing resistance to those agents. The complex processes that spread and link resistance genes into different distributions at different times and places are driven by antimicrobial selection and by contagion. Management of resistance by reducing selection and contagion in a coordinated way requires better information. Most of the information about the spread of resistance exists in laboratory files of isolates at medical centers, and the information about patient antimicrobial use is found in pharmacy files at the same centers. Putting these in a combined database at each center would give a valuable tool to each center's antimicrobial resistance management team. Merging such databases from multiple centers would provide a public health resource for benchmarking, overview surveillance, and general resistometrics.
