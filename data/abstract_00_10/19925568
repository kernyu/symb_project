We describe a 61-year-old male patient with a history of long-term corticosteroid treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who developed subcutaneous nodules on his right forearm. Histopathologic examination showed large epitheloid cell granulomas with multinuclear giant cells that contained hyphae within their cytoplasm. Microbiological testing of biopsies revealed an infection with Scedosporium apiospermum with resistance to common antifungal agents like fluconazole, itraconazole or amphotericin B and sensitivity to voriconazole. After two months of oral therapy with voriconazole the skin lesions have completely cleared according to clinical and sonographic investigations. Adverse effects like nausea and increased photosensitivity immediately disappeared after finishing the 6-month period of voriconazole treatment.
