Three Aeromonas salmonicida strains were isolated from the livers of 265 rainbow trouts sampled. The antibiotic susceptibility test results showed that A. salmonicida strains were susceptible to streptomycine and ciprofloxacin. However, they were resistant to amoxycilline + clavulanic acid, penicillin, erythromycine, oxytetracycline and cefuroxime sodium.
