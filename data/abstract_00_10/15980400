Staphylococcal isolates were examined for possible macrolide-inducible resistance to telithromycin. All macrolide-resistant isolates demonstrated telithromycin D-shaped zones. This result did not discriminate between resistance due to an efflux mechanism (msrA) or a ribosomal target modification (ermA or ermC). Inducible telithromycin resistance in staphylococci does not appear to be analogous to inducible clindamycin resistance.
