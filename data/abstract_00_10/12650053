The aim of this study was to evaluate the drug susceptibility of Enterococcus sp. strains isolated in 2000-2001, from patients of five Warsaw's hospitals (154 strains) and from fecal samples of healthy persons (33 strains). On biochemical reaction profiles species of clinical enterococci were identified as: E. faecalis--66.2%, E. faecium--29.2%, E. hirae--1.9%, E. gallinarum--1.3%, E. casseliflavus--0.6% and E. avium--0.6%. The species of enterococci from stool's samples were identified as: E. faecalis--28 strains, E. durans--2 strains and single strains: E. faecium, E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. Susceptibility to 20 antibiotics was tested by disc diffusion method. None of these 187 enterococcal strains was vancomycin resistant; 3 strains of E. gallinarum and 1--E. casseliflavus demonstrated intermediately susceptibility to vancomycin, but they were susceptible to teicoplanin--phenotype Van C. Among clinical strains were resistant to penicillin--33.3% of E. faecalis and 100% of E. faecium, to ampicillin--over 80% of E. faecium and 1 strain of E. faecalis. None of these strains produced beta-lactamase. High-level resistance to aminoglicoside was expressed by 48 strains (47.1%) E. faecalis and 36 (80%) E. faecium isolated from clinical specimens. Both--HLR to streptomycin and gentamycin were found in 28.3% of E. faecalis and 68.9% of E. faecium. Among 33 strains isolated from fecal samples of healthy persons--3 of E. faecalis were resistant to streptomycin and one was resistant to both gentamicin and streptomycin. In general, enterococcal strains isolated from samples of healthy persons were susceptible to the most of used antibiotics. But to rifampicin none of these strains were susceptible. There were about 40% of E. faecalis strains isolated from healthy persons, resistant to tetracyline.
