Quantitative assessment, using three Pseudomonas sp. strains, of the activity of the microbial biocide Soncid 8101 demonstrated that the values of effective sublethal concentrations (L50) differed by 500% (because of individual variations in the sensitivity of the test strains). The spread of parameters of biocidal activity could be narrowed by using a mixture of microorganisms with high, medium, and weak resistance. A method for quantitative assessment of the activity of microbial biocides was proposed, based on the use of natural associations of soil bacteria.
