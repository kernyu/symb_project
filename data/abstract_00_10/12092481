Gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococci and staphylococci, continue to cause the majority of cases of infective endocarditis. Among the streptococci causing IE, the long-standing predominance of oral or viridans-group streptococci has progressively faded, while the number of cases caused by "enteric streptococci" (Streptococcus bovis and enterococci) has increased. While most oral streptococci and S. bovis strains remain fully sensitive to penicillin, nutritionally variant streptococci--now renamed Abiotrophia--and enterococci can exhibit resistance to penicillin and/or glycopeptides that makes endocarditis more difficult to treat. Among the staphylococci causing endocarditis, the increasing proportion of coagulase-negative and methicillin-resistant strains observed in recent years has changed the approach to choice of antibiotic therapy. The purpose of this paper is to focus on some new aspects of the management of antibiotic therapy of IE due to streptococci and staphylococci, including recent developments such as once-daily aminoglycoside administration in IE, outpatient antibiotic therapy, and the evaluation of new antibiotics.
