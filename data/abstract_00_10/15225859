A collection of 326 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage, transtracheal aspirate or sputum from January 1996-June 2002 were included in this study. The activity of clarithromycin, clindamycin, telithromycin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin against penicillin G and erythromycin A susceptible and resistant pneumococci were determined; the erythromycin A resistance phenotypes and genotypes were identified and susceptibilities of these agents were assessed according to the resistance genotypes. MICs were determined for all strains of pneumococci using an agar dilution method. MLS(B) resistance phenotypes were determined by the double disk (erythromycin A and clindamycin) diffusion method. Genetic determinants for macrolide resistance were identified by PCR using primers specific for erm(B) and mef(A). Erythromycin A resistance was detected in 13.8% of the strains. MLS(B) resistance phenotype was observed in 82% of these (60% being cMLS(B) and 40% being iMLS(B)), and M type resistance in about 18%. All the MLS(B) phenotype strains except four, revealed the presence of erm(B) gene and all except one M phenotype strains revealed the mef(A) gene. Of the erythromycin A resistant pneumococci about 49% were also resistant to clindamycin. No strains were resistant to telithromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid. Telithromycin had the lowest MIC values for both erythromycin A resistant and susceptible strains of all the antiribosomal agents tested. The most prevalent mechanism of macrolide resistance was mediated by the erm(B) gene leading to the expression of MLS(B) phenotype. Telithromycin was the most active antiribosomal agent, regardless of the macrolide resistance genotype of the pneumococci tested.
