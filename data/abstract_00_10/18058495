Reaction in leprosy, nerve damage/deformities, drug resistance/relapses, may come as yet another challenge. Their management too is intriguing and has been dealt with carefully. In addition, special situations such as pregnancy and concomitant HIV/tuberculosis also need care for their effective management. To facilitate a comprehensive appraisal, the subject has been bifurcated into management of leprosy per se were multidrug therapy (MDT) is widely the accepted and acclaimed treatment option. The former has been dealt with in depth in an adjoining article, while the latter forms the contents of the current paper. The salient contents of the text are illustrated by exemplary literature, which should provide an adequate and comprehensive source of information for the academic work force, under- and post-graduate students of dermatology, health workers and treating physicians involved in the care of leprosy patients, and facilitate decision making or options for treatment in a given case.
