Campylobacteriosis, an infectious disease caused by Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, is treated by fluoroquinolone antibiotics in clinical practices. However, use of these drugs in animal husbandry may select for fluoroquinolone-resistant campylobacters and, thereby, compromise the clinical treatment of infection. In this study, 21 fluoroquinolone-resistant campylobacters were isolated from poultry samples. Morphological and biochemical characteristics indicated that 19 isolates were C. jejuni and two were C. coli. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics but sensitive to chloramphenicol and gentamicin. These isolates were characterized at the molecular level by amplifying the flagellin gene (flaA) by PCR. The PCR protocol amplified a 1.7-kb flaA gene from all isolates. RFLP analysis of the 1.7-kb amplicons after digestion with DdeI yielded four distinct patterns. The 21 fluoroquinolone-resistant campylobacter isolates were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and compared with the PFGE patterns of nine fluoroquinolone-sensitive campylobacter strains. Four of the 21 fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were untypable by the PFGE protocol. The PFGE analysis with SalI or SmaI indicated that seven or five, respectively, of the 17 resistant isolates had identical macrorestriction profiles (mrps). However, PFGE analysis with a combination of SalI and SmaI indicated that four of the 17 isolates had similar macrorestriction profiles. The PFGE patterns of the 17 fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were different from the nine sensitive campylobacter strains.
