The management of antibiotherapy in elderly patients is a unique and challenging problem. Old patients often suffer more serious complications of infection, more serious adverse events and drug interaction with drug therapy. The choice of antibiotherapy must also take into account the evolution of bacterial ecology. About one third of persons older than 80 and a higher proportion of elderly disabled patients reside in long term care facilities. And now, bacterial flora in institutions remains intermediate between that of community acquired infections and the more antibiotic resistant hospital flora.
