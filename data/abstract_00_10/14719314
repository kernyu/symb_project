Handwashing is considered the most important and effective infection control measure to prevent transmission of nosocomial pathogens. However, compliance with handwashing by health care workers is low. A new modality for hand hygiene is alcohol gel rub, which reduces time required, does not damage the skin and increases health care workers compliance. An observational study was conducted to assess the effect of alcohol-gel hand antiseptic on infection rates due to the 3 more frequent multi-resistant bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae y Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in our hospital. Two periods were compared, 12 months before and 12 months after starting alcohol gel use. The second period (AG use) showed a significant reduction on incidence rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae with extended spectrum betalactamase (RR: 0.38) overall infections and specially bacteremias (RR: 0.10). Nevertheless, on the basis of this study, we cannot conclude that the result was due to AG itself or to an increase in hand-hygiene compliance.
