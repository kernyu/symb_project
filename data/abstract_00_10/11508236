The studies have showed the frequency and spectrum of drug resistance, determined by the methods of proportions and absolute concentrations, to be virtually equal. This suggests that both methods are of equal diagnostic value. The method of absolute concentrations is rather accurate and similar to that of proportions in sensitivity, by ensuring comprehensive determination of the spectrum of drug resistance. Furthermore, the advantages of this method are its simplicity, accessibility, and cost-efficiency.
