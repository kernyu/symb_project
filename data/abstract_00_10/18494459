Synthesis and biological evaluation of new derivatives of 1,5-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2-methyl-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl-1H-pyrrole (BM 212, 16) are reported. Variously substituted phenyl rings with different substitution pattern and lipophilicity were added to the pyrrole nucleus to evaluate their influence on the activity toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and atypical mycobacteria. The most active derivatives showed activity between 0.125-0.5 microg/mL (better than 16 and streptomycin) and protection index (64-256) higher than 16 (4) and similar to isoniazid and streptomycin (128).
