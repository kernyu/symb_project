OBJECTIVE: To observe the base of the interference in correlated biotic active matter obtained multi-drug resistance induced by chemotherapy for different alkaloid, and to supervise the use in clinic to restrain the multi-drug resistant of chemotherapy, and thereby to improve the curative effect. METHOD: After bestowing subter-dosage unite chemotherapeutant to ascites S180 mouse to set up the mouse models of multi-drug resistance of S180 tumour cell, and giving the mouse matrine, terandrine, oxymatrine and berberine hydrooh loride for 4 weeks, the P170, LRP, TOPOII, Fas and apoposis were determined by flow cytometry. RESULT: Matrine and terandrine could obviously reduce the express of P170, LRP and the activation of TOPOII, and increase the ratio of the express of Fas and the apoposis of drug resistant tumour cell. And at the same time it could obviously reduce the express of intercellular adhesion molecule(CD54). CONCLUSION: Matrine and terandrine can interfere in MDR which results from chemotherapeutics by the adjustment of correlated biotic active matter, besides, the different degree of alkaloid effect with different configuration.
