The resistance determinants were transferred from clinical strains of enterococci to Staphylococcus aureus strains. As recipients methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains were used and the filter-mating procedure was performed. The transconjugants resistant to erythromycin were obtained in the case of all recipients, in one case the vanA determinant conferring the resistance to vancomycin was transferred together with erythromycin resistance. However the resistance was very unstable and the level was not as high as in the case of Enterococcus faecalis donor strain. The vanA determinant was easily transferred between enterococcal strains by the conjugation and a transfer occurred of vanA alone or together with erythromycin resistance.
