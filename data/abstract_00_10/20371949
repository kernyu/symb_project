The dynamic, hemolytic and hemagglutination activities and the antibiotic resistance of non-O1 Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS), isolated by standard membrane filtration methods from suburban and rural groundwater supplies, were carried out. Detectable non-O1 V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa was present in 81% and 88% of samples. The total occurrence of FC and FS during the period of study was 94%. The annual average densities of non-O1 V. cholerae were 4,903 MPN/100 mL. While, they were 206, 1,891 and 1,246 cfu/100 mL for P. aeruginosa, FC and FS respectively. Non-O1 V. cholerae strains had the highest percentage of hemolytic activities (alpha + beta) (71.29%), whereas 20.71% of FS, 16.88% of FC and 9.13% of P. aeruginosa strains produced hemolysin. Bacterial strains isolated were found to be adhesive, with percentages of 63.09%, 65.09%, 84.06% and 87.98% respectively for non-O1 V. cholerae, FS, FC and P. aeruginosa. As for antibiotic resistance, the overall resistance of non-O1 V. cholerae strains was 79%, whereas it was 100% for the other bacteria. Non-O1 V. cholerae resistance was expressed towards sulfamethoxazole (75%), streptomycin (62%) and cephalothin (60%). Obtained results indicated correlation between bacteriological pollution and their public health implications.
