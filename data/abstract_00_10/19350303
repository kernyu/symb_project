Since acne vulgaris is the combined result of a bacterial infection and the inflammatory response to that infection, we examined whether Abies koreana essential oil (AKE) possessed anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities against skin pathogens. In this study, AKE showed excellent antibacterial activities against drug-susceptible and -resistant Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are acne-causing bacteria. In addition, AKE reduced the LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, NO and PGE(2) in RAW 264.7 cells, indicating that it has anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we suggest that AKE may be an attractive candidate for promoting skin health.
