We investigated the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in China and determined the susceptibility of S. aureus to 26 antimicrobial agents, including ceftobiprole, linezolid, and tigecycline. A total of 798 isolates were collected and tested by agar dilution. The mean prevalence of MRSA was 50.4%, the highest in Shanghai (80.3%), followed by those in Beijing (55.5%) and Shenyang (50.0%). Only 4.2% to 12.6% of MRSA were susceptible to erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, and tetracycline. All isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and ceftobiprole.
