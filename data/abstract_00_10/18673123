Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading infectious killers in the world. New anti-TB drugs and more effective drug combinations are urgently needed, particularly given the increasing incidence of drug-resistant TB and HIV-TB co-infection. This review describes the available mouse models of TB and describes their utility in the evaluation of new TB drug candidates and in the evaluation of the efficacy of new TB drug combinations. Some of the most recent patents on promising TB drug-candidates are also mentioned here.
