Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate CY-1, which was resistant to ceftazidime, harbored a conjugative ca. 250-kb plasmid that contained a class 1 integron with two gene cassettes encoding OXA-32, an OXA-2- type beta-lactamase, and the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(6')Ib(9). OXA-32 differed from OXA-2 by an Leu169Ile amino acid substitution (class D numbering). Site-directed mutagenesis established that Ile169 is responsible for resistance to ceftazidime but not to cefotaxime.
