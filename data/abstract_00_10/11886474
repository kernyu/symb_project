OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of two commonly employed treatments for Helicobacter pylori infection and the impact of bacterial resistance to antibiotics on eradication rate. METHODS: Ninety-two consecutive H. pylori-positive patients with active peptic ulcer disease were randomly enrolled to receive a 7-day treatment with either lansoprazole 30 mg plus amoxicillin 1 g and clarithromycin 500 mg [all twice a day (b.i.d.), Group A, n = 46]; or bismuth subcitrate 125 mg four times a day (q.i.d.) plus tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d and furazolidone 200 mg b.i.d. (Group B, n = 46) H. pylori status was reassessed 30 days after completion of the therapy and bacterial resistance to the antibiotics was investigated using an in vitro assay. RESULTS: Five patients from each study group were lost to follow up. Both treatments resulted in similar H. pylori eradication rate: 66-60% (per protocol), 59-52% (intention-to-treat) in Groups A and B, respectively (non significant). However, eradication improved to 79% in the absence of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin or amoxicillin. CONCLUSION: Primary resistance to clarithromycin or amoxicillin may underscore a potentially serious problem for the eradication of H. pylori infection. Testing for bacterial resistance may become necessary to improve therapeutic efficacy.
