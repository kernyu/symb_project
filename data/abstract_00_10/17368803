We compared in vitro activities of carbapenems against 264 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) isolates. The MIC(50)/MIC(90) (microg/mL) values of imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and panipenem were 1/1, 0.25/0.25, 0.25/0.5, and 0.125/0.25, respectively. The susceptibility rates to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem were 0%, 85.2%, and 99.6%, respectively. Compared with imipenem and meropenem, ertapenem and panipenem had better in vitro activities against PRSP.
