Mice deficient in the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible, immunity-related GTPase Irgm1 have defective host resistance to a variety of intracellular pathogens. This greater susceptibility to infection is associated with impaired IFN-gamma-dependent macrophage microbicidal activity in vitro. Here we show that Irgm1 also regulated the survival of mature effector CD4(+) T lymphocytes by protecting them from IFN-gamma-induced autophagic cell death. Mice deficient in both IFN-gamma and Irgm1 were 'rescued' from the lymphocyte depletion and greater mortality that occurs in mice singly deficient in Irgm1 after mycobacterial infection. Our studies identify a feedback mechanism in the T helper type 1 response that limits the detrimental effects of IFN-gamma on effector T lymphocyte survival while promoting the antimicrobial functions of IFN-gamma.
