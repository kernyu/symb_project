BACKGROUND: In an era of growing concern about bacterial resistance and hospital costs, limiting the use of broad spectrum antibiotics is important. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of an antibiotic restriction policy on expenditures, antimicrobial resistance rates and clinical outcomes of hospitalized children. DESIGN: Starting in January, 1997, a prior consultation with an infectious disease specialist for using restricted antibiotics was required in all hospital areas. A retrospective assessment of study objectives obtained 2 years before (1995, 1996) and 2 years after (1997, 1998) initiation of the restriction policy was performed. SETTING: The present study was conducted in a 500-bed university hospital serving children nationwide of a developing country, Panama. RESULTS: Total expenditures for antimicrobial agents decreased by 50%, from $699,543 (US dollars) during 1995 and 1996 to $347,261 during 1997 and 1998. Susceptibility rates of many nosocomial isolates (especially staphylococci and Gram-negative enteric bacilli) usually improved for restricted antibiotics with >35% reduction in utilization (notably for gentamicin, third generation cephalosporins, piperacillin and vancomycin). Major improvements in bacterial susceptibilities were observed in the nursery, a place harboring microorganisms exhibiting the higher initial resistance rates of the hospital. No differences in days of hospital stay and mortality rates of all patients and of children with nosocomial infections were detected during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Requirement for prior approval of selected antimicrobial drugs in a pediatric institution decreases hospital expenditures and improves susceptibilities to antibiotics without compromising patient outcomes or length of hospital stays.
