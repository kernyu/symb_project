Adaptive status was assessed in 50 children. Lysosomal-cationic test was carried out in healthy children and 20 patients with complicated hemangioma. Photochromotherapy was followed by enhanced functional potential of neutrophil granules. That was indicated by greater values of lysosomal-cationic test results as well as by higher counts of high-concentration cationic proteins. Elevated non-specific resistance was accounted for by antistressor reactions.
