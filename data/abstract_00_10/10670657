The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the resistance against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) using an interferon-alpha1 (IFN-alpha1) transgene in specifically targeted cells in vitro. Transfection of mouse fibroblast L929 cells with an IFN-alpha1 plasmid construct reduced viral load and viral gene expression in a time-dependent fashion. Supernatants from IFN-alpha1-transfected cells augmented natural killer (NK) cell activity, and such an effect was antagonized with neutralizing antibody to IFN-alpha/beta. In addition, transfected cells displayed an increase in the IFN inducible genes (2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase [2',5'-OAS], T cell-specific guanine nucleotide triphosphate-binding protein, IFN regulatory factor 1 [IRF-1], and major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class I) compared with plasmid vector-treated controls. Collectively, these results show that IFN-alpha1 transfection of cells in vitro induces or upregulates a spectrum of IFN-regulated genes involved in the direct or indirect antiviral action of this cytokine. In addition, the transgene significantly increases the resistance of transfected cells in vitro to HSV-1 infection.
