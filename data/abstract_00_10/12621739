We experienced a case in the infant of the bacterial meningitis due to beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (BLNAR) which has increased in recent years. In the present condition, the sensitivity of the bacteria to the antibacterial-drug used as the initial treatment for the bacterial meningitis is sometimes inadequate. If it takes into consideration that BLNAR participates in H. influenzae meningitis, it will be one of the choice to use meropenem with other antibacterial-drug concomitantly.
