The intrinsic resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related pathogens to most common antibiotics limits chemotherapeutic options to treat tuberculosis and other mycobacterial diseases. Resistance has traditionally been attributed to the unusual multi-layer cell envelope that functions as an effective barrier to the penetration of antibiotics. Recent insights into mechanisms that neutralize the toxicity of antibiotics in the cytoplasm have revealed systems that function in synergy with the permeability barrier to provide intrinsic resistance. Here, we highlight the growing pool of information about internal, antibiotic-responsive regulatory proteins and corresponding resistance genes, and present new concepts that rationalize how they might have evolved. Pharmaceutical inhibition of these intrinsic systems could make many previously available antibiotics active against M. tuberculosis.
