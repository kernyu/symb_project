Structure-activity relationships of aryl alkynyl synergists of the general formula of Ar-Q-R, where Q represents a bridging structure, were studied using a standardised testing system and Relative Potency values. Ethers, esters, oxime ethers, amides and amines were prepared and evaluated. The length of the R-alkynyl chain, the role of the bridge and the substitution of the aromatic ring were examined systematically. The most potent compounds possessed an aromatic ring connected via a bridge of three atoms to an alkynyl chain, forming together a linear side-chain of six atoms. Several highly potent compounds were synthesised of which one (MB-599; proposed common name verbutin) was selected for development as a selective insecticide synergist in crop protection. Its high potential at practical insecticide:synergist ratios makes possible the reduction of the total amount of insect-control chemicals applied, and its use as an additive to produce new formulations of existing insecticides makes it highly advantageous in resistance management, giving a new tool to sustain the effectiveness of a wide range of insecticides. A product containing a (1+1) mixture of verbutin and beta-cypermethrin was launched in Hungary in 2002.
