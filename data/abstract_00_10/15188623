We report three cases with methotrexate-vinblastin-adriamycin-cisplatin (MVAC) resistant multiple liver metastases of urothelial carcinoma that responded to combination chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine plus carboplatin (GC) with additional docetaxel (GCD) as salvage chemotherapy. Case 1: A 55-year-old man underwent left nephroureterectomy for ureteral cancer (TCC, G3, pT3pN1M0). Three courses of GC followed by three courses of GCD were given via intra-hepatic arterial infusion for multiple liver metastases, which appeared after adjuvant high-dose MVAC therapy. Complete response was obtained and maintained for 11 months. Case 2: A 46-year-old man underwent radical cystectomy for locally advanced bladder cancer (TCC G3 + adenocarcinoma. pT3pN0M0). Two courses of GC followed by 2 courses of GCD systemic therapies were performed for multiple liver metastases, which appeared after adjuvant high-dose MVAC therapy. Partial response was obtained and maintained for six months. Case 3: A 66-year-old man received three courses of MVAC for multiple metastases of the bladder cancer (TCC, G3, > pT2), which resulted in disease progression. Eight courses of GC followed by six courses of GCD were administrated via intra-hepatic arterial infusion. Partial response was obtained and maintained for 12 months. Although the response duration was still short, GC and GCD may be promising salvage chemotherapeutic regimens for the patients with MVAC-resistant liver metastases of urothelial carcinoma.
