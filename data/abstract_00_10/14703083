Evolution of bacterial resistance to certain antibacterial agents in horses in a veterinary hospital. A total of 255 antibiograms, conducted according to the Kirby-Bauer method from bacterial isolates collected from horses at the Hopital Veterinaire d'Enseignement at the Universite de Montreal between 1996 and 1998 were compared with the results obtained about 10 years ago with corresponding bacterial species. A significant increase in the percentage of strains resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SXT), penicilline, tetracycline, and to gentamicin was observed. The percentages of isolates of Actinobacillus spp. and coagulase-positive staphylococci resistant to TMP-SXT increased from 0% to 17% and from 0% to 33%, respectively, (P < 0.05). The percentage of isolates of Actinobacillus spp resistant to penicilline also increased from 33% to 73% (P < 0.05). Regular monitoring of the evolution of bacterial resistance to antibacterial agents is indispensable in a hospital structure. The adoption of "good antibiotherapy practices" is essential to guarantee a decrease in the risks of selection and dissemination of a resistant bacterial strain.
