We report a case of fluconazole-resistant oropharyngeal colonization caused by a strain of Candida glabrata that rapidly regained susceptibility once prophylaxis with this agent was discontinued and echinocandin therapy was initiated. Isolates collected before and after discontinuation of fluconazole were confirmed to be isogenic by RAPD analysis. Transcription analysis demonstrated constitutive expression of genes encoding efflux pumps in the isolate recovered on fluconazole prophylaxis and transient expression in those isolates collected after fluconazole was discontinued.
