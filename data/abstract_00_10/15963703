During the course of pathogens penetrating the plant cell, besides of chemical secretion, the pathogens may cause mechanical signal by the physical pressure on the plant cell. In the current study, we took the stress as the mechanical signal elicitor to find the effect of plant resistance induced by stress. The results showed that an appropriate stress stimulation can evidently improve the plant resistance. However, disruption the plasma membrane-cell wall adhesion will absolutely eliminate this kind of inducement effect, which suggests that the plant resistance inducement by stress depend on the adhesion of plasma membrane-cell wall. Also we found that stress stimulation may cause synthesis of lignin and increase the activity of phenylalaninc ammonial lyase (PAL) chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase obviously. The results showed that stress stimulation may not only enhance ability of the plant cell resistant to pathogen penetration but also elicit the accumulation of pathogens suppression or antimicrobial chemical substance in the plant cell.
