Variable antiretroviral drug penetration into the genital tract may contribute to the differential evolution of HIV-1 and the emergence of drug resistance. We compared concentrations of darunavir in 34 time-matched blood plasma and seminal plasma samples from 18 HIV-1 positive men. Darunavir in seminal plasma were approximately 10-20% of that achieved in blood at matched time points postdrug ingestion. All seminal plasma darunavir were above the protein-corrected EC(5)(0) values for wild-type HIV-1.
