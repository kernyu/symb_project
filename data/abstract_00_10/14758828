Faecal egg counts (FECs) were made on samples from 1383 horses on 64 farms in northern Germany between August 2000 and November 2001. There were significant differences between the mean FECs in the two years; in 2000, 59.6 per cent of 369 samples were positive and in 2001, 32.6 per cent of 1014 samples were positive for strongyle eggs. The results of a FEC reduction test indicated that resistance to fenbendazole was present on all 10 farms where it had been used, including in 33 of 60 horses tested. In contrast, treatment with ivermectin resulted in the complete elimination of nematode eggs in all the 77 horses tested. The mean LD50 values of the egg hatch test for thiabendazole indicated resistance on all 20 farms investigated and in 94 of 134 samples (70 per cent).
