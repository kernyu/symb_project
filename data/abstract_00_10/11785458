The application of sophisticated molecular biology, genetics and genomics has made possible the advanced analyses of microbial genes, the topology of DNA and chromosomes, and insight into the regulation of gene expression during all stages of the life cycle of microbes, both in vitro and in vivo. The struggle to control contagious pathogens continues world wide amidst resistance emergence to many classes of antimicrobial agents. Many hospital, research and community labs are applying themselves to a more thorough understanding of the molecular basis of this resistance. New drugs which improve on predecessor agents were presented. The following classes of antimicrobial agents were represented: quinolones, cephems, macrolides and natural products. New target opportunities against both lethal (essential) gene targets and virulence targets were presented throughout the conference. In addition, increasing attention to the involvement of microbial life forms in immune function and dysfunction were described in numerous presentations.
