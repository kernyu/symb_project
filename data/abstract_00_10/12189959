The active, population-based surveillance system of the Georgia EIP has provided valuable insights into the characteristics of invasive pneumococcal disease in Georgia and continues to provide an important mechanism to assess the impact of the newly introduced PCV7 vaccine. The problem of antimicrobial resistance has been carefully documented among isolates from invasive pneumococcal disease in all age groups, particularly young children. Fluoroquinolone resistance is now present in our area and will require close monitoring in the coming months and years. Over 80% of invasive pneumococcal disease and over 85% of penicillin and cefotaxime resistant invasive disease occurring in young children in our surveillance area involve serotypes included in the new conjugate vaccine approved for use in children. Preliminary data suggest an early decline in invasive pneumococcal disease in young children has occurred since the introduction of the conjugate vaccine and the effect upon the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance remains to be determined. The high rates of invasive pneumococcal disease, the significant associated morbidity and mortality and antimicrobial resistance highlight the need for enhanced prevention measures in both adults and children. Ongoing surveillance in the Georgia EIP will allow accurate measurement of the impact of prevention efforts, provide essential information on trends in antimicrobial resistance and document any changes in the pneumococcal serotypes responsible for invasive disease in the conjugate vaccine era.
