Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging problem among nosocomial bacteria. Risk factors for the recovery of ceftriaxone-resistant (CRCF) or -susceptible (CSCF) Citrobacter freundii in clinical cultures from hospitalized patients were determined by using a case-case-control study design. CRCF was isolated from 43 patients (case group 1) and CSCF was isolated from 87 patients (case group 2) over a 3-year period. Risk factors for CRCF were exposure to imipenem (odds ratio [OR], 7.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 45.4), broad-spectrum cephalosporins (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.8 to 26.7), vancomycin (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 7.4), or piperacillin-tazobactam (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.2), as well as hospital length of stay >or=1 week (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 10.2) and intensive care unit (ICU) stay (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.2). Risk factors for CSCF were peripheral vascular disease (OR, 23.2; 95% CI, 4.3 to 124.6), AIDS (OR, 9.5; 95% CI, 1.6 to 55.5), cerebrovascular disease (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 10.8), and ICU stay (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.8 to 5.4).
