The epidemiological and antifungal susceptibility data for 94 episodes of candidaemia in an Italian tertiary-care hospital between January 2000 and August 2003 were evaluated by prospective laboratory-based surveillance. The incidence of fungaemia was 0.90 episodes/10 000 patient-days, and the most common species isolated were Candida albicans (40.4%), Candida parapsilosis (22.3%), Candida tropicalis (16.0%) and Candida glabrata (12.8%). Among 24 patients who received antifungal prophylaxis, non-albicans Candida spp. were more prevalent than C. albicans (p 0.012). The 30-day mortality rate was high (38.2%), particularly for haematological (71.4%) and solid-organ transplant patients (50.0%), and in individuals with C. tropicalis and C. glabrata bloodstream infections (60.0% and 50.0%, respectively). In-vitro susceptibility tests demonstrated that 95% of the isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B (MIC < 2 mg/L), 98.1% to posaconazole (MIC < 1 mg/L), 95.8% to flucytosine (MIC < 32 mg/L) and fluconazole (MIC < 64 mg/L), and 94.7% to itraconazole (MIC < 1 mg/L). Posaconazole was active (MIC 0.5 mg/L) against all three isolates of Candida krusei, which had reduced susceptibility to both fluconazole and itraconazole. Overall, non-albicans Candida spp. accounted for 60% of the episodes of candidaemia, which could be related to the use of antifungal prophylaxis. Resistance is still uncommon in Candida spp. recovered from blood cultures. The in-vitro activity of posaconazole is encouraging, and this agent could play an important role in the management of invasive candidiasis, including episodes caused by inherently less susceptible species such as C. krusei.
