The efficacy of oral telithromycin 800mg once daily for 7 days was evaluated in a multicentre, multinational study in patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin and/or erythromycin. Per-protocol clinical and bacteriological outcomes were assessed 10-17 days post-therapy. Of the 129 patients with S. pneumoniae infection, 16 were infected with strains resistant to penicillin and/or erythromycin. Fifteen of these 16 patients (93.8%) were assessed as clinically and bacteriologically cured at the post-therapy visit.
