Helicobacter pylori infects over 50% of the worldwide population. For eradication, European, Canadian, and American guidelines recommend a regimen consisting of a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and metronidazole or amoxicillin dosed twice daily for at least 7 days. When this treatment strategy fails, a complex, multidosed bismuth-based quadruple regimen is recommended. Unfortunately, for patients with heart failure, this salvage regimen can be potentially hazardous due to the drug-drug interaction with tetracycline and digoxin, as well as the large salicylate content with bismuth subsalicylate. As H. pylori infection is so prevalent, providers will most likely encounter such a therapeutic dilemma. A safe, effective, and simplistic alternative is a 10-day fluoroquinolone-based regimen consisting of a proton pump inhibitor, levofloxacin and either clarithromycin or amoxicillin. Levofloxacin demonstrates excellent bioavailability, widespread tissue and fluid distribution, extended half-life, limited drug interaction profile, low incidence of side effects, and remarkable activity against H. pylori with minimal primary resistance. Compared to the 7-day quadruple regimen, a 10-day levofloxacin-based regimen demonstrated a greater eradication rate, better tolerability, and a lower rate of therapy discontinuation. We briefly provide a summary of the data regarding this levofloxacin-based regimen and two successful cases from our heart failure clinic.
