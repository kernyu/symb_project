OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of rational drug use and laboratory service in preventing the emergence of multiple antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus in developing countries. DATA SOURCE: Literature search on compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM) Medline and Internet using the key words: Staphylococcus and antibiotic resistance. A few articles were manually reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant studies or articles on antibiotic resistance with special reference to Eastern Africa, region are included in the review. DATA EXTRACTION: From individual studies or articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Evidence for the spread of S. aureus multiple antibiotic resistance is synchronized under the headings: Introduction, current situation, antibiotic resistance control strategies, are outlined. CONCLUSION: There is need for concerted efforts between different groups to monitor changes in the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus. Strategies aimed at preventing transmission of resistant strains are remarkably effective when strictly enforced. Necessary attention should be given on the subject so that meaningful control measures preventing the expansion of antimicrobial resistance can be formulated, thereby ensuring the future successful treatment of Staphylococcal infections.
