Tea (Camellia sinensis) has been known for its modulation of resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to beta-lactam antibiotics in vitro. This study aimed to confirm the in vitro effect of green tea extracts with beta-lactams and to determine whether green tea extracts can reduce the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amoxicillin in MRSA-infected mice. The catechins in the test tea that account for the reduced resistance to beta-lactams were quantitatively determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The MICs of the ampicillin, cefazolin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, tea extract alone and tea extract in combination with beta-lactams were determined. Proportions of tea extracts and amoxicillin-tea extract combinations were administered to groups of mice enterally. The in vitro experiment showed that the MICs of four beta-lactams were greatly decreased in the presence of 0.25% tea extract. However, in an in vivo experiment, amoxicillin in combination with 5% tea extract conferred a higher ED(50) than that of antibiotic alone. Green tea extract, alone or in combination with amoxicillin, does not have protective benefits in MRSA-infected mice. This study concluded that tea extract weakened the antibacterial effect of amoxicillin in MRSA infected mice. Tea drinking is not recommended in combination with amoxicillin treatment.
