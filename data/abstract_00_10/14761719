Susceptibilities to amphotericin B and fluconazole of 383 Candida species isolated from blood were determined. Candida albicans was the most common species (55.6%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (17.5%), Candida tropicalis (16.5%), Candida glabrata (5.2%), Candida guilliermondii (2.3%), and others (2.9%). All but three isolates, Candida ciferrii, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata, one each, were susceptible to amphotericin B. A total of 367 (95.8%) and 15 (4.2%) isolates were susceptible and susceptible-dose dependent to fluconazole, respectively. Only one isolate, a C. glabrata, was resistant to fluconazole. Few patients (13%) having prior fluconazole treatments may explain the low rate of resistance to fluconazole in this study.
