During January-March 2001, two U.S. citizens died from malaria after taking chloroquine alone or with proguanil for malaria chemoprophylaxis in countries with known chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Chloroquine-containing chemoprophylaxis regimens are not recommended by CDC for persons traveling to areas with known chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. This report summarizes the investigation of the two cases and underscores the need for clinicians and travelers to know the recommended options for malaria chemoprophylaxis when traveling to locations with chloroquine-resistant malaria.
