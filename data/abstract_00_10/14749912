OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns observed in the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) in several locations of five countries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional, descriptive study. Random sample of 12,264 paediatric outpatients seen by paediatricians or general practitioners (GPs). Data on patient demographics, diagnoses and treatment were collected. Diagnoses were coded by ICD-9 and drugs by ATC classification. Patients diagnosed with AOM (ICD-9 codes: 381 and 382) were selected for analysis. RESULTS: Cases of AOM (873) accounted for 7.1% of the sample. There is a clear variation in the percentage of children diagnosed with AOM and treated with antibiotics in the different locations, antibiotic prescriptions being higher in Barcelona (93% of children), and lowest in Smolensk (56.4 % of children were treated without antibiotics). The antibiotics used varied widely: ampicillin use is almost limited to Smolensk (26.7%) and Bratislava (13.8%), whereas amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid is the choice in Toulouse (33.8%), Valencia (30.2%) and Barcelona (28.9%), and cephalosporins are more frequently prescribed in Tenerife (51.7%). Finally, macrolides are used in Barcelona (18.3%), Valencia (17.5%) and Tenerife (13.6%), but not prescribed in Toulouse or Sofia. Prescriptions of anti-inflammatory drugs were only relevant in Valencia (31.7%), Tenerife (27.2%) and Toulouse (17.4%) and of otological preparations in Sofia, where almost each child received ear drops (91.9%). Nasal preparations are commonly used only in Sofia (41.9%), Bratislava (65.5%) and Smolensk (68.6%). CONCLUSION: Despite the general agreement of most guidelines, wide differences in the treatment of uncomplicated AOM in children are observed. Non-antibiotic therapy for AOM and the use of first-choice antibiotics should be more actively encouraged in the primary care centres. Studies to measure prevailing rates of antibiotic resistance in these populations are needed.
