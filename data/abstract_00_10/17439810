"Swedres 2005", the fifth report on Swedish antibiotic utilisation and resistance in human medicine, was presented in May 2006. Compared with the rest of Europe, antibiotic consumption and resistance levels in Sweden are relatively low. However, global travel and trade facilitate the spread of bacteria between countries and continents. As a consequence, also in Sweden, increasing resistance trends are seen for some pathogens, notably ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae.
