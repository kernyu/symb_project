Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens were sequentially identified in a patient who underwent small bowel transplantation. Molecular typing and plasmid analysis suggested that the KPC gene was acquired by E. coli, most likely from K. pneumoniae, and was subsequently transferred to S. marcescens.
