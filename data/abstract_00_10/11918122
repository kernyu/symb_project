Investigation of a cluster of hospital inpatients colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) revealed a point-prevalence of 19.1%. The outbreak was controlled using established guidelines and additional strategies, including minimizing patient transfers and enforcing appropriate antibiotic prescribing. The incidence of VRE has remained low during the ensuing 30 months.
