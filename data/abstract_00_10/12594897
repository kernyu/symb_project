INTRODUCTION: The increasing number of enterococcal infections in hospitals and reports about the development of resistance of these bacteria make it necessary to review their importance as co-pathogens in secondary peritonitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial on primary therapy of secondary peritonitis was carried out in six centers comparing cephalosporin-based antibiotic therapy to acylaminopenicillin-based therapy. RESULTS: Enterococci were only cultured in 6 of 110 cases from the abdomen and were found in only 5 cases of postoperative complications. No differences were found between penicillin-based vs. cephalosporin-based therapy. CONCLUSION: The study supports the view that these bacteria continue to play a minor role in secondary peritonitis. The point has to be emphasized, however, that the patients under study were in relatively good condition (APACHE II median 9 for cephalosporins and 10 for penicillins) and that postoperative cases of peritonitis were excluded.
