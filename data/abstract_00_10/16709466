Since the 1990s, the major approach to hookworm control has been morbidity reduction in school-aged children by periodic deworming with benzimidazoles. Now, efforts are underway to determine the feasibility of integrating deworming with control programs that target other neglected tropical diseases. However, the sustainability of benzimidazole deworming for hookworm is of concern because of the variable efficacy of mebendazole, high rates of post-treatment reinfection and possible development of drug resistance. This requires parallel efforts to develop new and complementary hookworm control tools, such as new anthelmintic drugs (e.g. tribendimidine) and a recombinant hookworm vaccine. It is hoped that, ultimately, anthelmintic vaccination will be linked to deworming as part of an expanded control package.
