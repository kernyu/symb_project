It has been reported that spontaneous or interferon (IFN)-induced hepatitis B e (HBe) seroconversion has usually been associated with the development of a stop codon in the precore region. However, the difference between lamivudine-induced seroconversion and spontaneous or IFN-induced seroconversion is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the evolution of the precore and core promoter mutations and lamivudine-induced seroconversion. Forty-five patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection who were treated with lamivudine for more than 1 year were enrolled. The nucleotide sequence of the precore and core promoter region was determined before and after treatment with lamivudine for 1 year. Among 29 patients who were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive before treatment, 12 (41.3%) lost HBeAg during the course of treatment for 1 year. Of these, eight patients (66.7%) still had precore wild type HBV after 1 year. After 1 year, reversion to precore wild type HBV was detected in 11 (64.7%) of 17 patients who had precore mutant HBV before treatment. Twelve (70.6%) of 17 patients who were persistently HBeAg-positive had precore wild type HBV before and after treatment for 1 year. Despite the loss of HBeAg, two thirds of the patients still had precore wild type HBV after the 1-year treatment. It is suggested that lamivudine-induced seroconversion differs from spontaneous or IFN-induced seroconversion in the change of nucleotides in the precore region. The reversion in the precore region may be caused by the difference of drug-susceptibility to lamivudine. The antiviral effect of lamivudine may be more effective in the precore mutant HBV than in the precore wild type HBV.
