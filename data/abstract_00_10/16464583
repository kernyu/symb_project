In this report, we describe a new family of N-thiolated 2-oxazolidinones having antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis. The effect of ring substituents and stereochemistry on antibacterial activity of these oxazolidinones closely parallels that previously reported for N-thiolated beta-lactam antibiotics.
