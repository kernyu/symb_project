Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) is the causative agent of a severe ocular disease in cats for which a safe potent antiviral chemotherapeutic agent is highly demanded. The sensitivity of FHV-1 to inhibition by three anti-herpetic nucleoside analogues [acyclovir (ACV), penciclovir (PCV) and cidofovir (CDV)] was tested by means of yield reduction assay. ACV showed very poor ability to inhibit FHV-1 replication. At low multiplicity of infection (MOI), both PCV and CDV were nearly equally effective with IC50 values ranging between 6 and 8 microg/ml. However, when the MOI was raised to 3PFU/cell, the activity of CDV was markedly reduced (IC50 25 microg/ml), while that of PCV remained relatively low (IC50 10 microg/ml). Although FHV-1 is normally insensitive to ACV, it exhibited >1000-fold increase in sensitivity when the thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) was supplied in trans. Furthermore, three PCV-resistant FHV-1 variants selected in vitro were shown to carry mutations in the TK gene. Taken together, these data provided direct evidence that PCV is a potent selective inhibitor of FHV-1 and that the virus-encoded TK is an important determinant of the virus susceptibility to nucleoside analogues.
