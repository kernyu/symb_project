The typing of 106 M. tuberculosis (MBT) strains isolated from patients in the Samara region by the restriction DNA fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) IS6110 revealed that most of the strains (71.7%) belonged to the W family, 5 MBT strains (4.7%) belonged to the AI family, one culture was the mixture of two strains, AI and W. In addition, 24 MBT strains (22.6%) classified with other genotypes were detected. The analysis of the sensitivity of the MBT strains to rifampicin and isoniazid, with the method of absolute concentrations and by point mutations, demonstrated that 29 MBT strains (27.3%) were sensitive to rifampicin and isoniazid and 56 MBT strains (52.9%) were resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid simultaneously. Among the MBT strains of different RFLP families, strains both sensitive and resistant to these two preparations could be detected, but strains with multiple drug resistance prevailed in the W family (61.8%).
