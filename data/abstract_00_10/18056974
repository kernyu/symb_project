A notable extension of life span (up to 50%) was achieved in Drosophila melanogaster when the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLc) was overexpressed in neuronal tissue, while a moderate increase (up to 24%) was observed when the modulatory subunit of GCL (GCLm) was overexpressed globally. We sought to identify specific tissue domains that are particularly sensitive to the beneficial effects of GCLc overexpression. Overexpression of GCLc using the mushroom body driver (OK107-GAL4) had a small but significant beneficial effect on longevity (approximately 12%) while overexpression in serotonergic (MZ360-GAL4) neurons or dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons (Ddc-GAL4) had small, nonsignificant effects on longevity. A significant beneficial effect (12-13%) was also observed using the C23-GAL4 transverse muscle driver. Finally, a low-level global driver (armadillo) was shown to increase life span significantly (15%). A series of mutant and knockdown studies were also carried out. Reduction of GCLm by > 95% had no discernable effect on longevity or resistance to oxidative stress. In contrast, knockdown of GCLc by 30-70% using an RNAi-hairpin strategy had a significant effect, resulting in greater sensitivity to H(2)O(2) and reduced survivorship under normal conditions varying from a 50% reduction in median life span to lethality. A GCLc null allele was identified and shown to be recessive lethal. Overall, this study demonstrates that the longevity effects of GCLc are dependent on dosage and that there are specific tissues (mushroom bodies, motor neurons, and transverse muscle cells) particularly sensitive to the benefits of GCLc overexpression.
