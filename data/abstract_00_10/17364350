CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) detection in head and neck cancer patients are the duration of hospitalization, intravenous hyperalimentation, prior antibiotic use, and the coexistence of other pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To shed light on the clinical characteristics of MRSA-positive inpatients with head and neck cancers. The secondary goal was to evaluate risk factors for MRSA detection in comparison with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive inpatients with head and neck cancers with S. aureus detection were analyzed based on their medical records. The antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated S. aureus was tested by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: MRSA and MSSA were detected in 46 (75.4%) and 15 (24.6%) of the 61 patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in the male/female ratio, age, primary site, comorbidity, cancer stage, cancer treatment, or 5-year survival rate between the MRSA and MSSA groups. Compared with the MSSA group, the MRSA group had significantly longer hospitalization periods and intervals between admission and MRSA detection, as well as significantly greater likelihood of intravenous hyperalimentation, prior antibiotic use, and co-isolation of other pathogens. Isolated strains of MRSA were thoroughly sensitive to vancomycin and arbekacin and moderately sensitive to minocycline.
