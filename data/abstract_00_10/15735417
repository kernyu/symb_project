PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to give practicing physicians a practical approach to the treatment of latent and active tuberculosis and to review newer recommendations and common problems encountered in the treatment of patients with tuberculosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently published literature documents the increased incidence of multidrug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the importance of antituberculosis drug toxicities and drug-drug interactions, persistent problems in the correct interpretation of the tuberculin skin test and ongoing problems with treatment compliance and treatment completion. SUMMARY: This article provides a practical approach to the interpretation of the tuberculin skin test, the proper approach to the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, and a structured approach to the treatment of presumed or documented active tuberculosis infection.
