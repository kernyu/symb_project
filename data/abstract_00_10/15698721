LBM415 (NVP PDF-713), a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, was tested by reference methods against 2 collections of pathogenic Neisseria, N. gonorrhoeae (157 strains) and N. meningitidis (100 strains). The collection included strains resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones and were also tested against ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and tetracycline. The 50% and 90% minimum inhibitory concentration values for LBM415 were 1 and 2 microg/mL, and 4 and 8 microg/mL for N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae, respectively. All comparison agents were more active than this peptide deformylase inhibitor against this genus.
