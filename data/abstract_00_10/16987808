The cytochrome bc1 complex resides in the inner membrane of mitochondria and transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. This electron transfer is coupled to the translocation of protons across the membrane by the protonmotive Q cycle mechanism. This mechanism topographically separates reduction of quinone and reoxidation of quinol at sites on opposite sites of the membrane, referred to as center N (Qn site) and center P (Qp site), respectively. Both are located on cytochrome b, a transmembrane protein of the bc1 complex that is encoded on the mitochondrial genome. To better understand the parameters that affect ligand binding at the Qn site, we applied the Qn site inhibitor ilicicolin H to select for mutations conferring resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The screen resulted in seven different single amino acid substitutions in cytochrome b rendering the yeast resistant to the inhibitor. Six of the seven mutations have not been previously linked to inhibitor resistance. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activities of mitochondrial membranes isolated from the mutants confirmed that the differences in sensitivity toward ilicicolin H originated in the cytochrome bc1 complex. Comparative in vivo studies using the known Qn site inhibitors antimycin and funiculosin showed little cross-resistance, indicating different modes of binding of these inhibitors at center N of the bc1 complex.
