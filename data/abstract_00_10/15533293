Giardia intestinalis is one of the most prevalent parasites in adults and children in Mexico. Benzimidazoles have been proposed as a therapeutic alternative in the treatment of giardiasis. However, high-dose related toxicity and the development of resistance have emerged in clinical trials using this therapy. In the search of alternative drugs, we found that benzimidazole-resistant strains of fungi have shown increased sensitivity to phenyl-carbamates, hence, we developed several substituted phenyl-carbamates, two of which were tested against the protozoan parasite G. intestinalis in susceptible and albendazole-resistant Giardia strains. 4-R-ethyl-phenyl-carbamates IRE-6A and IRE-7B demonstrated antigiardial, albeit modest, activity when compared with albendazole, against susceptible and albendazole-induced resistant Giardia. However, when albendazole 0.38 microg/mL (MIC(50)) was combined with each IRE compound, a significant antigiardial synergism (fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI < 0.5)) was obtained not only with sensitive cultures but also with resistant Giardia parasites. The results described here suggest a potential role for a combined therapy with phenyl-carbamates and sub-doses of benzimidazoles in the treatment of giardiasis.
