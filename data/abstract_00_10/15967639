The effects of probiotic supplementation on the intestinal re-growth microbiota following antibiotic therapy were studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. In the placebo group, numbers of facultative anaerobes and enterobacteria increased significantly, and at day 35 the numbers were significantly higher in the placebo group than in the active group; in the active group, the numbers of bacteroides increased significantly. Although the numbers of enterococci in both groups did not change, in the placebo group the number of patients harbouring antibiotic-resistant enterococci post therapy increased significantly. There was no change in the incidence rate of antibiotic resistance among the patients in the probiotic group.
