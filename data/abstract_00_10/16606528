OBJECTIVE: To investigate the trend of resistance to antimicrobial agents among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli 1990-2004. METHODS: Agar diffusion test was used to analyze the changes of drug susceptibility of 33,495 strains of E. coli isolated from 11 hospitals in Shanghai to 21 antimicrobial agents 1990-2004. RESULTS: The resistance rates of 33,495 E.coli isolates to 21 antimicrobial agents mostly increased 1990-2004. The resistance rates to ampicillin and piperacillin increased from 69% and 30% to 85% and 71.4% respectively. The resistance rates to cephalosporins, except ceftazidime and cefepime, all increased, e. g., the resistance rates to cefazolin (24.0%-->48.3%), cefuroxime (18.0%-->45.7%), and cefaclor (33.3%-->46.8%), especially that to cefotaxime (6.0%-->35.2%). The resistance rate to fluoroquinolones increased from 11.0% to 55.4%. The resistance rate to gentamicin increased from 44.0% to 54.0%. The resistance rates to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, SMZ/TMP remained at high levels. However, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, amikacin, beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors, and nitrofurantoin remained active against the E.coli isolates. The detectable rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains in E. coli increased from 14.7% to 36.5%. CONCLUSION: The trend of resistance of E. coli to commonly used antimicrobials was upward 1990-2004.
