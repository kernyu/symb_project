Two separate studies were conducted to evaluate the utility of glyphosate tolerant canola (GTC) as a feed ingredient in diets fed to rainbow trout. In the first study, two forms of GTC were compared to a parental line, Westar. In the second study, one line of GTC was reevaluated to Westar. In each study, processed canola meals were incorporated at 5, 10, 15, or 20% of the dry diet and a diet containing no canola was fed for comparison. All diets were fed to triplicate groups of fish in each study. In the first study, weight gain, feed efficiency (FE), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and protein retention (PR) were not significantly different in fish fed either Westar or GT200 at any level of substitution. Fish fed GT73 exhibited a gradual reduction in weight gain, FE, and PER as the level of GTC increased. However, the only significant reduction was in weight gain of fish fed 20% GT73 as compared to fish fed 5% GT73. Because of an error in preparing samples prior to the experiment, samples GT200 and GT73 were essentially equivalent in composition. The differences were explained by differences in processing temperatures that occurred after the sample mixing error occurred. In the second study, mean weight gain, PR, and survival were not significantly different among forms of canola. FE and PER values were significantly lower in fish fed 15% Westar as compared to fish fed 10% Westar; other FE and PER values were not significantly different. On the basis of these results, GTC processed into a toasted meal and incorporated into diets for rainbow trout is equivalent to a parental line of canola.
