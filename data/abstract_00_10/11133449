Pseudomonas oleovorans GPo1 and its polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) depolymerization-minus mutant, GPo500 phaZ, residing in natural water microcosms, were utilized to asses the effect of PHA availability on survival and resistance to stress agents. The wild-type strain showed increased survival compared to the PHA depolymerase-minus strain. The appearance of a round cellular shape, characteristic of bacteria growing under starvation conditions, was delayed in the wild type in comparison to the mutant strain. Percent survival at the end of ethanol and heat challenges was always higher in GPo1 than in GPo500. Based on these results and on early experiments (H. Hippe, Arch. Mikrobiol. 56:248-277, 1967) that suggested an association of PHA utilization with respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, we investigated the association between PHA degradation and nucleotide accumulation. ATP and guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) production was analyzed under culture conditions leading to PHA depolymerization. A rise in the ATP and ppGpp levels appeared concomitant with PHA degradation, while this phenomenon was not observed in the mutant strain unable to degrade the polymer. Complementation of the phaZ mutation restored the wild-type phenotype.
