This review summarizes recent data on iron metabolism in macrophages, with a special emphasis on possible bacteriostatic and bactericidal consequences for intracellular pathogens. It includes the role of biological chelators and transporters in normal macrophage physiology and antimicrobial defense. Iron is an essential metal cofactor for many biochemical pathways in mammals. However, excess iron promotes the formation of cytotoxic oxygen derivatives so that systemic iron levels must be tightly regulated. The mechanism of iron recycling by macrophages including iron efflux from erythrocyte-containing phagosomes, iron release from macrophages, and entry into the transferrin (Tf) cycle remain poorly understood. Ferroportin expression in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow cells appears to be restricted to macrophages. Mutant mice bearing a conditional deletion of the ferroportin gene in macrophages show retention of iron by hepatic Kupffer cells and splenic macrophages. Hepcidin is induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse spleens and splenic macrophage in vitro and appears to mediate the LPS-induced down-regulation of ferroportin in the intestine and in splenic macrophages, suggesting that inflammatory agents may regulate iron metabolism through modulation of ferroportin expression. The host transporter Nramp1 may compete directly with bacterial divalent-metal transport systems for the acquisition of divalent metals within the phagosomal space. The ultimate outcome of these competing interactions influences the ability of pathogens to survive and replicate intracellularly. This seems particularly relevant to the Salmonella, Leishmania, and Mycobacterium spp., in which inactivating mutations in Nramp1 abrogate the natural resistance of macrophages to these pathogens.
