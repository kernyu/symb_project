A spontaneous kanamycin resistance and capreomycin resistance mutation, A1408G, in the decoding center of 16S rRNA, was identified in the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus. Unexpectedly, this mutation also confers resistance to streptomycin. We propose a novel mechanism of streptomycin resistance by which A1408G influences conformational changes in 16S rRNA during tRNA selection.
