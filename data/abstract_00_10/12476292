The management of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies remains controversial. A major problem is how to manage patients who had invasive aspergillosis during remission induction and consolidation therapy and then undergo SCT. Indeed in these patients the mortality rate related to invasive aspergillosis recurrence remains unacceptably high. We report two cases of patients who underwent remission induction for AML, developed invasive aspergillosis during antifungal prophylaxis with itraconazole, failed amphotericin B deoxycholate and liposomal amphotericin B treatment, were successfully treated with voriconazole and eventually underwent SCT with voriconazole prophylaxis without reactivation of invasive aspergillosis.
