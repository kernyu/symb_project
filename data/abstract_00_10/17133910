The aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial activity of protein extracts from HaCaT cell line against bacterial strains, isolated from clinical materials, obtained from patients with clinical symptoms of acne (Propionibacterium acnes) and gas gangrene (Clostridium perfringens and Sterptococcus pyogenes). Reference strain of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 also was used. Protein extracts from cultured HaCaT cells were obtained by 3-fold freezing/defreezing cells in dry ice following by centrifugation and incubated with appropriate bacterial suspension (0.5 McFarland scale) during 6 and 24 hours. We observed time-depending and strain-depending activity of HaCaT--protein extract. Interestingly, high activity was demonstrated against strains of S. pyogenes and C. perfringens. Because of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics further studies in the field of antimicrobial peptides are required.
