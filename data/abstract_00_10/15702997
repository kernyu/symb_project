A total of 50 Staphylococcus intermedius strains isolated in France from canine pyodermas in 2002 were investigated for their susceptibility to various antimicrobial drugs. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using a 2-fold serial dilution method in Mueller-Hinton agar, and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. About 62% of the 50 strains tested were producers of beta-lactamase and categorized as penicillin-resistant. About 26% demonstrated resistance to sulphonamides, 46% to oxytetracycline, 30% to chloramphenicol, 28% to streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin or erythromycin, 22% to clindamycin, 6% to doxycycline, 2% to gentamicin, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin or pradofloxacin. Acquired resistance was not observed to a clavulanic acid-amoxicillin combination, oxacillin, cephalosporins (cephalexin, ceftiofur and cefquinome), trimethoprim, a sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination and florfenicol. About 42% were simultaneously resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes (multiresistance). All isolates with acquired resistance to erythromycin were also resistant to streptomycin and neomycin/kanamycin. About 22% of isolates exhibited cross-resistance between erythromycin and clindamycin and all clindamycin-resistant isolates also exhibited resistance to erythromycin. Resistance to penicillin, oxytetracycline and chloramphenicol was also positively associated with resistance to erythromycin and streptomycin.
