The frequency of resistance genotypes among Beijing and non-Beijing strains was compared using a reverse blot hybridization assay to detect mutations within genes associated with rifampicin (rpoB) and isoniazid (katG, inhA, and ahpC) resistance. Of the 743 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, 569 (77%) belonged to Beijing family. The proportion of Beijing strains was significantly higher among MDR-TB isolates than among drug-susceptible strains (82% vs. 72%, p<0.01). Genotype analysis of the rpoB gene revealed significantly lower rates of the Ser531Leu mutation rate among Beijing vs. non-Beijing MDR-TB strains (41% vs. 66%, p<0.005). While the mutation for Ser315Thr in the katG gene was more common among Beijing vs. non-Beijing family strains (65% vs. 50%, p<0.01), the mutation rate of promoter region of the inhA gene was lower among Beijing strains compared with non-Beijing strains (14% vs. 25%, p<0.05). Reverse hybridization successfully detected over 80% of isoniazid-resistant strains and over 92% of rifampicin-resistant strains among Korean isolates. Significant differences in mutation rates in the rpoB, katG, and inhA genes between Beijing strains and non-Beijing strains could explain discrepancies in mutation rates of genotypes in different countries. Reverse hybridization was useful for rapid detection of isoniazid and rifampicin resistant strains.
