It was demonstrated that biogenic elicitors, arachidonic acid and chitosan, locally and systemically stimulated wound healing in potato tuber tissues by increasing the number of wound periderm layers, accelerating the development of cork cambium (phellogen), and inducing proteinase inhibitors. The signal molecules, jasmonic and salicylic acids, had different effects on the development of wound periderm: jasmonic acid locally and systemically stimulated potato wound healing and elevated the level of proteinase inhibitors, whereas salicylic acid did not have any effect on wound healing and even blocked the formation of proteinase inhibitors.
