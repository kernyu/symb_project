Identification of the mechanisms of damage to neurons is an important task in contemporary neuroscience and is of enormous importance in medicine. This report compares two models of neuron damage due to hyperexcitation induced by kainic acid and pilocarpine, using two lines of mice, C57BL/6J and FVB/NJ. Neuron damage was more marked in FVB mice, though lethality was greater in C57BL mice. The levels of convulsive activity were not significantly different. Kainic acid had greater tropism for the hippocampus than pilocarpine. Hsp-70 and Egr-1 expression was not significantly different in C57BL and FVB mice. Analysis of the isolated mitochondrial fraction showed that free radical production was different in these mouse lines; this may be one of the reasons for the differential resistance of neurons to hyperexcitation.
