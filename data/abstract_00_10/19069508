The antimicrobial activities of four different extracts (ethanol, methanol, distilled water and 2-Methylbutan-1-01) obtained from different parts of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) such as flowers, leaves, seeds and seed hulls and were tested against Bacillus subtilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella peneumoniua, Shigella sp. and Micrococcus pyogenes. Better antimicrobial activity was observed with the leaves of broad bean sterile distilled water extract with a zone of inhibition in between 13-32 mm. Flower and seed hull showed by Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus pyogenes a zone of inhibition in between 15-29 and 14-19 mm, respectively. Leaves, seed hulls and flowers of broad bean with ethanol extract showed by Escherichia coli a zone of inhibition in between 25-34, 15-17 and 15 mm, respectively. Flower with ethanol extract had a zone of inhibition in between 15-16 mm by Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus pyogenes, respectively. Different parts of Broad Bean with methanol and 2-Methylbutan-l-01 extract did not shown any antimicrobial affects.
