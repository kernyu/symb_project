This unique case reports the nonsurgical management of a late (2 years) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus neck infection around a Dacron-patched carotid endarterectomy. Because the patient was elderly with multiple serious risk factors and no drainable material, IV and oral antibiotics were selected as initial management. Follow-up computed tomography of the neck, however, documented complete resolution of the phlegmon. While the authors remain uncertain of the long-term outcome the patient is free of local infection 2 years after diagnosis and nonoperative treatment.
