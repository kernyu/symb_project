Osteo-articular infections represent the majority of invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections in children. It is demonstrated that, independently of the resistance or susceptibility to methicillin, the production of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) by S. aureus enhanced the severity of the disease. However, an increase of the rate of community acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) has been reported in osteo-articular infections. These CA-MRSA are the most often susceptible to the other antibiotics. SCCmec elements of type IV or V associated with the PVL coding genes seem to be molecular markers of CA-MRSA. The risk factors of acquisition of these strains are the young age of children and the overcrowding. It is now established that CA-MRSA are pathogens present all over the world. It thus became necessary to look after the epidemiology of these virulent strains.
