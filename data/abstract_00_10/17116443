The science of antibiotic therapy for infectious diseases continues to evolve. In many instances where empiric coverage is necessary, treatment with more than one agent is considered prudent. If an etiology is identified, antibiotics are modified based on culture and susceptibility data. Even when the organism is known, more than one antibiotic may be needed. Decisions about antibiotics should be made after assessments of pertinent clinical information, laboratory and microbiology information, ease of administration, patient compliance, potential adverse effects, cost, and available evidence supporting various treatment options. Clinicians also need to consider synergy and local resistance patterns in selecting therapeutic options. In this article, the authors outline monotherapy and combination therapy options for several common infectious diseases.
