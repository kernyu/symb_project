OBJECTIVES: To compare the activity of linezolid with a range of drugs used in the treatment of Mycobacterium kansasii infections. RESULTS: The percentages of resistant isolates against isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol were 2.9%, 1.9% and 2.9%, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin and moxifloxacin both with MIC(90) values of 0.125 mg/L. Linezolid was active against all isolates with MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of 0.5 and 1 mg/L, respectively, both below the susceptibility breakpoint established for mycobacteria. CONCLUSION: Linezolid, clarithromycin or moxifloxacin, could be used as alternative drugs for treatment of infections due to rifampicin-resistant isolates as well as short-course or intermittent therapy of M. kansasii lung disease.
