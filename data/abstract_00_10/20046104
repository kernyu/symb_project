This survey was conducted to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 50 isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. Isolates of A. baumannii were resistant to ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, imipenem, levofloxacin, piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam, but were always susceptible to colistin. MICs of tigecycline were determined by E-test in Mueller-Hinton agar. The results of the study showed that 50% of the A. baumannii strains were susceptible to tigecycline.
