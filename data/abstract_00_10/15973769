OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between HBV (hepatitis B virus) polymerase gene 180 and 204 sites mutation and lamivudine resistance. METHODS: One hundred forty-one patients with lamivudine resistance after lamivudine treatment and 60 chronic hepatitis B patients without lamivudine treatment were enrolled in this study. The serum HBV DNA mutation was analyzed by sequence detection via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sequences of the same patient were analyzed before and after lamivudine treatment. RESULTS: One hundred and nine lamivudine resistance patients had HBV YMDD (tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate) mutation. Among them, 45 patients had rtL180M/M204V mutation (41.28%), 28 patients had rtL180M/M204I mutation (25.70%) and 36 patients had rtM204I mutation (33.02%). There were 6 patients with rtL180M mutation in 32 lamivudine resistance patients. Sixty chronic hepatitis patients without lamivudine treatment had no mutations. CONCLUSIONS: HBV mutations, which play an important role in lamivudine resistance usually locate at polymerase gene 204 site; 180 site mutation was also observed in these patients. Evaluation of the anti-virus therapy by surveillance of the two sites mutations is of importance.
