Single- and Multi-step selection studies were used to test the ability of BMS-284756, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin and moxifloxacin to yield resistant clones from 12 quinolone-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. Although all quinolones selected, to a greater or lesser degree, for resistant clones with mutations usually in parC or gyrA, BMS-284756 tended to select for resistant clones at a lower rate than other quinolones studied.
