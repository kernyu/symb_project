Our objective was to evaluate the relation between antimicrobial use and susceptibility in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU inpatient areas in the Bolzano regional hospital. For the isolates of S. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus sp., P. aeruginosa and E. coli we found a pattern of significant stepwise decrease in the frequency of antimicrobial susceptibility to penicilloic beta-lactam antibiotics and first generation cephalosporins; the highest senitivity rates occurred among isolates from outpatients, followed in decreasing order by rates among isolates from non-ICU inpatients and from ICU-patients; the rate of use of this group of antimicrobial agents was relatively high in the intensive care unit (13,1%). For P. aeruginosa we observed significantly lower susceptibility-rates to second, third and fourth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and monobactams for non-ICU inpatient areas than for outpatient or ICU areas; this paralleled with the low use of this group of agents in the ICU area (4,9%). Also, for P. aeruginosa the prevalence of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin in inpatient areas was lower than in the outpatient or ICU-areas; the rate of quinolone-use was relatively low in the ICU area (4,2%).
