Nowadays the management strategy for primary gastric lymphoma is undergoing change due to the effectiveness of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. While earlier surgical resection was the primary treatment and chemotherapy was only a follow-on procedure, at the present time this arrangement seems to have been reversed. Early stage low-grade MALT lymphoma can be treated with Helicobacter pylori eradication. Total or subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy and with adjuvant chemotherapy in R1 situation is proposed up to stage II.1. The strategy is similar in the case of high-grade gastric lymphoma, but resection is useful only in those cases when one can be assured the result will be an R0 situation. With the exception of these cases, the only indication for resection is chemo-resistance. There is no reason for operating in advanced stages of the disease. The only purpose can be to manage complications. Unfortunately, the exact diagnosis is difficult. The diagnosis of lymphoma can often only be made after the operation. In the 6-year period between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2005 we treated 38 patients for primary gastric lymphoma. Altogether 9 patients were operated on. Resection was performed in 6 cases. The diagnosis of lymphoma was known preoperatively only in one case. Nowadays surgery seems to be only secondary to chemotherapy and immuno-chemotherapy in the treatment of primary gastric MALT lymphoma. Our own cases also mirror this change.
