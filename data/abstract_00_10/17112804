BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The disposition and sterol-lowering effect of ezetimibe are associated with long-lasting enterosystemic circulation, which is initiated by secretion of ezetimibe and its glucuronide via intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (ABCB1) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) (ABCC2) into gut lumen. Hepatic uptake and secretion may contribute to recycling. To obtain deeper insight into the intestinal and hepatic processes, the disposition of ezetimibe was studied in the presence of rifampin (INN, rifampicin), a modulator of P-gp, MRP2, and hepatic organic anion (uptake) transporting polypeptides (OATPs) (SLCOs). METHODS: The disposition of ezetimibe (20 mg orally) alone and after coadministration of rifampin (600 mg orally) was measured in a crossover study of 8 healthy subjects with the SLCO1B1 *1a/*1a genotype. Concentrations of ezetimibe and its glucuronide in serum, urine, and feces, as well as cholesterol, lathosterol, and the plant sterols campesterol and sitosterol in serum, were quantified by use of liquid chromatography and gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. RESULTS: After rifampin administration, the maximum serum concentrations of ezetimibe and its glucuronide were significantly elevated (12.0+/-4.20 ng/mL versus 4.67+/-2.72 ng/mL, P=.017, and 282+/-73.8 ng/mL versus 107+/-35.3 ng/mL, P=.012, respectively). The area under the curve of ezetimibe was not affected (102+/-37.6 ng.h/mL versus 140+/-86.3 ng.h/mL, P=not significant), whereas that of the glucuronide was markedly increased (2150+/-687 ng.h/mL versus 1030+/-373 ng.h/mL, P=.012). Renal clearance remained unchanged. Fecal excretion of ezetimibe was markedly decreased (7.6+/-2.2 mg versus 10.4+/-1.8 mg, P=.036), whereas renal excretion of the glucuronide was strongly elevated (4.8+/-1.9 mg versus 2.0+/-1.2 mg, P=.049) after coadministration. The onset of a significant sterol-lowering effect of ezetimibe was significantly shortened by rifampin coadministration. CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of rifampin increases the maximum serum concentrations of ezetimibe but reduces its enterosystemic recycling, most likely by inhibition of the secretion of ezetimibe and its glucuronide via P-gp and MRP2.
