Stepwise selection of ciprofloxacin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae mutants produced first-, second-, third-, and fourth-step substitutions in GyrA (S84Y), ParC (S84R), GyrA (D88N), and ParC (E88K), respectively. Successive mutations raised the mutant selection window. The wild-type selection window for garenoxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was also measured.
