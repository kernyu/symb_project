Many inherited diseases and drug resistance have been attributed to mutations in corresponding genes. In this paper, several techniques based on PCR used in diagnosis were concluded. The development and research progress of Mismatch PCR were discussed in details. Some information about an assay that we developed for detection of antimicrobial resistance to quinolones was also described.
