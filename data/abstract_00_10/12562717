A broth microdilution method following the NCCLS recommendations was used for testing fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, 5-fluorocytosine and amphotericin B against 83 yeast isolates causing bloodstream infections in 59 patients hospitalized between January 1998 and June 2001 at the University Hospital of Bari, Italy. Isolates belonged to four species of Candida and three other yeast genera. Of the isolates, 97%, 95% and 100% were susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole, respectively. Similarly, 97% and 100% of the isolates were susceptible to 5-fluorocytosine and amphotericin B, respectively.
