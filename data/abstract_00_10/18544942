Early detection of antiviral resistant mutants is of clinical importance in patients receiving antiviral treatment. The ideal assay is sensitive, specific, accurate, reproducible and easy to perform, attains a high throughput and is able to detect mixed and novel mutations. Advantages and disadvantages of sequencing, line probe assay, DNA chip technology, peptide nucleic acid cramping, fluorescent biprobe hybridization and a new technique based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometric analysis will be discussed.
