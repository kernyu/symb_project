In the winter of 1998/1999, sheep on a farm in the province of North Holland, The Netherlands, died from subacute and chronic liver fluke disease despite four previous treatments with triclabendazole (TCBZ). Faecal examinations of sheep and cattle on the farm showed high number of liver fluke eggs. In a randomised clinical trial, the fluke egg output was monitored weekly for 3 weeks in sheep which were treated with TCBZ or with closantel; in dairy cows treated with TCBZ or with clorsulon; and in heifers treated with TCBZ or clorsulon. The results showed a significant reduction of 99.7, 98.1 and 99.2%, respectively, in fluke egg output at 21 days in all non-TCBZ treated animals. TCBZ treatment produced percentage decreases of 15.3, 4.3 and 36.6%, respectively. These results are highly indicative of the presence of TCBZ-resistant Fasciola hepatica in sheep and cattle on this farm.
