The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 10 antimicrobial agents against a total of 33 isolates of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum and Clostridium sordellii from cattle affected with malignant edema in Japan was determined. The low MIC activities of benzylpenicillin confirm the place of benzylpenicillin as the antibiotics of choice for treatment of malignant edema. Five (22%) of 23 C. septicum strains, five (71%) of seven C. perfringens strains and all strains of C. sordellii showed resistance to oxytetracycline. These oxytetracycline-resistant strains carried tetracycline-resistance genes [tetA(P), tetA408(P), tetB(P) and tetM]. The sequences of the tetracycline-resistance genes of some C. septicum strains were completely or nearly completely identical to those of strains belonging to other clostridiual species. This is the first report of resistance of C. septicum to tetracycline.
