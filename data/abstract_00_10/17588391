BACKGROUND: Patients with complicated gram-positive endocarditis are usually treated with a combination of surgical procedure and long-term antibiotic therapy with intravenous vancomycin. However, oral linezolid offers the potential for an early switch from intravenous vancomycin to oral linezolid therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study from February 2002 to August 2005 to determine the potential for early switch from intravenous vancomycin to oral linezolid in patients surgically treated for a left-sided active gram-positive endocarditis. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were identified; average age was 52 +/- 16 years. There were 10 (85%) and 2 (15%) cases of native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, respectively. Patients were operated on 3 to 10 days after diagnosis. There were no cases of operative mortality. Mean follow-up was 20.8 +/- 7.0 months. Two (14%) patients died of noncardiac causes during follow-up. The mean intensive care unit length of stay was 3.1 +/- 2.3 days, and mean hospital length of stay was 10.5 +/- 3.4 days. No cases of recurrent endocarditis or periprosthetic leakage were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of aggressive surgical treatment and the early switch from intravenous vancomycin to oral linezolid for treatment of active gram-positive heart valve endocarditis is safe and effective, and reduces infection relapses, vancomycin use, hospital length of stay, and economic costs.
