Estimates of the annual number of infections with Plasmodium vivax reach 391 million. So far the blood-schizontocidal therapy with chloroquine remained effective in most parts of the world, but reports about emerging resistance are increasing. The study had the objective of determining the pharmacodynamic interaction between pyronaridine and retinol in Plasmodium vivax, since pyronaridine is a potential alternative for chloroquine and an earlier study had shown strong synergism between pyronaridine and retinol in Plasmodium falciparum. The study was conducted at the Malaria Clinic of Mae Sot, Tak Province, Thailand, near the border to Myanmar. The in vitro observations followed the method of Tasanor. Successful tests were performed with 44 isolates. The mean IC(50), IC(90) and IC(99) values for pyronaridine were 9.8, 2069.6 and 162446.5 nM. The mean IC(50), IC(90) and IC(99) values for the combinations with retinol (corresponding to the 50th, 65th and 80th percentile of the physiological retinol levels in healthy adults) were 1.7, 542.8 and 59379.5 nM for pyronaridine + retinol "low", for the combination with retinol "medium" they were 0.5, 313.7 and 58891.4 nM and for the combination with retinol "high" they were 0.2, 96.7 and 16754.3 nM. These results suggest strong synergism between the two substances.
