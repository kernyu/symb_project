Phytoalexins are inducible chemical defenses produced by plants in response to diverse forms of stress, including microbial attack. Our search for phytoalexins from cruciferous plants resistant to economically important fungal diseases led us to examine stinkweed or pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), a potential source of disease resistance to blackleg. We have investigated phytoalexin production in leaves of T. arvense under abiotic (copper chloride) and biotic elicitation by Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. et de Not. [asexual stage Phoma lingam (Tode ex Fr.) Desm.], and report here two phytoalexins, wasalexin A and arvelexin (4-methoxyindolyl-3-acetonitrile), their syntheses and antifungal activity against isolates of P. lingam/L. maculans, as well as the isolation of isovitexin, a constitutive glycosyl flavonoid of stinkweed, having antioxidant properties but devoid of antifungal activity.
