The purpose of this investigation was to compare the susceptibility of cells of Enterococcus faecalis during exponential growth, stationary phase and starvation phase to three endodontic medicaments. E. faecalis strains VP3-80 and A197A in different growth phases were exposed to saturated calcium hydroxide solution, 0.05% chlorhexidine digluconate and 0.0001% sodium hypochlorite. Cells in the exponential growth phase were the most sensitive to all three medicaments and were killed between 3 s and 10 min. Cells in stationary phase were more resistant and living cells could be recovered at 10 min. However, cells in starvation phase were the most resistant and were not totally eliminated by the medicaments during the 10-min test period. Number of surviving cells of E. faecalis cells to the tested medicaments increased 1000- to 10,000-folds in aging cultures.
