In 2002, 119 isolates of the Enterobacter cloacae complex were collected randomly from 11 German laboratories nationwide. Antibiotic susceptibilities were tested by disk-diffusion tests according to CLSI guidelines, and MICs were determined using Etests. PCRs were performed to amplify all TEM and SHV, and most CTX-M and OXA beta-lactamase genes. PCR products were sequenced to identify the precise extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) types. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) and PM/PML Etests were used to confirm production of the respective ESBLs. According to susceptibility tests and CLSI criteria, 49 (40%) isolates were resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Seven (5.8%) isolates were positive in at least one of the PCR assays. Sequencing identified production of TEM-1 beta-lactamase genes by three (2.9%) isolates, and ESBL genes of the CTX-M and SHV beta-lactamase families by five (4.2%) isolates. IEF confirmed the production of beta-lactamases in the expected pI ranges of the respective ESBLs, and four of the five ESBL-producers were detected using the PM/PML Etest. All ESBL-producing isolates showed co-resistance to sulphonamides.
