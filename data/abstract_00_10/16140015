A series of acylated phloroglucinols and triketones was synthesized and tested for activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) and multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB). A tetra-methylated triketone with a C12 side chain was the most active compound (MIC of around 1.0 microg/ml against MRSA) and was shown to stimulate oxygen consumption by resting cell suspensions, suggesting that the primary target was the cytoplasmic membrane.
