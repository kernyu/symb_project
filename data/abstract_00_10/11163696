The efficacy of triclabendazole in sheep experimentally infected with Fasciola hepatica was studied. Two groups of 12 lambs were infected with a susceptible (S) or a resistant (R) strain of F. hepatica. Eight weeks after infection, six lambs of each group (ST and RT) were treated with triclabendazole (10mg/kg). The other lambs were used as untreated controls (SC and RC). The parameters studied were: GLDH, gamma-GT, ELISA measuring antibodies against recombinant cathepsin-L(1) and eggs per gram faeces (epg). The lambs were slaughtered 16 weeks after infection and the number of flukes counted. The GLDH, gamma-GT levels and the OD value of the ELISA decreased as a result of the treatment in group ST. Patent infections were observed in all animals of groups SC, RT and RC. In group ST, occasionally a few eggs were found in five lambs. The percentage of flukes was 31.3 in SC and 37.6 in RC. In the treated groups ST and RT, the percentage of flukes was 0.06 and 33.6, respectively. These results corresponded to efficacies of 99.8% in the susceptible and 10.8% in the resistant strain. Since the resistant strain was isolated from a mixed cattle and sheep farm, it confirms the presence of triclabendazole resistance in the Netherlands.
