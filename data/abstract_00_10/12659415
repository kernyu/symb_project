This study was undertaken to determine the profile and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of aerobic isolates from blood cultures of neonates in a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India. All blood culture reports (n = 1,828), obtained during August 1995-September 1996 from newborns admitted to the Department of Pediatrics and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the University College of Medical Sciences and GTB Hospital, Delhi, were analyzed, and the sensitivity patterns were recorded. The positivity of blood culture was 42% (770/1,828). Most (93.2%) bactaeremic episodes were caused by a single organism, while polymicrobial aetiology was observed in 52 (6.8%) cases. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 493 (60%) of 823 cases, with Klebsiella (33.8%), Enterobacter (7.5%), Alcaligenes faecalis (4.9%), and Escherichia coli (4.6%) being the common microbes. Staphylococcus aureus (24.4%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (7.9%), were the major Gram-positive isolates. Most (80%) Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, and 50-75% of the Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and amikacin. It is concluded that Klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus remain the principal organisms responsible for neonatal sepsis in a tertiary care setting.
