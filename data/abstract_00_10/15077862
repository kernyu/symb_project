As techniques for early diagnosis of HIV-infected neonates and young infants become more sophisticated, neonatal nurses will be responsible for administering a variety of antiretroviral agents. Infants infected with HIV are likely to be placed on combination therapy, with the goal of suppressing viral replication and stabilizing the immune system. Combination therapy also reduces the risk of resistance mutations associated with monotherapy. The pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents in neonates is under study in a variety of PACTG protocols. However, the pharmacokinetics of most antiretroviral agents in premature infants has not been studied. With the exception of zidovudine, specific dosing for these agents in the preterm population is not known. The long-term effects of antiretroviral agents on growth and development also require further study. Knowledge of the management of HIV in all populations is expanding rapidly. Access to and utilization of HIV/AIDS-related resources are essential.
