This study analysed the pattern of antibiotic resistance in 251 Campylobacter strains isolated from symptomatic children hospitalized in 4 large paediatric hospitals in Poland from 2000 through 2007. The highest resistance was found for ciprofloxacin (49.5% for C. jejuni and 51.3% for C. coli), followed by tetracycline (17.5% and 18.0%, respectively), and ampicillin (13.2% and 10.2%, respectively). Almost all isolates were susceptible to macrolides. As much as 22.6% of C. jejuni and 25.6% of C. coli were resistant to more than one class of antimicrobial agents. Multidrug resistance (defined as resistance to at least two classes of antimicrobials) rose significantly from 5.1% in 2000-2003 to 34.6% in 2004-2007.
