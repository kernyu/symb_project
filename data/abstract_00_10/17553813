BACKGROUND: We present antifungal susceptibility data on environmental isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans (serotype A, n=117) and Cryptococcus gattii (serotype B, n=65) cultured from decayed wood of trunk hollows of Ficus religiosa and Syzygium cumini trees. METHODS: Susceptibilities to amphotericin B, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were determined by using Etest. The MICs were read after 48 h as per the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. RESULTS: The MIC90s and susceptibility ranges for C. neoformans isolates were as follows: 0.094 (0.004-0.25) mg/L for amphotericin B, 4 (0.032-12) mg/L for fluconazole, 0.094 (0.004-0.75) mg/L for itraconazole, 0.064 (0.002-0.19) mg/L for ketoconazole, and 0.047 (0.006-0.125) mg/L for voriconazole, whereas for C. gattii isolates these were 0.125 (0.023-0.5) mg/L for amphotericin B, 8 (0.032-16) mg/L for fluconazole, 0.75 (0.006-2) mg/L for itraconazole, 0.125 (0.003-0.19) mg/L for ketoconazole, and 0.094 (0.004-0.125) mg/L for voriconazole. A comparison of the geometric means of MICs (mg/L) revealed that C. gattii was less susceptible than C. neoformans to amphotericin B (0.075 versus 0.051, P=0.0003), fluconazole (2.912 versus 2.316, P=0.003), itraconazole (0.198 versus 0.0344, P<0.0001), ketoconazole (0.072 versus 0.037, P<0.0001), and voriconazole (0.045 versus 0.023, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The antifungal susceptibility data obtained in this study indicate that the occurrence of primary resistance among environmental isolates of C. neoformans serotype A and C. gattii serotype B is rare, and serotype B isolates are less susceptible than serotype A isolates.
