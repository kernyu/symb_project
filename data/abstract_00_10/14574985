It was reported in this article that the transgenic elite indica container line D297B containing snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, GNA) gene gna was obtained by biolisties. PCR, Southern blotting and Western blotting indicated that the transgenes were integrated into the genome of D297B and expressed in transgenic plants. Analysis of protein activity showed that product of transgene had activity of agglutinin. Resistance of transgenic seeds to Hygromycin B suggested that the transgenes were integrated in a single locus and inherited according to the pattern of 3:1 in most of transgenic plants. In addition, the PCR analysis revealed that the insect-resistant gene gna and selective marker gene hpt were co-integrated and co-inherited.
