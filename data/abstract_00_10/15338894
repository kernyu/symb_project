A hundred new cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis whose age was 60 to 87 years were treated by the intensive chemotherapy regimen recommended by the WHO. Most (n = 78) patients satisfactorily tolerated the intensive stage, fully completed the regimen, and made up a study group (Group 1). Group 2 comprised the remaining 22 patients who had, due to its poor tolerance, to transfer to their individual regimen. The higher incidence of significant cardiovascular diseases in Group 2 patients is the only significant difference between these two identified groups. The advantages of the standard chemotherapy regimen are the more rapid elimination of symptoms of tuberculous intoxication; the earlier and more frequent disappearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the sputum even with the primary drug resistance of the causative agent; as well as a more frequent closure of decay cavities. The findings make it possible to recommend a wider use of the standard intensive chemotherapy regimens for elderly and senile patients with tuberculosis.
