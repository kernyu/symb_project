A 2-year-old budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) was presented to the Massey University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for chronic regurgitation. Multiple drug-resistant Klebsiella oxytoca was cultured from the crop. Necropsy revealed a mass in the crop that was histologically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of SCC in a budgerigar associated with a multidrug-resistant bacterial ingluvitis.
