Fecal samples from humans and food-producing animals were analyzed for the presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The VRE carriage rate in humans was 6%, and there was a predominance of VanC-type resistance. Enterococcus faecium with vanA-mediated resistance was frequent in broiler chickens (42%) but rare in cattle and pig samples.
