We reported previously that insulin inhibits the stimulatory effect of high glucose on the expression of angiotensinogen (ANG) gene in both rat immortalized renal proximal tubular cells (IRPTCs) and non-diabetic rat renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs), but has no effect in diabetic rat RPTCs. In the present study we investigated whether hyperglycaemia-induced resistance to the insulin-induced inhibition of expression of the ANG gene is mediated via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in RPTCs. Rat IRPTCs were cultured for 2 weeks in high-glucose (25 mM) or normal-glucose (5 mM) medium plus angiotensin II (Ang II) with or without a superoxide scavenger (tiron), or inhibitors of: NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodinium, DPI), Ang II type 1 and 2 receptors (losartan and PD123319), angiotensin-converting enzyme (perindopril), protein kinase C (GF 109203X), or glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amino-transferase (azaserine). Cellular generation of ROS, and ANG and renin mRNA levels were assessed by lucigenin assay and specific reverse transcriptase-PCR respectively. Phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44/42 MAPK) was evaluated by western blotting. Prolonged exposure of IRPTCs to high concentrations of glucose or Ang II evoked generation of ROS and resistance to the insulin-induced inhibition of expression of the ANG gene and of p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. Co-incubation of IRPTCs with tiron, DPI, losartan, PD123319, perindopril, GF 109203X or azaserine prevented ROS generation, restoring the inhibitory action of insulin on ANG gene expression and on p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that blockade of both ROS generation and activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system improves the inhibitory action of insulin on ANG gene expression in IRPTCs in conditions of high glucose.
