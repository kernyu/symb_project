OBJECTIVE: To study the susceptibility pattern of candida species isolated from various clinical specimens to common usable antifungals in Libya. METHODS: Two hundred and four candida species were isolated from patients complaining of fungal infections gathered from vaginal swabs, nails, throat, hair and ear. Yeast isolates were identified to the species level by API 20C AUX Commercial system. The in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B, nystatin, ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole and econazole was determined using the macrodilution in broth method. RESULTS: Candida albicans was the most common isolated species from vaginal and Candida tropicalis from throat swabs. On the other hand Candida parapsilosis and Candida guilliermondii were more often isolated from the ear and hair. Candida krusei and Candida fomata were only isolated from vulvaginitis in this study. In vitro sensitivity showed that most of the isolates were inhibited at optimum ranges of minimal inhibitory concentration particularly with amphotericin B and nyastatin. On the other hand resistance strains of candida species were found against the 4 azoles antifungal agents. CONCLUSION: Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata are among the most common cause of vaginitis among Libyan females. Amphotericin B, nystatin and clotrimazole were the most effective antifungals against most isolates in this study. Fungicidal effect was obtained with most antifungals at higher concentrations.
