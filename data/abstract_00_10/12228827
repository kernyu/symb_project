We assessed the incidence of antiretroviral drug resistance in a cohort of 25 antiretroviral-naive, human immunodeficiency virus-positive inmates in Massachusetts. Silent mutations, unexpected mutations at resistant sites, and resistance mutations were recorded. Among these inmates, we found a prevalence of drug resistance mutations that was equivalent to the prevalence previously found in nonprison populations in the same state.
