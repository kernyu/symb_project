Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in acute lung injury. Tissue inflammation, the increased vascular permeability, and plasma exudation are cardinal features of acute lung injury. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) has potential therapeutic applications in preventing vascular leakage and also has beneficial effects in several inflammatory disorders. Recently developed COMP-Ang1 is more potent than native Ang1 in phosphorylating tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and EGF homology domain 2 receptor in endothelial cells. However, there are no data on effects and related molecular mechanisms of COMP- Ang1 on ROS-induced acute lung injury. We used hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-inhaled mice to evaluate the effect of COMP-Ang1 on pulmonary inflammation, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and vascular leakage in acute lung injury. The results have revealed that VEGF expression, the levels of IL-4, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in lungs, the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and NF-kappaB in nuclear protein extracts, phosphorylation of Akt, and vascular permeability were increased after inhalation of H2O2 and that the administration of COMP-Ang1 markedly reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, pulmonary inflammation, plasma extravasation, and the increases of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and VEGF in lungs treated with H2O2. We have also found that the activation of HIF-1a and NF-kB and the increase of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity in lung tissues after H2O2 inhalation were decreased by the administration of COMP-Ang1. These results suggest that COMP-Ang1 ameliorates ROS-induced acute lung injury through attenuating vascular leakage and modulating inflammatory mediators.
