Susceptibility to antibiotics of Ureaplasma urealyticum strains isolated in Primorye Region and its changes were evaluated. Among the sexually transmited diseases urogenital ureaplasmosis has the leading position in combination with gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis and infections caused by opportunistic pathogens. The spectrum of investigated antibacterial agents included gentamycin, clarithromycin, roxythromycin, azithromycin, doxycycline, three fluoroquinolones of II generation and for cephalosporins of the I and III generations. The most potent activity against U. urealyticum was demonstrated for pefloxacin (67 per cent of susceptible strains), ofloxacin (63 per cent) and roxythmycin (54 per cent). It is concluded that at Primorye Region the drugs of first choice for the urogenital infections therapy are fluoroquinolones.
