OBJECTIVES: To monitor the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) over time and the proportions of patients with poor virological control in order to help provide some insight into drug resistance. DESIGN: Analysis of data from the EuroSIDA study; an observational study initiated in 1994 of almost 8500 patients with HIV from across Europe. METHODS: Patients who initiated HAART, and had both a CD4 lymphocyte count and viral load measured in the 3 months prior to starting HAART, were included in analyses. The proportion of patients with a poor virological response (defined as a viral load of > 10,000 copies/ml, using either a single measure or two consecutive measures) at 16 and 48 weeks was determined. Multivariate logistical regression was used to determine the factors associated with a poor virological response at both time points. RESULTS: Median CD4 cell count at starting HAART was 218 cells/mm3 [interquartile range (IQR), 113-327 cells/mm3] and median viral load was 4.36 log10 copies/ml (IQR, 3.57-5.04 log10 copies/ml). At 16 weeks, 16% had a viral load of > 10,000 copies/ml based on a single viral load measure and 10% if the more stringent definition of two consecutive viral loads above this level was used. At 48 weeks these proportions were 19% and 13%, respectively. Compared with patients from Southern Europe, patients from both Central and Northern Europe had approximately half the chance of a poor virological response at 16 weeks (odds ratios 0.53 and 0.47, P = 0.0015 and P < 0.0001, respectively), while at 48 weeks both regions still had approximately a 25% reduced chance of a poor virological response, but this was no longer statistically significant (odds ratio 0.77 and 0.75, P = 0.17 and P = 0.13, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There were marked difference in virological response to HAART across regions of Europe, which may be partly explained by regional differences in access to HAART and utilisation. If drug resistance is closely related to virological failure, these results may help to provide an early insight into the potential problem of drug resistance across Europe. Continued follow-up is essential to monitor patients with poor virological control.
