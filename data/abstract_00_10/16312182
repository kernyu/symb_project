OBJECTIVE: To survey the frequency of genotypic antiretroviral resistance in drug-naive HIV-1-infected Djiboutians. METHODS: A national study was conducted in the general population of Djibouti in March 2002 to determine HIV-1 seroprevalence. Blood samples were collected anonymously and plasma samples scoring positive for HIV-1 antibodies were tested for viral load. Genotypic studies were performed with viral RNA from plasma using the consensus technique of the Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA (www.hivfrenchresistance.org). Mutations were identified using the International AIDS Society-USA resistance panel and resistant virus was defined according to the ANRS algorithm. RESULTS: A panel of 2423 individuals representing the general population of Djibouti was included. Antibodies were detected in 53 of 2423 samples tested. The HIV-1 seroprevalence in the general population was 2.2%. Genotype C was the most prevalent, and the other isolates were CRF_02 AG, or subtype A or D. Forty-seven of the 53 samples were tested for genotypic resistance, and mutations concerning all three classes of antiretrovirals were found. The most frequent were secondary mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PIs): M36I, R41K and K20I/R. A few strains displayed primary mutations (the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]-associated mutations K101E, K103T, L100I and G190V; the PI-associated mutation N88D; and the NRTI-associated mutation K65R). The presence of these mutations may be due to the transmission of strains from treated patients. CONCLUSION: Substantial polymorphism and a few primary mutations are found in HIV-1 non-B subtype isolates from Djiboutian antiretroviral-drug-naive individuals. This needs to be taken into account to adapt antiretroviral regimens and prophylactic schedules locally.
