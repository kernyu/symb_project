Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]) is an important pathogen whose virulence is related to the production of exotoxins and the presence of particular surface components. One hundred eighty-two GAS strains were collected in northwestern Italy between 1994 and 2002 and analyzed for phenotypic characteristics (opacity factor, proteolyic activity, and antimicrobial susceptibility) and by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of genes responsible for the production of exotoxins implicated in pathogenesis speA and speF and of prtF(1) (encoding fibronectin-binding protein F1). All strains were speF positive and 19.2% were speA positive and prtF(1) negative, whereas the prtF(1) gene was identified in 39.5% of the other strains. Of these, approximately half revealed the same pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern but differed in both speA gene and macrolide resistance.
