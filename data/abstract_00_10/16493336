Virologic testing and clinical management of patients with chronic hepatitis B must take into account the particular characteristics of this virus. These tests rely on the detection of different viral genotypes and mutations that may cause viral escape to either the host immune response or the antiviral treatment. Tests to quantify viral load are important for studying the efficacy of antiviral treatments and especially because the pathogenesis of hepatic lesions requires viral replication. Appropriate management of chronic hepatitis B must rely not only on the standard serologic markers but also on tests that quantify viral load and on the study of viral genome variability according to clinical situation.
