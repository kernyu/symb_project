This is a case of mucormycosis complicated by necrotizing fasciitis in a renal transplant recipient on immunosuppressive therapy treated with posaconazole. Mucormycosis occurs most commonly as an opportunistic infection in the immunocompromised host. This patient, with predisposing risk factors for infection, including diabetes mellitus status post cadaveric renal transplantation on immunosuppressive therapy, is the first reported case of successful treatment of Mucor involving an extremity which was neither fatal nor required extremity amputation.
