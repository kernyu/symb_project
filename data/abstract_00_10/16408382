OBJECTIVES: The authors described their experience with the therapy with pegylated interferon and its safety in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) induced liver cirrhosis treated at First Department of Medicine, Medical School, University of Pecs and at Tawam Hospital, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty four (12 male, 12 female, average: 55.66 +/- 7. 02 years) anti-HCV and/or HCV-RNA PCR positive cirrhotic patients were examined. Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound and/or histological examination of liver biopsy. RESULTS: Different genotypes of HCV were detected: genotype 1 in 7 cases, genotype 2 in 1 person, genotype 3 in 3 cases. Genotype 4 was detected in 10 patients, all of them were treated out of Hungary. Thirteen of 24 patients were not treated earlier, 6 persons were non-responders to previous interferon monotherapy, pegylated interferon was administered to 5 patients because of relapse. Biochemical parameters showed improvement in 16 cases (16/24, 66.66%), but did not in 5 patients. Until now, virological response was achieved in 13 patients (13/24, 54.16%), while three patients remained HCV-PCR positive. Temporary dose reduction was needed in 13/24 cases (54.16%). Withdrawal of therapy became necessary in only 2 patients due to severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and/or signs of decompensation. CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated interferon treatment is well tolerated by patients with compensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pough stage A). Frequent side-effects (half of all cases) were usually mild or moderate requiring discontinuation only in 2 of 24 patients. The incidence of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia emphasizes the need of frequent blood cell count tests and patients follow up.
