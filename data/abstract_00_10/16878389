Etiology and antibiotic susceptibility of the pathogens of otitis media purulenta acuta in children was studied within 2000-2005. A total of 161 children at the age of 1 to 14 years were examined. The middle ear discharge collected during paracentosis (79.5%) or spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane (20.5%) was used in the bacteriological tests. The microflora growth in the culture was detected in 80% of the cases. The leading pathogen was Streptococcus pyogenes (47.5%), the part of Streptococcus pneumoniae amounted to 36.6% of all the etiologically significant microflora, the part of Staphylococcus aureus amounted to 6.9% and that of Haemophilus influenzae amounted to 4.0%. The part of the associations of 2 microorganisms equaled 5.0%. The species composion of the pathogens differed from that described in the literature. The isolates of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were characterized by low resistance to macrolides (4.0-6.3%). As for the S. pneumoniae isolates, 97.3% of them was susceptible to penicillin. The results of the etiology study and the pathogen antibiotic susceptibility showed that the drugs of choice for the empirical antibacterial therapy of otitis media purulenta acuta in children should be amoxicillin and 1st generation cepholosporins. When the antibacterial therapy within the first 3 days fails, it is advisable to use protected aminopenicillins or 2nd generation cephalosporins. In case of the drug intolerance, macrolide antibiotics should be used.
