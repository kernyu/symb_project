The in vitro activity of BMS-284756 against 602 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including 152 that were both methicillin and ciprofloxacin resistant (MIC > or = 4 microg/ml), was determined. For ciprofloxacin-susceptible and nonsusceptible isolates, the MICs at which 50% of organisms were inhibited were 0.015 and 2 microg/ml and the MICs at which 90% of organisms were inhibited were 0.03 and 4 microg/ml, respectively.
