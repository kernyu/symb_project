UNLABELLED: Cefpirome is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with an expanded spectrum against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpirome against staphylococci, clinical isolates. For comparison oxacillin was also tested. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 434 isolates (coagulase-positive staphylococci, n = 268 and coagulase-negative staphylococci, n = 166) were tested. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Mueller-Hinton agar dilution method. RESULTS: Cefpirome inhibited the majority of strains at 0.5-8 mg/l. Cefpirome had excellent activity against coagulase-negative staphylococci with 91.6% susceptibility. Except the coagulase-positive staphylococci, of the 268 isolates, 81.3% were cefpirome sensitive. Concerning oxacillin, 35.1% of coagulase-positive staphylococci isolates were resistant, comparative with 26.5% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci. A cross-resistance analysis showed the association of resistance between cefpirome and oxacillin. CONCLUSION: Against staphylococci, cefpirome had the best activity when compared with the oxacillin.
