BACKGROUND: Given the expanding antiretroviral therapy, inexpensive and fast HIV drug resistance assays are urgently needed. In this view, we have developed a novel phenotypic resistance test for HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) based on recombinant expression of patient-derived HIV PR in Escherichia coli and subsequent enzymatic testing in a fluorescent readout. OBJECTIVES: To facilitate and expedite the test procedure, we have introduced coupled in vitro transcription/translation using a commercially available technology called RTS for producing enzymatically active HIV-1 protease (PR). STUDY DESIGN: We expressed one wild type PR and one highly resistant mutant starting from molecular clones as well as three patient-derived PRs. The amplified PR gene was either ligated into an expression vector or directly used as a template for the in vitro transcription/translation reaction. Enzymatic susceptibility data derived from in vitro expressed PRs were correlated to the respective results from E. coli expression and genotypic evaluation. RESULTS: All tested enzymes were obtained in sufficient quantities for complete resistance profiling to five PIs. The PRs required no purification prior to the enzymatic assay. Inhibition constants and enzymatic resistance factors compared well to corresponding data from PRs expressed in parallel in E. coli. Enzymatic resistance was in good agreement with the respective PR genotype. CONCLUSION: The presented in vitro transcription/translation system represents a novel approach for HIV PR expression starting from molecular clones or patient samples. Coupled with the enzyme-kinetic PR assay recently developed in our group it allows to sensitively quantify resistance to PIs. The test system is significantly less laborious and faster than currently available phenotypic drug resistance assays.
