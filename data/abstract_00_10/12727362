The lack of methods to identify Mycobacterium leprae with the resistance against multi-drugs quickly and specifically has hindered effective chemotherapy against M. leprae infection. To screen M. leprae with resistance against multi-drugs, the Touch-Down (TD)-PCR has been used in this study. Sequences of the folP, rpoA, B, and gyrA, B genes were analyzed for isolates of M. leprae from leprosy patients in Korea. We amplified designated region of several genes in M. leprae involved in drug resistance and could obtain the PCR products of each gene. The mutations in the particular region of folP, rpoB, and gyrB gene were certified by TD-PCR single-stranded conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing, respectively.
