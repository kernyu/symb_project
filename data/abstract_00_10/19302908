BACKGROUND: Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are a fundamental tool for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sequential anti-HBV treatment might lead to the selection of mutations. OBJECTIVE: This report aimed to analyze the genetic evolution of the reverse-transcriptase (RT) gene of viral quasispecies in a patient with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic HBV who received, sequentially, lamivudine (LAM), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), and ADV + telbivudine (LDT) combination treatment over a total of 108 weeks. METHODS: A 20-year-old Chinese man presented to Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China, with hepatitis B surface antigen-positive and HBeAg-positive chronic HBV and was sequentially treated with LAM 100 mg/d for 18weeks,ADV 10mg/d for 68weeks, and ADV 10mg/d + LDT 600 mg/d combination treatment for 22 weeks. Compliance was monitored every 4 weeks using a pill count. For genotypic analysis, the RT region of the polymerase gene from the serum of this patient was amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Fifty clones with HBV insert were selected for sequencing at weeks 0 (baseline), 18, 22, 60, 70, 86, and 108. RESULTS: The rtM204V/L LAM-resistance mutation was detected in 4.4% (2/45) of clones prior to LAM treatment. At week 18 during LAM treatment, the rtM204I mutation became predominant, being present in 79.5% (35/44) of clones. The rtM204I mutation was associated with compensatory mutations (rtL180M and rtT184L). A total of 9.1% (4/44) of the clones harbored the rtL180M + rtT184L + rtM204I mutations. Two new mutations, rtL229V and rtV191I, were detected in 75.0% (33/44) and 11.4% (5/44) of clones, respectively. At week 22 during ADV treatment, LAM-resistance mutations (rtL180M, rtT184L, rtM204I, rtV191I, and rtL229V) were not detected. At week 86 during ADV therapy, the rtN236T ADV-resistance mutation was detected in 58.8% (20/34) of clones. A total of 20.6% (7/34) of the clones harbored the rtK212T + rtM250L mutation, and rtA181V was found in 2.9% (1/34) of the clones. At week 108, after the patient had been receiving ADV + LDT combination therapy for 22 weeks, rtS202G and rtI269T had emerged, representing 28.9% (13/45) and 8.9% (4/45), respectively, of the viral population during ADV + LDT combination treatment. We also detected several polymorphic sites,including rtF221Y, rtS223A, rtI224V, rtN238H, rtL267Q, and rtQ271M, during the sequential treatment. After 22 weeks of combination treatment, HBV DNA count was decreased to less than the lower limit of quantitation (<200 copies/mL). CONCLUSIONS: This report identified HBV mutations that escaped the antiviral pressure of LAM, ADV, and ADV + LDT in this patient and provided insight into the process of mutation selection through genotypic analysis during antiviral treatment. Mutations selected under sequential treatments of LAM, ADV, and ADV + LDT can lead to a series of compensatory mutations, which partially restore the level of viral replication. ADV administered in combination with LDT appeared to be effective in this selected case with clinical or virologic resistance to sequential treatment with LAM and ADV.
