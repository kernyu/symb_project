There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of micafungin and expression of hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (ABCC2/Mrp2) between analbuminemic and Sprague-Dawley rats. Micafungin bound strongly to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and moderately to gamma globulin. These results suggest that HDL and gamma globulin contribute to the pharmacokinetics of micafungin.
