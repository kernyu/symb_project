BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to a multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter is one of the most dreadful complications, which occurs in the critical care setting. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To find out the incidence of Acinetobacter infection in VAP cases, to determine various risk factors responsible for acquisition of Acinetobacter infection and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Acinetobacter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 endotracheal aspirate specimens from intubated patients diagnosed clinically and microscopically as VAP were studied bacteriologically. All clinical details and prior exposure to antibiotics were recorded. RESULTS: An incidence of 11.6% of Acinetobacter VAP cases was recorded. Various underlying conditions like head injury, cerebral hemorrhage and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were found to be associated with Acinetobacter VAP. Acinetobacter strains exhibited MDR pattern. CONCLUSION: Strict infection control measures, judicious prescribing of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance surveillance programs and antibiotic cycling should be adopted to control infections due to these bacteria in patients admitted to intensive care units.
