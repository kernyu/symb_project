When cultivated in the presence of glucose, irrespective of temperature and the degree of aeration, Y. pseudotuberculosis cells have the ovoid form, constant size and low hydrophobic properties of their surface. Meanwhile the characteristics of the bacteria grown in the medium, carbohydrate-free or with galactose added, essentially depend on the conditions of medium aeration. Under the conditions of intensive stirring at both temperatures these bacteria acquire the coccoid form, not typical for Yersinia, they have a smaller area (approximately 2 times) and more hydrophobic surface in comparison with the cells grown in the presence of glucose. Under stationary conditions the differences between the cells, cultivated in the presence of galactose and glucose, in form and area disappear, but the differences in the hydrophobic properties of the surface are retained. As revealed in this study, the cells grown in the presence of galactose and under the conditions of intensive medium stirring, in contrast to those grown with glucose, have 1.5-fold greater invasive activity, irrespective of aeration conditions, eightfold greater resistance to ampicillin and twofold greater resistance to streptomycin and erythromycin.
