In the search for new types of ketolide antibiotics active against key respiratory pathogens including erythromycin-resistant strains, we conducted an extensive study on the modification at the C-11,12-diol moiety of 9-oxime-3-ketolide derivatives. Among the derivatives prepared, compound 6 with carbonate at the C-11,12 position was found to have potent antibacterial activities against erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as other erythromycin-susceptible strains.
