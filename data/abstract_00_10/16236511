For the systematic SAR study on mansonone F, a series of C6 and C9 analogs of mansonone F have been synthesized and their anti-MRSA activities were evaluated. Most of the analogs exhibited good or excellent anti-MRSA activities. In particular, the 6-n-butylmansonone F showed fourfold higher antibacterial activities compared to that of vancomycin.
