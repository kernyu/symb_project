The rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility prior to and after the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Portuguese children were evaluated. The changes in incidence of IPD in children under 1 year old between the two periods of the study was not significant (P=0.53), despite the 21% decline. In children under 18 years old there was a 27.7% decrease in vaccine serotypes. All nonvaccine serotypes increased 71.4%. The decrease in vaccine serotypes was more impressive during the first year of life (-54.8%) than for children between 1 and 5 years of age (-19.1%). Among children under 1 year old, penicillin nonsusceptible isolates declined between the two periods of the study (47.2% vs. 25.0%) (P=0.03), as did those of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone nonsusceptible isolates. No changes were observed for isolates nonsusceptible to tetracycline and macrolides. The serotypes of these nonsusceptible isolates differed after the introduction of vaccine (P=0.01). Multiresistance increased 57.1% after the introduction of vaccine. Multiresistant isolates with vaccine serotype declined 42.9% (P<0.001), and nonvaccine serotypes appeared during the vaccination period (P<0.001). These findings suggest a replacement of vaccine serotypes by nonvaccine serotypes, mainly among nonsusceptible isolates.
