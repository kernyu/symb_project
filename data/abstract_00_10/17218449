OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of clarithromycin (0.01-0.5 mg/L) alone or in combination with ceftriaxone (0.1 and 0.25 mg/L) on pneumolysin production by both macrolide-susceptible and -resistant [2 erm(B) positive and 2 mef(A) positive] strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: The bacteria were cultured for 6 h at 37 degrees C/5% CO(2) in tryptone soy broth, washed, enumerated and resuspended to 0.5-3 x 10(8) cfu/mL in tissue culture medium, RPMI 1640. After 16 h of incubation at 37 degrees C / 5% CO(2), pneumolysin was assayed in the bacteria-free supernatants, as well as in lysates, using a functional assay based on the influx of calcium into human neutrophils. RESULTS: Exposure of not only macrolide-susceptible strains, but also the macrolide-resistant strains, of S. pneumoniae to sub-MICs of clarithromycin resulted in dose-related inhibition of the pneumolysin production, whereas production of the toxin was unaffected by ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: These observations demonstrate that even in the setting of macrolide resistance the production of pneumolysin, a key virulence factor of the pneumococcus, is attenuated by exposure of this microbial pathogen to clarithromycin.
