INTRODUCTION: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a Gram negative, opportunistic bacteria. We describe a case of community-acquired superficial pyoderma due to this bacteria in a immunocompetent host. CASE-REPORT: A 59-year-old man presented with an ulceration of the sole for two months. Several topical and systemic treatments had failed to cure the lesion, including oral ofloxacin for ten days. Microbiological study of the lesion showed numerous Gram negative bacilli with growth of S. maltophilia. This bacterium initially responded to ofloxacin, but became resistant after the oral use of this antibiotic. Finally, a topical treatment with polymyxin/tetracycline ointment resulted in complete healing within two weeks. DISCUSSION: S. maltophilia may be responsible for superficial pyoderma and serious opportunistic infections in immunocompetent persons. Topical antimicrobial therapy is efficient when oral quinolone therapy has failed to cure the lesion.
