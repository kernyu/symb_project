BACKGROUND: High dose amoxicillin is recommended for the initial treatment of children with acute otitis media (AOM), particularly patients at risk for having drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Single dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg) is considered an alternative agent for the treatment of AOM. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of single dose azithromycin with that of high dose amoxicillin among children with uncomplicated AOM. METHODS: This was a double blind, double dummy, multinational, clinical trial in which children (6-30 months of age) with AOM were randomized to treatment with single dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg) or high dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d, in 2 divided doses) for 10 days. Tympanocentesis was performed at baseline and clinical responses were assessed at days 12-14 (end of therapy) and at days 25-28 (end of study). RESULTS: The study enrolled 313 patients, and 83% of the patients were < or =2 years of age. A total of 158 patients in the azithromycin group and 154 in the amoxicillin group were considered clinical modified intent-to-treat patients. A middle ear pathogen was detected for 212 patients (68%). Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen (isolated for 96 patients), followed by S. pneumoniae (92 patients), Moraxella catarrhalis (23 patients) and Streptococcus pyogenes (23 patients). beta-Lactamase production was observed for 17% of H. influenzae isolates and 100% of M. catarrhalis isolates. Thirty-five (38%) S. pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-nonsusceptible and 24 (26%) isolates were macrolide-resistant. At the end of therapy, clinical success rates for azithromycin and amoxicillin were comparable for all patients (84 and 84%, respectively) and for children < or =2 years of age (82 and 82%, respectively). At the end of therapy and end of study, clinical efficacies among all microbiologic modified intent-to-treat evaluable subjects were comparable for patients treated with azithromycin (80%) and patients treated with amoxicillin (83%). The rates of treatment-related adverse events for azithromycin and amoxicillin were 20% and 29%, respectively (P = 0.064). Diarrhea was more common in the amoxicillin group than in the azithromycin group (17.5 and 8.2%, respectively) (P = 0.017). Compliance, defined as completion of > or =80% of the study medication, was higher in the azithromycin group (100%) than in the amoxicillin group (90%) (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, single dose azithromycin was as effective as high dose amoxicillin for the treatment of children with AOM, whereas rates of adverse events were lower and compliance improved with the simplified single dose regimen.
