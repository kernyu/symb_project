Data concerning chemotherapy of patients with multiresistant tuberculosis of the lungs by reserve antituberculous agents in combination with ofloxacin are presented. It was shown that the ofloxacin-including chemotherapy regimen applied to patients with multiresistant destructive tuberculosis of the lungs provided by the end of the 6-month treatment course elimination of multidrug resistant tubercle bacilli isolation at least in 80% of the patients and closure of the lung caverns after artificial pneumothorax and routine surgical interventions in more than half of the patients. For all this, side effects that could not be eliminated were stated merely in 8.5% of the patients.
