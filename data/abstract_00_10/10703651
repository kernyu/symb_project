BACKGROUND: The widespread use of antibiotics for prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial infections has lead to the emergence of resistant human pathogens. Great differences have been documented between European countries in the use of systemic antibiotics. In parallel, significant differences in levels of resistant pathogens have been documented. AIM: To investigate whether differences in antibiotic use influence the level of antimicrobial resistance of the subgingival microflora of untreated patients with adult periodontitis in The Netherlands and Spain. METHOD: Blood agar plates containing breakpoint concentrations of penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin and clavunalate, metronidazole, erythromycin, azithromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline were used to determine the proportion of bacteria from the subgingival plaque that was resistant to these antibiotics. In the Spanish patients, statistically significant higher mean levels of resistance were found for penicillin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, clindamycin and tetracycline. The mean number of different bacterial species growing on the selective plates was higher in the Spanish patients, as was the % of resistant strains of most periodontal pathogens. A striking difference was observed in the frequency of occurrence of tetracycline-resistant periodontal pathogens. In Spain, 5 patients had > or =3 tetracycline resistant periodontal pathogens, whereas this was not observed in any of the Dutch patients. CONCLUSIONS: The widespread use of antibiotics in Spain is reflected in the level of resistance of the subgingival microflora of adult patients with periodontitis.
