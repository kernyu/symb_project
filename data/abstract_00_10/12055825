Leishmania species show a significant variation in their sensitivity to established and experimental drugs. Molecular techniques to identify species in clinical infections rapidly could be used to guide treatment. Molecular markers are required to detect and monitor acquired resistance to antimonial drugs. Reporter genes and the polymerase chain reaction will improve assays both in vitro and in vivo for the identification and evaluation of new drugs.
