Reverset (2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine, RVT) is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in cell culture, with a 90% effective concentration at or below 1 microM. In vitro, RVT retains its activity against isolates harbouring mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene that otherwise confer resistance to lamivudine and/or zidovudine. The pharmacokinetics and safety of single oral doses of RVT (10-200 mg) were evaluated in an initial Phase I clinical trial. The viral load changes were determined on 18 HIV-1-infected antiretroviral therapy-naive subjects that were randomized into three cohorts, each cohort consisting of three study periods. The subjects received up to two oral doses of active drug and one placebo dose with a 1-week washout period separating the three study periods. Quantification of viral RNA was performed on the pre-dose, 12, 24 and 48 h post-dose plasma samples. A single oral dose of RVT to antiretroviral-naive subjects significantly reduced plasma viral load by 0.45 +/- 0.10 log10 copies/ml (P=0.0003). A mean drop of 0.37 +/- 0.12 log10 copies/ml (P=0.001) was obtained at the lowest dose of 10 mg. Sequence analysis of the HIV-1 RT gene performed before and after RVT dosing detected no genotypic changes in this short-term study. The viral RT gene of one subject had at predose the following genotype: L41 + N103 + C181 + W210 + D215, indicating prior exposure to zidovudine and non-nucleoside analogues, and anticipating high-level resistance against these agents. A single 10 mg RVT dose resulted in a viral load drop of 0.61 +/- 0.05 log10 providing evidence that a viral strain with the indicated genotype is susceptible to RVT.
