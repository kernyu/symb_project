In this follow-up of an article written in the South Dakota Journal of Medicine, February 2001, Antimicrobial Resistance: Steps to Reduce the Problem with Emphasis on Antibiotic Utilization--The Rapid City Experience, subsequent local analysis based on evolving literature, local measures undertaken, and results of these measures will be presented. With national numbers of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE) rising, steps taken in the Rapid City Region have shown reduction in these two pathogens. The two key components of these programs have been appropriate antibiotic utilization and strict adherence to aggressive infection control measures.
