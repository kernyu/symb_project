The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility of 170 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to fusidic acid using a proportion dilution method. Nineteen isolates were resistant to at least one first-line anti-tuberculosis drug. A total of 1.8% of the isolates were resistant to fusidic acid. Fusidic acid should be evaluated clinically as a potential supplementary drug for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis.
