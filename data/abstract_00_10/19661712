To determine whether two HorC molecules coordinately form a single unit, the functional properties of covalently linked dimers of HorC encoded by tandemly fused horC genes were studied. Lactobacillus brevis introduced with the fused horC genes and a single horC gene exhibited same degree of resistance to hop compounds and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. This suggests that HorC functions as a homodimer.
