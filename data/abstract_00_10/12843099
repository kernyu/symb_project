By the low-stringency single-specific-primer PCR technique, a highly sensitive and rapid method for diagnosis of rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis was established. Seven rifampin-resistant and five rifampin-susceptible specimens were analyzed. Rifampin resistance was determined by MIC measurement. A complex electrophoretic pattern consisting of many bands was obtained for both susceptible and rifampin-resistant isolates. The same pattern was obtained for all of the susceptible specimens, but differences between resistant and susceptible isolates were found. DNA sequencing showed that a particular mutation produces a specific electrophoretic pattern.
