The biofilm mode of growth is the survival strategy of environmental bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Such P. aeruginosa biofilms also occur in the lungs of chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients, where they protect the bacteria against antibiotics and the immune response. The lung tissue damage is due to immune complex mediated chronic inflammation dominated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes releasing proteases and oxygen radicals.
