This paper describes an efficient synthesis and the antiparasitic evaluation of cyclic beta-amino acid-containing dipeptides 3.1-3.6 and 4.1-4.5. The antimalarial properties of all these dipeptides have been evaluated in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum and in vivo against Plasmodium berghai. Compounds 4.4 and 4.5 have been found to be very effective in this respect, with IC50 values of 3.87 and 3.64 microg/mL in the in vitro test, while 4.5 has also been found to be active in the in vivo evaluation.
