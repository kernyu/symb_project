Forty-six Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 clinical isolates resistant to nalidixic acid were studied. The use of molecular typing techniques, other indicators of resistance patterns, the plasmid profile, and the presence of genes that encode aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme production suggested to us a clonal dissemination of the studied strains.
