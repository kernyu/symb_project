OBJECTIVES: Only a part of MS patients treated with interferon beta (IFN) respond positively to the applied treatment and to date no parameter predicting the response to treatment has been found. The aim of the study was to determine whether the levels of interleukin-10 and -12 (IL-10 and IL-12) might be the parameters enabling us to distinguish those patients who would best respond to therapy before the IFN treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 29 patients with clinically definite relapsing-remitting MS treated with IFN beta. In all of them the levels of IL-10 and IL-12 in blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid were determined before treatment using ELISA method. After the 2-year therapy the patients responding and nonresponding to IFN therapy were distinguished on the basis of clinical parameters. RESULTS: In the patients responding positively to IFN treatment the level of IL-10 in blood serum before treatment was found to be significantly lower (p<0.05) and distinctively differentiated responders from nonresponders. The IL-12 levels were similar both in cerebrospinal fluid and serum and no significant differences between responders and nonresponders were found. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that IL-10 level may be a useful parameter to identify the patients potentially responding to IFN therapy.
