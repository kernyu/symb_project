OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemic tendency of the bacteria causing burn wound infection, and to explore the influencing factors. METHODS: Bacterial ecology on burn wound was investigated in 210 cases of burn patients admitted to our hospital from January 1999 to December 2000, and the results were compared to those done in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. RESULTS: Since 1999, G(+)cocci increased obviously (52.17%) when compared with those of the past three decades (P < 0.01), while G(minus sign) bacilli decreased significantly (46.48%, P < 0.01). The ratio of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in recent two years was evidently lower than those in the early 1970s and 1990s (P < 0.01) while the ratio of staphylococcus aureus was much higher than those in the middle of 1980s and 1990s (P < 0.01), in which methacillin -- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 85% or so, which increased significantly than those in the middle of 1980s and the beginning of 1990s (P < 0.01) with an increasing tendency. CONCLUSION: The increasing tendency of Staphylococcus aureus in our unit for the recent two years might closely be related to the preferential application of Imipenem in burn infection control. Furthermore, the ratio of MRSA in Staphylococcus aureus could not be lowered by vancomycin.
