A total of 493 clinical and environmental specimens were collected from May 1997 to August 1998 from Jimma Hospital wards to determine the frequency of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of staphylococci isolates. The specimens were obtained from pus and discharge (32%), blood (22%), urine (18%), nasal swabs (15%), and environmental samples (12%). Of the total 61 S. aureus isolates, 34 (55.7), 15 (24.6%), 8 (13.1%), and 4 (6.6%) were identified from pus and discharge, nasal swabs, blood, and environmental samples, respectively. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were also isolated from nasal swabs (48.3%), pus and discharge (29.2%) and environmental samples (13.5%). Multiple antimicrobial resistance was commonly revealed by the S. aureus isolates (84%). Fifty eight (95%), 57 (93%), 43 (72%), and 30 (49%) of the S. aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin, respectively. Methicillin resistance was also observed in 25 (43%) of the isolates. Similarly, coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were multi-antimicrobial resistant (96%). The antimicrobial resistance profile of the CNS isolates observed was against penicillin (88%), ampicillin (87%), tetracycline (75%), and chloramphenicol (66%). By contrast, the S. aureus and CNS isolates appeared to be sensitive to gentamicin, kanamycin, and clindamycin. Options available to treat infections caused by multiple resistant staphylococci are limited especially in developing countries. Therefore, the ever growing emergence of antimicrobial resistance requires enhanced surveillance, prudent use of existing antimicrobial drugs, increased emphasis on infection control, and hygienic practices.
