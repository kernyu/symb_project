A number of new antimicrobial agents have been licensed in the last years, most prominently a number of new antiviral and antimycotic agents. The development of new antibacterial agents has slowed down, new agents are mainly targeted at a small but rapidly growing number of patients infected with bacteria resistant to the current antibiotics. The rates of resistance against antibiotics are rapidly rising, especially for gram-positive cocci and, in addition, for gram-negative nosocomial agents. Rising rates of resistances are further present in chronic viral infections, e. g., HIV infection. Instruments to monitor and minimize the rates of resistances are necessary. Important changes are to be found in a number of infectious complications. For patients with sepsis a new therapeutic principle, drocretogrin, has been found to reduce mortality. Additionally, low-dose corticosteroids in selected patients, close control of blood sugar and other interventions have shown to be effective. Corticosteroids have proven to be effective as well in the reduction of complications in adults with bacterial meningitis, most pronounced in pneumococcal meningitis. With new drugs licensed for the treatment of malaria and changes in the epidemiology, the guidelines for therapy and prevention have been reformulated.
