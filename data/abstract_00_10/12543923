This study investigated the species prevalence and antibacterial resistance among enterococci isolated in Kuwait hospitals. They consisted of 415 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (85.3 %), Enterococcus faecium (7.7 %), Enterococcus casseliflavus (4.0 %), Enterococcus avium (1.2 %), Enterococcus durans (1.0 %), Enterococcus gallinarium (0.5 %) and Enterococcus bovis (0.2 %) isolated from urine (36.6 %), blood (10.4 %), wound swabs (11.0 %), stool samples (12.0 %), high vaginal swabs (9.0 %), endocervical swabs (3.0 %) and miscellaneous sources (18.0 %). All of them were susceptible to linezolid. Fifty-two (12.5 %) isolates were ampicillin resistant but none of them produced beta-lactamase. They were resistant to erythromycin (63.3 %), tetracycline (60.5 %), ciprofloxacin (40.0 %), chloramphenicol (28.0 %), vancomycin (2.6 %), and teicoplanin (2.6 %). Fourteen, 19 and 20 % of them expressed high-level resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin, respectively. All of the vancomycin-resistant strains carried the vanA phenotype and genotype. There was no evidence of clonal spread of the vancomycin-resistant isolates.
