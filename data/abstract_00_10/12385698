The activity of moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxyquinolone, was compared in vitro with the activity of ciprofloxacin against clinical strains isolated from various sites of infection. The mode MIC values of moxifloxacin were superior to those of ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter spp., while ciprofloxacin was more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Both antibiotics had similar activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Enterobacter spp.
