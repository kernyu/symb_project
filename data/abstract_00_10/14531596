Fiber posts are widely used in the restoration of endodontically treated teeth. Scientific evidence demonstrates that the mechanical performance of teeth restored with fiber posts in combination with resin luting cements is improved with respect to metallic post restorations. The post is cemented inside the root canal using low modulus elastic polymer resins. In this study, the mechanical resistance of four different post-cement systems was assessed by means of a micro-mechanical pull-out test assisted by a simulation using the finite element methodology. This in vitro test is specifically designed to accurately characterize the post-cement interface. The results show no significant difference among the adhesion properties of the various types of post-cement systems used.
