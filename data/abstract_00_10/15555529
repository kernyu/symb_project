Interleukin (IL)-12 is a critical cytokine in the T helper (Th)1 response and host defense against intracellular microorganisms, while its role in host resistance to extracellular bacteria remains elusive. In the present study, we elucidated the role of IL-12 in the early-phase host defense against acute pulmonary infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, a typical extracellular bacterium, using IL-12p40 gene-disrupted (IL-12p40KO) mice. IL-12p40KO mice were highly susceptible to S. pneumoniae infection, as indicated by the shortened survival time, which was completely restored by the replacement therapy with recombinant (r) IL-12, and increased bacterial counts in the lung. In these mice, recruitment of neutrophils in the lung was significantly attenuated when compared to that in wild-type (WT) mice, which correlated well with the reduced production of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the infected tissues at the early phase of infection. In vitro synthesis of both cytokines by S. pneumoniae-stimulated lung leukocytes was significantly lower in IL-12p40KO mice than in WT mice, and addition of rIL-12 or interferon (IFN)-gamma restored the reduced production of MIP-2 and TNF-alpha in IL-12p40KO mice. Neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody (mAb) significantly decreased the effect of rIL-12. Anti-IFN-gamma mAb shortened the survival time of infected mice and reduced the recruitment of neutrophils and production of MIP-2 and TNF-alpha in the lungs. Our results indicated that IL-12p40 plays a critical role in the early-phase host defense against S. pneumoniae infection by promoting the recruitment of neutrophils to the infected tissues.
