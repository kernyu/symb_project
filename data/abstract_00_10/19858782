Hypertrophic pseudo tumoral herpetic lesion is an uncommon presentation in immunocompromized hosts that can be refractory to established therapies. We describe bipolar anal and tonsilar herpetic tumoral lesions related to acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient. Treatment with valacyclovir, cidofovir, and thalidomide failed and surgical excision was required.
