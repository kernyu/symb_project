The rise in the rates of glycopeptide resistance among Staphylococcus aureus isolates is concerning and underscores the need for the development of novel potent compounds. Ceragenins CSA-8 and CSA-13, cationic steroid molecules that mimic endogenous antimicrobial peptides, have previously been demonstrated to possess broad-spectrum activities against multidrug-resistant bacteria. We examined the activities of CSA-8 and CSA-13 against clinical isolates of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA), as well as vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) and compared them to those of daptomycin, linezolid, and vancomycin by susceptibility testing and killing curve analysis. We also examined CSA-13 for its concentration-dependent activity, inoculum effect, postantibiotic effect (PAE), and synergy in combination with various antimicrobials. Overall, the MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations of CSA-13 were fourfold lower than those of CSA-8. Time-kill curve analysis of the VRSA, VISA, and hVISA clinical isolates demonstrated concentration-dependent bactericidal killing. An inoculum effect was also observed when a higher starting bacterial density was used, with the time required to achieve 99.9% killing reaching 1 h with a 6-log10-CFU/ml starting inoculum, whereas it was>or=24 h with a 8- to 9-log10-CFU/ml starting inoculum with 10x the MIC (P<or=0.001). A concentration-dependent PAE was demonstrated with CSA-13, nearly doubling from 2x to 4x the MIC (P=0.03). With respect to the CSA-13 antimicrobial combinations, time-kill curve analysis showed no difference in the log10 CFU/ml at 24 h for the majority of the organisms tested. However, early synergy at 4 to 8 h was detected against the VRSA Pennsylvania strain (2002) when CSA-13 was tested in combination with gentamicin, while early additivity was demonstrated against all of the other organisms.
