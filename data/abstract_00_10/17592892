Paracoccidioidomycosis is a chronic progressive infection. It affects mainly the elderly and it is geographically limited to certain areas of Latin America. In Europe it is considered a rare imported infection. Here we report a case of paracoccidioidomycosis that occurred in a 27-year-old Ecuadorian patient living in Spain initially misdiagnosed as blastomycosis. The typical multi-budding yeast cells of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis were observed in Grocott stained samples. This case should alert Spanish mycologists, clinicians and pathologists about the possibility of patients who have travelled or lived outside Spain may suffer paracoccidioidomycosis or other imported mycoses.
