Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is enhanced by antimicrobial selection pressure by antibiotics and the crossed transmission. Multiresistant bacteria (MRB) are involved in 1/5 of nosocomial infections and the 3/4 of the MRB are meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The epidemic diffusion of these strains is still poorly controlled in our hospitals. The fight against the diffusion of these bacteria requires not only to screen patients harbouring antibiotic-resistant bacteria and respect hygiene measures, but also actions aiming at reducing the weight of selection pressure by antibiotics.
