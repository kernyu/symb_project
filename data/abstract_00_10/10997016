There has been a substantial decrease in maternal-infant transmission of HIV in many European and North American countries during the past five years, from 15-25 per cent to approximately 5%. Reasons include the prophylactic administration of zidovudine to mother and child, more effective treatment strategies leading to decreased viral load during pregnancy, and increased use of elective Caesarean section. In developing countries however, the vertical transmission rate of HIV is still high at 25-40 per cent. Simpler and less expensive prophylactic regimens, such as nevirapine to mother and child at delivery and after birth, respectively, have raised hope. Drug resistance and the risk of adverse effects of antiretroviral drugs on the child are threats to the prevention of mother-to-infant transmission of HIV.
