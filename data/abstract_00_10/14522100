Quinolone and macrolide resistance of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli mainly depend on a mutation in gyrA and in 23S rDNA, respectively. In order to detect quinolone and/or macrolide resistant C. jejuni and C. coli strains, a macrolide and quinolone line probe assay (MQ-LiPA) was developed and 42 C. jejuni and C. coli strains were tested to evaluate the efficiency of the assay. Profiles of the mutations in 23S rDNA and in gyrA characterized by MQ-LiPA agreed with resistance to macrolides and quinolones. MQ-LiPA is a rapid and simple method for simultaneous detection of quinolone and macrolide resistance of C. jejuni and C. coli. We could also discriminate between C. jejuni and C. coli using probes for detection of gyrA mutations in MQ-LiPA.
