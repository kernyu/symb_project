Non-B HIV-1 samples collected in France between 1999 and 2001 were sequenced in the env, reverse transcriptase (RT), and protease genes (1) to characterize further the non-B strains circulating in the country, (2) to assess the importance of recombination, and (3) to describe the polymorphism of RT and protease genes and appreciate a possible impact on susceptibility to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. The results show that, within a background of CRF02_AG predominance, there is a high genetic diversity of non-B isolates, including intersubtype recombinants. There is an extensive polymorphism of protease and RT genes compared with B consensus sequences; we have so far no data indicating that these non-B isolates may have reduced sensitivity to ARV drugs.
