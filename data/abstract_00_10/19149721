The widespread resistance to antibiotics among pathogenic bacteria has made development of alternatives to antibiotics a pressing public concern. Extensive studies have established bacteriophages (phages) and phage-encoded lytic enzymes (virolysins) as two of the most promising families of alternative antibacterials for the treatment and prophylaxis of bacterial infections. They have shown great potential in veterinary and human medicine for the treatment and prophylaxis of infections. Technologies have also been patented employing phages and virolysins in other pathogen related applications including detection and decontamination.
