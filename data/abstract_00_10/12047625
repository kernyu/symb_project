One of the earliest signal transduction events that trigger the hypersensitive response (HR) of plants against pathogen attack is thought to be an alteration of proton flux across the plasma membrane (PM). However, no direct genetic evidence for the involvement of PM-localised proton channels or pumps in the induction of this response has been reported. We previously showed that expression of the bacterial proton pump bacterio-opsin (bO) in transgenic plants resulted in the spontaneous activation of the HR. Here we show that the bO protein is likely localised to the PM in transgenic tobacco plants. Furthermore, mutational analysis shows that induction of the HR by bO expression is dependent upon the capability of bO to translocate protons. Although bO functions as a light-driven proton pump in Halobacteria when assembled with retinal, we also show by mutational analysis that this chromophore binding is unnecessary for its in planta activity. Taken together, our results suggest that expression of bO in plants leads to the insertion of a passive proton channel into the PM. The activity of this channel in the PM results in spontaneous activation of cell death and HR-associated phenotypes including enhanced resistance to a broad spectrum of plant pathogens. Our work provides direct molecular evidence to support a working model in which alterations in ionic homeostasis at the level of the PM may work as one of the critical steps in the signalling pathway for the activation of the HR.
