Molecular co-suppression phenomena are important to consider in transgene experiments. Embryogenic cells were obtained from immature cotyledons and engineered with two different gene constructs (pHV and pHVS) through particle bombardment. Both constructs contain a gene conferring resistance to hygromycin (hpt) as a selective marker and a modified glycinin (11S globulin) gene (V3-1) as a target. sGFP(S65T) as a reporter gene was, however, inserted into the flanking region of the V3-1 gene (pHVS). Fluorescence microscopic screening after the selection of hygromycin, identified clearly the expression of sGFP(S65T) in the transformed soybean embryos bombarded with the pHVS construct. Stable integration of the transgenes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analysis. Seeds of transgenic plants obtained from the pHV construct frequently lacked an accumulation of endogenous glycinin, which is encoded by homologous genes to the target gene V3-1. Most of the transgenic plants expressing sGFP(S65T) showed highly accumulation of glycinin. The expression of sGFP(S65T) and V3-1 inherits into the next generations. sGFP(S65T) as a reporter gene may be useful to increase the transformation efficiency of transgenic soybean with avoiding gene co-suppression.
