Wild type strains of Burkholderia pseudomallei, spontaneous mutants with high resistance to fluoroquinolones and ceftazidime, and Tn5-induced mutants with reduced resistance level were studied using polymorphic and gene-specific DNA fingerprinting. Cluster analysis of genomic DNA patterns obtained using PCR with arbitrary primer (5'-GTTTCGCTCC-3') and primer specific to the class I integrase intll gene (5'-CCTCCCGCACGATGATC-3') was performed. According to the DNA pattern conformity, the distinct groups submitted by high-level resistant B. pseudomallei derivatives were revealed by both typing approaches. The obtained results may be useful in searching for molecular markers associated with different types of antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic and related burkholderiae.
