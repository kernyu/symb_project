Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are a rare cause of meningitis, occurring primarily in patients who have undergone neurosurgical procedures. We describe the first reported case of VRE meningitis successfully treated with linezolid. A 56-y-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage underwent ventriculostomy and embolization of cerebral aneurysms. Her postoperative course was complicated by multiple infections needing repeated antibiotic courses, culminating in the development of VRE meningitis. She was treated with 600 mg of i.v. linezolid (MIC < 0.75 microg/ml) every 12 h for 6 weeks. After the fourth dose, peak and trough linezolid concentrations were 11.45 and 0.14 microg/ml in serum and 3.19 and 2.39 microg/ml in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). On Day 19 of linezolid therapy, serum and CSF trough concentrations were 1.53 and 2.98 microg/ml, respectively. Linezolid achieved sufficient CSF concentrations to bring about clinical and bacteriological cure. We conclude that i.v. linezolid may be a useful option for treating VRE meningitis. We also present findings of a literature review, which identified 11 cases of VRE meningitis treated with other pharmacologic agents with mixed success.
