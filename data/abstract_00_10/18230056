Nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens continue to be a challenge, mainly due to the increasing rates of resistance among Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. Oritavancin, a new parenteral semisynthetic glycopeptide, possessing rapid bactericidal action and an antimicrobial spectrum containing all Gram-positive pathogens (streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci--vancomycin-resistant enterococci included--and Clostridia spp.) irrespective of their resistance status to the precursor molecule of vancomycin, is expected to file a new drug application by the first trimester of 2008. Once-daily dosing, good penetration into macrophages, in vitro activity against bacteria embedded in biofilms and low adverse reaction potential are further considered as oritavancin's advantages over existing drugs. While waiting for the results of supplementary Phase III studies to be announced, preliminary reports suggest the new drug will be a welcome addition to the existing antimicrobial armamentarium against Gram-positive cocci.
