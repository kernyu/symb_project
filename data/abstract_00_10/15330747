The increasing incidence of serious infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria has led to the development of new spectrum-specific agents. One such agent is Cubicin (daptomycin for injection), the first member of a new class of antibacterials called cyclic lipopeptides. Daptomycin has rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against most clinically significant Gram-positive pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-intermediate and -resistant S. aureus. This cyclic lipopeptide has a unique mechanism of action and exhibits a relatively prolonged concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect in vitro. In September 2003 the US FDA approved daptomycin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections. With its once-daily dosing, excellent safety profile and low potential for resistance, daptomycin is a welcome new addition to the armamentarium against Gram-positive infections.
