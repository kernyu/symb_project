Marination is widely used to enhance flavor and increase consumer acceptability of meat and poultry products. The impact of such marination on the safety and shelf life of poultry meat was evaluated in this study. A series of experiments were conducted to determine the efficacy of teriyaki and lemon pepper marinades against multiple strains of nalidixic acid (NAL)-resistant Salmonella. NAL-resistant Salmonella serovar (Typhimurium, Heidelberg, and Senftenberg) cultures were inoculated onto chicken skin at 0.6 to 3.14 log CFU/g in a 12-well titer plate. Inoculated chicken skin was exposed to teriyaki or lemon pepper marinades for up to 32 h and stored at 4 or 25 degrees C to determine the prevalence of Salmonella. To determine Salmonella survival, a three-strain cocktail of Salmonella was inoculated at low (ca. 4 log CFU/g) and high (8 log CFU/g) levels onto chicken skin that was then marinated with either teriyaki or lemon pepper marinade for up to 32 h and stored at 4 or 25 degrees C. Prevalence of Salmonella was significantly reduced (P </= 0.05) by teriyaki marinade at all levels of contamination regardless of storage temperature. Lemon pepper marinade reduced Salmonella prevalence (P </= 0.05) at low levels of contamination (10(1) and 10(2) CFU/g), whereas no significant effect (P > 0.05) was observed at higher levels of contamination. Marination of chicken skin with teriyaki marinade greatly reduced Salmonella prevalence and survival (P </= 0.05) regardless of the storage temperature, indicating the antimicrobial potential of this marinade for poultry and meat products.
