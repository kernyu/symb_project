A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay was established to detect linezolid resistance (conferred by the mutation 2576G>T in the gene coding for the 23 string of the ribosomal RNA) in enterococci. The assay was evaluated with 106 Enterococcus isolates; it showed a sensitivity of 100% for the detection of phenotypic resistance and was even able to identify a single mutated allele in phenotypically linezolid-susceptible isolates.
