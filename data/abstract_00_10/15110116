A pilot study was performed on a 28-bed acute hospital ward, promoting hand disinfection by providing Sterillium alcohol hand rub at the bedside. Bottles of Sterillium with pump dispensers were attached to the end of each patient's bed, next to the observation charts. Posters promoting the use of the product were prominently displayed and several ward staff attended a presentation on the effectiveness of Sterillium. Although this was a small study, Alert Organism rates during the three-month trial indicated a reduction in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) incidence and an increased Clostridium difficile incidence. Several other factors that may have influenced the study outcomes will be discussed. There were no health and safety problems during the trial, but other issues were identified which have implications for introducing the bedside rub on a hospital wide basis, including the type of holder used, logistical arrangements and the staff and patient information requirements. The strategies adopted to address these issues will be discussed.
