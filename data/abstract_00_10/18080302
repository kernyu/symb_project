The porous materials of Cu and Ag/Cu were successfully prepared by the electrodeposition on a precursor of conventional polyamide foam. The microstructure of the porous materials was observed by scanning electron microscope. Their porosity and specific surface area were measured. The inhibition effect of Cu porous materials against E. coli was also investigated. The broad-spectrum of antibiosis of the Cu and Ag/Cu porous materials were characterized. The corrosion resistance of Cu, Ag/Cu coatings was also compared. The shape and size of pores are uniform in three directions for the porous materials. Their porosity may reach above 95% and specific surface area is beyond 12.8 m(2)/m(3). The antibacterial test results show that the Cu porous materials not only exhibited high antibacterial effect and good broad-spectrum antibacterial properties, but also excellent persistent antibacterial effects; the antibacterial effects, and broad-spectrum of antibiosis were greatly improved through the deposition of a thin Ag coating on the surface of Cu porous material.
