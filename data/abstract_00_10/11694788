Preclinical data indicate that trastuzumab (Herceptin) has the potential for synergistic or additive effects in combination with therapies including chemotherapy and hormonal agents, providing the rationale for a number of clinical trials in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. A recently reported phase II trial has demonstrated that trastuzumab plus vinorelbine is both effective (overall response rate 75%) and well tolerated, with the major side effects being typical of single-agent vinorelbine. Other combinations of trastuzumab with a variety of other chemotherapeutic and hormonal agents are also being assessed. In an effort to overcome the cardiotoxicity observed with trastuzumab plus doxorubicin in the pivotal phase III trial, combination regimens involving potentially less toxic anthracyclines such as epirubicin and liposomal formulations of doxorubicin are ongoing. In addition, trials are investigating whether trastuzumab can reverse the resistance to hormonal therapy that develops in most women with metastatic breast cancer. These and other studies will identify the regimens that produce the best outcomes with the fewest possible side effects in women with HER2-positive breast cancer.
