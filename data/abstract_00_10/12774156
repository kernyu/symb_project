OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors of infections with piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant Escherichia coli in critical care patients. DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive sample survey study. SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in a university hospital. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 133 patients from whom culture results were positive for E. coli during their ICU stay. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following significant independent factors associated with the emergence of a piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant Escherichia coli: prior use of amoxicillin (odds ratio, 4.15) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (odds ratio, 3.25). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is a major risk factor for the detection of piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant E. coli in ICU patients.
