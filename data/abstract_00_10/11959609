The impact of different types of enzymatic resistance on the in vivo antibacterial activity of aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, and netilmicin) was studied in the rabbit endocarditis model with four strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Animals were treated in a manner simulating the administration of a single daily human dose. Amikacin had no effect on the three kanamycin-resistant strains despite apparent susceptibility in the disk diffusion test. Gentamicin appears to be the preferable aminoglycoside for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
