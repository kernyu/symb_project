The present study defines a series of genetic procedures to be used for molecular studies in photosynthetic halophilic species such as Rhodovibrio salinarum and Rhodothalassium salexigens. In both species, the minimal inhibitory concentrations for the antibiotics tetracycline, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin, streptomycin, and kanamycin were determined. In addition, conjugal transfer of IncP and IncQ plasmids from Escherichia coli was demonstrated and the resistance markers expressed in these halophiles were determined. Finally, Rth. salexigens growth dependence on variable salt concentrations was measured: maximal growth rates were seen at 6% and 4% NaCl under phototrophic and chemotrophic conditions, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report analyzing the genetic properties of two representative species of halophilic purple non-sulfur phototrophs.
