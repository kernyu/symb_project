Escherichia coli urinary tract isolates were collected in 1997-2003 from Nimes University Hospital in order to investigate long-term trends in antibiotic resistance and to explore the relationship between antibiotic use and the emergence of resistance. Time-series analysis (ARIMA models) and dynamic regression models were used to investigate relationships between antibiotic use and resistance to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Significant increases were seen in the frequency of ofloxacin (8.9 to 16.7%) and ciprofloxacin resistance (6.2 to 10.1%) (p < 0.001). Using multivariate dynamic regression analysis, it was found that an increased use of one defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 patient-days for ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin induced average increases of 0.81%, 0.65% and 0.53% in E. coli ofloxacin resistance (p < 0.01), with average delays of 4, 4 and 6 months, respectively. An increase of 1 DDD/1000 patient-days of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin use induced increases of 0.73%, 0.82% and 0.63% in E. coli ciprofloxacin resistance (p < 0.01), with average delays of 4, 4 and 5 months, respectively. The use of nalidixic acid was not associated significantly with an increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones by multivariate analysis.
