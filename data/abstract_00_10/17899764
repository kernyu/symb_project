A total of 50 clinical imipenem-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were subjected to the ceftazidime-2- mercaptoethanol -double-disk synergy test and to the PCR assays with primers specific for bla(IMP-1). After the process of sequencing the positive one to identify the results, PCR analysis was conducted with primers specific for class 1 integrons. For synergy test, 28 isolates gave positive results, among which were 27 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Only one Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to carry bla(IMP-1), and bla(Int1) at the same time. This is the first ascertainment of IMP-1 producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate carrying bla(IntI1) in West China, which is of significance to the research on the clinical spread of these drug-resisitant genes.
