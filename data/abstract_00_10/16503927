The extensive and sometimes indiscriminate use of antibiotics sometimes without strict indications has led to increases in both bacterial resistance and sensitization of patients. Systemic antibiotics in skin infections are indicated when a severe local infection occurs which spreads into the surrounding tissue or when there are signs of systemic infection. There are special indications in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease,diabetes or immunosuppression. Topical use of antibiotics should be abandoned and replaced by antiseptics. The beta-lactam antibiotics are the antibiotics of first choice for many skin infections. They are usually effective, have a well-defined profile of adverse events and most are affordable. Penicillin G or V are the first line treatment for erysipelas. Infections with Staphylococcus aureus are usually treated with isoxazolyl penicillins or second generation cephalosporins. In mixed infections in patients with diabetes or peripheral arterial occlusive disease,the treatment of choice is metronidazole plus beta-lactam-/beta-lactamase inhibitor antibiotics, but quinolones or second generation cephalosporins can also be used, once again with metronidazole. The aim of this review is to define the indications for antibiotics in dermatology, to highlight their modes of action and adverse effects and to make suggestions for rational antibiotic therapy in cutaneous infections frequently encountered in the practice of dermatology.
