This study examined viridans streptococci (SV) in oral flora of patients at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) by obtaining 57 isolates from gum-tooth margin swabs of 3 groups of patients. Penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by E test. Group 1 was from 30 patients with prosthetic heart valves who did not receive antimicrobial agents within 3 months prior to recruitment. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients with known rheumatic heart diseases who regularly received penicillin prophylaxis. Group 3 was 2 patients with IE caused by SV in whom dental swabs were performed before and on the third day of treatment. Streptococcus mitis was found most frequently (49% among 51 oral isolates of SV from patients in group 1 and 2) and in both blood cultures of IE patients. Ninety-four per cent of the isolates were penicillin-susceptible and the rest were intermediate-resistant (IR) equally distributed in both groups 1 and 2. In 2 patients with IE, oral SV obtained after 3 days of penicillin therapy had MICs rising 3 and 5 folds of the baselines. It is suggested that surveillance of susceptibilities of oral SV in patients at risk for IE should be kept up since this will affect the dose and type of antimicrobial agents in IE prophylaxis.
