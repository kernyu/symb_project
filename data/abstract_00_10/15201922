The prevalence of antibiotic resistance was studied in 3230 strains of Salmonella enterica isolated in the Hospital Universitario La Paz in Madrid, Spain, from 1991 to 2001. Betalactam antibiotic resistance has been notorious in serogroup B4; the highest prevalence of ampicillin resistance (84%) was reached in 2000 and that of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (45%) in 1996. Resistance to cephalosporins has been controlled, although in 2000 cefazolin resistance reached 37% in serogroup C2-8. An increase in first generation quinolone resistance was detected in every serogroup, especially in D9 and C2-8, which showed an increase from 6% and 15% in 1991, respectively, to 40% and 85% in 2001. Although important resistance to ciprofloxacin has not yet been detected, the activity of fluoroquinolones against Salmonella must be closely monitored.
