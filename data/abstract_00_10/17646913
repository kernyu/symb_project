Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is increasing in prevalence both in nosocomial and in community settings. Treatment of such infections, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS), is problematic, as available options are limited. Linezolid is a new antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, and has good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid. To our knowledge, there are only three case reports of successful treatment of CNS infections caused by MRSA with linezolid; we report herein a fourth such case. Clinical trials to address the role of linezolid in CNS infections are urgently needed.
