This paper presents a molecular simulation study of the interactions of a protein (lysozyme) with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of mannitol and sorbitol terminated alkanethiols in the presence of explicit water molecules and ions. The all-atom simulations were performed to calculate the force generated on the protein as a function of its distance above the SAM surfaces. The structural and dynamic properties of water molecules both above the SAM surfaces and around the SAM head groups were analyzed to provide a better understanding of the nonfouling behavior of the sugar-based SAM surfaces. Results from this work suggest that both mannitol and sorbitol SAMs generate a tightly bound, structured water layer around the SAM chains. This hydration layer creates a repulsive force on the protein when it approaches the surface, resulting in a nonfouling surface despite the presence of hydrogen-bond donor groups. This work demonstrates the importance of strong surface-water interactions for surface resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption.
