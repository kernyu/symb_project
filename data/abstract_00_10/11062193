The pharmacokinetics in plasma and saliva of a new ketolide, telithromycin (HMR 3647), and the effect on the normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora were studied in healthy volunteers and compared with those of clarithromycin. Ten subjects received 800 mg telithromycin perorally once daily and 10 other subjects received 500 mg clarithromycin bid for 10 days. Blood, saliva and faecal specimens were collected at defined intervals before, during and after administration for pharmacokinetic and microbiological analyses. In subjects receiving telithromycin, the mean C:(max), AUC and C:(24) (24 h) in saliva exceeded the values obtained from plasma, while saliva and serum pharmacokinetic parameters were in the same range for the clarithromycin group. The quantitative ecological disturbances in the normal microflora during administration of telithromycin were moderate and comparable to those associated with clarithromycin administration. No overgrowth of yeasts or Clostridium difficile occurred. Emergence of resistant strains was seen in both treatment groups. Administration of both telithromycin and clarithromycin was associated with significant increases in MICs for intestinal Bacteroides isolates, which persisted 2 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. In addition, a significant emergence of highly clarithromycin-resistant alpha-haemolytic streptococci, intestinal enterococci and Enterobacteriaceae was detected at day 10 in the clarithromycin group. In conclusion, administration of telithromycin resulted in high drug levels in saliva, which indicates a good therapeutic profile for throat infections. Telithromycin seems to have a more favourable ecological profile compared with clarithromycin in terms of resistance development in the normal microflora.
