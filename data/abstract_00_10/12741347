OBJECTIVES: The objective of this open-label, single-arm, multicenter study was to assess the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 72 outpatients with symptoms/signs of urinary tract infection and underlying anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract was enrolled to receive levofloxacin 250 mg orally once daily for 10 days. Return visits were scheduled at 3-5 days (early follow-up visit) and 4-6 weeks after completion of therapy (long-term follow-up). At each visit symptoms and signs were assessed, possible adverse events were recorded and a urine specimen was obtained for culture. RESULTS: At 3-5 days post-therapy clinical success rate was 94% and the overall microbiological eradication rate of pathogens was 94%. Microbiological eradication rate with respect to patients was 86%. Treatment failed in 4 patients and 2 patients had superinfections with pathogens still susceptible to levofloxacin. At long-term follow-up visit 3 reinfections were observed in patients previously cured at early follow-up. Drug-related adverse events were reported by 2 patients. CONCLUSION: These study results indicate that levofloxacin 250 mg orally once daily for 10 days is an effective and well tolerated treatment of complicated urinary tract infections.
