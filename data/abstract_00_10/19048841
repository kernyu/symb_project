Studies of the role of H. pylori (Hp) in etiopathogenesis of a number of common diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract changed traditional approaches to their management with emphasis on antibiotic therapy. Positive effect of Hp eradication was confirmed in numerous randomized clinical studies. Bismuth-containing drugs have been used for a long time to treat gastrointestinal disorders. To-day, bismuth tri-potassium di-citrate (de---nol) is considered to be an optimal tool for different schemes of eradication therapy (triple and quadruple therapy of the first and second lines) and recommended to improve its efficiency by overcoming resistance of Hp to antibiotics. The overall efficacy of anti-helicobacterial therapy using bismuth tri-potassium di-citrate amounts to 81-98%. This compound has cytoprotective effect on gastric and duodenal mucosa, besides antibacterial action. All these properties characterize de-nol as a single universal preparation for the treatment of erosive ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
