The growing incidence of microbial infections and the increasing ability of such organisms to acquire resistance to antimicrobial treatment lead the requirement of fast bacteria and fungi identification methods. In this work we explored optical spectroscopic techniques on fungal identification. We show that some fungal infections can be identified by ultraviolet optical excitation of fungi fluorescence followed by the spectral analysis of the emitted light. Moreover, we demonstrate that ultraviolet LED and LASER could be applied in fungal identification and a new device for fungal diagnosis is proposed.
