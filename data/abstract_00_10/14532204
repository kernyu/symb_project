There is little information about invasive infections by group B streptococci (GBS) and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in Latin America. We performed a prospective multicenter study to determine the serotype distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility of GBS in Argentina. We identified 58 cases, but only 44 had sufficient data to be evaluated. Eight early-, four late-, and one fatal late, late-onset neonatal infections due to GBS were found. A total of 31 patients were adults with bacteremia, skin and soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, arthritis, meningitis, abdominal infections, and renal abscess. Serotype III was prevalent in late-onset neonatal disease, and several serotypes (Ia/c, III, Ia, and II) were involved in early-onset neonatal infections. Serotypes II, Ia/c, III, and IV were commonly found in adults, with serotype II prevalent in younger adults (18 to 69 years old) and serotype Ia/c prevalent in elderly adults (>70 years old). The mortality rate attributable to GBS infections was 10.8%. All GBS were susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone. Resistance to clindamycin (1.7%), erythromycin (5.2%), azithromycin (5.2%), minocycline (69%), and tetracycline (72.4%), to high levels of kanamycin and amikacin (1.7%), and to intermediately high levels of gentamicin (1.7%) was observed. The bifunctional enzyme AAC6'-APH2" was detected in the isolate resistant to aminoglycosides, and other genetic determinants were identified in other resistant isolates: tetM and tetO in tetracycline-resistant streptococci and mefA and ermTR for efflux-mediated and inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-resistant streptococci, respectively. For clinical purposes and rapid and easy detection of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant GBS, a screening method that used 1,000- micro g kanamycin disks is proposed.
