In order to identify new and potent candidate drugs to treat tuberculosis, a library of compounds was screened, and (S,S)-N,N'-bis-[3-(2,2',6,6'-tetramethylbenzhydryloxy)-2-hydroxy-propyl]-ethylene diamine (S2824) was identified as a hit in the screen. This research discusses our efforts to synthesize and test 30 analogs of this hit for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Two compounds with homopiperazine ring possess high in vitro activity against drug sensitive and resistant M. tuberculosis with MICs 0.78-3.13 microg/mL (or 1.22-4.88 microM).
