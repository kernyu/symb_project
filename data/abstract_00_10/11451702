In three Escherichia coli mutants, a change (Ala-51 to Val) in the gyrase A protein outside the standard quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) lowered the level of quinolone susceptibility more than changes at amino acids 67, 82, 84, and 106 did. Revision of the QRDR to include amino acid 51 is indicated.
