We describe phenotypic and genotypic traits of a group of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones that are either remnants of unsuccessful community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) clones or represent a transitional state with some yet-to-be-acquired characteristics of CA-MRSA. These rare strains (n = 20) were identified during a 10-year period (1990-1999) from 13 unrelated health care facilities in Wisconsin. The isolates were recovered from patients in nosocomial or long-term chronic care facilities (60%) and outpatient settings (40%). Sixty percent (n = 12) of the isolates were recovered from skin and soft tissue infections, whereas the remaining isolates (n = 8) were from invasive infections. Ninety percent of isolates were susceptible to all antibiotic classes tested or resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and spa typing clustered these isolates into 8, 8, and 14 clonal groups, respectively. Eight plasmid profiles were represented in these strains. All four agr types were represented, with type IV being predominant (40%). All strains harbored subtypes of type IV staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec but lacked genes for the virulence factor Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). The strains harbored one or more of the following toxin genes: sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seh, sej, sek, sel, seg, sei, sem, sen, and seo. Individual clonal groups maintained the same set of enterotoxin genes even though they were isolated over extended time periods, suggesting significant genomic stability. The potential role of PVL-carrying phages and plasmids in the success of CA-MRSA clones has been discussed.
