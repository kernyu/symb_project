Two strains of Raoultella planticola and one of Raoultella ornithinolytica showing carbapenem resistance were recovered from patients hospitalized in New Jersey and Ohio. All patients had received previous antimicrobial treatment, including carbapenems. These strains harbored bla(KPC-2) and bla(KPC-3). Carbapenemase genes were embedded in isoforms of Tn4401 and were plasmidic and chromosomal in location.
