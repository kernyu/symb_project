We have suggested recently that ATM-Rad3-Related (ATR) DNA damage signaling pathway, which responds to single-strand breaks in DNA, was activated in response to HBV infection. ATR knockdown cells showed decreased HBV DNA yields, implying HBV infection and replication activate and exploit the activated DNA damage response. Host cell proteins may constitute an attractive target for anti-HBV-1 therapeutics, since development of drug resistance against compounds targeting these cellular cofactor proteins is unlikely. In this study, we show that one of the clinically used compounds of ATR and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinases inhibitor, theophylline (Tp), significantly reduced the yield of HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2215 cell culture system, furthermore, Tp could also suppress serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels in the HBV-transgenic mice. Consistent with this result, immunohistology also showed reduced intensity of HBsAg staining on livers from Tp-treatment group. Taken together, these data indicated the feasibility of therapeutic approaches that target host cell proteins by inhibiting a cellular gene that was required for HBV replication and provided a potential approach for the prevention and treatment of HBV infection.
