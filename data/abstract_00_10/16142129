Rapid development of significant resistance to antimalarial drugs has been a major force driving research to identify and develop new compounds. The use of synthetic organometallic complexes seems to be promising for treatment of malaria infections. Recent progress in identification and development of new drugs promises to lead to a much greater range of antimalarial agents. Organometallic complexes and metalloporphyrins have shown in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum. Ferroquine (ferrocenyl chloroquine) is more active than chloroquine against strains and isolates of P. falciparum and shows efficacy against murine parasites.
