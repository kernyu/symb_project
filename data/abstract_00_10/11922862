The current use of antimicrobials has become more complex due to the extensive emergence of antibiotic resistance. The single most important approach in resistance control is probably the judicious use of chemotherapeutic agents. New agents that may be of use in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia are currently in development. Antimicrobials can be grouped according to their mechanism of action. These include protein synthesis inhibitors (ketolides, oxazolidinones, streptogramins and glycylcyclines), nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors (fluoroquinolones), peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors (beta-lactams and glycopeptides) and agents interfering with membrane function (cationic peptides and lipopeptides). Among those agents under development, only the oxazolidinones, the cationic peptides and the lipopeptide antibiotics can be truly regarded as structurally novel inhibitors as the other agents are analogues of existing compounds which have been in clinical use for many years.
