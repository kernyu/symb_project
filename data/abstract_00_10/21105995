Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia is a leading cause of infection in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Cloxacillin, cefazolin, and vancomycin are the mainstay antimicrobials. Cloxacillin administration leads to frequent drug dosing, longer length of stay (LOS), and higher cost, while resistance and poorer outcomes are associated with vancomycin use. Dosing cefazolin during HD allows for prolonged blood therapeutic levels. We assessed the outcomes and safety of a strategy of treating MSSA bacteremia with 2-3 g cefazolin on HD only. All HD patients with MSSA bacteremia admitted in June-December 2009 at our center and receiving this regime were compared with historical controls who received cloxacillin. Demographic characteristics and outcome measures like mortality, LOS, cost, recrudescence, and adverse drug reactions were assessed. Of 27 consecutive episodes reviewed, 14 and 13 patients received cefazolin and cloxacillin, respectively. Baseline demographics were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. More than one-third of the bacteremia was related to tunneled catheter infection. The 30-day mortality of cloxacillin- and cefazolin-treated patients was 15% and 7%, respectively (P=0.14). Two of the 11 survivors treated with cloxacillin (18%) had recrudescent bacteremia while none was observed in cefazolin-treated survivors. Cefazolin was associated with shorter LOS (10 vs. 20 days, P<0.05) and lower cost (US$8262.00 vs. US$15,367.00, P<0.05). Cefazolin use resulted in 3 idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions. Cefazolin dosed on each HD in MSSA bacteremia leads to earlier discharge and less cost. Larger prospective studies are, however, warranted to fully assess its safety and efficacy.
