In this study, a chromosomally encoded putative drug efflux pump of the SMR family, named AbeS, from a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii was characterized to elucidate its role in antimicrobial resistance. Expression of the cloned abeS gene in hypersensitive Escherichia coli host KAM32 resulted in decreased susceptibility to various classes of antimicrobial agents, detergents, and dyes. Deletion of the abeS gene in A. baumannii confirmed its role in conferring resistance to these compounds.
