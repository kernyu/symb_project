Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes were examined in HIV-infected patients with chronic and occult HBV infection. From a total population of 593 HIV-infected patients, 22 individuals (prevalence 3.7%) were found to be HBsAg while 72 (12.1%) were found to be anti-HBc alone. From them, 20 and 4 were HBV DNA positive, respectively. These last four patients are therefore considered to be HBV infected in an occult form. The genotypes could be determined in all 24 HBV-infected patients. HBV-A was the most common (20/24; 83.3%), followed by HBV-D (2/24; 8.3%) and HBV-F (1/24; 4.2%). The remaining sample exhibited mixed infection involving genotypes A and D as pure ones, thus also forming part of three intergenotypic recombinant forms exhibiting different mosaic S gene patterns. The sexual route of transmission was predominant among HBV genotype A-infected patients. Among the 24 HBV DNA-positive patients, point mutations related to lamivudine resistance were found in four strains. These viral strains showed a methionine-to-valine substitution at codon 204 (rtM204V) in association with an upstream B-domain change at rtL180M. Additionally, two of them exhibited the additional rtV173L mutation. The value of HBV molecular monitoring including both HBV viral genomic characterization and genotypic resistance profile in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals is discussed.
