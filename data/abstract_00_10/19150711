Time-kill assay and Etest testing for synergy of meropenem (MER) (1x MIC) plus polymyxin B (1/4, 1/2, and 1x MIC) were performed against 8 genetically unique MER-resistant clinical Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Time-kill assay demonstrated synergy for all isolates, whereas Etest showed synergy in 5 isolates and indifference in 3.
