In situ replacement of infected vascular grafts is an accepted alternative to total graft excision and extraanatomic replacement. Its success relies upon the ability of the newly inserted graft to resist recurrent infection. This study compares the efficacy of two methods used to reduce the risk of graft reinfection: rifampicin soaking versus silver bonding of grafts. The grafts' resistance to infection was tested in vitro in two protocols, each using a panel of seven common bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The length of time the grafts remained free of organisms was compared between the groups. Both the silver graft and the rifampicin-soaked graft were significantly better than control graft at preventing bacterial growth on the graft surface. The rifampicin inhibited the growth of the gram-positive organisms, including MRSA, significantly better than the silver graft on days 2 and 3 (p < 0.001). Conversely, the silver graft was significantly more effective against the gram-negative organisms until day 4 (p < 0.0001). Both types of graft inhibit the in vitro growth of bacteria more effectively than controls, with rifampicin being most effective against gram-positive organisms and silver being best against the gram-negative organisms.
