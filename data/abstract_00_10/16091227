Issues, such as complexity, tolerability, and drug resistance and cross-resistance, limit the effectiveness of current antiretroviral regimens and make the continued development of newer agents important, despite the availability of 20 approved drugs for the treatment of HIV infection. Many new compounds are in development in existing classes: nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (eg, D-d4FC and SPD754), non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (eg, capravirine and TMC125), and protease inhibitors (eg, tipranavir and TMC114). In addition, newer classes of antiretroviral drugs, such as HIV entry inhibitors (eg, TNX-355, SCH 417690, UK-427,857, AMD 11070), that target the first step in the HIV life cycle are under development. Continued improvement in the treatment of HIV infection will result from the availability of convenient, well-tolerated, and affordable drugs with potent and durable antiretroviral activity.
