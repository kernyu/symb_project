OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between induced apoptosis of human luteinized granulosa cells (GCs) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome. STUDY DESIGN: We induced apoptosis with interferon gamma and an anti-human Fas antibody in cultured GCs isolated from follicular fluids coming from 25 different women undergoing 25 consecutive IVF cycles. After examination of 1000 GCs stained by DAPI with a fluorescent microscope, we determined the percentages of apoptotic GCs. Ovarian, endometrial and IVF parameters were recorded for every woman. RESULTS: We classified the women according to their induced GCs apoptosis percentages in two groups. Group 1 with a low percentage of apoptotic GCs (11.6+/-4.8%) had a significantly higher pregnancy rate (P<0.05) than group 2 with a high percentage of apoptotic GCs (59.5+/-14.8%). No other statistically significant differences were observed. CONCLUSION: Resistance of human GCs to apoptosis might be implicated in IVF outcome.
