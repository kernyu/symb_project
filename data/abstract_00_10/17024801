The authors report and discuss a patient admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction caused by face and neck soft tissue infection. An oxacillin-resistant Staphyloccoccus aureus was isolated from necrotic skin lesions and from skin biopsy. The strain was susceptible in vitro to teicoplanin, but it showed resistance in vivo, despite appropriate dosage. After 6 days of full dose therapy, since the clinical course worsened, teicoplanin was interrupted and linezolid was started. In 48 hours signs of infection regressed, and the patient was discharged from the ICU after 10 days of linezolid treatment. Linezolid resulted as a rescue drug for a life-threatening infection.
