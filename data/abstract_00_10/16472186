Over 300 million cases of malaria each year cause significant morbidity and mortality. Growing drug-resistance among the Plasmodia that cause malaria motivates the development of additional anti-malarial drugs. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about potential drug targets for malaria. The recently sequenced malaria genome data clarifies parasite metabolic pathways, and more metabolic targets have been identified.
