Clostridium butyrium CB2 isolated from chickens was tested as a potential fish probiotic in the Chinese drum, Miichthys miiuy. Fish were fed live (CB), dead CB2 (D-CB) cells (10(8) cells g(-1)) or spent culture supernatant (SCS), for 30 days and challenged with Vibrio anguillarum or Aeromonas hydrophila. Survival was higher in both the CB and the CB-D fed groups, but the SCS group was not significantly different from the control. After feeding live or dead CB2 cells, there was increase in phagocytic activity of the head kidney macrophages, the lysozyme activity of serum and gut mucosa and immunoglobulin (Ig) level. The SCS group showed no obvious change in immune parameters. The results suggest that live or dead Clostridium butyrium CB2 has an immunomodulatory effect on fish.
