OBJECTIVE: Seven-day administration of omeprazole 40 mg/day + amoxicillin 1500 mg/day + clarithromycin 800 mg/day is currently approved in Japan for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. We investigated the efficacy and safety of an omeprazole-based triple therapy regimen in combination with amoxicillin and low-dose clarithromycin in Japanese patients. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to either the low-dose group (omeprazole 40 mg/day + amoxicillin 1500 mg/day + clarithromycin 400 mg/day) or the high-dose group (omeprazole 40 mg/day + amoxicillin 1500 mg/day + clarithromycin 800 mg/day). A total of 288 patients were allocated to the low-dose (143) and high-dose (145) groups and were treated twice daily for 1 week. RESULTS: For the full-analysis set, H. pylori eradication rates were 81.1% (116/143 patients, 90% confidence interval [CI] 74.9, 86.3) in the low-dose group and 80.0% (116/145 patients, 90% CI 73.7, 85.3) in the high-dose group. Per-protocol eradication rates were 81.7% (103/126 patients, 90% CI 75.1, 87.2) and 84.1% (90/107 patients, 90% CI 77.1, 89.6), respectively. When patients with non-susceptibility to clarithromycin were excluded, eradication rates were >80% for both gastric and duodenal ulcers in the two groups. The results suggested that eradication rates were affected more by susceptibility to clarithromycin than to amoxicillin. Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that an omeprazole-based triple-therapy regimen with clarithromycin 400 mg/day was as effective as that with clarithromycin 800 mg/day for H. pylori eradication.
