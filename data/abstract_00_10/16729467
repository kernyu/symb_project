The identification of thermotolerant campylobacters in official food control in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has been traditionally performed using the cultural procedure as described in the ISO-Norm 10272:1995. Analysis thus took 5-6 days to complete. Additionally diagnostic problems caused by the accompanying flora as well as the resistance to nalidixic acid occured. Within the scope of this study these problems could be solved by introducing a filtration step for the reduction of the accompanying flora and by performing the indoxyl acetate-hydrolysis-test in addition to the antibiotic-resistance-test. Besides various PCR protocols for the identification of thermotolerant campylobacters from food were established as an alternative to the cultural procedure, providing reliable results within two days. Furthermore, infrared spectroscopy was tested for the identification of Campylobacter isolates. Using this technique and with the help of a suitable data base, bacterial pure cultures can be differentiated within 2 hours. Among others 356 samples of raw poultry meat were tested with the newly established procedures as well as with the classical cultural method, showing that 32% of the samples were Campylobacter spp. positive. 37% of these isolates were resistant against nalidixic acid. This indicates that the development of resistances in Campylobacter spp. in Germany follows the same trend described for other European countries.
