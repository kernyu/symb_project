Infections by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) have become a major threat for patients hospitalized in intensive care units, representing a prevalent cause of morbimortality in the critically ill, since these microorganisms have developed resistance to most available antimicrobial agents. In this respect, very few therapeutic innovations have been developed in recent years, and it is not foreseen that any new drugs will be commercialized in the near future. Tigecycline represents an effective alternative in this setting, but lacks activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and its use has not been validated for all organ-specific infections. Frequently, only old antibiotics like colistin remain a valid option. New pharmaceutical formulations and dosage regimens of polymyxins have considerably reduced the toxicity previously attributed to these antimicrobials, and have made it possible to reintroduce them into clinical practice. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of polymyxins is still suboptimal, and the expansion of heteroresistance and pan-drug-resistant strains of gram-negative bacilli is of concern. Improvements in dosing, alternative methods of administration and different synergic antimicrobial combinations have been proposed in recent literature, among other measures, to enhance the effectiveness of polymyxins. The latest data regarding polymyxins and their clinical use are discussed in this review.
