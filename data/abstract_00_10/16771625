This decade will see the emergence of the electronic medical record, electronic prescribing and computerized decision support in the hospital setting. Current opinion from key infectious diseases bodies supports the use of computerized decision support systems as potentially useful tools in antibiotic stewardship programs.

This review describes computerized decision support systems used to assist with antibiotic prescribing, the evidence for their effectiveness and the current and future roles.
