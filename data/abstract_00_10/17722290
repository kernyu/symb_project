Mapping modeling of the distribution of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis was made in different regions of the Kyrghyz Republic. The results of determination of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) by the biochip test were used to examine 904 MBT DNA samples taken when examining the patients living in different regions of the Kyrghyz Republic: Bishkek (n = 323), the Chui (n = 185), Issyk-Kul (n = 68), Naryn (n = 75), Talas (n = 47), Osh (n = 65), Dzhalal-Abad (n = 90), and Batken (n = 51) Regions. Comparison of the distribution of drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis by different regions revealed that rifampicin-resistant MBT strains were more frequently encountered in the densely populated regions of the republic - Bishkek and the Chui Region. Rifampicin resistance in MBT was caused by mutations in codons 531, 526, 522, 516, 511, 513, 512, and 513 of the rpoB gene. At the same time, there was a predominant selection of MBT with mutations in codons 531, 526, 516, and 511 in the republic. The spectrum of mutant MBT strains occurring in some regions varied. The broadest spectrum of genetic variability was observed in Bishkek and the Chui Region. Thus, Bishkek and the Chui Region are the hot points of concentration of mutant rifampicin-resistant MBT strains.
