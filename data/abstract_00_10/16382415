PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The authors analysed the incidence of S. aureus strains and their resistance to antibiotics in in-patients in order to obtain information for the management of an antibiotic policy, as well as for an emprical treatment of staphylococcal infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors determined the sensitivity of S. aureus strains to antibiotics. Data on patients, biological material, bacterial strains and their sensitivity to antibiotics were processed by the programme WHONET 5.3. RESULTS: During the period of the study no substantial changes were seen in the proportion of S. aureus resistance to most investigated antibiotics. The chosen denominator-the number of complete hospital stays-helped to establish the list of wards at risk on the basis of patient colonization and the onset of infections. The authors investigated the incidence of S. aureus strains in the different wards. CONCLUSIONS: When processing an analysis of the incidence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics the use of an appropriate denominator represents the solution of the problem-because of the small set of investigated strains the proportion of resistance cannot be computed.
