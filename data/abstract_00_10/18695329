Gram positive organisms are one of the leading pathogens causing skin and soft tissue infections. For these infections, clindamycin is a useful alternate drug in penicillin-allergic patients. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of erythromycin-induced clindamycin resistance in gram positive organisms in the southern part of the country. A total of 522 consecutive clinical isolates from blood, CSF, sputum, throat, pus, and urine were collected between November 2006 and April 2007 and tested for erythromycin resistance and inducible clindamycin resistance. There was a relatively higher incidence of inducible clindamycin resistance among the MRSA isolates. We conclude, therefore, that clindamycin is not a suitable alternative antibiotic for use in staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections.
