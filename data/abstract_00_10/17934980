Carbapenem non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains were tested for the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) by EDTA-synergy screening. Imipenem hydrolysis was investigated by a bioassay and IMP-/VIM-encoding genes by PCR. No bla(IMP/VIM) related genes or imipenemase activity were detected although E-test found all strains as MBL-positive. Disk synergy tests with 0.5 M EDTA determined 63.6-100%, while those with 0.1 M EDTA detected 0-7.7% of isolates as MBL producers. Most strains were susceptible to EDTA. In conclusion, for MBL-screening purposes, EDTA-synergy results change with molarity of EDTA, but even if some false positives are encountered, 0.1 M EDTA seems to be acceptable.
