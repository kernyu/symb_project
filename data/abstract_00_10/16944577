Susceptibility of explants to antibiotics and the transient expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene were studied to determine the optimal conditions for gene transformation of Jatropha curcas mediated by Agrobacterium Tumefaciens. The results showed that Jatropha curcas was insensitive to the antibiotic cefotaxime, which is used for suppressing the growth of Agrobacterium after cocultivation, while the plant was sensitive to kanamycin, hygromycin, phoshpinothrincin. All the three selective reagents synchronously suppressed the induction and the growth of callus, shoot organogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The types of explants and the physiological state of the explants had strong influence on the transient expression efficiency of GUS. Hypocotyl, cotyledon petiole and cotyledon from 14-day-old seedling were more susceptible to Agrobacterium infection. Hygromycin-resistance calli from cotyledon explants were obtained and showed GUS staining.
