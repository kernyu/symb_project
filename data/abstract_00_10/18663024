The susceptibilities of 12 antimicrobial agents for two collections of Staphylococcus aureus, isolated in the 1970s and in 2006 from poultry, were determined. For eight antibiotics, the percentage of resistance was significantly higher in the recent isolates. Ten recent isolates were methicillin resistant and had spa types t011 and t567, belonging to multilocus sequence type 398. This is the first report of "livestock-associated" methicillin resistant S. aureus from healthy poultry.
