Doripenem is a new member of the carbapenem family. Its spectrum is a little wider than meropenem and it is active on some Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to other carbapenems and on Burkholderia cepacia. Doripenem was evaluated in nosocomial pneumonia including ventilator-acquired pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infection, and complicated urinary tract infection. In nosocomial pneumonia, doripenem showed an interesting activity in P. aeruginosa infected patients. This data, along with the global increase in multiresistance, may be an opportunity to optimize our therapeutic options with a new molecule.
