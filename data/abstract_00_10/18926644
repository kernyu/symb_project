The aim of the study was to show the emergence of the qnr genes in extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing enterobacteria in Abidjan between 2005 and 2006. The whole of 151 strains of extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing enterobacteria were studied: 64 Escherichia coli, 66 Klebsiella pneumoniae, seven Klebsiella oxytoca and 14 Enterobacter spp. isolated from various biological products and from in- and out-patients. The techniques of disks diffusion, double-disk synergy, E-test were respectively used for the antimicrobial susceptibility test, the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases and the minimal inhibiting concentration. The bla genes(SHV, TEM, CTXM groups 1, 2, 8, 9), and AmpC were determined by PCR and characterized by sequencing. A global prevalence of 27,2 % (41/151) and rates of 9,9, 14,6, 2,7 % for the qnr genes A, B, A and S were observed. The distribution was 42,9 % for Enterobacter spp, 31,2 % for Escherichia coli, 20,5 % for Klebsiella; 30 strains expressed at least two bla genes; four strains were associated with AmpC. The strains were resistant to the cotrimoxazole (97,6 %), to the cefepime (73,2 %), to the cefoxitine (56,1 %), to the imipeneme (0 %) and 43,9 % to all the aminosides. This high qnr gene prevalence associated with several types of bla genes in epidemic matter, the high level of resistance to antibiotics make fear a high risk of the transmission of multi-resistants bacteria and challenge the authorities for a resistance monitoring policy.
