The increase since the mid 1980s in glycopeptide resistant enterococci (GRE) raised concerns about the limited options for antimicrobial therapy, the implications for ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised hospitalised patients, and fuelled fears, now realised, for the transfer of glycopeptide resistance to more pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. These issues underlined the need for guidelines for the emergence and control of GRE in the hospital setting. This Hospital Infection Society (HIS) and Infection Control Nurses Association (ICNA) working party report reviews the literature relating to GRE prevention and control. It provides guidance on microbiological investigation, treatment and management, including antimicrobial prescribing and infection control measures. Evidence identified to support recommendations has been categorized. A risk assessment approach is recommended and areas for research and development identified.
