Hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is common in cancer, and PI3K and mTOR act synergistically in promoting tumor growth, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, combined targeting of PI3K and mTOR presents an opportunity for robust and synergistic anticancer efficacy. 17-Hydroxywortmannin (2a) analogues conjugated to rapamycin (3a) analogues via a prodrug linker are uniquely positioned for this approach. Our efforts led to the discovery of diester-linked conjugates that, upon in vivo hydrolysis, released two highly potent inhibitors. Conjugate 7c provided enhanced solubility relative to 3a and to an equivalent mixture of 3a and 9a and demonstrated profound activity in U87MG mouse xenografts, achieving an MED of 1.5 mg/kg, following weekly intravenous dosing. At 15 mg/kg, 7c completely inhibited the growth of HT29 tumors, whereas an equivalent mixture of the inhibitors was poorly tolerated. In the A498 renal tumor model, 7c exhibited superior efficacy over 3a or 9a when administered as a single agent or in combination with bevacizumab. Thus, we have uncovered a novel approach to target both PI3K and mTOR via hybrid inhibitors, leading to a broader and more robust anticancer efficacy.
