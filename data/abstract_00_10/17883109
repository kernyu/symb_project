The emergence and spread of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing strains have led to questions regarding optimal therapy for infections especially empirical treatment of suspected gram negative infection. A total of400 isolates belonging to family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from various clinical samples and were studied for ESBL production by NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) confirmatory test (using disc diffusion technique) and MIC brott dilution test. ESBL production was found in 61.72% of hospital isolates and 30.90% of outdoor isolates. The susceptibility of ESBL producers to imipenem and amikacin was found to be 100% and 63.38% respectively. A high degree of associated resistance to other antimicrobial was found in ESBL producers. Tests for detection of ESBLs and continuous monitoring of antimicrobial sensitivity pattern in individual setting is emphasized to minimise the emergence of drug resistant bacteria.
