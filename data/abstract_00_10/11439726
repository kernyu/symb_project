Tuberculosis is endemic, with nearly 2 billion carriers worldwide. Aviation medical examiners should be alert to both its pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations, especially in the international traveler. Uveitis is a rare presentation of tuberculosis, but that diagnosis must be considered in the differential, even in the absence of pulmonary disease. Promptly treated, tuberculosis should not interfere with the resumption of a career in aviation, and does not generally require special follow up.
