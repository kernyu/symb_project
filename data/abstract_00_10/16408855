Considerable variation in counts of antibiotic-resistant enterobacteria in the ovine gastrointestinal tract was observed. The occurrence of ruminal and fecal isolates resistant to ampicillin (Ap), kanamycin (Km) and tetracycline (Tc) culminated in summer months, followed by rapid decline in subsequent months. Using PCR the tem1bla (Apr), aphA1 (Kmr) and tetB (Tcr) genes were found to be predominant. Under in vitro conditions all resistance genes were transferable into laboratory Escherichia coli strain with relatively high frequency (10(-3) transconjugants per recipient).
