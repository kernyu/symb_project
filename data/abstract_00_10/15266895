The majority of the population is infected by several herpesviruses. Once these infections are established the viruses persist for life. Therefore, current therapy may at best reduce symptoms but does not cure the infection. Moreover, the only classes of compounds licensed for systemic treatment of disease are nucleoside, nucleotide and pyrophosphate analogues; all of these ultimately target the herpesvirus DNA polymerase. A vaccine against varicella zoster virus (VZV) is available, but so far no effective vaccines against other human herpesviruses have been launched. At the same time, rising resistance to current medication, especially in the immunocompromised patient population, is a concern. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for new treatment options. Recently, some promising new drugs have been discovered; one of these compounds, developed at Bayer HealthCare under the name BAY 57-1293, is a potent HSV helicase primase inhibitor.
