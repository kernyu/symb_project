In the last decade in Chile, there was a large reduction in the rate of communicable diseases, especially typhoid fever, and those preventable through the universal vaccination programs. Exceptions were hepatitis A and Pertussis. The reduction in tuberculosis, has lead the country to a threshold in which the elimination of tuberculosis as a public health problem is reachable. The HIV epidemic is still expanding, at higher rate among women and heterosexual men, keeping drug addiction as a low ranked risk factor. At the end of the century, universal or expanded access to HIV therapy was still not a reality. Cholera was a well controlled emerging infection, but Hantavirus infection has become a major threat in many regions. Syphilis and especially gonorrhea have decreased, but condyloma has increased dramatically. The nosocomial infection scenario has changed somehow, due to more severely ice and complex patients admitted to hospitals. Multiresistant nosocomial pathogens continue expanding (S aureus, fermentor and non fermentor gram negative rods, especially A baumannii). The country has been able to expand control programs to almost all hospitals. Antimicrobial resistance has continued growing. The massive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics, largely responsible for the resistance, grew worse until the sale of antimicrobials in pharmacies was restricted by law. This had a major impact, with important reduction in sales of most, but not all, antibiotics. The impact in resistance rate of this reduction, if any, has yet to be assessed.
