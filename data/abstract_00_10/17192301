Cells cured of persistent virus infection can be used to investigate cellular pathways of resistance to viral cytopathic effects. Persistent poliovirus (PV) infections were established in human intestinal Caco-2 cells, and spontaneously cured cell cultures were obtained. Two cell clones, cl6 and b13, cured of type 3 PV mutant infection and their parental Caco-2 cells were compared for susceptibility to PV infection, PV receptor CD155 expression, capacity to differentiate into polarized enterocytes, and PV-, staurosporine-, and actinomycin D-induced apoptosis. Our results strongly suggest that cells that are partially resistant to apoptosis can be selected during persistent virus infection.
