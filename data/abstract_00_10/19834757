Candida krusei is an uncommon cause of vaginitis and cystitis but is unique because of the management challenge it poses due to intrinsic resistance to fluconazole and flucytosine. We report a case of C. krusei vaginitis and cystitis successfully managed with topical vaginal and intravesical amphotericin B. The challenges in managing C. krusei cystitis and the role of amphotericin B bladder irrigation in the management of fungal urinary tract infections are discussed.
