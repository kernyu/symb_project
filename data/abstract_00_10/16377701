The adaptive and further evolutionary responses of Staphylococcus aureus to selection pressure with the antibiotic rifampin have not been explored in detail. We now present a detailed analysis of these systems. The use of rifampin for the chemotherapy of infections caused by S. aureus has resulted in the selection of mutants with alterations within the beta subunit of the target enzyme, RNA polymerase. Using a new collection of strains, we have identified numerous novel mutations in the beta subunits of both clinical and in vitro-derived resistant strains and established that additional, undefined mechanisms contribute to expression of rifampin resistance in clinical isolates of S. aureus. The fitness costs associated with rifampin resistance genotypes were found to have a significant influence on their clinical prevalence, with the most common clinical genotype (H481N, S529L) exhibiting no fitness cost in vitro. Intragenic mutations which compensate for the fitness costs associated with rifampin resistance in clinical strains of S. aureus were identified for the first time. Structural explanations for rifampin resistance and the loss of fitness were obtained by molecular modeling of mutated RNA polymerase enzymes.
