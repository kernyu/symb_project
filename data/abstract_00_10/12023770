Polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing of the Toxoplasma gondii dihydropteroate synthase gene (dhps) identified 4 alleles among parasite populations from 32 cases of human toxoplasmosis. Heterologous expression and enzyme assay reveal that 3 of these alleles encode sulfadiazine (Sdz)-sensitive enzymes. The fourth, generating a highly Sdz-resistant enzyme, differs from 1 of the other 3 at only a single residue (407) of DHPS. Of interest, a fifth allele, found in a laboratory-induced Sdz-resistant line, also differs from another of these 3 drug-sensitive forms by the same single mutation that affects residue 407 of DHPS. Significantly, residues corresponding to DHPS-407 are implicated in sulfonamide resistance in other microorganisms. The human-derived allelic form encoding the Sdz-resistant enzyme was found in T. gondii associated with a fatal infection, and its presence within clinical material may have implications for sulfonamide use, particularly in cases of toxoplasmosis in which the initial response to drug treatment is poor.
