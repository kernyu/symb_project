Rational use of antimicrobials is a key element for a successful strategy against development of resistance to antimicrobials. The physician should establish the need and the reason for therapy, select the appropriate antimicrobial agent, and then decide on the optimum dose and dosing interval, duration, as well as route of administration. In a particular hospital, the present status of antimicrobial use should be determined, and a strategy should be developed to improve it. This usually encompasses a combination of educative, facilitative and restrictive measures. Good infection control practice is a critical component for success of such a programme.
