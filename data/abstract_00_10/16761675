We analysed the record of blood cultures carried out at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi between 1996 and 2003. We isolated 477 Salmonella typhi and 410 S. paratyphi A from blood of patients suffering from typhoid fever. We observed a significant shift in the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of typhoid salmonellae. The isolation rate of S. typhi fell significantly while S. paratyphi A is emerging as a major pathogen. Resistance to conventional antityphoid drugs in S. typhi decreased dramatically from 80% to 14%, while in S. paratyphi A resistance increased from 14% to 44%. Susceptibility to the fluoroquinolones decreased in both. No resistance to third generation cephalosporins was detected.
