BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Multidrug resistant (MDR) cells can resist drug-induced apoptosis, which is the functional mechanism for many chemotherapeutic drugs. It is necessary to search for the molecular mechanism underlying anti-apoptosis of MDR cells. However, because of the anti-apoptosis characteristic of MDR cells, it is hard to study the mechanism on their apoptosis pathway. This study was to induce apoptosis in human acute leukemia cell line HL-60, and its MDR cell lines HR20 and HT9 by cyclosporin A (CsA), analyze the differences in apoptosis pathway between MDR cells and sensitive cells by detecting several important apoptosis-related molecules. METHODS: HL-60, HR20, and HT9 cells were treated with 10, and 20 mg/L of CsA, cell apoptosis was identified by cell morphologic changes,electrophoresis,and flow cytometry. Changes of apoptosis-related factors were detected by spectrophotometer and Western blot. RESULTS: HL-60, HR20, and HT9 cells all showed obvious apoptotic characteristics after treated with CsA,such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) degradation and activation, and DNA fragmentation. However, Caspase-3 activation was only detected in apoptotic HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: CsA may induce apoptosis of HR20, and HT9 cells in a Caspase-3 independent manner, which is different from apoptosis of sensitive cells. In the apoptosis pathway of HR20, and HT9 cells, there may be some factors other than Caspase-3 that can activate DFF. It is postulated that the difficulty of Caspase-3 to be activated may be an important reason for HR20 and HT9 cells to resist apoptosis induced by many chemotherapeutic drugs.
