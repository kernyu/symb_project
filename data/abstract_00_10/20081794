Results of quantitative and qualitative assessment of mucosal microbiocenoses in the upper respiratory tracts are presented along with cytomorphological characteristics of upper airway mucosa. SIgA and lysozyme concentrations were measured in the saliva of firemen. Their exposure to occupational hazards during periods of professional activity was shown to lead to a decrease in non-specific anti-infectious resistance to the effect of unfavourable factors.
