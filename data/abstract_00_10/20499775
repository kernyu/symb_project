Traditionally, pneumonia developing in patients who receive health care services in the outpatient environment, such as nursing homes, long-term care facilities, and dialysis centers, has been classified and treated as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Recent studies, however, have shown that this type of infection, known as health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is distinct from CAP in terms of its epidemiology and etiology, and increases the risk for infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. A review of available clinical data about HCAP was conducted to determine effective empiric treatment strategies and improve clinical outcomes. Analysis of multi-institutional clinical data showed that mortality associated with HCAP is higher than with CAP, suggesting that patients with HCAP may have been treated as hospitalized patients with CAP and received inappropriate initial empiric antibiotic treatment. All patients presenting to the hospital with suspected HCAP or CAP should be evaluated for their underlying risk of infection with MDR pathogens. Because HCAP may be similar to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) both clinically and etiologically, it should be treated as HAP until culture data become available. A greater recognition of HCAP as a new class of pneumonia with a distinct epidemiologic, microbiologic, and clinical profile should lead physicians to initiate appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy more often, thereby improving the likelihood for optimal clinical outcomes and patient care.
