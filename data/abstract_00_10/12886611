Clinical and laboratory evaluation of the preparation Acipol in 45 children greatly susceptible to acute respiratory virus infections (ARVI) was carried out. Simultaneously with the clinical analysis, the study of the microflora of the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tracts and intestine, as well as the levels of secretory IgA in saliva and coprofiltrates before and after treatment, was made. The inclusion of Acipol into the therapy of ARVI patients facilitated their clinical convalescence, uncomplicated course of the disease, correction of disturbances in the biocenosis of the upper respiratory tracts and increased infectious resistance.
