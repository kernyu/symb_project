Candida dubliniensis is rare and very similar to C. albicans. To date, detailed clinical reports on C. dubuliniensis recovered from an immunocompromised patient have not been described in Japan. A 71-year-old man with end-stage liver cirrhosis had been treated for suppurative omarthritis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Anti-MRSA agents and broad-spectrum antimicrobials but no antifungal agents had been administrated. C. dubliniensis, isolated from the sputum, was eliminated by selective digestive decontamination and supportive therapy. This case emphasizes the need to recognize this emerging Candida sp., C. dubliniensis in cases of opportunistic infection.
