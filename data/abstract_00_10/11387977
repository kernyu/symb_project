Plant disease resistance (R) genes are introduced into high yielding crop varieties to improve resistance to agronomically important pathogens. The R gene-encoded proteins are recognitionally specific, interacting directly or indirectly with corresponding pathogen avirulence (avr) determinants, and are therefore under strong diversifying selection pressure to evolve new recognition capabilities. Genetic analyses in different plant species have also revealed more broadly recruited resistance signalling genes that provide further targets for manipulation in crop improvement strategies. Understanding the processes that regulate both plant-pathogen recognition and the induction of appropriate defences should provide fresh perspectives in combating plant disease. Many recent studies have utilized the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, mutational screens have identified genes that are required for R gene function and for restriction of pathogen growth in compatible plant-pathogen interactions. Genetic analyses of these plant mutants suggest that whilst signalling pathways are conditioned by particular R protein structural types they are also influenced by pathogen lifestyle. Two Arabidopsis defence signalling genes, EDS1 and PAD4, are required for the accumulation of salicylic acid, a phenolic molecule required for systemic immunity. The cloning, molecular and biochemical characterization of these components suggests processes that may be important in their disease resistance signalling roles.
