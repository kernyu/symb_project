Defense against toxic endo- and xenobiotics is a major concern of all living species and ABC transporters play a vital role in this defense system. Multidrug resistance associated proteins 1 (MRP1) is a cellular detoxifying factor supposed to transport a wide range of compounds across cell membranes either as GSH conjugates or as co-transport accompanying glutathione transposition. The cellular localization of MRP1 is a determining factor whether the transport function can take place. In this study we have undertaken experiments on the transport activity of MRP1 in cultured human lung tumor cells in order to check whether MRP1 is expressed as a functionally active protein. For this purpose we have adapted a quantitative fluorescence imaging assay to conditions where a small number of attached cells should be repeatedly measured by a non-destructive method. In cultured A549, H358 and H322 cells MRP1 is located in the cell membrane as observed by immunocytochemistry. Efflux of 5,6-carboxy-2'-7'-dichloro-fluorescein (CDF) from lung cells was sensitive toward the MRP1 inhibitor MK571 while verapamil had no effect. On the other hand, efflux of Rhodamin 123, a Pgp-glycoprotein substrate, from lung cells reacted to inhibition by verapamil, while MK571 had no effect. Modulation of glutathion content of lung cells by N-acetyl cystein and buthionine sulfoximine shifted CDF efflux toward higher or lower rates, respectively. These experiments confirm that MRP1 function can be followed in the attached cells in vitro under non-toxic concentrations of the substrates without the need to harvest and destroy the cells.
