PURPOSE: To determine the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of conjunctival flora in patients undergoing intravitreal (IVT) injection. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n = 85) scheduled to undergo 136 IVT injections at California Vitreoretinal Center at Stanford University. METHODS: Conjunctival cultures were obtained on the day of the IVT injection from the injection site bulbar conjunctiva before the application of povidone-iodine or antibiotics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacterial isolates were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibility using either the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion technique or MicroScan-WalkAway system. RESULTS: Our analysis included 136 samples collected from 90 eyes of 85 patients. Of those with positive cultures (n = 65), the most common bacterial isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), comprising 59 (83%) of the 71 bacterial strains. Among the CNS, all were susceptible to vancomycin and >80% were susceptible to gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and imipenem. Between 60% and 80% of the CNS were susceptible to the cephalosporins and newer generation fluoroquinolones. Fewer than 60% were susceptible to the penicillin analogs, erythromycin, and the earlier generation fluoroquinolones. Nearly half of the CNS (47%) were resistant to oxacillin/methicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria isolated from the injection site of patients undergoing IVT injections were mostly CNS. Most are sensitive to vancomycin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol.
