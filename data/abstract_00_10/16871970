Sanfetrinem is the first member of tricyclic beta-lactams (trinems) which can be administered orally as a hexatil ester. His chemical structure is related to carbapenems. High stability to many beta-lactamases and human renal dehydropeptydase were described. The investigation was performed on 43 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing ESBL isolated from hospitalized patients. The MICs of sanfetrinem and imipenem were determined by E-test. Additionaly, susceptibility to antibiotics was tested by disc diffusion method. Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 were used as a control strains. MIC50 and MIC90 of sanfetrinem and imipenem amounted respectively 0,38/3 mg/1 and 0,19/0,25 mg/l. Range of MIC value was from 0,064 mg/l to 4 mg/l for sanfetrinem, and from 0,094 mg/l to 0,38 mg/l for imipenem. Additionaly, geometric and aritmetic means were calculated to both antibiotics. All results of study were compared using correlation factor and "Student" t-test. None of these 43 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains was resistant to imipenem and cefepime. Majority of isolates demonstrated susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and cefoxitin--90,7% and 74,4% respectively All strains were resistant to gentamicin, amikacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
