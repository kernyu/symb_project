The Vitek 2 yeast susceptibility test was evaluated by testing 122 Candida isolates against fluconazole and voriconazole. Excellent categorical agreement with the CLSI broth microdilution method was observed (97.5% for both the azoles). Moreover, the Vitek 2 system was able to identify all but 2 of 59 investigated fluconazole-resistant organisms.
