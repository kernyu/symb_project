In this study, the 7H10 agar proportion method was compared with the BACTEC TB-460 and BACTEC MGIT 960 systems (BD Biosciences, USA) for the susceptibility testing of 22 genetically characterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates for isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol. The 7H10 agar proportion method agreed with the resistant genotype in 87.3%, BACTEC TB-460 in 92.7%, and the MGIT in 96.4% of the cases, showing the high sensitivity of MGIT in the detection of resistant isolates.
