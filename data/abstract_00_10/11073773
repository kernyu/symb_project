We describe the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus isolates with glycopeptide heteroresistant subpopulation from 15 patients (11 with colonizations and 4 with infections) in a French hospital. Non of the patients were previously treated with glycopeptides. The 15 isolates belonged to 2 different pulsotypes unrelated to other methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates from the same hospital.
