AIM: Most patients treated for H. pylori infection receive empirical therapy based on epidemiological data of antibiotic resistance. However, previous European studies indicate that resistance patterns may be changing. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of primary clarithromycin and/or metronidazole resistant H. pylori strains over a six-year period (1997-2002) in a regional hospital. METHODS: All patients visiting Slingeland Hospital in Doetinchem, the Netherlands between 1997 and 2002 with a positive H. pylori culture were included in this study. Susceptibility to metronidazole and clarithromycin was determined by disk diffusion. RESULTS: Of the 1355 patients with an H. pylori positive culture, 1127 did not have a history of H. pylori eradication, 58 did, and for 170 this information was not available. Mean rates of primary resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin were 14.4% (162/1125) and 1.0% (11/1123), respectively. Primary metronidazole resistance was stable throughout the study period and primary clarithromycin resistance showed a decreasing trend. Patients of foreign descent and from secondary care had a higher chance of harbouring primary metronidazole-resistant H. pylori (adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.75 (1.1 to 2.8), and 1.60 (1.1 to 2.2), respectively). Patients with failed H. pylori eradication had a higher chance of harbouring metronidazole-resistant H. pylori (43 vs 14%, p<0.0001) and clarithromycin-resistantH. pylori (5.3 vs 1.0%, p=0.004) than untreated patients. CONCLUSION: Primary metronidazole resistance is stableat a low level, while primary clarithromycin resistance isvirtually absent in the eastern part of the Netherlands.Therefore, triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor,clarithromycin and amoxicillin can remain the empiricaltreatment of choice in the Netherlands.
