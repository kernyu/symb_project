A longitudinal pharmacoepidemiological study on prescribing patterns of antimalarials was conducted in Gezira State, Sudan. Different core drug prescribing indicators were identified, measured and correlated. Chloroquine and quinine were the most frequently prescribed antimalaria drugs but in 44.7% of cases, the dosage was inappropriate and did not conform to standard regimens. Due to variable and unmonitored patterns of drug resistance, most medical practitioners in Sudan tend to follow their own protocols to treat severe cases of malaria rather than conforming to standard regimens. We attribute the emergence of a high rate of resistance to malaria chemotherapy to such practices. We recommend interventions to ensure rational prescribing, and call for the formulation of a national antimalarial drugs policy.
