We describe the changing epidemiology of drug resistant malaria in Thailand over the past decade. Factors determining the characteristic patterns of the development and spread of resistance to anti-malarial drugs on the Thai-Cambodian border and the Thai-Myanmar border are explored, namely, population dynamics, drug usage and malaria control measures. The introduction of artesunate-mefloquine combination in selected areas along the two borders in 1995 is believed to be one of the multiple factors responsible for stabilizing the multidrug resistance problems in Thailand today. Other control measures and inter-governmental co-operation must continue to be strengthened in order to limit the spread of drug resistance malaria in the Southeast Asian region.
