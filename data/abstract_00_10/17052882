The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection program is a global study providing in vitro surveillance data on antimicrobial susceptibility in centers prescribing meropenem. This study summarizes data on the activity of meropenem and 5 comparators against 4022 clinical isolates from 7 centers in Spain (1999-2003). Those bacteria intrinsically resistant to meropenem were excluded. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 100% of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., and Serratia spp. were susceptible to meropenem. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae susceptibilities to carbapenems were 100% and > or =98%, respectively. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae were 3.8% of isolates, and all of them were susceptible to meropenem. Ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli was around 20%. Meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Acinetobacter baumannii were 61-90% susceptible to carbapenems, but only 6-21% susceptible to ciprofloxacin. In this period, around 100% of oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were susceptible to meropenem. There was no significant decrease in susceptibility to the carbapenems throughout the 5-year period. The clinical use of meropenem in 7 Spanish centers did not increase bacterial resistance to this agent in the microorganisms evaluated.
