Three clinical strains (Escherichia coli Rio-6, E. coli Rio-7, and Enterobacter cloacae Rio-9) collected in 1996 and 1999 from hospitals in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) were resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and gave a positive double-disk synergy test. Two bla(CTX-M) genes encoding beta-lactamases of pl 7.9 and 8.2 were implicated in this resistance: the bla(CTX-M-9) gene observed in E. coli Rio-7 and E. cloacae Rio-9 and a novel CTX-M-encoding gene, designated bla(CTX-M-16), observed in E. coli strain Rio-6. The deduced amino acid sequence of CTX-M-16 differed from CTX-M-9 only by the substitution Asp-240-->Gly. The CTX-M-16-producing E. coli transformant exhibited the same level of resistance to cefotaxime (MIC, 16 microg/ml) but had a higher MIC of ceftazidime (MIC, 8 versus 1 microg/ml) than the CTX-M-9-producing transformant. Enzymatic studies revealed that CTX-M-16 had a 13-fold higher affinity for aztreonam and a 7.5-fold higher k(cat) for ceftazidime than CTX-M-9, thereby showing that the residue in position 240 can modulate the enzymatic properties of CTX-M enzymes. The two bla(CTX-M-9) genes and the bla(CTX-M-16) gene were located on different plasmids, suggesting the presence of mobile elements associated with CTX-M-encoding genes. CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-8 enzymes were found in Brazil in 1996, and two other CTX-M beta-lactamases, CTX-M-9 and CTX-M-16, were subsequently observed. These reports are evidence of the diversity of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Brazil.
