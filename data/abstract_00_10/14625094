In this study we evaluated the performance of the VERSANT HIV-1 Resistance Assays (LiPA) in detecting drug resistance in therapy-naive HIV-infected patients diagnosed in Belgium in 2000. We compared the results with population sequencing and found concordance to be in line with previous studies in treatment-experienced patients (86.87% for reverse transcriptase (RT); 92.77% for protease (PRO)). Discordance was mainly due to indeterminate reactions on LiPA (8.45% for RT; 6.85% for PRO) and minor discordances (4.13% for RT; 0.25% for PRO). Major discordances were rare (0.46% for RT; 0.12% for PRO). Indeterminate reactions were significantly associated with strains belonging to non-B subtypes.
