AIM: To evaluate the diversity of Vibrio anguillarum isolates from vibriosis-infected Penaeus monodon collected from east coast of India. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-six V. anguillarum were cultured from specific V. anguillarum medium, further identified using biochemical tests and confirmed by PCR detection of rpoN gene. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed that in each location, the selected V. anguillarum isolates produced a unique band pattern, indicating that the members of this species are genetically heterogeneous. Antibiotic sensitivity results showed that 85%, 72%, 70%, 58%, 45% and 34% of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin, furazolidone, chloramphenicol, oxolinic acid, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin, respectively. Plasmids were found in 70% of the isolates, and nine different plasmid profiles were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Wide ranges of diversity were noted in V. anguillarum isolates collected from P. monodon at different locations of east coast of India. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Molecular typing, antibiotic resistance and plasmid profiles of V. anguillarum isolates from shrimp in India enables the prediction of possible risk for diseases in shrimp culture environment and the application of alternative management plans to prevent further spread of antibiotic resistance.
