Since social and economic changes in Latvia in 1991 the incidence of salmonellosis dramatically increased: more than 500 pediatric cases are registered every year. Specification of the properties of the Salmonella strains isolated in Latvia was undertaken. The study demonstrated that acute salmonellosis in pediatric inpatients was mainly due to S.typhimurium (78 per cent) and only in 22 per cent of the patients it was due to S.enteritidis. All the S.typhimurium isolates showed high antibiotic resistance defined by specific extended spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-M-5).
