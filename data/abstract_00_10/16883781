Rifalazil is a potent second-generation ansamycin that kills bacterial cells by inhibiting the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. Rifalazil has several improved properties compared with rifampicin, but retains rifampicin's propensity to develop resistant mutants at high frequency. To explore strategies to overcome resistance development, we studied the effects of rifalazil in combination with several different antibiotics in an in vitro time-kill model, against both log phase and stationary phase Staphylococcus aureus cells. Experiments were carried out at high initial cell density so that the frequency and proliferation of resistant mutants could be monitored. We found that each combination was advantageous in terms of enhanced killing and the suppression of mutants, compared with each drug used alone. None of the three combinations was effective against stationary phase cells.
