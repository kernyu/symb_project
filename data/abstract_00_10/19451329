Injection drug users bear the burden of HIV in Vietnam and are a focus of national treatment programmes. To date, determinants of successful therapy in this population are unknown. Substance use and clinical correlates of viral suppression were studied in 100 HIV-1-infected drug users receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least six months in Hanoi, Vietnam. The mean age of the cohort was 29.9 + 4.9 years; all were men. A majority of patients (73%) achieved viral suppression (HIV-RNA <1000 copies/mL). Correlates of viral suppression include self-reported > or = 95% adherence (P < 0.01) and current use of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (P < 0.01); current or ever diagnosed with tuberculosis was associated with viral non-suppression (P = 0.006). Tobacco use was prevalent (84%), and surprisingly 48% of patients reported active drug use; neither was associated with viral non-suppression. This is the first study to document successful ART treatment in a population of Vietnamese drug users; rates of viral suppression are comparable to other international populations. The 28% of patients without HIV-1 suppression highlight the need for adherence promotion, risk reduction programmes, and population-based surveillance strategies for assessing the emergence of HIV drug resistance in settings where access to viral load and drug resistance testing is limited.
