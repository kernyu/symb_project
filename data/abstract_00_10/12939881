A rapid development of the resistance of drugs and their toxic and adverse reactions suggest that new antituberculous drugs should be designed. Of the greatest importance is isoniazid resistance. Testing new compounds (IIa, b) has established that the minimum inhibitory concentration of the drug (IIa), 0.39 microgram/ml suppresses the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) in the macrophages up to 50%, that of the drug (IIb), 1.56 micrograms/ml, causes death in 25% of cases, which is indicative of the high activity of compounds (IIa, b) against MBT.
