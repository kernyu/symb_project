The frequency of occurrance of Listeria strains in different food products was determined. Biochemical characteristic of the isolated strains was achieved in accordance with procedure included in PNEN ISO 11290 standard, genus was determined byApiListeria (bioMeieux) test. Sensitivity to selected antibacterial medicines was investigated using disck method and Mueller-Hinton 2 Agar medium. From the 577 examinated food samples 126 strains of Listeria were isolated and among them: 34.1% L. monocytogenes, 36,5% L. welshimeri, 19.0% L. innocua, 3.17% L. grayi, 0.79% L. seeligeri, 0.79% L. seeligeri/welshinmeri and 5.56% L. ivelshimeri/innocua. L. monocytogenes strains most often were found in minced pork, culinary products and in frozen vegetables. On the base of ApiListeria (bioMeieux) test the isolated L. monocytogenes strains were qualified into 2 biochemical types. It was found that all L. monocytogenes were sensitive to sulphametaksazol/trimetoprim and ampicyllin, 25% of strains were moderatety sensitive to penicillin and only 2 L. monocytogenes strains were resistant to gentamicin. Presence of Listeria spp. microorganisms in food products may be an production hygiene indicator for critical control point and show the possibility of contamination with L. monocytogenes strains.
