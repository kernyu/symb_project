OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of integron-mediated antibiotic resistance in a diverse sample set of Salmonella enterica isolated from animals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiplex PCR was used to detect class 1 integron gene sequences, and integron gene cassettes were identified by PCR mapping. Susceptibility to 18 antibiotics or antibiotic combinations commonly used in either human or veterinary medicine was measured using a microdilution method, and statistical comparisons of the frequency of resistance between groups were made using Fisher's two-sided probability test. Genotypic comparisons of isolates were made following pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA. RESULTS: Thirty-two (30.8%) of 104 isolates contained class 1 integron sequences. Integron-positive isolates represented 15 different S. enterica serovars, were obtained from nine different animal species and had a higher frequency of non-integron-mediated antibiotic resistance (P < 0.05) compared with integron-negative isolates. One non-Typhimurium isolate (S. enterica Meleagridis) contained an SGI1 genomic island, including the antibiotic resistance gene cluster. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that integron-mediated antibiotic resistance is common among diverse Salmonella serovars, many of them rare. In addition, SGI1 is not limited to Salmonella enterica Typhimurium DT104 or other commonly isolated serovars.
