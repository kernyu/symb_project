A matched case-control study was performed to identify predictors of mortality among patients (n = 46) with community-onset infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in Thailand. The crude mortality rate was 30%. By multivariable analysis, community-onset bloodstream infection due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was the sole predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 41.3 [95% confidence interval, 4.3-69.4]; [P= .001).
