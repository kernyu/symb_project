OBJECTIVE: To review the outcome for MDR-TB treatment among potential migrants from Vietnam. SETTING: All cases of documented MDR-TB treated by the International Organization of Migration (IOM) in Vietnam from 1989 to 2000 were reviewed. METHODS: MDR-TB was defined as isoniazid- and rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All cases of TB treated by the IOM and recorded in the computerised database were reviewed to identify MDR-TB cases. Demographics, chest radiograph results, drug resistance, drug use and dosage, duration of treatment, and outcome were analysed. RESULTS: Forty-four cases of MDR-TB were identified. Treatment consisted of ambulatory directly observed treatment with an 8-drug protocol: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, capreomycin, ethionamide, ofloxacin and cycloserine. This initial protocol was modified due to drug availability or drug intolerance. Patients were treated with a median of 8 drugs (range 6-12). Mean duration of treatment for MDR-TB was 23.0 (SD+/-11.4) months. Thirty-eight (86%) patients were cured and emigrated, one failed treatment (2%), three were lost to follow-up (7%) and two died (4%). CONCLUSION: Treatment for MDR-TB provided by the IOM was effective in preparing a low-income population for migration.
