BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no standard treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who do not experience a response to first-line immunotherapy. In the current Phase II study, the authors explored the antitumor activity of a combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (L-OHP) in this setting. METHODS: Forty-two patients with RCC who had progressive disease following immunotherapy received gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days) and L-OHP (90 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 every 21 days) for a minimum of 2 cycles before responses were evaluated. Responses to treatment and toxicity were recorded according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, respectively. RESULTS: No complete responses were recorded; however, 6 patients experienced a partial response (14.28%; 95% confidence interval, 5.43-28.5%), 11 patients (26.19%) had temporary stable disease as a best response, and the remaining 25 patients (59.52%) experienced progression despite receiving treatment. The median time to disease progression was 2.5 months (mean, 3.86 months; range, 1.5-11.0 months), whereas the median overall survival was 9.5 months (mean, 10.46 months; range, 4.0-22.5 months). With regard to toxicity, treatment generally was well tolerated, with only one episode of Grade 4 toxicity and expected episodes of Grade 3 toxicity, including myelosuppression and neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that the combination of gemcitabine and L-OHP possesses a certain level of activity and an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with immunotherapy-resistant advanced RCC.
