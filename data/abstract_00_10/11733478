The activity of linezolid was determined against 225 recently isolated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) with decreased levels of susceptibility to teicoplanin. Linezolid activity was compared with other new agents (quinupristin-dalfopristin, trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and telithromycin) and six other antimicrobials (erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, teicoplanin and rifampicin). The in vitro activity of linezolid was similar to that of vancomycin. Linezolid inhibited all MRSA strains at between 0.1 and 2 mg/L and all CoNS strains tested at between 0.2 and 0.5 mg/L. These results suggest that linezolid would be useful for the treatment of infections involving these organisms.
