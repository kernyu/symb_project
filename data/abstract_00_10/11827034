Two new antibiotics, CJ-16,264 (I) and CJ-16,367 (II), were isolated from the fermentation broth of an unidentified fungus CL39457. These antibiotics have a pyrrolizidinone skeleton, first discovered in fungi. Compounds I and II inhibit the growth of Gram-positive multi-drug resistant bacteria and some Gram-negative strains such as Moraxella catarrhalis and Escherichia coli with altered permeability (imp). Comparison of an antibacterial profile between the two compounds suggested that the gamma-lactone portion of I is important for the activity.
