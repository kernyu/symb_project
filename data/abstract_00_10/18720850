OBJECTIVE: To isolate and characterize a glyphosate-resistant strain from extremely polluted environment. METHODS: A glyphosate-resistant strain was isolated from extremely polluted soil taking glyphosate as the selection pressure. Its glyphosate resistance, growth optimal pH and antibiotic sensitivity were detected. Its morphology, cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical properties, chemotaxonomy and 16S rDNA sequences were studied. Based on these results, the strain was identified according to the ninth edition of Bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology. RESULTS: The isolate was named SL06500. It could grow in M9 minimal medium containing up to 500 mmol/L glyphosate. The cell growth optimal pH of SL06500 was 4.0. It was resistant to ampicillin, kanamycin, tetracycline and chloromycetin. The 16S rDNA of SL06500 was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Compared with the published nucleotide sequence of 16S rDNA in NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), SL06500 showed high identity with Achromobacter and Alcaligenes. Based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics, the strain was identified as Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp.xylosoxidans SL06500 according to the ninth edition of Bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology. CONCLUSION: Strain SL06500 is worthy to be studied because of its high glyphosate resistance.
