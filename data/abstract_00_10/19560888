Despite the development of new anitiviral agents, the treatment of chronic hepatitis B remains a major clinical challenge. Major achievements have been made with the rationale use of antivirals exhibiting a complementary cross resistance profile to prevent antiviral drug resistance. The current concept of modern antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B relies on a precise virologic monitoring and early treatment adaptation to prevent drug resistance. The difficulty of achieving viral clearance and the risk of drug resistance development are major arguments to continue research in the field of antivirals and to identify new targets for therapy. The development of true combination therapy is highly desirable to fulfil the objective of long-term viral suppression, clearance of viral cccDNA and infected cells and ultimately cure of the disease.
