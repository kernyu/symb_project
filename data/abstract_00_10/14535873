AIM: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a one-week triple therapy with esomeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in the absence of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: Patients testing positive for H. pylori susceptible to metronidazole and clarithromycin (E-test) were randomized to receive a one-week regimen with either esomeprazole 2 x 20 mg or omeprazole 2 x 20 mg in combination with clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg and metronidazole 2 x 400 mg. Follow-up endoscopy with histology and culture and/or rapid urease test was performed 4-8 weeks after the end of treatment. RESULTS: Eighty patients were randomized. Helicobacter pylori infection was cured in 38/39 patients of the esomeprazole group and 31/33 patients of the omeprazole group (per protocol 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86.2-99.9), 93.7% (95% CI, 79.2-99.2), P=0.59); intention-to-treat 90.4% (95% CI: 77.4-97.3), 81.6% (95% CI: 65.7-92.3), respectively. No major side effects occurred. Minor side effects occurred in eight (20%) and six (23%) patients during esomeprazole and omeprazole therapy, respectively. Post-treatment susceptibility testing revealed resistance to both metronidazole and clarithromycin in two of the three patients who failed. CONCLUSION: We conclude that esomeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole as one-week triple therapy is effective for eradication of H. pylori in the absence of antimicrobial resistance.
