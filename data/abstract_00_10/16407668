A 92-year-old man with a history of bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis received antibiotics for sepsis by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Enterococcus gallinarum. During the antibiotics treatment, skin eruptions, liver dysfunction, and hypereosinophilia developed, followed by dyspnea, congestive heart failure, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and diffuse mild myocardial hypokinesis. After the discontinuation of the antibiotics and the administration of steroid, skin eruptions, liver dysfunction, and hypereosinophilia improved parallel with the improvement of the congestive heart failure. Vancomycin hydrochloride and teicoplanin were suspected as the causative drugs on the basis of the treatment course. Although congestive heart failure is rare in the case of drug-induced hypereosinophilia, it is one of life-threatening complications. We describe herein a case of congestive heart failure associated with hypereosinophilia developed during antibiotics treatment, successfully treated with steroid after the discontinuation of the causative drug.
