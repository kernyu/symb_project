Efficacy and safety of the difluoroquinolone sparfloxacine used in combined therapy for drug-succeptible and drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis were studied. Clinical trials enrolled 60 patients with severe pulmonary tuberculosis. The most effective combinations of sparfloxacine and other antituberculous drugs were determined. Data on satisfactory tolerability of sparfloxacine used in various combinations of the main and reserve agents are presented.
