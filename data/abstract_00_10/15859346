A new sisomicin resistance gene sisR was cloned from sisomicin-producing Micromonospora inyoensis. The sisR fragment was obtained by PCR amplification. The primer pairs were designed based on grm gene sequence from gentamicin-producing Micromonospora purpurea. The template DNA was isolated from Micromonospora inyoensis. A series of different DNA fragments were amplified by PCR, which were sub-cloned to vector pUC19 for further identification. It was found that five specific transformants containing target DNA fragments could resist high concentrations of sisomicin (over 1000 microg/mL sisomicin). One of them designated as sisR, was then sequenced and the alignment among sisR and other related genes showed that sisR gene differs from any known genes. It was concluded that sisR gene is a sequence that has not been reported so far.
