Fourteen fluoroquinolone-resistant fusobacterial strains, originating from cats or dogs, were characterized by sequencing of the 16S-23S and 16S rRNA genes and DNA-DNA hybridization and were described as a new species, Fusobacterium canifelinum. All of the strains are intrinsically resistant (MIC, >4 g/ml) to levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. Compared to the quinolone resistance-determining region (gyrA) of the susceptible relative F. nucleatum, we found that Ser79 was replaced with leucine and Gly83 was replaced with arginine.
