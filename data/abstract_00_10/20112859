A total of 94 bacteria, associated with wild Achanthobrama marmid (Heckel, 1843) in Sir Dam lake of Turkey identified. Subsequently selected isolates were characterized and identified to the genus level The 94 members of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated in the gills and intestines, and among the isolates, E. coli were represented at a rate of 55%, Shigella spp. at a rate of 21%, Salmonella spp. at a rate of 9%, Citrobacter spp. at a rate of 9%, Klebsiella spp. at a rate of 3% and Proteus spp., at a rate of 3%. A total of 94 bacteria resistant to antibiotics and heavy metals were isolated from total 47 of A. marmid samples and were investigated. Viable counts of antibiotic resistant bacteria isolated from gill and intestinal content samples showed high frequencies of resistance to Penicilline-G (KP) (68%), CZ (54%), FOX (48%), while the proportion of CRO (39%) and CTX (36%) resistance was low. In this research, heavy metal contamination in Sir Dam lake water samples and resistance frequency against heavy metals in isolated bacteria from gill and intestinal contents in A. marmid were investigated. Heavy metal contamination such as nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) and chromium (Cr) determined diverse rate (except Mn) in water samples. The resistance frequency of the isolates was revealed different rate for the following heavy metals: Ni, Cd, Cu and Cr When the concentration of heavy metals increased, the resistance against heavy metals in diverse genus of isolates in different rate decreased.
