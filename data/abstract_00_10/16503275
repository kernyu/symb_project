Modern pork production uses a variety of tools to ensure the health, welfare and productivity of pigs. Therapeutic (treatment and prevention of disease) use and use for enhancing growth and feed efficiency (growth promotion) are the two options for use on the farm. Collecting meaningful and accurate antibiotic use data faces significant challenge because of the number and variety of production systems, the need for broad stakeholder analysis of the data and the lack of consistent and science-based definitions of antibiotic use categories. The National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) is one mechanism that estimates uses based on a statistical sample of the nation's swine herd. If, based on sound science, additional information on antibiotic use is considered necessary, stakeholders should discuss the best implementation strategies to achieve the desired result. Producers continue in their science-based commitment to ensure the safety of pork and to maintain consumer confidence.
