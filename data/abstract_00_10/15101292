The experience of optimization of empirical antibacterial therapy of diffuse purulent peritonitis at toxic and terminal stages is presented. The treatment results were compared in main (209) and control (130) patient groups taking into account the clinical and bacteriological efficiency. The technology of combined antibacterial multi-component retroperitoneal lymphotropic therapy was used that included the following drugs: novocain, haemodesum, trisaminum, hydrocortison hemisuccinas, heparin, tripsinum and antibacterial group (kanamicini, levomycetinum, natrii hemisuccinas, dioxydinum, metronidazole) for abdominal and retroperitoneal treatment. 96.7% from the main group and 74.6% from the control group recovered, lethal outcomes and complications decreased in 2.78 and 4 times respectively.
