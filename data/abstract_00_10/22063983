A total of 17 strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, isolated from a Tunisian traditional salted meat and identified by biochemical and molecular methods, were characterized according to their technological properties including acidifying, antimicrobial and enzymatic activities as well as antibiotic resistance in order to select the most suitable for use as starter cultures for the production of fermented sausages. All the strains studied showed good acidifying activity and were able to reduce the pH to less than 4.3 in 72, 48 and 24h at 15, 25 and 37 degrees C respectively. The majority of strains displayed antimicrobial activities against Salmonella arizonae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa and Escherichia coli, however characterization of the antimicrobial substances showed that none of the strains could produce bacteriocins. All the L. plantarum strains were able to hydrolyze casein, whereas none of them was found to possess lipolytic activity. The majority of strains of L. plantarum were resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, rifampicin, ampicillin and penicillin G.
