In order to evaluate the effects of FLAG regimen in treatment of refractory and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 27 patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (10 refractory AML patients, 17 relapsed AML patients) were treated with FLAG regimen. The results show that the rate of complete remission was 48.2% (13/27), the rate of partial remission was 14.8% (4/27), and the overall response rate was 63.0%. Main toxicities were gastrointestinal side effectes, myelosupression and neutropenia. It is concluded that FLAG regimen can be employed in treatment of the refractory or relapsed patients who were not respond to other regimen, and the regiment was safe.
