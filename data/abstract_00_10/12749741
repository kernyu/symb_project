The triple combination tablet containing lamivudine (150 mg), zidovudine (300 mg) and abacavir (300 mg, as abacavir sulfate) is a new formulation of three nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Two studies in treatment-naive patients (one double-blind, one nonblind) have reported that lamivudine/zidovudine (dual combination tablet) plus abacavir showed efficacy similar to that of lamivudine/zidovudine plus indinavir. In both studies, similar numbers of patients in each treatment group had plasma HIV RNA levels </=400 copies/mL at week 48 (51% vs 51% and 64% vs 50%). In treatment-experienced patients with baseline plasma HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL, switching to lamivudine/zidovudine/abacavir (triple combination tablet) was as effective as remaining on highly active antiretroviral treatment (mainly protease inhibitor [PI]-based). Virological failure, the primary endpoint, defined as two consecutive plasma HIV RNA values >400 copies/mL, was reported in 22% of patients in both treatment groups at week 48. Treatment-naive patients receiving lamivudine/zidovudine/abacavir combination therapy experienced several adverse events, including nausea, malaise/fatigue and vomiting.
