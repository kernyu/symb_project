Interferons (IFNs) suppress cell growth by inducing cellular genes. The anti-estrogen tamoxifen (Tam), binds to estrogen receptor and inhibits transcription of estrogen stimulated genes. In cells resistant to IFN-induced growth suppression, IFN/Tam combination causes cell death. We previously reported that the combination of IFN-beta and Tam was a more potent growth suppressor of human tumor xenografts than either agent alone. The IFN/Tam combination acts in a manner similar to the IFN/retinoic acid combination. Using a genetic technique, we have recently identified several genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality (GRIM). One such gene, GRIM-12, was identical to human thioredoxin reductase (TR). In the present study we have examined whether the IFN/Tam combination also requires GRIM-12 for inducing cell death. We report here that GRIM-12 is necessary for mediating the cell death effects of IFN/Tam, and its expression is induced by IFN/Tam at a post-transcriptional stage. Repression of GRIM-12 levels either by antisense expression or by dominant negative inhibitors caused resistance to IFN/Tam induced death and promoted cell growth. Overexpression of GRIM-12 increased IFN/Tam induced apoptosis. Thus, these studies have identified a critical role for GRIM-12 (TR) in apoptosis.
