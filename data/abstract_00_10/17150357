Maintaining a proper balance of metal concentrations is critical to the survival of bacteria. We have designed and synthesized a series of conjugates of metal chelators and efflux transporter substrates aimed at disrupting bacterial metal homeostasis to achieve bacterial killing. Biological studies showed that two of the compounds had very significant antimicrobial effect with an MIC value of 7.8 microg/mL against Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis.
