OBJECTIVE: To study the resistant rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to ADV and the dynamic evolution of HBV in lamivudine (Lam)-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. METHODS: Twenty-three Lam-resistant CHB patients were assigned to a 10mg/d ADV monotherapy for 68-116 weeks. The baseline and different time point blood samples after ADV monotherapy were analyzed for ADV-resistant mutations using direct sequencing of PCR products; the evolution of HBV mutations was examined by clonal analysis of serial samples from one patient infected with ADV-associated resistant HBV strains. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of genotypic ADV resistance at weeks 48 and 96 was 4.3% and 10.5% respectively respectively. The evolution analysis of HBV mutant strains in an ADV-resistant CHB patient showed that the proportion of YMDD mutants gradually decreased with rtA181S mutants increasing over time after ADV monotherapy, and that rtA181S+N236T mutants became the predominant strains during prolonged ADV monotherapy. The addition of Lam to the ongoing ADV treatment had poorer antiviral response in the patient with rtA181S or rtA181S+N236T mutant infection; one clone with multi-drug resistant mutations was selected during Lam and ADV combination therapy. CONCLUSION: Increased risk of adefovir resistance and selection of multi-drug resistant mutations are associated with long-term ADV monotherapy in patients with Lam-resistant chronic hepatitis B.
