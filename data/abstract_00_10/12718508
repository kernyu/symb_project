Challenge with an equal mix of drug-resistant and drug-susceptible larvae of Teladorsagia circumcincta resulted in infections in groups of lambs (n = 6) either untreated or given controlled-release capsules, containing either albendazole or ivermectin. Lambs treated with albendazole capsules contained similar numbers of adult worms at necropsy to the other groups but had no detectable faecal egg count. Animals treated with ivermectin capsules had similar worm burdens and faecal egg counts to the control group but the worms had significantly higher numbers of eggs in utero. These results provide evidence for suppression of egg production by both anthelmintic treatments. The observation that albendazole caused a significant reduction in the developmental success of parasite eggs also has implications for the use of faecal egg count as an indicator for pasture contamination with resistant parasites. In two further groups of lambs, either untreated or given albendazole capsules, treatment caused a significant reduction in egg count and adult worm burden of Trichostrongylus colubriformis. No significant effects were observed on in utero egg counts or egg viability and the apparent effect on the number of eggs produced in faeces per adult female was not significant (p = 0.077). There was, therefore, no evidence that albendazole controlled-release capsules caused suppression of egg output in this species.
