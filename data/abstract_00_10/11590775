Extraction kinetics of phenol with N,N-di(1-methyl-heptyl) acetamide-kerosene using hollow fiber membrane extractor has been studied. The rate regularities and kinetic types of forward and backward extraction were obtained respectively by determining the forward and backward extraction rate under various experimental conditions. The mass transfer mechanism was discussed. Both the forward and backward extraction of phenol might be controlled by diffusion processes, and the diffusion resistance for both forward and backward extraction mainly exists in aqueous phase. In addition, ways to optimize the extraction process of phenol were discussed as well.
