AIM: To investigate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract pathogens, primarily Escherichia coli, in two age groups, children < or = 2 y and adults 18-50 y, over a period of 12 y. METHODS: From the database of the microbiological laboratory all urinary tract culture data were extracted and structured according to date, patient age, bacteriological findings, antimicrobial susceptibility results and sample type. Statistical longitudinal analysis of bacteriological findings and antimicrobial resistance trends in the two age groups were performed. RESULTS: Statistical significance was obtained for the following results. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen in both age groups and irrespective of sample type. In E. coli resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim was higher in children than in adults and increased over time in both age groups. Resistance to fluoroquinolones was higher in adults than in children and increased over time in both groups. Resistance to pivmecillinam, cefadroxil and nitrofurantoin was below 2% in 2001 in both age groups. CONCLUSION: The steadily increasing and now high E. coli resistance levels in children to ampicillin and trimethoprim render empirical therapy with these drugs doubtful. The stable and low levels of resistance to pivmecillinam, cefadroxil and nitrofurantoin (< 2% in 2001) make these drugs reasonable alternatives in uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections.
