We studied the antibiotic susceptibility of 309 Salmonella isolates obtained from three hospitals serving the provinces of Salamanca, Avila and Zamora in the region of Castilla y Leon (mid-west Spain). The susceptibility to 18 antibiotics was studied using the agar dilution method, according to NCCLS guidelines, and the most common multiresistance phenotypes were determined for each province. We observed clear susceptibility differences between the two main serotypes found, S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium. Seventy percent of S. typhimurium were resistant to amoxicillin. In 44% of these isolates, amoxicillin resistance was associated with resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines and chloramphenicol. S. enteritidis was susceptible to most antibiotics tested; amoxicillin resistance was observed in 23.3%, and nalidixic acid resistance in 49.6%. Resistance to nalidixic acid was higher in S. enteritidis than in any other serotypes. According to NCCLS breakpoints, no strain was resistant to fluoroquinolones. However, according to MENSURA criteria, 9% of S. typhimurium isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to cotrimazole and gentamicin was less than 10% for all the serotypes tested. The results indicate that S. typhimurium showed greater resistance and a high multidrug resistance rate. Conversely, S. enteritidis showed high resistance only to amoxicillin and nalidixic acid, though in most cases there was no correlation between this resistance and reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones.
