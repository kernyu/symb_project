The flagellate Trichomonas hominis is often identified in human diarrheic stools. Because of the fecal-oral transmission rout, infection with T. hominis is more frequently reported in children than in adults. Although infections with the trichomonads in some world regions are as often as with Giardia, no prevention and optimal treatment are defined. The purpose of our in vitro studies was to examine susceptibility of T. hominis to a newly synthesized imidazole derivative--1-metylo-2-(2,4-dinitrobenzylotio)-1H-imidazol--P27; in order to make a comparison between this new and previously known compounds, chlorhexidine and metronidazole were used. The protozoans derived from the diarrheic stool of adult patient were grown on the liquid Pahm medium and subcultured twice a week. Assays of trichomonad cultures were incubated with one of the following substances: chlorhexidine, metronidazole or P27. For each compound, two different concentrations were applied. After 24h exposition, an antitrichomonal effect of the above substances was assessed, namely a quantity of the surviving trichomonads was microscopically determined and compared with that observed in control cultures. The protozoans showed different susceptibility, depending on kind and concentration of tested compound. In comparison to the control cultures, the reduction in number of surviving protozoans appeared in the assays with metronidazole, chlorhexidine and P27 (to 63%, 52% and 8.7%, respectively). The highest in vitro susceptibility of T. hominis was revealed to a new imidazole derivative P27. The obtained results allow us to suppose that the further studies in this field will be very helpful for explaining the mechanisms of the antitrichomonal activity of the tested compounds as well as for assessment of the influence of various abiotic factors.
