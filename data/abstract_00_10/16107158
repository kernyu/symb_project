A series of novel 8-substituted dipyridodiazepinone-based inhibitors were investigated for their antiviral activity against wild type human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and the clinically prevalent K103N/Y181C mutant virus. Our efforts have resulted in a series of benzoic acid analogues that are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 replication against a panel of HIV-1 strains resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Furthermore, the combination of good antiviral potency, a broad spectrum of activity, and an excellent pharmacokinetic profile provides strong justification for the further development of compound (7) as a potential treatment for wild type and NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 infection.
