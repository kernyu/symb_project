Therapeutic management of blood hypereosinophilia depends on its underlying cause. The cause may be clearly established (parasitic infestation) or more hypothetical (systemic disease). Blood eosinophils often return to normal levels after treatment of either the cause or the associated eosinophilic disease. A targeted approach is more difficult when the cause is unknown (unexplained chronic hypereosinophilia). Various conventional treatments (corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, interferon) have been somewhat effective. The identification of new cellular and molecular markers with diagnostic and pathophysiologic significance makes more rational approaches possible.
