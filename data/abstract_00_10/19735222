With the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), there have been dramatic reductions in mortality and morbidity of HIV-1-infected patients. Protease inhibitor-based regimens remain a cornerstone of cART owing to their potency and high genetic barrier to resistance. The comparison of atazanavir/ritonavir in naive subjects in combination with tenofovir-emtricitabine versus lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with tenofovir-emtricitabine to assess safety and efficacy (CASTLE) study is a noninferiority trial in which the efficacy, safety and tolerability of atazanavir-ritonavir and lopinavir-ritonavir were compared in antiretroviral therapy-naive patients. The aim of this paper is to review the CASTLE study and the role of atazanavir-ritonavir as an initial treatment in HIV-1-infected patients.
