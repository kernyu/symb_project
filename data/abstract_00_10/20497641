OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible differences in antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli isolated from different samples in children. METHODS: Six hundred and twenty-nine samples from urine, sputum, blood and secretion were collected from June 2004 to May 2009 for bacterial identification by VITEK-32 automatic system and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by Kirby-Bauer method. The drug resistance rate of Escherichia coli isolated from different samples was compared. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty strains of Escherichia coli were isolated , and 108 of which were from urine , 64 from sputum, 54 from secretion and 23 from blood. ESBLs were detected in 96 (36.9%) of the 260 isolates, AmpC enzymes in 32 (12.3%), and ESBLs+AmpC in 8 (3.1%). The ESBLs positive rate of Escherichia coli isolates from sputum was significantly higher than that from other samples (P<0.05). The antimicrobial resistance rate of Escherichia coli strains from different samples to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cefepime, gentamicin, cotrimoxazole, and nitrofurantoin was different. The resistance rate of the strains from sputum samples was higher than that from the other samples (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli isolated from different samples have different antimicrobial resistance rates in children, so the selection of antibiotics for infections confirmed by bacterial cultures from different samples should based on drug sensitivity results.
