The activity of fenticonazole was studied against 260 West and Southeast European vulvovaginal candidiasis isolates, and low MICs were displayed. Fenticonazole was assessed by European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and CLSI microdilution methods for the first time, and the results showed excellent agreement (97%) and significant interclass correlation coefficient (P < 0.0001). Also, the levels of agreement for the results for itraconazole, fluconazole, and ketoconazole were 84%, 90%, and 98% (P < 0.0001), respectively. Multilocus typing by PCR fingerprinting and subsequent cluster analysis delineated geographically associated alignments for Candida albicans and fluconazole resistance-related clusters for Candida glabrata.
