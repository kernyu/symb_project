Fifty-one novel 1-(cyclopropyl/2,4-difluorophenyl/t-butyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-fluoro-7-(sub secondary amino)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids were synthesized and evaluated for their antimycobacterial in vitro and in vivo against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB), multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MC(2)) and also tested for the ability to inhibit the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase from M. smegmatis. Among the synthesized compounds, 7-(3-(diethylcarbamoyl)piperidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoqu inoline-3-carboxylic acid (7l) was found to be the most active compound in vitro with MIC of 0.09 microM against MTB and MDR-TB respectively. In the in vivo animal model 7l decreased the mycobacterial load in lung and spleen tissues with 2.53- and 4.88-log10 protections respectively at a dose of 50mg/kg body weight.
