We cared for a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia who experienced clinical failure with daptomycin. The failure was accompanied by progressive elevation of the daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration during treatment. DNA fingerprinting confirmed that the minimum inhibitory concentration elevation occurred within the same strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This observation provides important new information to clinicians who adopt this promising drug for treatment of serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
