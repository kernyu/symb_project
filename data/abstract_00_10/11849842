The inhibitory effects of methanolic extracts of 19 Jordanian plants and their combinations with seven antibiotics, on the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus were checked. Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which was isolated from patient and a standard strain of S. aureus were used. Our results showed that there are variations in the effect of some combinations used on the resistant and the standard strains probably due to structural changes. Common results between the two strains showed that combinations of gentamicin and chloramphenicol could be improved by the use of plant materials, whereas nalidixic acid activity cannot be improved when combined with plant materials.
