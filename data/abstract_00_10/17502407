The genes erm(B), mef(A), and both erm(B) and mef(A) were identified in 42.6, 10.1, and 47.3%, respectively, of the erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Of the strains, 3.8% were nonsusceptible to levofloxacin and had 1 to 6 amino acid changes in the quinolone resistance-determining region, including a new mutation, Asn94Ser, in the product of parC. Levofloxacin with reserpine was highly specific for efflux screening.
