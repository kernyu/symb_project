Isopoly (S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine) derivatives of nucleic acids bases were prepared as antisense compounds. In past study, we investigated the properties of these compounds in vitro, and revealed that these compounds in vivo regulated the cell death presumably due to the inhibition of protein production. In this study, western and northern blots were carried out in order to reveal the mechanism of this inhibition for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 cell line. In addition, we investigated the resistance of these compounds against cell extract and the metabolism. In conclusion, we proved that these compounds inhibited the protein production by antisense mechanism.
