BACKGROUND: Serious systemic infections represent a major challenge to all paediatric departments, hence the importance of having treatment guidelines available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a review of the literature and a meeting of Norwegian paediatricians with an interest in the field, guidelines for the treatment of serious infectious diseases are proposed. RESULTS: The two main new proposals include once daily dosage of aminoglycosides and increased dosage of aciclovir in the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis. INTERPRETATION: The main objective of the meeting was to maintain a conservative and environmental-friendly antibiotics policy in order to contribute to the prevention of antibiotic resistance.
