In the course of our research aimed at the discovery of metabolic stable pleuromutilin derivatives with more potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens than previous analogues, a series of compounds bearing a purine ring were prepared and evaluated. From SAR studies, we identified two promising compounds 85 and 87, which have excellent in vitro activity against a number of Gram-positive pathogens, including existing drug-resistant strains, and potent in vivo efficacy.
