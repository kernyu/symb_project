An overview of the mechanism of action, dosing, clinical indications, and toxicities of the glycopeptide vancomycin is provided. Emerging gram-positive bacterial resistance to antimicrobials and its mechanisms are reviewed. Strategies to control emergence of resistance are proposed. Newer antimicrobial agents with activity against vancomycin-resistant organisms are now available and play a critical role in the treatment of life-threatening infections.
