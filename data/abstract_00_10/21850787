The challenges of resistance are compounded by growing concerns about the possible use of biological weapons leading to large-scale disease outbreak or exposure. The ability to respond effectively to such exposures could be significantly compromised by the introduction of drug-resistant pathogens. The use of prophylactic drugs or therapies on large populations may also contribute to the development of drug resistance and thus increase both the immediate and longer-term challenges of treating infectious diseases. With such evidence of a dwindling armamentarium to wage our wars against infectious diseases, it has been suggested that a paradigm shift is warranted in how we address the threats posed by pathogens. In an attempt for the Forum to understand how such a new lens might be devised through which the challenges of disease should be viewed, the presentations and discussions of the workshop were structured to explore the existing knowledge and unanswered questions indicated by (but not limited to) the following topics: host-pathogen interactions: defining the concepts of pathogenicity, virulence, colonization, commensalism, and symbiosis; the ecology of host-microbe interactions; understanding the dynamic relationships of host-microbe interactions; novel approaches for mitigating or minimizing the development of antimicrobial resistance; and challenges and opportunities for developing a new paradigm to replace the "war metaphor" of the host-microbial relationship.
