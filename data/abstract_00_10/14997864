As mortality rates decrease in the HIV/AIDS population because of antiretroviral therapies, modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease take on increased significance. There is compelling evidence that the patient population treated for HIV infection is at an increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. While a portion of this risk appears to be related to traditional cardiac risk factors, there is also evidence that iatrogenic factors play a role. Antiretroviral therapy has been associated with hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are among the side effects reported with protease inhibitor (PI) use. Although a few studies report conflicting results, significant data suggest that antiretroviral therapy, particularly PI use, may be associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events. The management of cardiac risk will play an increasing role in the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
