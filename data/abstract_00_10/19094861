INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic, active against gram-positive bacteria. In this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered in 3 Spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international SENTRY antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. The possible therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of Spanish susceptibility data. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. RESULTS: All the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. The highest MIC values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. In addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against Enterococcus faecalis. Daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. viridans group isolates. The distribution of daptomycin MIC values in S. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. CONCLUSION: The sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in Spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.
