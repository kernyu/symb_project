Rifampin-resistant mutants were selected from UV-light-treated Bacillus cereus (20 mutants) and attenuated B. anthracis (23 mutants). In addition, spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutants were also isolated in attenuated B. anthracis (22 mutants). The rifampin resistance clusters of the rpoB gene were sequenced for all 65 mutants. Mutations associated with resistance were consistent with those from other bacteria, though two novel changes were observed. The spontaneous rate of resistance was estimated at 1.57 x 10(-9) mutations/generation by a Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test.
