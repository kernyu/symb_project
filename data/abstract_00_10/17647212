The antifungal activities of novel salicylic acid derivatives, salaceyin A, 6-(9-methyldecyl) salicylic acid, and salaceyin B, 6-(9-methylundecyl) salicylic acid were evaluated against plant pathogenic fungi. Salaceyin A showed antifungal activity against Cladosporium cucumerinum, Colletotrichum orbiculare and Phytophthora capsici at 64 microg ml(-1) while salaceyin B was less effective. In vitro antifungal activities of the compounds were influenced by the experimental pH value of the MIC test medium wherein their antifungal activities were enhanced by increasingly acidic conditions. Salaceyin A showed potent in vivo control efficacy against Phytophthora blight in pepper plants. The disease was effectively suppressed at 500 microg ml(-1), which was comparable to the commercial fungicide, metalaxyl. Salaceyin A suppressed anthracnose development on cucumber leaves in a concentration dependent manner. The control efficacy of salaceyin A against C. orbiculare infection was similar to chlorothalonil when applied prior to pathogen inoculation. Since the salaceyins are derivatives of salicylic acid, a known important signal molecule critical to plant defenses against pathogen invasion, we investigated the possibility that exogenous application of the salaceyin A would activate a systemic acquired resistance against P. capsici infection and C. orbiculare development on pepper and cucumber plants respectively. The addition of 500 microg ml(-1) of salaceyin A to the plant root systems did not significantly decrease disease development in the hosts. We are led to conclude that the disease control efficacy of salaceyin A against the Phytophthora blight and anthracnose diseases, mainly originates from the direct interaction of the agent with the pathogens.
