OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of katG, inhA, ahpC, kasA, and oxyR gene mutations in isoniazid-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: A total of 101 isoniazid-resistant and 43 susceptible strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were analyzed by PCR and sequence analysis of their katG, inhA, ahpC, kasA, and oxyR genes. RESULTS: (1) Sequencing of katG from 101 INH-resistant strains showed point mutations, small deletions or insertions in 81 isolates (80.2%), but no complete deletions were identified. The mutations at 16 position were found for the first time. Point mutations at position 315 were found in the genomes of 38.6% (39/101) of isoniazid-resistant strains. Low level isoniazid resistant strains (1 microg/ml) had higher mutation frequency at 315-Ser than high level isoniazid resistant strains (10 microg/ml; chi(2) = 9.31, P < 0.05). Mutations at position 463 were detected in 58 (57.4%) isoniazid-resistant strains. Arg463leu was also present in 23 of 43 susceptible strains. (2) Mutations in inhA genes were identified in 5 isoniazid-resistant isolates (4.9%). None of the susceptible strains contained any mutation in inhA genes. (3) Only 3 isolates in the 101 (2.97%) isoniazid-resistant clinical isolates had mutations in ahpC genes. No mutations were identified in the ahpC genes in 43 isoniazid-susceptible isolates. (4) Mutations in kasA genes were present in 17 of 101 (16.8%) isoniazid-resistant isolates. However, G312S was also present in 3 of 43 susceptible strains. (5) None of the isoniazid-resistant strains and susceptible isolates contained oxyR gene mutation. (6) Taken together, 91 of 101 (90%) isoniazid-resistant strains had mutations in katG, inhA, ahpC, and kasA genes which were associated with drug resistance. CONCLUSION: These studies provide further evidence supporting the association between katG, inhA, ahpC, and kasA gene mutations and INH resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while other mechanisms of INH resistant may exist.
