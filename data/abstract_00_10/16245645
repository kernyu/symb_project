SPD754 (also known as AVX-754) is a deoxycytidine analogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with antiretroviral activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 in vitro and against recombinant viruses containing thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs). In order to better establish the activity of SPD754 against HIV-1 containing TAMs, twelve panels of up to twenty clinical isolates with defined TAM combinations were selected from the ViroLogic database. Phenotypic viral susceptibility to SPD754 and five other NRTIs was tested using the PhenoSense HIV assay and expressed as median fold-change compared with a reference strain. In total, 215 isolates were selected, representing four TAM patterns in both pathways by which TAMs accumulate clinically. The presence of five TAMs in the 41, 215 pathway, at codons 41, 67, 210, 215, and 219 of reverse transcriptase (RT), produced a median 1.8-fold reduction in SPD754 susceptibility, compared with fold reductions to zidovudine, lamivudine, abacavir, didanosine and tenofovir of 438, 4.8, 4.5, 1.4 and 3.6, respectively. Five TAMs in the 67, 70, 219 pathway (at codons 41, 67, 70, 215 and 219) reduced SPD754 susceptibility by a median 1.3-fold, compared with fold reductions for the aforementioned NRTIs of 108, 3.2, 3.0, 1.3 and 2.5, respectively. M184V addition reduced SPD754 susceptibility by 1.8-fold in the presence or absence of TAMs. SPD754 retains a substantial proportion of its antiviral activity against HIV-1 containing multiple TAMs, with or without the M184V mutation. These data suggest that SPD754 is a promising new NRTI for the treatment of NRTI-experienced HIV-infected patients.
