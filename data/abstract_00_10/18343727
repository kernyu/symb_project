Chronic osteomyelitis is a serious problem in developing countries. A lot of patients with chronic osteomyelitis have to be treated for a very long period and get several operations including complete debridement, antibiotic bead implant, bone grafts, etc. However, traditional methods seem to be ineffective in some patients, who always have a high incidence of recurrence. We report a case of chronic osteomyelitis in bilateral femurs, which has been treated with long time antibiotic therapy, about twenty debridements, yet the sinus remained unhealed for over four years. At the end of this period, we used PRP to treat the unhealed sinus and obtained good results. Though the mechanism by which PRP treats chronic osteomyelitis is now unclear, the results encourage study further.
