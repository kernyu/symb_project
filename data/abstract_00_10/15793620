The work reported here investigated the fungal community inhabiting western redcedar fence material with a focus on species colonizing wood below the surface, of which little is known. From seven pieces of fence material, twenty-three different fungal species were isolated and characterized using both traditional morphology and molecular identification methods. The species identified included thirteen ascomycetous and ten basidiomycetous fungi. Isolates were tested for their resistance to beta-thujaplicin - one of the principle fungicidal agents of western redcedar heartwood extractives. Generally, ascomycetous fungi exhibited greater resistance to beta-thujaplicin than basidiomycetous fungi. Interestingly, three ascomycetous and two basidiomycetous species frequently isolated had high tolerance to this compound. These species could be candidate 'pioneer' species that invade and detoxify western redcedar extractives, paving the way for colonization by decay fungi.
