LysK is the endolysin from the staphylococcal bacteriophage K, and can digest the cell wall of many staphylococci. Lysostaphin is a bacteriocin secreted by Staphylococcus simulans to kill Staphylococcus aureus. Both LysK and lysostaphin have been shown to lyse methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). This study describes optimal reaction conditions for the recombinant His-tagged LysK protein (pH range pH 6-10, and 0.3-0.5 M NaCl), and C-His-LysK MIC (32.85+/-4.87 mug mL(-1)). LysK and lysostaphin demonstrate antimicrobial synergy by the checkerboard assay.
