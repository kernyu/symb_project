Nucling is a novel protein isolated from murine embryonal carcinoma cells with an up-regulated expression during cardiac muscle differentiation. We show here that Nucling was up-regulated by proapoptotic stimuli and important for the induction of apoptosis after cytotoxic stress. We further demonstrated that overexpressed Nucling was able to induce apoptosis. In Nucling-deficient cells, the expression levels of Apaf-1 and cytochrome c, which are the major components of an apoptosis-promoting complex named apoptosome, were both down-regulated under cellular stress. A deficiency of Nucling also conferred resistance to apoptotic stress on the cell. After UV irradiation, Nucling was shown to reside in an Apaf-1/pro-caspase-9 complex, suggesting that Nucling might be a key molecule for the formation and maintenance of this complex. Nucling induced translocation of Apaf-1 to the nucleus, thereby distributing the Nucling/Apaf-1/pro-caspase-9 complex to the nuclear fraction. These findings suggest that Nucling recruits and transports the apoptosome complex during stress-induced apoptosis.
