The Adames strain of Punta Toro virus (PTV-A, Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) causes an acute lethal disease in hamsters and mice. The Balliet strain of the virus (PTV-B) is generally considered to be avirulent. The difference in hamster susceptibility is likely due to the ability of PTV-A to suppress interferon (IFN)-beta similarly to that described for Rift Valley fever virus. Here we investigated strain differences in PTV pathogenesis and the IFN response in mice. Although PTV-B infection in mice did not induce systemic IFN-beta release, primary macrophages produced dramatically higher levels when exposed to the virus in culture. The importance of IFN in resistance to PTV infection was borne out in studies employing STAT-1 knock-out mice. Also, a number of genes specific to IFN response pathways were upregulated in PTV-B-infected macrophages. Our findings provide new insights into the type I IFN response during PTV infection in the mouse model of phleboviral disease.
