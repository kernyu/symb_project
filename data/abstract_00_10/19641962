An actual severe problem in agriculture consists of an expressive increase of economical losses caused by fungi and resistant bacteria toward antibiotics. In order to find a solution to this problem, several studies have been concentrating on the screening of novel plant defense peptides with antimicrobial activities. These peptides are commonly characterized by having low molecular masses and cationic charges. The present work reports the purification and characterization of a novel plant peptide with molecular mass of 5340 Da, named Cp-AMP, from seeds of C. pallida, a typical plant from Caatinga biome. Purification was achieved using a size exclusion S-200 column followed by reversed-phase chromatography on Vydac C18-TP column. In vitro assays indicated that Cp-AMP was able to inhibit the development of filamentous fungi Fusarium oxysporum as well as the gram-negative bacterium Proteus sp. The identification of Cp-AMP could contribute, in the near future, to the development of biotechnological products, such as transgenic plants with enhanced resistance to pathogenic fungi and/or of antibiotics production derived from plant sources in order to control bacterial infections.
