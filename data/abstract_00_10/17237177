Large-scale chromosomal inversions (455 to 535 kbp) or deletions (266 to 320 kbp) were found to accompany spontaneous loss of beta-lactam resistance during drug-free passage of the multiresistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus clinical strain JCSC1435. Identification and sequencing of the rearranged chromosomal loci revealed that ISSha1 of S. haemolyticus is responsible for the chromosome rearrangements.
