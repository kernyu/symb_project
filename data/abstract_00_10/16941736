Clindamycin resistance in Staphylococcus species can be either constitutive or inducible. Inducible resistance cannot be detected by the conventional antimicrobial susceptibility test. In this study, we determined the prevalence of inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococcal isolates at a Korean tertiary care hospital. Between February and September 2004, 1,519 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 1,043 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were tested for inducible resistance by the D-zone test. Overall, 17% of MRSA, 84% of MSSA, 37% of MRCNS, and 70% of MSCNS were susceptible to clindamycin. Of the erythromycin non-susceptible, clindamycin-susceptible isolates, 32% of MRSA, 35% of MSSA, 90% of MRCNS, and 94% of MSCNS had inducible clindamycin resistance. Inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococci was highly prevalent in Korea. This study indicates importance of the D-zone test in detecting inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococci to aid in the optimal treatment of patients.
