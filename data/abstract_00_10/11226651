A retrospective study on 113 patients admitted to the burns unit over a period of 12 months was undertaken to investigate the emerging trend of Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Wound infection with A. baumannii was seen in 13 (11.5%) patients. Of these six (46%) patients developed septicaemia with the same bacteria and five (38%) expired. The virulence of these bacteria, drug susceptibility pattern and its role as a nosocomial pathogen is discussed.
