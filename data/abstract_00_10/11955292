OBJECTIVE: To identify the variance of pathogens of purulent keratitis and their resistance patterns to antibiotics. METHODS: From January 1995 to October 2000, all patients with suspected infectious corneal ulcer were examined by bacterial, fungal and Acanthameoba culture. The results of microorganism-culture were compared with those in literature. RESULTS: Of the specimens in 1 430 cases, there were 790 cases (55.2%) with positive culture including bacterial isolates in 258 cases (18.0%), fungal isolates in 498 cases (34.8%) and parasites in 34 cases (2.4%). The Staphylococcus aureous and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had markedly declined since 1980s represented 6.2% and 21.7% of bacterial isolates respectively. However, the opportunity organism such as Staphylococcus epidermidis represented 27.5%, a tendency of gradual increase. The most common fungal pathogen was fusarium spp that represented 64.5% of all positive fungal cultures, and Aspergillus spp (13.6%) occupied the second place. The resistance of the ocular bacteria to fluoroquinolones gradually increased. Although the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to gentamycin in 36.2%, it was almost no resistance to tobramycin (3.4%). The fusarium spp was shown to be resistant to a number of the anti-fungal agents, but it is sensitive to natamycin. CONCLUSION: The survey of pathogens in purulent ulcerative keratitis and their resistance patterns to antibiotics helps in clinical treatment.
