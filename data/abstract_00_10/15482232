Telithromycin (Ketek), Aventis Pharma), a ketolide, belongs to a new class of antibiotics that was developed for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of penicillin and macrolide resistance among respiratory pathogens is increasing in the USA. Telithromycin is highly active against beta-lactam, macrolide and fluoroquinolone reduced-susceptibility pathogens. Its efficacy has been shown to be equal or superior to comparator agents in numerous studies. It has a broad in vitro spectrum versus usual respiratory pathogens and oral once-daily dosing that increases patient compliance. Telithromycin penetrates rapidly into neutrophils in bronchopulmonary tissue, with peak levels obtained in 1 to 2 h. Results of clinical trials show clinical-esponse rates similar to comparator agents. The most frequent adverse events involve the gastrointestinal system, with mild to moderate diarrhea and nausea. A low rate of discontinuation was observed in the studies. Telithromycin is an effective first-line treatment for mild to moderate respiratory infections in adults.
