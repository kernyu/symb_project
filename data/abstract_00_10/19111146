Linear IgA disease is an autoimmune subepidermal bullous disease in which linear IgA deposits are found at the basement membrane zone. It is classically idiopathic but may be drug induced. We report on a patient with drug induced linear IgA disease who exhibited certain unusual and interesting clinical features including isomorphic Koebner response, annular blister of the nipples and local insulin sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, these clinical features have not yet been reported in linear IgA disease.
