UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus agalactiae strains isolated from urocultures in order to obtain new data regarding circulating phenotypes in Urology Department. METHODS: For identifications of Streptococcus agalactiae strains we used Pastorex Strep (BioRad). The sensitivity of isolated germs to antimicrobials was tested using standardised Kirby-Bauer technique. RESULTS: We isolated 21 Streptococcus agalactiae strains from 1871 urocultures. Analyzing the extended antibiograms we categorized these germs according with their resistance phenotypes and we remarked a high percentage of wild type phenotype Streptococcus agalactiae strains (80.95%). CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus agalactiae strains are more rarely isolated from hospital acquired urinary tract infections, that's way we can explain the low resistance of these strains.
