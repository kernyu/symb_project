A series of novel 2,5-bis(guanidino-aryl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrroles 9a-h has been synthesized starting from 1-methyl-1H-pyrrole. The antifungal activities of compounds were evaluated by in vitro agar diffusion and broth dilution assay against Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. Compound 9c from this series was found to be equipotent or more potent than fluconazole, whereas compound 9d was comparable to fluconazole against most of the tested strains.
