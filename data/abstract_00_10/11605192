A 35-day-old male infant was admitted to our hospital, presenting a high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Multidrug-resistant and fluoroquinolon-resistant Salmonella serotype Typhimurium was isolated from his stool. The phage type of the strain was DT12. The strain was resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin; MIC 8 micrograms/ml, norfloxacin; 24 micrograms/ml, ciprofloxacin; 16 micrograms/ml, sparfloxacin; 32 micrograms/ml). He was cured by antibiotic therapy using fosfomycin (< or = 1 microgram/ml). We could not determine a route of infection. Domestic surveillance for fluoroquinolon-resistant Sallmonella is necessary.
