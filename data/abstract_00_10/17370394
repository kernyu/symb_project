Antibiotherapy is one of the main treatment in cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is one of the main causes of pulmonary degradation. The chronic sputum colonisation is characterized by the emergence of the mucoid phenotype, the formation of biofilm and the induction of excessive inflammatory response and consecutive tissue lesion. The choice of antibiotics depends on quantitative and qualitative analysis of sputum, bacteria resistance phenotypes and severity of infection. Treatment of P. aeruginosa is different in case of first colonization or chronic infection. In the first case, parenteral antibiotherapy (beta-lactams-aminoglycosids) followed by inhaled antibiotherapy may eradicate the germ. In the other case, superinfections can be treated with parenteral biantibiotherapy (beta-lactams or quinolons and aminoglycosides) during 15 to 21 days. This is associated with a better nutritional and respiratory status and a prolonged survival. Inhaled antibiotics between the courses have decreased the number of superinfections. This prolonged antibiotherapy must be monitored because of possible induction of bacterial resistance, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminosids and allergy to beta-lactams.
