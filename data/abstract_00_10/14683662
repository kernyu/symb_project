Drug-resistant HIV-1 is a cause of growing clinical and public-health concern. In many patients, combination antiretroviral therapy fails to achieve complete viral suppression (virological failure). Continuing viral replication during therapy leads to the accumulation of drug-resistance mutations, resulting in increased viral load and a greater risk of disease progression. Patients with drug-resistant HIV-1 infection have three therapeutic options: a change to a salvage regimen with the aim of fully suppressing viral replication; interruption of therapy; or continuation of a partially effective regimen. The first strategy is preferred for most patients failing their first or perhaps their second regimen. However, the best approach remains unclear for patients who have failed multiple treatment regimens and who have limited options for complete viral suppression. The management of such patients requires a careful understanding of the pathogenesis of drug-resistant HIV-1, the clinical consequences of virological failure, the potential benefits and limitations of diagnostic assays, and the likelihood that agents in development will be effective.
