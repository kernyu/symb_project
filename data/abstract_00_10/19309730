Regulation of the DNA binding affinity of an oligomeric protein can be considered to consist of an intrinsic component, in which the affinity of an individual DNA-binding domain is modulated in response to effector binding, and an extrinsic component, in which the relative position of the protein's two DNA-binding domains are altered so that they can or cannot contact both half-site operators simultaneously. We demonstrated directly that the TetR repressor utilizes an extrinsic mechanism and CAP, the catabolite activator protein, utilizes an intrinsic mechanism.
