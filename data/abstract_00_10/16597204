In the current era of pay-for-performance standards, the incidence of surgical site infections is increasingly becoming an institutional marker of quality assurance. Surgical site infections lead to increased morbidity and mortality in the surgical population and contribute to an already rising healthcare cost. As a result, the surgical community goes to great lengths to prevent this costly and occasionally lethal complication. Many practices are evidence based, however, many are not. In this article, the most commonly used preventive strategies in practice today and the evidence behind each are reviewed. In addition, an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology and microbiology of surgical site infections will be provided.
