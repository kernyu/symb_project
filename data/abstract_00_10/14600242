Certain mutations in the rpsL gene (encoding the ribosomal protein S12) activate or enhance antibiotic production in various bacteria. K88E and P91S rpsL mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), with an enhanced actinorhodin production, were found to exhibit an aberrant protein synthesis activity. While a high level of this activity (as determined by the incorporation of labelled leucine) was detected at the late stationary phase in the mutants, it decreased with age of the cells in the wild-type strain. In addition, the aberrant protein synthesis was particularly pronounced when cells were subjected to amino acid shift-down, and was independent of their ability to accumulate ppGpp. Ribosomes of K88E and P91S mutants displayed an increased accuracy in protein synthesis as demonstrated by the poly(U)-directed cell-free translation system, but so did K43N, K43T, K43R and K88R mutants, which were streptomycin resistant but showed no effect on actinorhodin production. This eliminates the possibility that the increased accuracy level is a cause of the antibiotic overproduction in the K88E and P91S mutants. The K88E and P91S mutant ribosomes exhibited an increased stability of the 70S complex under low concentrations of magnesium. The authors propose that the aberrant activation of protein synthesis caused by the increased stability of the ribosome is responsible for the remarkable enhancement of antibiotic production in the K88E and P91S mutants.
