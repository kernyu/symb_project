Fifteen lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated from blood cultures from 15 different patients in the Faculty Hospital in Brno, Czech Republic. All strains were identified using biochemical tests and repetitive PCR using the (GTG)5 primer. Doubtful identification results were confirmed by whole-cell protein analysis. The strains were assigned to the genera Lactobacillus (eight strains representing seven species), Leuconostoc (six strains representing four species) and Weissella (one strain). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the E-test and revealed high-level resistance to cotrimoxazol, metronidazole, vancomycin and teicoplanin, but nearly all strains were susceptible to erythromycin, clindamycin, ampicillin and penicillin.
