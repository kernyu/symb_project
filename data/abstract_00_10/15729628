High-throughput isolation, purification and analysis methods applied to natural products libraries from plants gave rise to the discovery of two novel acylated caprylic alcohol glycosides (1, 2) produced by Arctostaphylos pumila. The NMR spectra were acquired using the CapNMR probe and performed on mass-limited samples, which enabled us to elucidate the structures of 2,6-diacetyl-3,4-diisobutyl-1- O-octylglucopyranoside (1, 200 microg) and 2,6-diacetyl-3,4-dimethylbutyl-1- O-octylglucopyranosid (2, 70 microg). Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC of 128 microg/mL and 64 microg/mL, respectively.
