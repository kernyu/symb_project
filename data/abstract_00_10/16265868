In the course of antibiotic treatments of the most frequent respiratory infections a lot of greatly heterogenic medical decisions in the primary health care were issued resulting in the irrational, untargeted and polypragmatic use of antibiotics, causing the spread of antibiotic resistance and increasing its threat world-wide. On the base of quality explorer investigations it was suggested that this bad attitude would be fairly characterised with use of our's new quality indicators which are really able to measure the negligence of the most important professional proposals (as the negligence of evidence based anticausal targeting) by doctors. In the future we would have to decrease the proportion of the erroneous medical decision patterns by virtue of the following of evidence based prescriptions of antibiotics and it would be helped by the introducing of continuous quality improvement based on the use of the new quality indicators. To regenerate the professional quality level of anticausal treatments we have to raise the frequency of rational, evidence based medical decision patterns to the desirable level to attain the avoidance of unnecessary or too broad spectrumed and thereby too expensive antibiotic treatments with an eye to restrain the spread of antibiotic resistance and to decrease the unnecessary costs. Today we have to choose expressly to serve the future of mankind or instead of those to serve the growth of industrial profit, only.
