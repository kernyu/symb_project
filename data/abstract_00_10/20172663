During the last few years, acquired resistance to colistin in Escherichia coli, but also in other bacterial species, has been reported. It has been shown that the disk diffusion test is not a reliable method for the detection of this resistance. Therefore, there is a need for a reliable and cheap test to determine colistin susceptibility of pathogenic E. coli strains. In the current research, the colistin susceptibility of E. coli isolated during the period 2005-2006 from pigs was determined. Results obtained with the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion test (Neosensitabs, Rosco), the disk prediffusion test (Neosensitabs, Rosco) and the E-test (AB Biodisk) were compared with the results of the reference agar dilution assay. The MIC values or inhibition zones showed a bimodal distribution for the results obtained by all test methods, except the disk diffusion assay, suggesting acquired resistance in 15 strains (9.6%). The E-test and disk prediffusion assay generated results within acceptable levels compared to the reference agar dilution assay. The categorical agreement with the results obtained by the agar dilution method were good to very good for all tests, except the disk diffusion assay. In conclusion, current results suggest that, in addition to the E-test, the disk prediffusion test is a reliable, alternative agar-based colistin susceptibility method for testing colistin susceptibility of E. coli isolates in diagnostic bacteriology.
