Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death due to bacterial infection. It accounts for 10 million physician office visits in the USA annually. However, 80% of these are managed in the community, usually with oral antibiotic therapy. Typically, such courses have lasted 10 days or longer. Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for 25% of all CAP infections; resistance among S. pneumoniae to all classes of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, poses new and shifting challenges to the primary care physician. Gemifloxacin is a potent agent, active against pneumococci and atypical pathogens. Administered once daily for 5 days, gemifloxacin is highly efficacious and well tolerated. Gemifloxacin administered for 5-7 days is a cost effective and safe alternative to both parenteral and oral antimicrobials, which may not cover the emerging resistant respiratory pathogens.
