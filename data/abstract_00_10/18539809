An increase of the degree of d-alanylation of teichoic acids in Lactococcus lactis resulted in a significant increase of bacterial resistance toward the cationic antimicrobials nisin and lysozyme, whereas the absence of D-alanylation led to a decreased resistance toward the same compounds. In contrast, the same variations of the D-alanylation degree did not modify bacterial cell surface charge and hydrophobicity. Bacterial adhesion to polystyrene and glass surfaces was not modified either.
