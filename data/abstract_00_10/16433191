The interactions of daptomycin with gentamicin and 5 beta-lactam agents were determined by checkerboard and timed-kill studies. Eighty isolates were tested by checkerboard: 20 each of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (VSEF) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Time kill curves were performed on 8 selected isolates: 2 each of MRSA, MSSA, VSEF and VRE. Checkerboard results showed highest frequency of synergistic effects against VSEF (35-75%) with daptomycin combined with ceftriaxone, cefepime or imipenem; a modest effect with most combinations against VRE and MRSA (5-20%); and indifference with daptomycin and most agents against MSSA (0-5%); except with daptomycin with oxacillin where 10-20% synergy was observed. Synergistic interaction was confirmed by time kill studies in seven of ten isolates where checkerboard suggested synergy. A bactericidal effect was exerted in 5/7 synergistic combinations. The in vitro data suggest that daptomycin combined with other antibiotics may be microbiologically beneficial and not antagonistic.
