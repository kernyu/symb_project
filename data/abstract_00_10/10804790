Under the influence of antimicrobial agents, bacteria that primarily produce TEM-Type or SHV-Type beta-lactamases developed point mutations in structural genes which served to extend the substrate specificity of the enzymes. Undoubtedly, CTX-resistance rates increased in E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the recent years. It is strongly suggested that a survey of ESBL-producing clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae should also be required for rigorous detection methods.
