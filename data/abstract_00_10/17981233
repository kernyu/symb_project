The emergence of viral resistance during treatment is becoming an important clinical issue for hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapy. Considerable progress has been achieved in the efficacy of treatment, with the development of new drugs that allow a sustained suppression of HBV replication, or at least maintain the viral load below a clinically relevant threshold. Although most drugs currently registered for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B are effective in suppressing viral load, long-term therapy is required to avoid viral reactivation and progression of liver disease. Because of the variability of the HBV genome, such long-term treatments are associated with the emergence of resistant viral strains, which may compromise the initial clinical benefit of the treatment.
