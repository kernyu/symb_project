OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibiotic sensitivity of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from persons in contact with pigs. DESIGN: Retrospective. METHOD: The pig-related MRSA collection, built up between January 1st 2003 and November 30th 2006 in the Regional Laboratory for Medical Microbiology and Infection Prevention (RLMMI) of the Jeroen Bosch Hospital, Den Bosch, The Netherlands, was tested for sensitivity to a large number ofantibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 65 isolates were obtained from 53 patients. All (100%) of the pig-related MRSA isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, nitrofurantoin, rifampicin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Variable sensitivity was found for erythromycin (40%), clindamycin (48%), cotrimoxazole (48%), aminoglycosides (92%), tetracycline (6%), and quinolones (94%). CONCLUSION: In view of the sensitivities found, clindamycin does not seem suitable for the empirical therapy ofpig-related MRSA-infections. In case of severe infection, therapy should be started either with an intravenous glycopeptide or with oral ciprofloxacin, possibly combined with rifampicin or linezolid.
