We used a well-characterized isogenic set of clinical bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus strains to study (i) regulation of mprF-mediated phosphatidylglycerol lysinylation in the contexts of in vitro daptomycin (DAP) nonsuceptibility and (ii) the role of mprF mutation in endovascular virulence. We observed a correlation between increased expression of a mutant mprF gene and reduced in vitro DAP susceptibility. There were no detectable fitness differences between strains in experimental infective endocarditis.
