The antimicrobial effects of sitafloxacin (DU-6859a) against Mycobacterium leprae, either singly or in combination with either rifampicin, rifabutin or KRM-1648, were studied using a mouse footpad assay technique and the results were compared with those obtained with ofloxacin. When used singly, the minimum concentrations of sitafloxacin and ofloxacin needed to inhibit completely the growth of M. leprae were 25 and 100 mg per kg body weight per day, respectively, and the effects were bactericidal. Both sitafloxacin and ofloxacin exhibited excellent synergistic effects when combined with either rifabutin or KRM-1648, but not with rifampicin. Thus, incorporation of sitafloxacin and rifabutin (or KRM-1648) in the multidrug regimen for treating leprosy patients is suggested.
