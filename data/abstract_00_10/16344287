OBJECTIVES: Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease with worldwide significance. Trichomoniasis can be treated with metronidazole; however, resistant strains of T. vaginalis have been isolated and there is a lack of useful alternative drugs. The aim of the present study was to examine the activity of hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC; miltefosine), a membrane-active alkylphospholipid, that is licensed as an antileishmanial agent against T. vaginalis. METHODS: The efficacy of HePC after 30 min, 1 h, 16 h and 24 h against four different T. vaginalis strains (with varying resistance to metronidazole) was evaluated. RESULTS: It was shown that all isolates, including the metronidazole-resistant strains, were susceptible to HePC, with EC50s of between 8 and 40 microM and EC90s of between 8 and 80 microM depending on time and on the medium used for the experiments. Treatment of trichomonads with HePC resulted in rounding up and, at concentrations of >or=40 microM, in subsequent total lysis of the organisms. CONCLUSIONS: HePC may be a promising new candidate for the treatment of trichomoniasis.
