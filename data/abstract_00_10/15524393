The total of 259 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates gained from aerosols created during dumping and utilisation of municipal waste were investigated. Species and subspecies identification allowed to determine predominance of novobiocin-resistant species which primarily colonise rodents or other animals. However, about 30% of isolates were species originating from humans. Metabolic properties of the studied group of isolates were examined, as well as their sensitivity to a set of 8 commonly used antibiotics: amoxicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. Many isolates resistant to erythromycin (19%), tetracycline (13%) and a considerably smaller group resistant to clindamycin (6.2%), chloramphenicol (2%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1%) were found. It appeared that processes of occurring at the time of dumping and utilisation of waste affect the prevalence of only some features. The examined metabolic features were found to be relatively stable and no changes were observed, which would indicate the tendency of adaptation to existence in the inanimate matter environment. Only isolates with active nitrate reductase were more frequently detected. The increase in frequency of occurrence of isolates resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol and simultaneous elimination of isolates resistant to other antibiotics were observed.
