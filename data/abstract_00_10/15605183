The aim of this study was to compare a commercially available automated broth microdilution system (Merlin; Micronaut, Germany) with the standard agar dilution method for susceptibility testing of pulmonary isolates from cystic fibrosis patients. Accurate susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates from cystic fibrosis patients is known to pose problems. Although commercially available automated test systems could facilitate susceptibility testing of such isolates in routine diagnostics, these systems have not been recommended thus far. However, a pilot study recently indicated that the Merlin system, which is based on an endpoint measurement rather than on growth curves, might be applicable in the susceptibility testing of isolates from cystic fibrosis patients. In the present study, the Merlin system was further evaluated using an extended panel of nonmucoid and mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The results showed that the MICs obtained with the Merlin system tended to be lower than those obtained with the agar dilution method, a finding that became increasingly apparent when mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were tested. The correlation coefficients (r values) of the MIC results for all strains tested were between 0.6 and 0.8 for five of the seven antimicrobial agents, with r values exceeding 0.8 for only meropenem and ciprofloxacin. However, since the overall rate of serious discrepancies was within an acceptable range, the Merlin system appears to be applicable for routine clinical use in susceptibility testing of P. aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients.
