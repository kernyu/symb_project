The aim of the present paper was to compare different methods for detecting methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Among the isolates analyzed, 52 belonged to MRSA international lineages commonly detected in the American continent and 14 to sporadic MRSA clones. Both 30 microg-cefoxitin disk and PBP2a had 100% sensibility/specificity when the low-level heterogeneous isolates were tested and, thus, are highly recommended.
