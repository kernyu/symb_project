C57BL/6 mice were fed 18% ethanol (vol/vol) in drinking water for 12 wk. Isovolumic hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion on a Langendorff apparatus. There were no differences in baseline hemodynamic function between hearts from ethanol (EtOH)-fed mice and controls. However, prior alcohol consumption doubled recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (68 +/- 8 vs. 33 +/- 8 mmHg for controls; n = 10, P < 0.05) and reduced creatine kinase release by half (0.26 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.51 +/- 0.08 U x min(-1) x g wet wt(-1) for controls; n = 10, P < 0.05). EtOH feeding doubled expression of activated protein kinase C epsilon (PKC)epsilon (n = 6, P < 0.05); whereas PKC inhibition blocked protection during ischemia-reperfusion. EtOH feeding also increased expression of Akt three- to fivefold (n = 6, P < 0.05), whereas PKC inhibition prevented increases in Akt kinase activity. We conclude that signaling pathways involving PKC-epsilon are critical for sustained EtOH-mediated cardioprotection and that Akt may be a downstream effector of resistance to myocardial reperfusion injury.
