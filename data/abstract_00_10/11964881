Until recently, interferon monotherapy has been the only available therapeutic option for patients with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Lamivudine has emerged as another effective first-line therapy for chronic hepatitis B as well as a beneficial treatment option for patients with decompensated hepatitis B cirrhosis. Viral resistance with long-term lamivudine therapy remains a major concern but new data continue to show benefits despite the development of YMDD mutations. Combination therapy with ribavirin and pegylated interferon-alpha has revolutionized the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The rate of sustained virological response can now be expected to be as high as nearly 50% for genotype 1 and 80% for non-1 genotypes of hepatitis C.
