OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) resistance to metronidazole among three populations in Yunnan. METHODS: Susceptibilities to metronidazole among 109 H. pylori strains (33 H. pylori strains from Han, 31 H. pylori strains from Bai and 45 H. pylori strains from Naxi ethnic populations) were tested by Epsilometer test (E-test). RESULTS: In 109 H. pylori strains, the overall metronidazole resistance rate was 67.89%. There were no significant difference in the metronidazole resistant rates of H. pylori among Han, Bai, Naxi populations Yunnan in terms of the distribution on age and upper gastroduodenal diseases. In the facet of gender, metronidazole resistant rate of H. pylori was significantly lower in Han males than in females (chi2=5.304, P=0.027), but not seen in the Bai or Naxi peoples. CONCLUSION: Metronidazole resistance rate of H. pyloriin Yunnan was high, but no significant difference was found among Han, Bai, Naxi peoples in the province.
