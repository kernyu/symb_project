The activity of telithromycin and comparator antibacterials was examined in isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), or sinusitis during year 5 (2003-2004) of the Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin global resistance surveillance study. Among S. pneumoniae, penicillin nonsusceptibility and erythromycin resistance were 35.7% and 36.0%, respectively. beta-Lactamase was produced by 12.3% of H. influenzae isolates. beta-Lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains, mainly from Japan, comprised 5.2% of global H. influenzae isolates. Telithromycin and levofloxacin were the most active agents tested against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae (>99% of isolates susceptible) isolated from patients with CAP, AECB, or bacterial sinusitis. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, levofloxacin, and telithromycin were the most active agents against multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae.
