Vancomycin is considered the workhorse for the treatment of most drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. However, concerns have been raised regarding the increasing rates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and the clinical shortcomings of vancomycin in the treatment of invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections. Resources have been committed to the development of antimicrobial agents with activity against these organisms. This review will focus on the newer antibacterial agents that have been developed for the treatment of resistant gram-positive pathogens. Included in this review are the agents: quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, telithromycin, and tigecycline.
