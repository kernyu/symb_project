In this study, the patterns of resistance to 10 antibiotics by 730 Vibrio cholerae non-O1 and non-O139 species isolated from both environmental and seafood samples were investigated. Susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents was assessed by the disc diffusion technique. The frequencies of resistance to 10 antimicrobial agents--ampicillin, chloramphenicol, bacitracin, erythromycin, gentamycin, streptomycin, oxytetracycline, vancomycin, penicillin, and neomycin--were 88, 46, 8, 64, 13, 85, 18, 21, 84, and 18%, respectively. About 10-20% of the studied strains showed a 3-5 multiple drug resistance pattern.
