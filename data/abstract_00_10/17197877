PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus has a significant impact on the natural history of hepatitis B disease with faster rates of progression to cirrhosis and end stage liver disease. An increasing number of hepatitis B virus active drugs are now available, many of which have dual anti-HIV activity. This review highlights the most important recent developments in the management of HIV and hepatitis B virus coinfection. RECENT FINDINGS: Natural history studies continue to confirm the increased rate of liver-related mortality in coinfected individuals and the importance of hepatocellular carcinoma in this population. The most recent studies of adefovir and tenofovir in open label use in coinfected individuals are discussed and new data on the activity of emtricitabine, entecavir and pegylated interferon are presented. Strategies for use of these new options for anti-hepatitis B virus therapy in coinfected individuals are discussed. SUMMARY: Prevention of end stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in the coinfected population is vital and the increasing availability of drugs with potent anti-hepatitis B activity is encouraging. Appropriate diagnosis and monitoring of hepatitis B, coupled with better understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance, will enable clinicians to manage coinfection more effectively.
