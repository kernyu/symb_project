The emerging epidemic of H5N1 avian influenza virus with spillover into the human population in Asia has provoked intense concern globally about the potential of these particularly pathogenic viruses to evolve with the capacity for human-to-human transmission with a consequent pandemic. The availability of antiviral drugs with activity against influenza A viruses and the recognition of drug-resistant variants to these drugs prompted the following report by a select group of the global experts--members of the Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network--on the best use of the available drugs, both for prophylaxis and treatment. The editors of Antiviral Therapy are pleased to be able to provide this document in an expeditious manner.
