Data are limited on outcomes of treatment with extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). This study describes the largest treatment experience of a nonoutbreak series of bloodstream infections caused by strains of Escherichia coli (23 episodes) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (13 episodes) with a ceftazidime minimal inhibitory concentration of > or =2 microg/mL. E. coli isolates produced a greater variety of beta-lactamase types than did K. pneumoniae isolates, among which ESBL production was predominant. Five ESBL types were identified: TEM-12, TEM-71, TEM-6, SHV-12, and SHV-5. Most patients were treated empirically with an ESC-based regimen. A favorable response to treatment with a nonceftazidime ESC was observed when the causative pathogen produced either TEM-6 or TEM-12; ceftazidime treatment was associated with failure of therapy in all patients. Despite the limited clinical success, ESCs are currently not recommended for the treatment of serious infections caused by ESBL-producing strains.
