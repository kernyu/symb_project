BACKGROUND: The CYP2B6-G516T polymorphism has been shown to alter plasma efavirenz (EFV) concentrations in adults. The impact of CYP2B6-G516T polymorphisms on EFV concentrations may be different in children because of differences in liver maturation and drug dosage. METHODS: The CYP2B6-G516T polymorphisms were analyzed in 71 HIV-1-infected children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing EFV for >or=6 months. EFV pharmacokinetics, toxicity profiles, and viral resistance data were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median oral clearance (CL/F) rate was significantly lower in children with the CYP2B6-516-T/T genotype (3.0 L/h/m2, n=13) than in children with the G/T genotype (5.7 L/h/m2, n=30; P=0.02) or the G/G genotype (7.0 L/h/m2, n=31; P=0.003). In children with the CYP2B6-516-G/G genotype, which is associated with higher expression of hepatic CYP2B6, the clearance rate was significantly higher in younger children (<5 years of age) than in older children (>or=5 years of age) (9.7 L/h/m2 vs. 6.6 L/h/m2; P=0.03). No association was found between CYP2B6-G516T polymorphisms and virologic or immunologic responses, toxicity, or the development of viral resistance against EFV. CONCLUSIONS: CYP2B6-G516T polymorphisms significantly affect the CL/F rate of EFV in children. Changes in hepatic enzyme activity by age may need to be considered when evaluating the impact of genetic variants on antiretroviral pharmacokinetics in children.
