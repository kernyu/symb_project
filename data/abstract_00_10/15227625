The effects of therapy with glutamine and alanyl-glutamine on diarrhea and antiretroviral drug levels in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were examined in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in northeast Brazil. Patients with AIDS and with diarrhea and/or wasting were randomized into 4 groups to determine the efficacy of glutamine or high- or low-dose alanyl-glutamine given for 7 days, compared with isonitrogenous glycine given to control subjects. All patients in whom baseline antiretroviral drug levels were determined had low levels 2 h after dosing. Gastrointestinal symptom scores improved with receipt of high-dose alanyl-glutamine (P<.05) or glutamine (P<.01). Antiretroviral drug levels increased in patients given alanyl-glutamine (P=.02) or glutamine (P=.03) by 113% (P=.02) and 14% (P=.01), respectively. Antiretroviral drug resistance mutations were common in all groups. The dose-related efficacy of alanyl-glutamine and glutamine in treating diarrhea and in increasing antiretroviral drug levels shows that these supplements may help to improve therapy for patients with AIDS who have diarrhea and/or wasting in developing, tropical areas.
