Adequate antimicrobial therapy is of crucial importance for the survival of critically ill patients with severe nosocomial infections. Tigecycline is an important therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). A large randomised study (patients with APACHE-II-score >30 excluded/mean APACHE-II-score 6) demonstrated that tigecycline is not inferior to imipenem/cilastatin for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections. However, no case has been reported with microbiological eradication and clinical cure in a patient with septic shock due to peritonitis caused by VRE and treatment with tigecycline monotherapy. Clinical details of a patient suffering from postoperative peritonitis are presented. The patient developed severe septic shock after pancreatic surgery (multiple organ failure, APACHE-II-score 34). As the site of anastomotic leakage was very small and could not be exactly identified, irrigation-suction drains were placed followed by closed postoperative continuous lavage. The pathogen responsible was identified as a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, therefore monotherapy with tigecycline was started which resulted in microbiological response and clinical cure. Tigecycline is a new therapeutic option for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections and from an economic point of view financially rewarding when used as monotherapy.
