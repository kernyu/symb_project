Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains an important pathogen in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients in the current era of antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy, despite the almost complete elimination of CMV disease during the first 3 months after transplantation. Pretransplant CMV serostatus of the donor and/or recipient remains an important risk factor for poor post-transplant outcome, especially in highly immunodeficient patients (e.g. recipients of ex vivo or in vivo T-cell depletion). Prevention of late CMV disease continues to be a challenge in selected high-risk populations, and indirect immunomodulatory effects of CMV (e.g. invasive bacterial and fungal infections) appear to contribute to the poor outcome. The risk of developing antiviral resistance remains low in most patients; however, in a setting of intense immunosuppression (e.g. after transplantation from a haploidentical donor) the incidence may be as high as 8%. Transfusion-transmitted CMV infection can be reduced by the provision of seronegative or leukocyte-depleted blood products; however, a small risk of 1-2% of CMV disease remains. Surveillance and preemptive therapy is effective in preventing transfusion-related CMV disease. The development of new drugs and immunologic strategies (adoptive transfer of CMV-specific T-cells and donor/recipient vaccination strategies) are important goals for the elimination of the negative impact of CMV in the HCT setting.
