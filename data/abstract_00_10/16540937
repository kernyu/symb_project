BACKGROUND: The genetic barrier, defined as the number of mutations required to overcome drug-selective pressure, is an important factor for the development of HIV drug resistance. Because of high variability between subtypes, particular HIV-1 subtypes could have different genetic barriers for drug resistance substitutions. This study compared the genetic barrier between subtypes using some 2000 HIV-1 sequences (>600 of non-B subtype) isolated from anti-retroviral-naive patients in Europe. METHODS: The genetic barrier was calculated as the sum of transitions (scored as 1) and/or transversions (2.5) required for evolution to any major drug resistance substitution. In addition, the number of minor protease substitutions was determined for every subtype. RESULTS: Few dissimilarities were found. An increased genetic barrier was calculated for I82A (subtypes C and G), V108I (subtype G), V118I (subtype G), Q151M (subtypes D and F), L210W (subtypes C, F, G, and CRF02_AG), and P225H (subtype A) (P < 0.001 compared with subtype B). A decreased genetic barrier was found for I82T (subtypes C and G) and V106M (subtype C) (P < 0.001 vs subtype B). Conversely, minor protease substitutions differed extensively between subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the calculated genetic barrier, the rate of drug resistance development may be similar for different HIV-1 subtypes. Because of differences in minor protease substitutions, protease inhibitor resistance could be enhanced in particular subtypes once the relevant major substitutions are selected.
