We developed a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis to evaluate the efficacy of experimental antibacterial compounds for this disease. Experimental infective endocarditis was produced in CD1 mice by intravenous challenge with approximately 6 log10 colony-forming units (CFU) of methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) SA-3529 or -resistant (MRSA) SA-2015 S. aureus 1 d after aortic valve trauma. Valve trauma was produced by introduction of an indwelling 32-gauge polyurethane catheter into the aortic valve via the left carotid artery. Histologic examination of MSSA- and MRSA-infected and catheterized aortic valve sections revealed neutrophilic inflammation and vegetative bacterial colonies encapsulated within fibrin along the aortic valves 1 d after infection. The MSSA or MRSA endocarditis was determined to be catheter-dependent based on catheterized mice exhibiting heart bacterial counts 4 orders of magnitude greater than those seen for noncatheterized mice. The model was validated by using a 3-d regimen of vancomycin at exposures comparable to human dosing (500 microg x h/ml). Vancomycin treatment produced statistically significant reductions of 3.4 and 3.1 log10 CFU/heart for MSSA and MRSA, respectively, relative to controls. This mouse model of endocarditis shows promise in evaluating the predictive efficacy of antibiotics for S. aureus infective endocarditis.
