BACKGROUND: For orthopedic implants, infection is a serious problem. Therefore, we considered an implant with antimicrobial ability can prevent infection. We tried to coat a titanium alloy surface with Novaron, a commercially available inorganic antimicrobial. The purpose of this study was to analyze the differences among the surfaces of materials coated using different processing pressures of the working gas and analysis of the antimicrobial activity. METHODS: One of the inorganic antimicrobials Novaron (grade VZ 600) was applied to titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) plates. This antimicrobial has limited heat resistance, so we used cold spray technology to coat the titanium alloy with it. The principle of cold spray technology is spraying a powder in a high-velocity gas jet, accelerated by adiabatic expansion, against a substrate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) were used to analyze the differences among the surfaces of materials coated using different processing pressures of the working gas. The Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) method (JIS Z2801: 2000) was used to analyze the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Antimicrobial activity was analyzed only for the sample coated at 3.0 MPa. RESULTS: The SEM and EDS results indicated that when the pressure of the working gas was increased, the antimicrobial coated the titanium adequately. This material showed good effects against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa and some effect for K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial implants represent a preventive method against infection. There is a possibility of using them not only for clean operations but also for operations with suspected bacterial contamination, such as fixation of slight compound fractures.
