Resistance to antibacterial agents has increased among many species of bacterial pathogens in the last two decades. While this has been recognized and has been a matter of concern among those concerned with infectious diseases, it is only relatively recently that prescribing physicians have become aware of the problem. A range of official bodies, both national and international, have proposed a range of strategies for controlling this increase in resistance. The relationship between resistance and clinical efficacy or failure is unclear in many areas, although increasingly resistance can be seen to be associated with a less than optimal clinical response. Although the relationship between antibiotic use and resistance is complex, there is an assumption that excessive use of antibacterials may drive an increase in resistance. The term 'prudent prescribing' is frequently used in official documents, but it is not easy for the prescriber to determine exactly what is prudent prescribing. There have been efforts to reduce the unnecessary use of antibacterials in the treatment of many community respiratory infections where the etiological agent is likely to be viral. Guidelines for prescribing have been drawn up by governments and professional societies but their impact can be variable. They need to take account of the changing patterns of resistance, for example the rise in high-level penicillin resistance among pneumococci. They also need to be readily accessible to the practicing clinician. Surveillance systems are available in abundance and these may be local, national, or international. They often, however, suffer from drawbacks and are frequently selective. Frequently the prescriber does not have ready access to the most appropriate data. Integrated strategies to control resistance are urgently needed, as are improved rapid diagnostic facilities.
