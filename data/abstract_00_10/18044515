The consumption of polluted surface water for domestic and recreational purposes by large populations in developing nations is a major cause of diarrheal disease related mortality. The river Ganga and its tributaries meet 40% of the water requirement for drinking and irrigation in India. In this study, Escherichia coli isolates (n=75) of the river Ganga water were investigated for resistance to antimicrobial agents (n=15) and virulence genes specific to shiga toxin (STEC) and enterotoxin producing E. coli (ETEC). E. coli isolates from the river Ganga water exhibit resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. The distribution of antimicrobial agent resistance in E. colivaries significantly (chi2: 81.28 at df = 24, p < 0.001) between the sites. Both stx1 and stx2 genes were present in 82.3% of STEC (n=17) while remaining isolates possess either stxl (11.8%) or stx2 (5.9%). The presence of eaeA, hlyA, and chuA genes was observed in 70.6, 88.2, and 58.8% of STEC, respectively. Both LT1 and ST1 genes were positive in 66.7% of ETEC (n=15) while 33.3% of isolates harbor only LT1 gene. The prevalence of multi-antimicrobial-agent resistant E. coli in the river Ganga water poses increased risk of infections in the human population.
