The use of developed additional criteria for efficiency in the performed analysis has demonstrated that the most optimal duration of inpatient treatment regime I is 90 and 120 doses. Only the administration of 120 doses substantially reduces the number of caverns in multiple destructions and causes positive X-ray changes in complicated tuberculosis, which justifies the planning of inpatient treatment regimen I in patients with multiple lung tissue decay and complicated tuberculosis until 120 doses are used. The employment of additional criteria makes it possible to show the results of inpatient treatment in patients with drug resistance and justifies the leng of hospital stay until 120-150 doses are administered.
