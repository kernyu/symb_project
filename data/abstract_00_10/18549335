BACKGROUND: Infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (including Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) are being reported with increasing frequency from various parts of the world. OBJECTIVE: To share personal perspectives on the clinical use of colistin based on the available evidence reported in the literature as well as on knowledge obtained through our clinical experience with the use of colistin in a considerable number of patients during the past 7 years. METHODS: Literature review and personal experience. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: During the last decade, clinicians in several countries have resorted to colistin (polymyxin E), an antibiotic that has been shown to be clinically effective and acceptably safe for intravenous, aerosolized, and intrathecal/intraventricular administration. However, more data are needed to answer important clinical questions, including the appropriate colistin dosage, comparison of colistin monotherapy with combination therapy, and the possible preventive and therapeutic role of aerosolized colistin.
