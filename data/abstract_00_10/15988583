This research reports the sensitivity of a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis to sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate (sarkosyl) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), as well as the efficiency of these detergents in curing the strain. Compared to Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis was very sensitive to both detergents, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for the latter being 100 times lower than for Escherichia coli. The clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis used in this study exhibited plasmid-borne resistance to kanamycin (MIC 2 mg/ml) and tetracycline (MIC 50 mug/ml); 3% curing was observed after growth in the presence of sarkosyl but no curing was observed after growth in the presence of either SDS or acridine orange. In contrast, 35% curing of plasmid-bearing Escherichia coli was observed after growth in the presence of either SDS or acridine orange, but none was observed after growth in the presence of sarkosyl.
