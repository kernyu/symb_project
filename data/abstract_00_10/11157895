Clinical outcome is dependent upon antibiotic-mediated bacterial eradication in a number of infections. However, in respiratory tract infections, the need for bacterial eradication has been controversial. Clinical data are now available that support the need for active bacterial eradication in otitis media. This may also be the case for other respiratory tract infections. An increase in antimicrobial resistance reduces the probability of achieving eradication. Conversely, failure to eradicate bacteria may promote the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant clones. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters can be used to predict the bacteriological efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. In conclusion, the aim of antimicrobial therapy in respiratory tract infections should be the eradication of the infecting organism.
