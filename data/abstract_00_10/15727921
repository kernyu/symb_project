The efficacy of a topical preparation containing 0.5% fusidic acid and 0.1% betamethasone-17-valerate was compared to a systemic therapy (comprising a combination of parenteral dexamethasone and oral clavulanate-potentiated amoxycillin) in the treatment of 104 dogs with acute moist dermatitis. Significant improvement was evident after seven days in both treatment groups in all clinical parameters assessed and there was no significant difference in the overall response between the two treatment groups. Staphylococcus intermedius was the most frequently isolated organism from swabs at the first visit (Day 0). No resistance to fusidic acid or clavulanate-potentiated amoxycillin was encountered. The study demonstrates no difference in the clinical improvement achieved in canine acute moist dermatitis following topical or systemic therapy and that both treatment regimes represent effective treatment options for the condition.
