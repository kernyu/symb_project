Phenolic acids that are present in plant-soil ecosystems can be considered as toxins which induce specific stress responses in microorganisms. In this paper, we have analyzed the global response of the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis to salicylic acid using proteomics and transcriptomics. The results demonstrate that salicylic acid caused predominantly the induction of the SigmaB-dependent general stress response in B. subtilis which is not related to the acidic conditions. Treatment of B. subtilis with growth-inhibitory concentrations of 4 mM salicylic acid caused protein damage in B. subtilis as reflected by the induction of the CtsR and Spx regulons. Both phenolic acid decarboxylases (pads) of B. subtilis padC and bsdBCD (yclBCD) were induced by 4 mM salicylic acid that were previously shown to be involved in decarboxylation and detoxification of different phenolic acids. Deletion of the putative LysR-type regulator encoded by the divergently transcribed bsdA (yclA) gene upstream of the bsdBCD operon revealed that BsdA is the transcriptional activator of bsdBCD expression in response to salicylic acid. Phenotype analysis of bsdA and padC single and double mutants demonstrated that both pads confer resistance to salicylic acid in B. subtilis.
