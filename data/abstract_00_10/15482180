The management of anaerobic infection needs to be prompt and appropriate in order to ensure recovery. Management includes the use of hyperbaric oxygen, surgical methods and antimicrobial therapy. Various factors, such as efficacy, bacterial antimicrobial resistance, ability to reach appropriate antimicrobial levels at the infected site, toxicity and stability need to be taken into account in choosing antimicrobial agents. Some antimicrobials have poor activity against anaerobic bacteria. The more suitable agents include penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, metronidazole, macrolides, glycopeptides, tetracyclines and quinolones.
