This study was undertaken to evaluate the in vitro activities of arbekacin-based combination regimens against vancomycin hetero-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hetero-VISA). Combinations of arbekacin with vancomycin, rifampin, ampicillin-sulbactam, teicoplanin, or quinupristin-dalfopristin against seven hetero-VISA strains and two methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains were evaluated by the time-kill assay. The combinations of arbekacin with vancomycin, teicoplanin, or ampicillin-sulbactam showed the synergistic interaction against hetero-VISA strains. Data suggest that these arbekacin-based combination regimens may be useful candidates for treatment options of hetero-VISA infections.
