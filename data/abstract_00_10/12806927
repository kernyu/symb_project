Cytotoxic effect and guinea pig wound cure stage, pus fabrication presence in infected wound were compared with strong acidic electrolyzed water (AcEW) and povidone-iodine solution (PVP-I), chlorhexidine (CHG) and benzalkonium chloride (BAC). It gave the following results: In a cytotoxic test, the toxicity was recognized in 0.1%-0.01% PVP-I, in 0.0002-0.0004% CHG, in 10-0.1 micrograms/ml BAC, but there was no toxicity in AcEW. By a guinea pig wound cure process, no significance was recognized between each pharmaceutical agent in epidermal cell migration, but by an inflammation locus area, the significance was considerable in comparison with no-treatment. The pyopoiesis of P. aeruginosa infected wound was recognized in a ratio of 38.2% physiological saline, 27.3% CHG, 20.6% PVP-I and 12.1% AcEW. When pollution locus includes an infection image of bacteria, while draining AcEW instead of physiological saline, disinfection, indication was expected, and, as for the disorder in cure stage. I do not agree with that mentioned above. As for AcEW, availability by organism use was recognized for the cytotoxic effect of antiseptic instead of action of acceleration for wound cure.
