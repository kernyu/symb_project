(1) Maraviroc belongs to a new class of antiretroviral drugs designed to block entry of HIV-1 into CD4+ T-cells via the CCR5 coreceptor. It is indicated for combination therapy in treatment-experienced adults infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 that is resistant to multiple antiretroviral agents. (2) Results from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that in treatment experienced patients, maraviroc, combined with optimized background therapy (OBT), significantly decreases the level of HIV-1 RNA in the blood (viral load) when compared with OBT alone. The number of patients achieving undetectable viral loads and CD4+ cell count increases were also significantly higher in those receiving maraviroc. (3) Most patients experiencing treatment failure with maraviroc exhibit tropism changes from CCR5-tropic to CXCR4-using virus, but there is no evidence of disease progression. (4) Adverse effects reported with maraviroc include cough, fever, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, muscle and joint pain, abdominal pain, and postural hypotension (dizziness). No significant increases in cardiovascular events, hepatotoxicity, infections or malignancies have been reported with short-term maraviroc therapy. Several post-marketing studies will assess maraviroc's long-term safety for immune function, liver function, malignancy, cardiac events, and risks associated with changes in tropism. (5) Results from an ongoing trial in treatment naive patients suggest that maraviroc may not be superior in terms of viral suppression to standard therapy, but may significantly increase the number of CD4+ T-cells.
