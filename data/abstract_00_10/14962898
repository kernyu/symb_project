The antibody-targeted therapeutic, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, Mylotarg), is approved for treatment of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We previously showed that AML blasts from GO refractory patients frequently express the drug transporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and/or multidrug resistance protein (MRP). We also previously reported that inhibition of drug transport by the Pgp modulator, cyclosporine A (CSA), can increase GO sensitivity in Pgp(+) AML cells and that the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, PK11195, sensitizes AML cells to standard chemotherapeutics both by inhibiting Pgp-mediated efflux and by promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. We now show that PK11195 also can overcome multiple resistance mechanisms to increase GO sensitivity in AML cells, including resistance associated with expression of drug transporters and/or antiapoptotic proteins. PK11195 substantially increases GO cytotoxicity in AML cells from many different cell lines and primary patient samples, often more effectively than CSA. We also show that PK11195 is nontoxic in NOD/SCID mice and can sensitize xenografted human AML cells to GO. Since PK11195 is well tolerated in humans as a single agent, its further study as a multifunctional chemosensitizer for anti-AML therapies, including GO-based therapies, is warranted.
