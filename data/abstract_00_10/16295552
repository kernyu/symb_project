The present prospective study was carried out to determine the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci isolated from clinical samples in a tertiary care hospital of North India. Enterococcus species isolated from blood, urine, pus, sterile fluids and the hospital environment from October 2003 to January 2004 were identified by standard biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method as per NCCLS guidelines. Out of a total of 105 Enterococcus species recovered during the study period, E. faecium (42.90%) and E. faecalis (40.00%) constituted the predominant isolates. Enterococcus faecium was the commonest blood culture isolate while E. faecalis predominated pus and urine samples. Other species isolated were E. mundtii, E dispar, E. durans, E. avium, E. raffinosus and E. gallinarum. High-level aminoglycoside resistance was detected in 73.3% of isolates. Resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid was not detected. Prevalence of a wide variety of Enterococcus species in clinical samples together with their variable antimicrobial susceptibility patterns emphasizes the need for routinely carrying out detailed speciation and in vitro susceptibility testing of enterococcal isolates in the clinical bacteriology laboratory.
