Seventy-four strains representing the four species of the genus Dialister were isolated from various clinical samples. Dialister pneumosintes and Dialister micraerophilus were the two mainly encountered species. Fifty-five isolates were tested against 14 antimicrobial agents. Decreased susceptibilities to piperacillin, metronidazole, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and rifampin were demonstrated. The clinical impact of these decreased susceptibilities remains to be investigated but should prompt microbiologists to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing for clinically important Dialister spp.
