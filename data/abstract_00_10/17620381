The in vivo efficacy of the novel polymeric guanidine AKACID Plus was evaluated in a guinea pig model of experimental skin infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Topical application of AKACID Plus at concentrations of > or =0.5% was as effective as mupirocin 2% cream in the treatment of superficial skin infection with MRSA.
