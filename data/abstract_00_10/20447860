A pandemic influenza A/H1N1v strain with the neuraminidase H274Y mutation was detected in nasal secretions of a 2-year-old leukemic patient with influenza-like illness after 18 days of treatment with oseltamivir. At baseline, no drug-resistant virus was found, while 4 days after treatment initiation a mixture of wild-type and mutated virus was detected. After treatment interruption, the wild type influenza virus re-emerged and became prevalent in nasal secretions after a few days, suggesting the lower fitness of the mutated virus strain. The patient slowly improved concurrently with a decrease in virus load, which resulted negative 42 days after diagnosis. No other drug-resistant influenza A/H1N1v virus strains have been detected in Italy (up to the end of November 2009) since the first case of the novel A/H1N1v virus was identified in the country (May 2009).
