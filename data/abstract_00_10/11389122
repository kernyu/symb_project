The in vitro and pharmacodynamic effects of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae were compared with six other fluoroquinolones. Organisms included penicillin-susceptible (54) and penicillin-non-susceptible (145) isolates from 1998-1999. Moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin demonstrated the greatest in vitro activity, with MIC90s of 0.13 mg/L, followed by trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin > gatifloxacin, sparfloxacin > levofloxacin > ciprofloxacin. There was no difference in fluoroquinolone activity between penicillin-susceptible and -non-susceptible strains. Pharmacodynamic analysis using published pharmacokinetic information indicates that all the agents tested except ciprofloxacin had an AUC/MIC90 > 30, with moxifloxacin having the greatest free-drug availability.
