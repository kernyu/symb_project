The time of the settlement of leprosy in Mexico is uncertain, however recent studies pointed out that leprosy was probably brought by Asian's migration at about 12,000 years ago and not by the Europeans conquerors during XVI and XVII centuries. Registration of leprosy has been done since the colonial era and the disease was considered as a public health problem until the year 2004 in Mexico when the incidence was achieved to be less than 1 per 10,000 as defined by the world health organization (WHO). Although the national epidemiological parameters like prevalence show the leprosy are controlled well, there are still 49 prefectures with higher prevalence in Mexico. In addition, the incidence in last 10 years has not been stably reduced, in other words the infection cycle has not been interrupted. Therefore, it is necessary to keep the careful epidemiological monitoring, and to increase the search and follow-up of new cases and their contacts in order to eliminate leprosy in this country.
