Multiple methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones carrying type IV staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec were identified in the community-acquired MRSA strains of both the United States and Australia. They multiplied much faster than health-care-associated MRSA and were resistant to fewer non-beta-lactam antibiotics. They seem to have been derived from more diverse S. aureus populations than health-care-associated MRSA strains.
