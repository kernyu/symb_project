An 8-year-old girl with acute leukemia had bacteremia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae producing CTX-M-2-type broad spectrum beta-lactamase. K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli strains producing the same enzyme and harboring identical conjugative plasmids were recovered from stoor culture. Patients with frequent episodes of neutropenia and prophylactic administration of beta-lactams are at risk of harboring colonizing strains that produce broad spectrum beta-lactamases.
