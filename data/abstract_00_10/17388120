The paper deals with genotype peculiarities of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains circulating in the South region of Ukraine. The total of 93 M. tuberculosis strains isolated from patients with various forms of pulmonary tuberculosis from Odessa and Nikolaev Regions in the South of Ukraine were genotyped using internationally approved protocol of spoligotyping. The method is based on studying polymorphism of spacers within the region of direct replications in M. tuberculosis chromosome. Relatively high percentage of clasterized strains (59.6% to 65.9%) proves high levels of recent transmission of tuberculosis in Southern Ukraine. Prevalence of Beijing family strains, which have been previously demonstrated to be associated with high levels of drug resistance, was different in Odessa and Nikolaev Regions (51.9% and 17.0%, respectively), and turned to be lower than in a majority of regions in Russia. Other epidemiological groups were represented by the family strains T1, LAM1, LAM4, LAM5, S and Haarlem. An urgent need in the large-scale investigations in the field of molecular epidemiology of TB agent under the spread of epidemic was demonstrated.
