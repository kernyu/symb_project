The amount of tooth structure that remains after endodontic therapy and post preparation is of prime importance as the strength and resistance to root fracture of an endodontically treated tooth is directly related to the amount of residual dentine. The desired post diameter is determined by tooth morphology and the endodontic procedures (for root canal debridement) with the aim being to avoid removing too much tooth structure. Increasing the diameter of the post does not provide a significant increase in the retention of the post; it only increases the stiffness of the post at the expense of the remaining dentine and the fracture resistance of the root. There is little indication for increasing the post width beyond the endodontic cleaning and shaping procedures for all post systems. The post diameter needs to be controlled to preserve the radicular dentine, reduce the potential for perforations, and permit the tooth to resist fracture. However, endodontic treatment often involves wide flared canals where cast posts are the standard method of treatment. These thin-walled canals are then further compromised by the placement of a tapered cast post--thus increasing its risk for fracturing. The Luminex light, transmitting posts provide an alternative treatment option by strengthening weakened, endodontically treated teeth by the combined bonding action of dentine bonding agents and composite resin restorative material. The paper reports on a case where a wide flared root canal was rehabilitated with composite resin using a light-transmitting post.
