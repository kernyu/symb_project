Salmonella enterica serotype Newport is an important cause of salmonellosis, with strains increasingly being resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. The increase is associated with the acquisition of multiple resistance genes. This study characterizes the genetic basis of resistance of serotype Newport isolates collected from veterinary sources by PCR and DNA sequencing analysis.
