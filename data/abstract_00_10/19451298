A qnrS1-positive strain of Escherichia coli was detected among 73 poultry isolates showing ciprofloxacin MICs of > or =0.125 microg/ml. The qnrS1 gene was associated with a Tn3-like transposon, as previously described to occur in a Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis strain of animal origin, but the plasmid scaffold carrying this element resembled that of a plasmid previously identified in Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin. These elements suggest genetic exchanges among Salmonella and E. coli and a potential animal reservoir for the qnr genes.
