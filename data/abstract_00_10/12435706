Seven Klebsiella pneumoniae and four Klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolates with different levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin were studied. Mutations in the topoisomerase genes were found in almost all strains, but the contribution of a multidrug efflux system homologous to AcrAB in Escherichia coli was also observed. Overexpression of this efflux system was demonstrated by immunoblotting with antibodies against E. coli AcrA.
