A total of 714 samples consisting of faeces, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, abdominal and diaphragmatic muscles (each 119) were collected from November 2001 to April 2002 from apparently healthy slaughtered camels (Camelus dromedarius) in eastern Ethiopia. One hundred sixteen (16.2%) Salmonella strains belonging to 16 different serovars were isolated. All Salmonella strains isolated were examined for antimicrobial resistance to 17 selected antimicrobials. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined by the microdilution broth test. Fifty-two (44.8%) of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Thirty-nine of the 52 (75%) resistant Salmonella serovars exhibited multiple resistance to up to eight different antimicrobials. Among the serovars tested, S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg, S. Braenderup and S. Hadar displayed multiple resistance mainly to streptomycin (35.3%), spectinomycin (28.4%), sulfamethoxazole (25.0%), ampicillin (24.1%), trimethoprim (22.4%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (18.9%), tetracycline (12.9%) and colistin (11.2%). All Salmonella strains tested were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, kanamycin and neomycin. The present study showed the importance of camels as a potential source of single and multiple resistant Salmonella strains to different antimicrobials that are also used in the public health sector for the treatment of different bacterial diseases in Ethiopia.
