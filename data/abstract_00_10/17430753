Strains of community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) have emerged as an important group of pathogens. Most infections present as cutaneous abscess and most of these may respond to drainage alone. Sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics remain valuable agents for most CA-MRSA infections, but inducible resistance to clindamycin is problematic in some areas. Linezolid, and the newer parenteral antibiotics should be reserved for serious infections.
