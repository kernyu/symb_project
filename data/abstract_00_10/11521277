We investigated the drug susceptibilities of Neisseria gonorrhoeae by using 98 strains of clinical isolates at Toho University Omori Hospital from 1994 to 1998. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of 15 antimicrobial agents were determined with agar dilution methods according to the guidelines of NCCLS. Among these isolates, only 4 strains (4.1%) were found to be penicillinase producing N. gonorrhoeae. Ceftriaxone showed the most potent activity of which MICs of all strains were 0.06 microgram/ml or less. Macroride antimicrobial agents and minocycline also showed strong activities of which MICs of most of the strains were 0.06 microgram/ml or less. With the criteria of NCCLS, 10 strains (10.2%) were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin and these 10 strains also showed cross resistance to other fluoroquiolones we tested. Our results also revealed that the number of resistant strains against fluoroquiolones abruptly increased from 1996 and indicate the needs of further surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae.
