OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for drug-resistant tuberculosis among migratory population in Shanghai. METHODS: All sputum culture positive patients among migratory population, confirmed at any district (county) tuberculosis dispensary in Shanghai from February 2004 to January 2005, were enrolled. The drug susceptibility test was performed by the proportion method. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to determine the risk factors associated with drug resistance. RESULTS: 493 patients were enrolled during the study period, among whom 431 patients had bacterial identification and drug susceptibility results. Of the 431 strains, 427 (99.1%) strains were Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 4 (0.9%) strains were Mycobacterium non-tuberculosis. The prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis among new cases and re-treatment cases was 16.0% (62/387) and 40.0% (16/40), respectively. The prevalence of MDR-tuberculosis among new cases and re-treatment cases was 4.1% (16/387) and 22.5% (9/40), respectively. A history of previous treatment for tuberculosis and age group of 45 - 60 years were significantly associated with drug resistance. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis among migratory population was relatively high in Shanghai, suggesting the necessity to strengthen the tuberculosis control program for migratory population.
