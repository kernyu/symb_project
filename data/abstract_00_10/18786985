The treatment of concurrent HIV and tuberculosis (TB) in children <3 years of age has not been well-studied and is complicated by potential drug-drug interactions. The recommended antiretroviral therapy (ART) in coinfected children in South Africa consists of full-strength ritonavir, lamivudine and stavudine. We report on a child initiated on this regimen, during concurrent TB treatment, who promptly developed an adverse reaction, virologic failure and dual-class antiretroviral drug resistance, compromising subsequent salvage ART.
