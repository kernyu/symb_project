We describe the activities of the Croatian Committee for Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance and report surveillance results for 1999. Twenty-two Croatian microbiology laboratories participated in the study. Resistance rates for the organisms isolated in different centers varied widely, but certain trends were apparent. Penicillin resistance in pneumococci (38%), methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (22%), the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases by Klebsiella pneumoniae (21%), and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%) represent major resistance problems, especially in large hospitals. A comprehensive system of antimicrobial resistance surveillance, combined with training and external quality control programs, has identified high rates of resistance in key pathogens in some regions of Croatia. The program has heightened awareness of the problems of antimicrobial resistance and contributed to ongoing improvements in laboratory practice.
