PURPOSE: Klebsiella pneumoniae is considered an important pathogen causing nosocomial and community-acquired infections and is often associated with the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) belonging to SHV and CTX-M families, which are frequently described as a part of complex integrons, facilitate their horizontal transfer to other related as well as unrelated microbes. The present study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence and characterization of integrons among K pneumoniae isolates producing ESBL in a tertiary referral hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 136 clinical isolates of K pneumoniae were investigated for the presence of ESBL. Their ESBL genes were characterized by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Integrase gene PCR was performed to detect the presence of integron. The isolates were further typed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). RESULT: Out of 136 K pneumoniae isolates, 63 (46%) were confirmed to be ESBL producers. SHV (68%) and CTX-M (67%) ESBL genes were the most common in our study. Of the 63 ESBL-positive isolates, 58 (92%) strains carried integrons; 52 strains (82%) carried only class 1 integron, whereas 6 (9%) isolates harboured both class 2 integrons and the class 1 gene. However, in ESBL negatives, only 29 (40%) strains were positive for class 1 integron and none for class 2 integron. CONCLUSION: The presence of class 2 integron amongst ESBL-producing K pneumoniae is being described for the first time in this part of the world. The findings of this study strongly suggest that integrons have a role in the dissemination of ESBL-mediated resistance among the nosocomial isolates of K pneumonia.
