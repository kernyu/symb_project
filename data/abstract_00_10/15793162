Among 128 Streptococcus gallolyticus (Streptococcus bovis) isolates, 77.7% were resistant to tetracyclines and contained tet(M) and/or tet(L) and/or tet(O). A total of 59.4% had macrolide resistance and contained erm(B) and, rarely, mef(A). Among the one-third of isolates highly resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin, most harbored aphA3 and aad-6 genes.
