Human autoimmune uveitis is a heterogeneous group of potentially blinding ocular diseases in which most patients who exhibit immunity recognize the same retinal Ag. It is represented by the model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) induced in mice by immunization with retinal Ag in CFA. Murine EAU is characterized by a Th1/Th17 response pattern, which may not represent all types of human uveitis. We report in this study a new model of EAU induced by injection of matured dendritic cells loaded with a uveitogenic retinal peptide. Dendritic cell-induced EAU demonstrated unique characteristics compared with traditional EAU in terms of clinical manifestations, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrating cells, the cytokine response profile, and a strict requirement for IFN-gamma, whereas IL-17 appeared to play a minor role. Disease was self-limiting, but could be reinduced with the same Ag in CFA, albeit with reduced severity, suggesting post-recovery resistance. Our study demonstrates in a disease setting that the context in which the same autoantigen is initially presented to the immune system precipitates distinct forms of pathology via a distinct pathogenic pathway on the same genetic background. These findings may shed new light on the complex biology and the heterogeneous nature of human uveitis, and provide an alternative model for uveitic diseases of immune origin.
