In the absence of HIV infection, changes in adipose tissue and lipid levels, HIV protease inhibitor therapy increases fasting glucose levels,suggestive of hepatic insulin resistance. After 4 weeks of indinavir treatment in nine HIV-negative healthy men, fasting glucose production and glycogenolysis were significantly increased. During the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, indinavir blunted the ability of insulin to suppress glucose production. Therefore, indinavir worsens hepatic insulin sensitivity, increasing endogenous glucose production.
