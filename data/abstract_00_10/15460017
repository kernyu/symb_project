Cell walls in 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus 209P, i.e. actinomycin D susceptible and resistant ones were comparatively investigated. The resistant cells contained much more wall material per a unit of the biomass weight vs the susceptible strain cells, that conformed to thickening of the resistant cell walls detected by electron microscopy and a sharp increase of their electron density. Investigation of peptidoglycans and teichoic acids did not reveal any significant alterations in the structure of the wall components in the actinomycin D resistant cells. Only some increase of glucosamine in the peptidoglycan fraction of the resistant cells vs the susceptible ones was observed. It was shown that preparations of the resistant cell walls and peptidoglycan isolated from the resistant cells were able to bind somewhat lower quantities of actinomycin D vs the analogous preparations of the susceptible cells. The significant decrease of the antibiotic binding by live cells of the resistant strain probably slightly depended on the structure characteristics of the main wall components. The barrier properties of the walls in resistant staphylococci are most likely defined by the wall thickening and consolidation while adapting to actinomycin D.
