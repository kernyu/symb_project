Dalbavancin, tested against 146 staphylococci, was more potent than other drugs tested, with an MIC at which 50% of staphylococci were inhibited of 0.03 microg/ml and an MIC at which 90% of staphylococci were inhibited of 0.06 microg/ml by microdilution. For all strains, MICs of vancomycin, linezolid, ranbezolid, oritavancin, daptomycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were </=4.0 microg/ml. Dalbavancin was bactericidal at four times the MIC against all six strains tested.
