Transgenic plants with introduced pest-resistant gene offer an efficient alternative insect control. The novel insect-resistant gene combination, chitinase(chi) and BmkIT(Bmk), containing an insect-specific chitinase gene and a scorpion insect toxin gene was introduced into Brassica napus cultivar via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Fifty-seven regenerated plantlets with kanamycin-resistance were obtained. Transgenic plants were verified by Southern blot analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and bioassay of artificial inoculation with diamondback moth (Plutella maculipenis) (DBM) larvae indicated that some of the transgenic plants were high-level expression for both chitinase and scorpion toxin proteins and performed high resistance against the tested pest infestation. The genetic analysis of T(1) progeny confirmed that the inheritance of introduced genes followed the Mendelian rules.
