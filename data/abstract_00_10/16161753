For the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, Banan), MICs of oral cephem antibacterials including CPDX against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 1,091 isolates of 22 species were tested, 993 isolates of the same 22 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 1,115 isolates of the same 22 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CPDX were observed against most of the species in these surveillances spanning three years and in comparison with that in the studies conducted before Banan was launched. In the study, CPDX as well as other cephem antibacterials showed a gradual decrease in activity against all the strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in proportion to the increase in the incidence rates of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR). A small percentage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are high-resistant strains, were isolated. The findings of this surveillance indicate that it is necessary to pay careful attention to the trends of resistant bacteria such as PRSP, BLNAR, and ESBL-producing strains.
