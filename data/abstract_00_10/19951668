Since 2000's, community extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing bacteria have spread worldwide, i.e. mostly Escherichia coli that produce ESBL such as CTX-M enzymes. Previous cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones usage are the two most frequent risk factors identified in patients that harbor ESBL-producing bacteria. In addition surveys have shown an alarming trend of associated resistance to others classes of antimicrobial agents among isolates. The emergence of ESBL-producing isolates limits the therapeutic options considerably. For serious systemic infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria, carbapenems should be regarded as drugs of choice. Preventing the spread and appropriately managing these infections caused by community acquired ESBL producing bacteria have become mandatory.
