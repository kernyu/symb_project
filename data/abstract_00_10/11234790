BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Cuban Ministry of Public Health plans to implement the syndromic approach to sexually transmitted diseases in persons with urethral or vaginal syndrome in Cuba using 500 mg ciprofloxacin as therapy. Although the emergence of clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin have been sporadically detected in Cuba, there has been no report of isolates that exhibited significant resistance to this drug. This is the first report of the isolation of a N gonorrhoeae strain resistant to ciprofloxacin in Cuba. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the need for awareness regarding the potential emergence of a clinically significant resistance of N gonorrhoeae in Cuba. There is a need for continued antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance of Cuban isolates to ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones.
