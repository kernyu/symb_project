Susceptibility (18 antimicrobial agents including high-dose tobramycin) and checkerboard synergy (23 combinations) studies were performed for 2,621 strains of Burkholderia cepacia complex isolated from 1,257 cystic fibrosis patients. Minocycline, meropenem, and ceftazidime were the most active, inhibiting 38%, 26%, and 23% of strains, respectively. Synergy was rarely noted (range, 1% to 15% of strains per antibiotic combination).
