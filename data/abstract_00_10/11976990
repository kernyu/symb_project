OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety profile and efficacy of salvage regimens containing amprenavir (APV) 600 mg twice daily and ritonavir (RTV) 200 mg twice daily. DESIGN: Prospective, single-center study. METHOD: The patient database of the department of infectious diseases was screened for patients who had failed at least two successive three-drug combinations. These patients were proposed to take APV and RTV in association with two to four other drugs. They were followed monthly for 6 months. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included. They had been previously treated for 70 +/- 23 months. At baseline, viral load (VL) was 4.86 +/- 0.98 log10 copies/mL and CD4 187 +/- 145 10(6)/L. On week 24, using intent-to-treat analysis, VL decreased to 2.95 +/- 1.59 log10 copies/mL and CD4 increased to 365 +/- 210 10(6)/L. Nine patients (53%) had a VL < 2.3 log10 copies/mL. The most common adverse events were grade 1 or 2 diarrhea and an increase of cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Mean APV trough concentration was 1727 +/- 1749 ng/mL on week 24. CONCLUSION: These data show that the combination of low-dose RTV and reduced doses of APV is safe. This combination can be added to nonnucleoside analogs.
