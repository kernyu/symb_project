OBJECTIVE: To perform the molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MRSH) clinical isolates from patients in a Mexican hospital. METHODS: Sixty three Staphylococcus ssp. isolates collected from September 2000 to October 2002 were analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method and the presence of the mecA gene was detected by PCR technique. Isolates characterization was carried out by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The frequency of S. haemolyticus was 25.5% (18 of 63 clinical isolates), all S. haemolyticus isolates were methicillin-resistant and they were positive for the mecA gene. A major pattern (A) with 8 subtypes was identified. This clone was distributed during the 20 months period. Most of them were isolated from the surgery (55%) and pediatric services (27.5%). CONCLUSION: The methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus permanence as pathogen in this hospital, suggest the implementation of control programs in order to decrease the prevalence of this multiresistant pathogen.
