The oxidative stress-sensitive c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is known to be activated in diabetic condition and is involved in the progression of insulin resistance. However, the effect of antioxidants on JNK pathway and insulin resistance has not been investigated. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of antioxidants on redox balance, insulin sensitivity, and JNK pathway in high-fat-fed rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: the control group - received a rodent chow; control+antioxidant group - fed with rodent chow supplemented with 0.2% (w/w) vitamin E, 0.3% (w/w) vitamin C, and 0.5% (w/w) alpha-lipoic acid; high-fat group - received high-fat diet; and high fat+antioxidant group - fed with high-fat diet supplemented with above antioxidants. Fat feeding to rats for 9 weeks significantly increased IRS-1 serine phoshorylation, reduced insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin sensitivity. High-fat diet also impaired redox balance and activated the redox-sensitive serine kinase - JNK pathway. Antioxidant supplementation along with high-fat diet preserved the free radical defense system, inhibited the activation of JNK pathway, and improved insulin signaling and insulin sensitivity. The present study shows for the first time that antioxidants inhibit JNK pathway and IRS-1 serine phosphorylation while improving insulin sensitivity in fat-fed rats. These findings implicate the beneficial effect of antioxidants in obesity-/dyslipidemia-induced insulin resistance in humans.
