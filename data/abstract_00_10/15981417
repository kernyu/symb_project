Eight spontaneous mutants of Streptomyces roseosporus resistant to spectinomycin (SpcR) were mapped to distinct transversions or deletions in the rpsE gene. Most of the mutations were strongly recessive to the wild type SpcS allele. This suggests that some SpcR alleles of rpsE may be useful in a spectinomycin based counter-selection system.
