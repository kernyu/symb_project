Multidrug-resistance efflux pumps - in particular those belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell-division (RND) family of transporters, with their unusually high degree of substrate promiscuity - significantly restrict the effectiveness of antibacterial therapy. Recent years have heralded remarkable insights into the structure and mechanisms of these fascinating molecular machines. Here, we review recent advances in the field and describe various approaches used in combating efflux-mediated resistance.
