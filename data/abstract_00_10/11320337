The fungistatic and fungicidal activities of five quaternary ammonium compounds towards Candida and Cryptococcus strains were determined using a bacteriological method adapted to mycological experiments. It could be deduced from this study that Cryptococcus in spite of the capsule around the cell were more sensitive than Candida and that the benzethonium chloride (BC) exhibited the most effective action against the whole yeasts. No resistance appeared, only Cryptococcus strain was less sensitive than the others.
