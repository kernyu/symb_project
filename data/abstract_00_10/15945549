The data on antibiotic resistance of the main uropathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infection in an urologic department (319 isolates) and outpatient and diagnostic units (360 isolates) are presented. It was shown that by the antibiotic resistance the Escherichia coli isolates from the urologic department patients and outpatients did not practically differ: 44.1 and 47.8% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 26.7 and 23.4% were resistant to amoxycillin/clavulanate, 28.9 and 24.9% were resistant to co-trimoxazole and 26.5% was resistance to cefuroxime (outpatients). The basic differences referred to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: resistance to ceftazidime in 38.5% of the isolates and resistance to gentamicin in 36.2% of the isolates. The activity against P. aeruginosa could be arranged as follows in the decreasing order: amikacin = meropenem > imipenem > cefepime = cefoperazone/sulbactam > gentamicin = ceftazidime. Resistance of P. aeruginosa to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) remained low (7.4 and 8.0% respectively). No ampicillin resistance was revealed in the isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.
