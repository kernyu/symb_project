Standard 7-14 day (d) courses of antimicrobial therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are thought to have contributed to the emergence of resistant pneumoccoci. Consequently, short-course fluoroquinolone regimens have been proposed to minimize resistance. To test this, we examined 2-day versus 5-day regimens of gemifloxacin and levofloxacin for treatment of pneumonia in a murine model. In doing so, we also investigated whether the enhanced potency of gemifloxacin would influence outcomes. CD1 Swiss mice were infected intratracheally with 10(5)-CFU of a virulent Streptococcus pneumoniae strain. Drugs were administered every 8 h for 2 d and 5 d, starting at 24 h postinfection. Temperature was used to assess disease progression. Gemifloxacin remained effective for 2 d and 5 d, with survival rates of 100%-83% compared with 40%-58% for levofloxacin. Eighty-nine to 100% of gemifloxacin-treated mice were clear of pulmonary bacteria compared with only 0%-20% for levofloxacin. For levofloxacin-treated mice, 2 of 7 (29%) isolates with a levofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 4 times that of the infecting parent strain had ParC mutations. By contrast, no isolates recovered from gemifloxacin-treated mice were reduced in susceptibility. Gemifloxacin could be effective in shortening duration of therapy for CAP treatment as well as minimize resistance development.
