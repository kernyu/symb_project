Information on virulence and persistence factors of enterococci as important nosocomial pathogens with ever increasing multiple drug resistance is updated. The importance of the virulent and persistent properties of enterococci in the processes of adhesion to host tissues, invasion, modulation of inflammatory responses, as well as their toxic action on the host body is considered. The pathogenicity factors of enterococci are relevant to the mechanisms of the bacterial survival in the host.
