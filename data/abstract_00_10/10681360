Oral administration of 2'-deoxy-3'-oxa-4'-thiocytidine (BCH-10652), a nucleoside analog structurally similar to lamivudine (3TC), caused dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 NL4-3 and with an NL4-3 clone containing the M184V mutation in reverse transcriptase that confers resistance to 3TC. These experiments demonstrate the utility of this mouse model for evaluating drug resistance and for performing direct comparisons between antiviral compounds in vivo.
