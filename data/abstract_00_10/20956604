Continuous infusion of vancomycin was evaluated against experimental endocarditis due to heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) and VISA. Animals were infected with hVISA PC1 (vancomycin MIC, 2 mg/liter) or VISA PC3 (vancomycin MIC, 8 mg/liter) and treated for 5 days with constant serum levels of 20 or 40 mg/liter. Vancomycin continuous infusion was unsuccessful, as 20 mg/liter was barely active against PC1 (6 of 13 sterile vegetations) and 40 mg/liter failed against PC3 (2 of 9 sterile vegetations).
