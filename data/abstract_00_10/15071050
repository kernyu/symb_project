In Korea, vancomycin-resistant enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens since the late 1990s, and most vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates have been VanA phenotype-vanA genotype strains. In 2001, we experienced an outbreak of VanB phenotype-vanA genotype vancomycin-resistant enterococci at a university hospital. This is the first report of VanB-vanA vancomycin-resistant enterococci from humans in Korea.
