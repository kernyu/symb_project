INTRODUCTION: The high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospitalized patients is a significant problem due to its associated morbidity and mortality. It is important to know the recent MRSA epidemiology at a General Hospital. OBJECTIVES: To determine the MRSA epidemiology at a Mexican general hospital from 2000 to 2007, in order to know if there is a significant trend in its proportion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prevalence survey. The resistance to oxacillin was identified by the Kirby-Bauer's method. The specimens were classified by type and year of isolation. Trend statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: S. aureus was identified in 1,008 samples, being 301 resistant to oxacillin (30%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 25 to 35%). The proportion of MRSA went from 37% (95% CI, 29 to 44%) to 49% (95% CI, 40 to 58%) in the period of study (chi2 for trends = 6.676, p < 0.01). Specimens with the highest proportion of MRSA were blood and sterile liquids with 32% (95% CI, 26 to 39%), secretions with 29% (95% CI, 24 to 33%), and catheters with 21% (95% CI, 16 to 26%). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of MRSA has increased significantly. This leads to higher costs and morbi-mortality for the hospitalized patients. We require stricter policies to prevent transmission and to control the use of antibiotics.
