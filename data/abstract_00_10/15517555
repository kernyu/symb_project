Reduction of analytes in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) often obscures the actual determination of molecular structure. To address the redox reactions in laser desorption/ionization processes, the organic dyes Methylene Blue, Janus Green B, Crystal Violet and Rhodamine B were analyzed by MALDI or by desorption/ionization on porous silicon (DIOS). Susceptibility to reduction in MALDI was dependent on both the reduction potentials of analytes and the molar ratio of analyte to matrix molecules. Addition of Cu(II) ions as an electron scavenger suppressed the reduction of Methylene Blue in MALDI. The results suggested that electron transfer to analytes from the sample target and/or from the matrix contributed to the reduction. In DIOS, the reductions of organic dyes were more prominent than in MALDI, and were not prevented by Cu(II) ion doping, probably due to direct contact of the analytes with silicon which had little electric resistance.
