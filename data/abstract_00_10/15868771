BACKGROUND: An increased risk in coronary heart disease associated with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylon) appears to be partially mediated by modifications of the atherogenic lipoprotein and inflammatory parameters. We conducted a controlled trial aimed at evaluating the changes of metabolic and inflammatory parameters after H. pylon eradication. METHODS: We included in the study 169 patients with H. pylori infection and conducted a retrospective longitudinal survey of 87 subjects (76 men, 11 women) who received treatment for H. pylon eradication and 82 control subjects (63 men, 19 women) who did not receive treatment. We compared pre- and posteradication (one year after) the metabolic and inflammatory parameters, such as blood sugar, lipid profiles, insulin resistance, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: No significant changes from the baseline in metabolic and inflammatory parameters within each group were observed. Changes in the serum levels of metabolic and inflammatory parameters were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and inflammatory parameters, including blood sugar, lipid profiles, insulin resistance, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, were not changed after H. pylori eradication treatment. H. pylori eradication has no effect on metabolic and inflammatory parameters.
