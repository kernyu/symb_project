During a 3-year surveillance program (2004 to 2007) in Monterrey, Mexico, 398 isolates of Candida spp. were collected from five hospitals. We established the species distribution and in vitro susceptibilities of these isolates. The species included 127 Candida albicans strains, 151 C. parapsilosis strains, 59 C. tropicalis strains, 32 C. glabrata strains, 11 C. krusei strains, 5 C. guilliermondii strains, 4 C. famata strains, 2 C. utilis strains, 2 C. zeylanoides strains, 2 C. rugosa strains, 2 C. lusitaniae strains, and 1 C. boidinii strain. The species distribution differed with the age of the patients. The proportion of candidemias caused by C. parapsilosis was higher among infants <or=1 year old, and the proportion of candidemias caused by C. glabrata increased with patient age (>45 years old). MICs were calculated following the criteria of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth macrodilution method. Overall, C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis isolates were susceptible to fluconazole and amphotericin B. However, 31.3% of C. glabrata isolates were resistant to fluconazole (MIC >or= 64 microg/ml), 43.3% were resistant to itraconazole (MIC >or= 1 microg/ml), and 12.5% displayed resistance to amphotericin B (MIC >or= 2 microg/ml). Newer triazoles, namely, voriconazole, posaconazole, and ravuconazole, had a notable in vitro activity against all Candida species tested. Also, caspofungin was active against Candida sp. isolates (MIC(90) <or= 0.5 microg/ml) except C. parapsilosis (MIC(90) = 2 microg/ml). It is imperative to promote a national-level surveillance program to monitor this important microorganism.
