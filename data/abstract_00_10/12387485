The apparent lack of anthelmintic resistant nematodes in cattle is due to the management systems used with most cattle and the lack of surveys for resistance. With extensive beef grazing or with beef suckler herds a large percentage of worms are in refugia (not exposed to anthelmintic) and few anthelmintic treatments are used. With dairy replacement heifers resistance can become a problem unless only first year animals are treated and different fields are used for grazing the animals each year. Intensive beefproduction on grass is unsustainable and in New Zealand resistance is already becoming a serious problem. Individual farms require monitoring for resistance and steps taken to avoid the introduction of resistance. New validated tests and surveys for resistance are required as the extent of anthelmintic resistant bovine nematodes is not known.
