The effectiveness of therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients has greatly improved in the last few years, and the gold standard is currently held to be pegylated interferon (IFN) in combination with ribavirin. Overall, however, the percentage of patients achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) is only around 50%,and it is not possible to predict those patients who will benefit from therapy. The molecular mechanisms underlying lack of therapeutic response remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the tissue expression of MxA and RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), two antiviral proteins modulated by IFN, in biopsy samples from hepatitis C patients before the beginning of therapy. Our results show that expression of MxA, but not of PKR, is significantly lower in responders compared with nonresponders. No differences were observed regarding the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype and the viral load. These results suggest that expression of the MxA protein could play a role among the mechanisms underlying responsiveness to therapy.
