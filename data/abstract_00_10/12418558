Resistance to macrolides is not a new phenomenon but it deserves attention because of the widespread use of these agents and their inclusion in many clinical guidelines for respiratory tract infections. The most common mechanisms by which Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes develop resistance to macrolides is by target site modification (erythromycin ribosome methylase, erm) and efflux of the drug out of the organisms (macrolide efflux, mef). Target site modification may be of greater concern because it confers high-level resistance to all antimicrobials in the macrolide-lincosamide-streptograminB (MLSB) group. The genotype profiles of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes differ somewhat across regions in the US and between the US and Canada and other countries. There is some evidence for an association between macrolide resistance and treatment failure but this must be researched more fully. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates resistant to macrolides are generally susceptible to ketolide antimicrobials because these agents bind more strongly to the relevant domain of the ribosomal subunit (withstanding erm resistance) and are less vulnerable to efflux compared to the macrolides.
