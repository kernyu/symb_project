OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to verify the correlation of endoscopically directed middle meatal (EDMM) cultures with maxillary sinus tap and culture (MST) in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Meta-analysis of the previous literature, unpublished data, and a prospective trial supported by the Sinus & Allergy Health Partnership. EDMM and MST cultures were obtained and their results compared. Inclusion for both the unpublished and prospective trial as well as prior published literature in the meta-analysis required the studies to compare EDMM versus MST in the acute setting of bacterial rhinosinusitis with both symptomatic and radiologic evidence of ABRS. RESULTS: Three articles and 1 national presentation were identified for inclusion. Additional data from unpublished studies and the prospective trial were combined. The pooled data consisted of 126 patients with 131 culture pairs. For known pathogenic bacteria for ABRS and in comparison to MST, EDMM had a sensitivity of 80.9%, a specificity of 90.5%, a positive predictive value of 82.6%, a negative predictive value of 89.4%, and an overall accuracy of 87.0% (95% confidence interval, 81.3%-92.8%); 70.5% (12/17) of false positive culture pairs were of known pathogens for ABRS that would not be expected to be contaminants. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This meta-analysis shows that EDMM is a highly sensitive and accurate culture method for acute ABRS and may be more sensitive than MST given the presence of pathogenic bacteria not found on antral lavage. EDMM is a viable, and possibly preferred, culture method for determining antimicrobial efficacy and bacterial resistance patterns. EBM RATING: A-1a.
