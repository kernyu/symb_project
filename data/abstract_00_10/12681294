Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) can interact with intracellular signaling pathways to regulate cell behavior. The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) signal, involved in diverse aspects of cellular functioning, is implicated as a cell sensor of redox stress. The growth-inhibitory effect of both high-level H(2)O(2) and H(2)O(2)-scavenging catalase treatments is accompanied by increased JNK1 activity. To investigate the role of this response in growth regulation, the JNK1 signal was increased by the introduction of ectopic HA-JNK1. HA-JNK1 expression correlated with increases in basal c-Jun phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Transient expression of HA-JNK1 potentiated cell growth arrest by catalase; however, with stable expression a degree of resistance to this response was observed. Resistance was accompanied by a lowered endogenous production of H(2)O(2). Transient HA-JNK1 expression also reduced H(2)O(2) generation, and this effect was reversed by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. These results indicate that the JNK1 stress response contributes to growth inhibition by catalase treatment via inhibition of cellular H(2)O(2) production. Stable amplification of the JNK1 pathway leads to cellular adaptation to its signal, resulting in a diminished reliance upon H(2)O(2) for efficient growth.
