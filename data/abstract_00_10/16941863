The influence of culture medium Fe2+ content on the resistance of Escherichia coli to hydroxyl radicals formed in the presence of Fe2+ and hydrogen peroxide in Fenton reaction was investigated. It was founded that a lack of Fe2+ in a culture medium increased resistance of bacteria to hydroxyl radicals but not to hydrogen peroxide. The suggestion was made that the lack of Fe2+ starts up synthesis of metabolites which inactivate hydroxyl radical or block Fe2+ ions participating in Fenton reaction. The phenomenon under study is considered to be a possible mechanism for survival of bacteria in oxidative stress and iron ions deficiency.
