OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of S315T mutation within the katG gene that confers clinically significant resistance to isoniazid in isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered from tuberculosis patients in Dubai and Beirut. METHOD: A total of 28 and 17 isoniazid-resistant and seven and six susceptible clinical M. tuberculosis isolates from Dubai and Beirut, respectively, were tested. The presence of S315T mutation in the katG gene was detected by amplification of the DNA region around codon 315 by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction digestion with Msp I to generate restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotyping of the isolates carrying S315T mutation was carried out by touchdown double-repetitive-element PCR (DRE-PCR). RESULTS: The mutation S315T was detected in 18 (64%) of 28 isoniazid-resistant isolates from Dubai and in six (35%) of 17 resistant strains from Beirut. None of the susceptible strains contained this mutation. The genotyping studies showed that the majority of the isolates carrying the S315T mutation exhibited unique DNA banding patterns. CONCLUSION: The data show a varying prevalence of S315T mutation within the katG gene in M. tuberculosis strains isolated from the two geographical locations, Dubai and Beirut.
