BACKGROUND: Intestinal carriage is a key factor in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) infection epidemiology but is difficult to study in open communities. To overcome this problem, we studied a highly stable group of Amerindians for whom we reported an ESBL carriage prevalence of 3.2% in 2001. METHODS: In 2006, ESBL carriage was assessed among 163 healthy volunteer adults. ESBL isolates were identified, and their molecular resistance mechanisms were characterized. Antibiotic use in the year before sampling and the epidemiological characteristics of the population were analyzed. Results were compared to those obtained in 2001. RESULTS: In 2006, the ESBL carriage prevalence, exclusively comprising Escherichia coli, was 8.0%. It mainly consisted of CTX-M-type ESBL. The strains and plasmids carrying ESBL were heterogeneous, but 1 CTX-M-2-producing strain was found in 4.3% of the subjects analyzed. No individual risk factor was identified. However, overall antibiotic use had almost doubled since 2001. A 3-fold increase was noted for beta-lactams. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, the frequency of ESBL increased with time because of the appearance of CTX-M ESBL, mimicking what occurs in the developed world. This resulted from the probable repeated introduction of new strains and plasmids and from interindividual dissemination. During the same period, antibiotic use substantially increased.
