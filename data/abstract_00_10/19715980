OBJECTIVES: The rate of infection in patients who require ventricular assist devices (VADs) is estimated at more than 35%. Infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms in VAD recipients present a high mortality rate. Daptomycin (Cubicin, Novartis, Nuremberg, Germany), a new cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, is useful for MDR gram-positive organisms. We report the successful use of daptomycin in patients presenting with MDR gram-positive infections after VAD implantation. METHODS: We retrospectively studied nine consecutive patients presenting with resistant gram-positive infections after VAD implantation treated with daptomycin. We analyzed type of VAD, type of infection, responsible microorganism, outcome, and adverse events. RESULTS: We studied nine patients (eight males, one female), of overall mean age of 51 +/- 8 years; 78% required a biventricular assist device or a left VAD (Berlin Heart, Berlin, Germany), 22% received other ventricular support. Sixty-six percent presented with catheter-related infections (CRIs). Therapy with daptomycin was empirically initiated in all cases. The initial dose was 6 mg/kg, continued at 4 mg/kg. The mean duration of therapy was 16 +/- 5 days. The reported pathogens were MRSA, 33%; E. faecium, 25%; methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, 12.5%; methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 12.5%; others, 17%. Successful outcomes were reported in seven subjects (78%), with two patients succumbing due to multiorgan failure related to their heart condition prior completing antibiotic therapy. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among our VAD patients, daptomycin proved efficient as a therapy for CRI with bacteremia. However, controlled studies are necessary to evaluate this antibiotic in patients presenting with VAD and MDR bacteremia.
