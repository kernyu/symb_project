A cross-sectional survey was conducted upon 500 respondents, comprising of 250 adults and 250 children who did consume antibiotics in the previous three months. Data were analysed to determine the patterns of utilisation, compliance and awareness regarding antibiotic medication amongst a selected urban population at Kolkata. Antibiotic consumption without prescription was evident amongst 41.2% of adults in comparison to that of 8.4% in children (P < 0.01). Compliance to daily dosage was observed in 40.8% of adults in comparison to 82.8% in children (P < 0.01). Awareness pattern regarding antibiotics were reported to have been more in the children group (16.4%) while compared to the adults (8%). The knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance remained more or less similar in both the groups. The study concludes that high over the counter (OTC) sale and inadequate compliance to antibitotic medication needs further intervention approach towards information, education and communication (IEC) to all concerned.
