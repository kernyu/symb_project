We evaluated 582 Haemophilus influenzae isolates from patients between January 2000 and December 2004. Overall, 433 isolates were obtained from sputum and bronchial washings, 124 isolates were from pus, 19 isolates were from blood and 6 isolates form cerebrospinal fluid. H. influenzae was sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem (range 97-100%), chloramphenicol (75%), ampicillin/amoxicillin (52%), but resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. As for beta-lactamase production, 48.4% of the isolates tested were positive.
