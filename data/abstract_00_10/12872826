The ability of the nitrofuran antimicrobial agents furazolidone and furaltadone to prevent, reduce or eliminate Salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis PT4 infection in artificially challenged day-old chicks was evaluated. Treating the birds with the nitrofurans failed to eliminate established infections with either furazolidone-resistant (FzR) or furazolidone-sensitive (FzS) strains. Simultaneous administration of the nitrofurans to day-old chicks challenged with FzS failed to prevent infection but reduced colonization significantly (p<0.05) compared to unmedicated controls. No reduction of colonization occurred with FzR. Challenging birds with FzS and simultaneous dosing with nitrofurans for 1 week, followed by a second week of continued treatment, resulted in an increase in the level of colonization in the second week rather than a decrease. Dosing with the nitrofurans (200 ppm) for 1 week prior to challenge with FzS and continued medication for a further week prevented colonization of the caecum, liver and spleen. However, cessation of dosing at the time of challenge with salmonella resulted in colonization. Chloramphenicol and tetracycline at concentrations of 200 ppm were both independently capable of preventing colonization by salmonella. Sulphadiazine initially reduced colonization but failed to eliminate the infection. Only when furazolidone was combined with chloramphenicol or when sulphadiazine was combined with trimethoprim, and the combined drugs were administered concurrently with the challenge, was colonization prevented.
