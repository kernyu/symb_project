alpha-Mangostin, isolated from the stem bark of Garcinia mangostana L., was found to be active against vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with MIC values of 6.25 and 6.25 to 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. Our studies showed synergism between alpha-mangostin and gentamicin (GM) against VRE, and alpha-mangostin and vancomycin hydrochloride (VCM) against MRSA. Further studies showed partial synergism between alpha-mangostin and commercially available antibiotics such as ampicillin and minocycline. These findings suggested that alpha-mangostin alone or in combination with GM against VRE and in combination with VCM against MRSA might be useful in controlling VRE and MRSA infections.
