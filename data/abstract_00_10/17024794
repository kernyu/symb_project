The susceptibility of 1870 Streptococcus pyogenes and 1595 Streptococcus pneumoniae to macrolides and lincosamides has been monitored from 1993 to 2004 in Central Italy. Among S. pyogenes, 30.2% were erythromycin resistant; 18.5% were also resistant to josamycin and clindamycin (MLS phenotype). After an increasing erythromycin resistance rate in 1993-1997 (maximum 53.16%), a definite decrease was observed since 2001 with resistance rates always less than 30%. Thirty six percent of pneumococcal isolates were erythromycin-resistant, with minor temporal fluctuations; the MLS phenotype was the most prevalent overall (32.6%) and in individual years. S. pneumoniae strains were also tested for susceptibility to beta-lactams and other antimicrobial agents: 11.2% were penicillin non-susceptible, with a gradually increasing prevalence after 2001 (maximum rate 17.3% in 2004), 31.15% were resistant to tetracycline, 4.9% to chloramphenicol, 0.74% to rifampin. All pneumococcal isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin and 99.9% to ceftriaxone and ofloxacin.
