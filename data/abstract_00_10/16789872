The incidences of human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans and its related species acquiring resistance to antifungals have increased considerably, which poses serious problems towards its successful chemotherapy. The resistance of these pathogenic fungi is not restricted to the commonly used triazole compounds but is even encountered, though not often, with polyene derivatives as well. The efflux pump proteins belonging to ABC (ATP Binding Cassette) and MFS (Major Facilitators) super family are the most prominent contributors of multidrug resistance (MDR) in yeasts. The abundance of the drug transporters and their wider specificity suggest that these transporters may not be exclusively drug exporters in yeasts and may have other cellular functions. In this article we focus on some of the recent advances on the structure and function, evolution and transcriptional control of drug efflux proteins of Candida. A short discussion on the physiological relevance of drug transporters is also included.
