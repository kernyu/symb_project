The M184V substitution in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is rapidly selected in tissue culture following serial passage of wild-type virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of lamivudine (3TC). M184V is also associated with several alterations of RT enzymatic function in vitro that may adversely affect viral fitness or replication capacity, which creates a potential rationale for its maintenance once it has been selected by antiviral chemotherapy. However, the relative effectiveness of nucleoside RT inhibitors that are structurally unrelated to 3TC in selecting and/or maintaining M184V has not been investigated. In the present study, we have studied the abilities of a variety of drugs, i.e., zalcitabine (ddC), didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC), and the novel nucleoside SPD754, in addition to 3TC, to maintain the presence of M184V in tissue culture and have shown that SPD754, ABC, and 3TC are able to preserve M184V in mixed dual infections consisting of wild-type viruses and clinical isolates which contained the M184V mutation. Moreover, M184V could also be maintained in these cultures when a subtherapeutic concentration of 3TC (i.e., 0.05 microM) was used. In contrast, neither ddI nor ddC was able to maintain M184V to the same extent as the other drugs after 10 weeks of tissue culture in mixtures of wild-type viruses and isolates containing M184V in different proportions.
