The genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in 113 unrelated group B streptococci was studied by PCR. Ninety-four strains were resistant to tetracycline-minocycline, and tet(M) was detected in 85% of these isolates. Seventeen erythromycin-resistant strains contained the erm(B), erm(TR), or mef(A) gene. Eleven strains exhibited high-level resistance to kanamycin due to the presence of the aphA3 gene; eight of these strains were also highly resistant to streptomycin; aad-6-related sequences were detected in seven strains.
