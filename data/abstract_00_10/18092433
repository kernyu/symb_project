The present study was conducted to detect aerobic causative agents of urinary tract infection (UTI) and their antibiogram pattern. This study was carried out in the Department of Microbiology, Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Imphal, Manipur, India. A total of 1,109 clean catched midstream urine samples were collected, out of which 459 (40.4%) samples grew potential pathogens causing UTI. Escherichia coli were the predominant 334 (72.8%) bacterial pathogen followed by Klebsiella species 66 (14.4%), non lactose fermenters 19 (4.1%), Pseudomonas species 16 (3.5%) and others. Most of the strains of E. coli were resistance to Ciprofloxacin whereas sensitive to Aminoglycoside. Most of the urinary isolates showed high degree of resistance to Tetracycline, Norfloxacin and Cotrimoxazole. Gentamycin was the drug of choice for most of the strains.
