Proper management of Helicobacter pylori infection in clinical practice--when supported by evidence-based data--is expected to produce substantial cost-efficacy advantages. This consideration has prompted the Cervia Working Group to organise a meeting of experts to update the National Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori infection in Italy. Recommendations in the new European Guidelines were considered in the National setting, here in the light of factors such as the incidence of gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma, the accessibility to different diagnostic tools, the prevalence of bacterial resistance against antibiotics, and the availability of different drugs. The main revisions in respect to the previous guidelines include H. pylori eradication in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients and in non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug users, as well as in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and iron deficiency anaemia. The stool antigen test is now accepted as a valid test for confirmation of H. pylori eradication following therapy. New therapeutic approaches have been recommended for both first- (sequential therapy) and second-line (levofloxacin-based) treatment in our country.
