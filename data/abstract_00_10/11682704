With travel and trade within the European Union (EU) increasing over the years, the risk of dissemination of (resistant) pathogens grows. Many studies have shown that there is a growing problem with antimicrobial resistance. For example, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was initially largely a problem of hospitals, but it is now increasingly reported as a community acquired infection. Certain strains have been shown to spread between European countries. Antimicrobial resistance may result in prolonged hospital stay, higher costs, and higher morbidity or even mortality.
