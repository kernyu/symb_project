Isoniazid (INH), a front-line antituberculosis agent, is activated by mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase KatG, converting INH into bactericidal reactive species. Here we investigated the requirements and the pathway of nitric oxide (NO*) generation during oxidative activation of INH by Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG in vitro. We also provide in vivo evidence that INH-derived NO* can inhibit key mycobacterial respiratory enzymes, which may contribute to the overall antimycobacterial action of INH.
