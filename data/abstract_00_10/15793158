The purpose of this study was to compare the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) of ABT-492 to those of levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The fluoroquinolones had comparable mutation selection windows, which is the ratio of MPC/MIC, for all isolates.
