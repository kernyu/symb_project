OBJECTIVE: To study the resistance to amantadine of epidemic strain of H3 subtype influenza virus. METHODS: Forty-one strains of influenza virus were isolated from pediatric patients with influenza in Beijing 2004-2005 and were identified as H3 subtype. RNA was extracted. Thirty of the 40 strains were resistant to amantadine with a resistance rate of 75%. The M2 gene ion channel fragments were amplified by one-step RT-PCR, sequenced, and then underwent systemic tree analysis. RESULTS: M2 ion channel associated gene fragment with a molecular size of 153 bp was obtained. The amino acid at the site 31 changed from serine into asparagines, a mutation identical to that of the reference strain A/PR8/34 resistant to amantadine. CONCLUSION: The resistance rate to amantadine is high among the epidemic strains of H3 subtype influenza virus in China. The associated mutation occurs at the site 31 of M2 protein.
