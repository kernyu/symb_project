Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae including Klebsiella have re-emerged as major pathogens in solid organ transplantation. The recent appearance and dissemination of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Europe and the northeastern United States represents a major challenge to the treatment of enteric gram-negative bacterial infections in immunocompromised patients; however, few reports have detailed the outcomes of such infections. Here we report 2 cases of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella infections in orthotopic liver transplant recipients, which were the index case and initial secondary case for an outbreak of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae in our institution. In both instances, the pathogens were initially misidentified as being carbapenem sensitive, the infections recurred after cessation of directed therapy, and the patients ultimately succumbed to their infections.
