The aim of the study was to compare the disk-diffusion (oxacillin 1 microg, cefoxitin 30 microg) method and PCR for detection of methicillin-resistance in S. aureus. The investigation were carried out on 120 S. aureus strains isolated from clinical materials of patients hospitalized in the University Hospital at the L. Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, University of Nicolaus Copernicus in Torun. Of the 120 S. aureus strains tested, 60 (50%) were mecA-positive by PCR. Consistency of results between oxacillin disk-difussion method and PCR amounted 92.5% and cefoxitin disk-diffusion method and PCR--98.3%. The oxacillin disk-difussion method falsely identified 3 (2.5%) strains as MSSA (sensitivity 95.0%) and 4 strains as MRSA (specificity 93.3%) in comparison with PCR. The cefoxitin disk-diffusion method falsely identified 2 (1.6%) strains as MSSA (sensitivity 96.7%) and there were no false resistant results (specificity 100%). Our results showed that in disk-diffusion tests, cefoxitin is a better than oxacillin for the identification of MRSA.
