We have characterized the cell surface properties of three mutant series of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that show various defects in their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core region. The deepest rough mutants of each series used in this study lacked completely rhamnose and glucose, and contained only galactosamine and alanine as LPS outer core constituents. However, rough mutants other than the deepest rough mutants showed high cell surface hydrophobicity compared to the corresponding parental strains, the deepest rough mutants showed less hydrophobicity than other rough mutants. The reactivity of an anti-lipid A monoclonal antibody with the deepest rough mutants was markedly higher than that with other counterparts. The deepest rough mutants tended to be more susceptible to antibiotics, such as gentamicin and polymyxin B, than the corresponding parental strains and other rough mutants. The above evidence indicates that neutral sugar, namely rhamnose and glucose, residues of the LPS outer core region play a critical role in the cell surface properties of P. aeruginosa.
