BACKGROUND AND AIM: Controversy exists as to whether rats after bile duct ligation (BDL) are more susceptible to gastric mucosal damage (GMD) induced by irritants. In the present study we characterize GMD after intragastric instillation of either ethanol or hydrochloric acid (HCL), 3 and 21 days after the surgical procedure. METHODS: Bile duct ligation and sham operated (SO) rats were studied. RESULTS: Three days after surgery, BDL rats exhibited a reduction in gastric mucosal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity but an increase in ethanol-induced GMD. Twenty-one days after surgery gastric mucosal prostaglandin (PG) E(2) generation in BDL rats was increased while NOS activity in both groups was similar. Ethanol-induced GMD in SO rats was higher. Pretreatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, prior to ethanol administration was associated with an increase in gastric mucosal PGE(2) generation: (147% in SO and 104% in BDL rats) and in GMD (176% in SO and 303% in BDL rats). HCL induced GMD was of similar magnitude in both groups in both time periods. CONCLUSIONS: The gastric resistance to damage by irritants in rats with BDL is not a static phenomenon. This may result from sequential changes that occur in the gastric mucosal defense mechanisms during the evolution of liver disease.
