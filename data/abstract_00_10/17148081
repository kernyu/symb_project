We report 4 cases of invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections who received treatment with tigecycline after unsuccessful treatment attempts with conventional drugs. All 4 patients were eventually cured although 1 experienced a relapse of her bacteremia while on treatment due to inadequate dosing.
