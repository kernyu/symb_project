AIM: To investigate antibiotic consumption in a sample of physicians from Osijek-Baranja county in Eastern Croatia and to determine the volume of prescribed antimicrobials and assess the appropriateness of prescribing practices. METHODS: Analysis of routine prescribing data was carried out in 30 primary care practices in both urban and rural communities of eastern Croatia, corresponding to a total population of 48000 patients. Prescribing practices were studied over a period of 3 years, from 2003 to 2005. Both the quantity of antimicrobials and differences and similarities between individual practitioners were analyzed. RESULTS: Urban and rural practices did not significantly differ in regard to the volume of antimicrobials prescribed. However, significant differences were found between individual physicians. Total consumption was 17.73 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day or 6456.85 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per year. The 10 most frequently used antimicrobials (93.70% of the total quantity) were amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, co-trimoxazole, cephalexin, norfloxacin, penicillin V, azithromycin, cefuroxime, doxycycline, and nitrofurantoin. Sore throat was the most frequent reason for prescribing antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Prescription of medicines in Osijek-Baranja county was characterized by high consumption of broad-spectrum penicillins, combined penicillins, combined sulfonamides and long-acting macrolides (azithromycin), together with disproportionately low use of doxycycline and erythromycin. The use of combined sulfonamides and azithromycin in this part of Croatia was among the highest in Europe. Great differences between prescribers in regard to indication-based prescribing have been found, and future studies should examine the factors behind these heterogeneous practices.
