The in vitro activities of tigecycline and selected antimicrobials were evaluated against a variety of multiple-drug-resistant clinical isolates, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and/or metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative strains, colistin-resistant strains, vancomycin- and/or linezolid-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Tigecycline showed excellent activity against a collection of difficult-to-treat pathogens currently encountered in the hospital setting.
