Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common bacterial pathogen that has long been considered a hospital-acquired pathogen. However, newer community-acquired strains have appeared that differ from nosocomial strains in their susceptibility to different antibiotics. Because these community isolates harbor a novel methicillin-resistance cassette gene element that has not been associated with hospital-acquired strains, they can encode virulence factors, such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which has been linked to skin and soft tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonia. A variety of antibiotics are available for the treatment of hospital-acquired MRSA (HAMRSA) and community-acquired MRSA (CAMRSA). Incision and drainage is of paramount importance in the treatment of cutaneous abscesses and is sufficient treatment in most uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections.
