In a miniature continuous flow cell system we investigated the influence of voriconazole (VCZ) (27 trials) or anidulafungin (ANID) (five trials) on the antimycotic resistance of C. albicans (type strain SC5314 and three strains from blood cultures). The duration of the trials was up to 10 d. After continuous addition of VCZ or ANID to the media, biomass decreased and glucose levels and pH values increased. After exposure to VCZ, the dry weight of biofilm dropped by 90%. There was no evidence of resistance. No resistance also developed against ANID after 1 day or 3 days of exposure. No viable cells were detected in the biofilm after 5 days of exposure to ANID. Therefore, VCZ and ANID effectively inhibited biofilm formation of different C.albicans strains. Our experiments show that biofilm production is not necessarily associated with development of resistance.
