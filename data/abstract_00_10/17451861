Early experiments showed that administration of mouse interferon preparations inhibited the development of viral-induced or spontaneous viral associated leukemias in mice. Interferon alpha/beta was also shown to inhibit the growth of transplantable tumors of different origins in all strains of mice tested. The finding that interferon alpha/beta inhibited the growth of sublines of tumors selected for resistance to interferon alpha/beta indicated the role of interferon induced host mechanisms in the antitumor effects observed. The different host antitumor mechanisms and especially the interaction of interferon alpha/beta with the immune system have been briefly discussed. Injection of mice with a neutralizing antibody to interferon alpha/beta demonstrated the essential role of endogenous interferon alpha/beta in the defense of the mouse against the development of syngeneic, allogeneic and xenogeneic tumors.
