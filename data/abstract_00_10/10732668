The 51,409-bp DNA sequence of the multiresistance plasmid pTP10 from the gram-positive opportunistic human pathogen Corynebacterium striatum M82B has been determined. Fully automated genome interpretation led to the identification of 47 ORFs. Analysis of the genetic organization of pTP10 suggests that the plasmid is composed of eight DNA segments, the boundaries of which are represented by transposons and insertion sequences. The DNA segments of pTP10 are highly similar to (1) a plasmid-encoded erythromycin resistance region from the human pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae; (2) a chromosomal DNA region from Mycobacterium tuberculosis; (3) a plasmid-encoded chloramphenicol resistance region from the soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum; (4) transposable elements from phytopathogenic gram-negative Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas and Erwinia species; and (5) a plasmid-encoded aminoglycoside resistance region from the gram-negative fish pathogen Pasteurella piscicida. The complete DNA sequence of pTP10 provides genetic information regarding the mechanisms of resistance to 16 antimicrobial agents that belong to six structural classes. In addition, the mosaic structure of pTP10 represents the evolutionary consolidation into a single plasmid molecule of antimicrobial resistances from microorganisms found in different habitats by means of mobile elements, resulting in the generation of a multiresistant bacterium that can infect humans.
