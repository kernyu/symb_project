In this study the nucleotide sequence of the pncA gene from 59 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates was analyzed. Mutations in the pncA gene were identified in 29 of 40 pyrazinamide-resistant isolates, and no pyrazinamidase activity was detected in 39 of them. Twelve mutations found in this work have not been described previously.
