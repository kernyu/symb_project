This modest study is trying to surprise the clinic shades spectrum of the pulmonary tuberculosis met at adults in the Romanati Plain zone, which was high consumption at the end of the second millennium without avoiding the new tones which AIDS and the MDR-TB brought. This things determined people to speak about the "NEW TUBERCULOSIS" of the third millennium. It had started from a number of 393 patients suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and age over twenty. This people were in hospital between 1997-2000 at the Pneumophysiology section in the Caracal's Municipal hospital. They were grouped after this parameters: the disease type, sex, environment, occupation, beginning form, clinic form, bacteriologic exam BK, diagnosis delay, lesion stretch and associated diseases, looking to discover the profile which is the most frequently used which satisfies in high percentage many of the studied parameters. We underline that the HIV test was negative to all the new cases and readmitted positive at T3 and to all the sick people who were registered with therapeutic failure in 1997 and 1999, so the AIDS impact with tuberculosis in this zone was null. Also systematic in the last two years we made ABG at relapses, failures and chronic; the bacillus resistance was not put in evidence, thing also hard to accept. The profile the most frequently met no matter the environments life, disease type, sex, age is the fibro-cases-cavitary farm (50%) followed by the infiltrative one (35%) with an "classic" onset in more than two third of the cases, bilaterally of the injures and the diagnosis delay with at least two months at 60% from all cases and a positively of the sputum in microscopy of about 50%. At least one third of the sick people are unemployed. This profile has of course epidemic consequences an therapeutic especially.
