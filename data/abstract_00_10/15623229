Molecular and functional characteristics of seven azospirilla and five phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) isolates of rice rhizosphere, growth promotion ability of two efficient strains, Azospirillum amazonense A10 (MTCC4716) and Bacillus megaterium P5 (MTCC4714) and their persistence based on streptomycin resistant derivatives (SRD), were determined. SDS-PAGE and isozyme banding patterns of the isolates were used to arbitrarily group the azospirilla into 4 and PSB into 3 clusters and as markers to ascertain their identity. The azospirilla produced 2.0 to 10.5 ppm of IAA like substances and showed nitrogenase activity of 0.02 to 3.55 nmole C2H4/hr/ml of pure culture. PSB isolates produced 7.8 to 15.0 ppm IAA like substances and 20 to 128 ppm soluble P. Induction of resistance to streptomycin resulted in changes of these properties. Co-inoculation of rice with SRD A10 and SRD P5 and their parental strains in separate treatments enhanced grain yield over control by 31 and 12.4%, respectively. Nitrogenase activity of rice roots under SRD co-inoculated treatment was higher (4.16 nmole C2H4/hr/hill) than that-under parental strains co-inoculated treatment (3.76 nmole C2H4/hr/hill). SDS-PAGE profile and population count of the strains confirmed their establishment in rice rhizosphere and persistence over a year after inoculation.
