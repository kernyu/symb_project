Publication of the NCCLS M100-S12 document in January 2002 introduced ceftriaxone and cefotaxime MIC interpretative breakpoints of < or =1 microg/ml (susceptible), 2 microg/ml (intermediate), and > or =4 microg/ml (resistant) for nonmeningeal isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. To estimate the effect of these breakpoint changes on clinical laboratory susceptibility testing results, nonmeningeal pneumococcal isolate (blood and respiratory) data from The Surveillance Network Database-USA, an electronic surveillance database, for the years 1996 to 2000 were collated and studied. Of 9,863 nonmeningeal isolates tested against ceftriaxone, 82.7% were susceptible, 13.2% were intermediate, and 4.1% were resistant by the M100-S11 NCCLS breakpoints (2001); by M100-S12 breakpoints, 95.9% of the isolates were susceptible, 3.1% were intermediate, and 1.0% were resistant. Of 10,777 nonmeningeal isolates tested against cefotaxime, 79.2% were susceptible, 14.3% were intermediate, and 6.5% were resistant by M100-S11 breakpoints; by M100-S12 breakpoints, 93.5% were susceptible, 4.2% were intermediate, and 2.3% were resistant. Overall, the new M100-S12 ceftriaxone and cefotaxime interpretative breakpoints for nonmeningeal isolates of S. pneumoniae decreased the number of isolates interpreted as intermediate by 10% and as resistant by 3 to 4%.
