The prevalence and clinical implications of the Q151M multidrug-resistance mutation gene (mut) to antiretroviral drugs in the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) gene have not yet been fully explained. In the present study three out of 350 (0.85%) of HIV-infected patients who underwent a drug-resistance genotyping assay because of therapeutic failure showed the Q151M mut. All these patients had been previously treated with zidovudine in association with didanosine. One such patient failed to respond to all salvage regimens tried and was shown to harbour some of the characteristic mut associated with Q151M (77L and 116Y). Another two patients partially responded to salvage regimens, both virologically and immunologically, and harboured the M184V mut in the RT gene. The prevalence of Q151M mut in our group was less (0.85%) than in other studies, which ranged from 2 to 19%. The M184V mut seemed to confer some viro-immunological benefit when associated with the Q151M mutation, compared with the latter alone.
