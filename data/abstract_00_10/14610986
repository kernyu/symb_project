Non-adherence to highly effective antiretroviral medications can lead to treatment failure and the development of drug-resistant strains of HIV, and may result in an epidemic of treatment resistant HIV. This article describes a theory-based intervention (ALP) that was developed to increase adherence to HIV therapies among low-literacy populations of HIV positive African American women. The ALP intervention consists of a cartoon book and a cassette tape suitable for individuals with less than a 3rd-grade reading level. Qualitative data were collected through focus groups and expert panel interviews to conduct a formative evaluation. The results indicated that constructs of the Health Belief Model and Social Cognitive Theory were recognizable by behavioral scientists and that the materials would be used as intended by the target population to achieve the desired behavior change. This type of evaluation is a cost-effective method that can be used to develop effective interventions and obtain community buy-in.
