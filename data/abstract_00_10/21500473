UNLABELLED: Although community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia with highly virulent Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive strains, a severe disease with significant lethality, is rare, especially in adult and adolescent patients, recent reports highlight that these infections are on the rise. On the other hand, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is one of the high-risk and potential multi-drug resistant microorganisms. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of mecA and pvl genes in S. aureus strains isolated from lower respiratory tract infections and to assess the antibiotic resistance profile of these strains. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method according to CLSI recommendations in 32 consecutive non-repeated S. aureus strains isolated from sputum specimens and endotracheal aspirates of hospitalized patients over the period from January 2005 to December 2009. Only 20 strains (2008-2009) were tested for the presence of mecA and pvl genes by real-time PCR and detection with specific fluorescence probes. RESULTS: Of the 32 S. aureus isolates, 68.7% were MRSA. MRSA strains showed higher resistance rates to gentamicin, tetracycline, rifampicin, fluoroquinolones comparing to the methicillin susceptible ones. Only one strain produced pvl; it was isolated from a 7 year old child with lethal sepsis with pulmonary and meningeal secondary localisations. CONCLUSIONS: Glicopeptides and linezolid are therapeutic options indicated in the treatment of staphylococcal pneumonia produced either by MRSA strains or pvl positive S. aureus strains.
