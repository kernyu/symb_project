The emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance in Shigella has shifted the attention to cephalosporins. The first occurrence of third generation cephalosporin-resistant Shigella flexneri was from France. This article reports the first case of cephalosporin-resistant S. flexneri from India. A 12-month-old child was admitted for a 20-day episode of loose stools, non-fetid, with mucus and blood. The stool sample showed the presence of blood and mucus and S. flexneri which was resistant to Ampicillin, Nalidixic acid, Ciprofloxacin, Furoxone, Ceftriaxone and sensitive only to Cefoperazone and sulbactam combination. The child was promptly admitted and treated with a combination of Cefoperazone and sulbactam. The use of this combination was met with success in the present case, and may be considered as a temporary answer to the emerging cephalosporin-resistance.
