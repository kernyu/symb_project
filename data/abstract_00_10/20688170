We report the effect of two probiotics, Lactobacil and Sporolac as separate or mixed diets on innate immune mechanisms, such as phagocytosis activity, superoxide anion production of blood leukocytes, complement activity and plasma lysozyme activity, and disease resistance in lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) infected olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus (523.5 +/- 18.3 g) on week 1, 2, and 4. In infected fish, administration of diet supplemented with Lactobacil individually or mixed with Sporolac significantly enhanced the immune parameters like phagocytic activity superoxide anion production, complement activity, and plasma lysozyme. However administration of supplemented diet with Sporolac alone, all the chosen immune parameters did not enhance when compared to control group; this diets resulted in lower mortality (30% and 25%) than Sporolac diet group (45%) in 30 days. We conclude that Lactobacil individually or mixed with Sporolac act as immunostimulants that enhance the innate immune response and disease resistance in lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) infected olive flounder.
