Various studies have documented a shift in species distribution in Candida bloodstream infections (BSI), but there are little data from Southeast Asia. This study was performed to determine the species epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of Candida species BSI in Singapore. Candida spp. from BSI were collected from a tertiary and secondary referral hospital, and an obstetrics/paediatric hospital over a 3-year period. The most common isolates were Candida albicans (36%), Candida tropicalis (27%), Candida glabrata (16%) and Candida parapsilosis (16%). Candida parapsilosis and C. albicans were predominant in the paediatric hospital, and C. albicans and C. tropicalis predominant in the other two institutions. Candida tropicalis temporarily replaced C. albicans as the predominant strain from BSI in 2006. Overall, 87.3% of Candida isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, and 10.4% classified as susceptible-dose-dependent. Fluconazole resistance was detected in C. tropicalis (3.6%), C. parapsilosis (2.1%) and C. glabrata (4.0%). Candida albicans is the predominant species isolated from BSI in Singapore. However, non-albicans species accounted for nearly two-thirds of all cases of candidaemia and the relative increase in C. tropicalis infections deserves further investigation. Resistance to fluconazole was uncommon.
