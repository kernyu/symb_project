We determined the in vitro activities of tigecycline and imipenem against 49 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, including those resistant to imipenem. The MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC(50)) and the MIC(90) for tigecycline and imipenem were 2 and 2 mg/liter and 32 and 128 mg/liter, respectively, with 92 and 20%, respectively, of the strains being susceptible. Tigecycline did not show bactericidal activity in the time-kill studies (n = 9 strains). Imipenem showed bactericidal activity against seven out of nine strains. These in vitro results show that tigecycline has good in vitro bacteriostatic activity against A. baumannii, including strains resistant to imipenem.
