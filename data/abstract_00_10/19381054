BACKGROUND/AIMS: Eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) tend to decrease over the last few years. Apart from the antibiotic resistance and patients compliance, various factors have an influence on the efficacy of eradication therapy. We analyzed the inter-departmental differences in the eradication therapy for H. pylori infection. METHODS: Between January 2003 and June 2007, total 3,072 eradication regimens were prescribed to patients. Eradication rates according to departments - gastroenterology (GE), general internal medicine (IM) and family medicine (FM) - were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall eradication rate of first-line triple therapy was 82.5% and second-line quadruple therapy was 71.2%. In the department of IM and FM, the eradication therapy was applied more frequently to the patients with erosion only, not ulcer. Overall eradication rates according to the departments were 87.0% in GE, 81.1% in IM and 77.2% in FM (p=0.02 GE vs. IM and p<0.01 GE vs. FM, respectively). Eradication rate in patients with peptic ulcer was also significantly higher in GE compared with IM or FM. CONCLUSIONS: In primary clinic (IM and FM), the eradication therapy was frequently applied to erosion. The eradication rates of H. pylori in GE department were significantly higher than those of IM or FM. Inter-departmental differences of the eradication rate might be caused by patients' compliance to prescribed medication.
