Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial, specifically developed for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. It has a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against common respiratory pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. It also has activity against atypical pathogens, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Telithromycin maintains activity against beta-lactam and macrolide-resistant respiratory tract pathogens and does not appear to induce cross-resistance to other members of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) group of antimicrobials. It demonstrates bactericidal activity against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and has a prolonged concentration-dependent post-antibiotic effect (PAE) in vitro. The drug has favourable pharmacokinetics following oral administration. It is well absorbed, achieves good plasma levels and is highly concentrated in pulmonary tissues and white blood cells. In clinical trials, telithromycin given orally at a dose of 800 mg once daily for 5 - 10 days was as effective as comparator antimicrobials for the treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis and group A-beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis. The adverse events and safety profile were similar to comparator antimicrobials. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, nausea, headache and dizziness. Telithromycin should provide an effective, convenient and well-tolerated once-daily oral therapy for treatment of respiratory infections.
