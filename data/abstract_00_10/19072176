A third echinocandin, anidulafungin, has recently been approved for Candida infections in the non-neutropenic patient. In the EU it is indicated for invasive candidiasis; in 2006 it was approved in the USA for candida esophagitis, candidemia, and two types of invasive infections, peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscesses. It is fungicidal against Candida species and fungistatic against Aspergillus species. In addition to its favorable tolerability in studies to date, it does not need adjustment for renal or hepatic insufficiency and has no known drug interactions. A steady state concentration can be achieved on day 2 following a loading dose of twice the maintenance concentration on day 1, and the drug is administered intravenously once daily. Cross resistance with other classes of antifungals is not a concern as it possesses a unique mechanism of action.
