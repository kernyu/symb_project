Costimulation of T cells via CD28 promotes both proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. In this study, we show that the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) fully reverses resistance to CD95-mediated cell death after TCR/CD28 costimulation or superagonistic anti-CD28 mAb stimulation of primary rat lymph node T cells. This effect correlated with a pronounced superinduction of caspase-3 on both mRNA and protein levels, whereas its main antagonist, X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, was unaffected by inclusion of CsA. Apoptosis triggered by CD95 cross-linking was characterized by robust caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, CsA sensitization to CD95-mediated apoptosis of CD28-activated T cells did not alter mRNA stability of superinduced caspase-3 mRNA, suggesting a transcriptional regulation of the caspase-3 gene. Addition of Ca(2+) ionophores to TCR/CD28 or superagonistic CD28-stimulated cells reduced caspase-3 levels, further supporting a role for Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways in negatively regulating caspase-3. Taken together, these findings suggest that CsA promotes sensitivity to CD95-mediated apoptosis in CD28-stimulated T cells by superinduction of the caspase-3 gene via a mechanism involving suppression of the calcineurin pathway.
