Erythromycin and tetracycline resistance was analyzed in 37 Clostridium difficile clinical isolates. Strains of different clonal origins showed different erythromycin and tetracycline resistance determinants and different genetic arrangements of the elements. In strains of recent isolation, the presence of Tn916-like elements, never found before in C. difficile clinical isolates, has been demonstrated.
