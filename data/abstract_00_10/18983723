Large amounts of antimicrobial agents are still being used in modern swine production in many countries around the world. This facilitates the emergence and development of antimicrobial resistance. Bacteria causing infections in swine have in several cases acquired resistance to a number of the agents most commonly used for treatment, making it difficult to predict the efficacy of different antimicrobial agents without prior susceptibility testing. This review gives an overview of recent susceptibility data from different parts of the world and discusses the importance of the development of resistance not only in the treatment of infections in swine but also taking into account the human health implications of antimicrobial resistance.
