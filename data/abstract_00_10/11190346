S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci such as S. epidermidis are important causes of infection of the bloodstream, cardiac valves, implanted devices, and skin, with repercussions on mortality and increased economic costs. Treatment of staphylococcal infections is made difficult by the increasing emergence of resistance to beta-lactams and other antimicrobials, including reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. Penicillin must be used for infrequent penicillin-susceptible isolates, oxacillin and nafcillin are to be considered the major option for penicillin-resistant staphylococci, and glycopeptides are the drugs of choice for infections caused by methicillin-resistant strains. Co-trimoxazole, lincosamides, macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones are alternative agents, primarily in subjects allergic to beta-lactams. Newly introduced or experimental drugs, such as streptogramins (quinupristin-dalfopristin), oxazolidinones (linezolid), carbapenems (LY 333328), everninomicins (SCH 27899), and derivatives of tetracyclines (glycylcyclines), could be useful for therapy of infections caused by multiresistant staphylococci.
