Doxycycline is a semi-synthetic derivative of tetracycline family exhibiting an interesting pharmacokinetic profile since no dosage adjustment is required for renal failure. Doxycycline displays good bacteriostatic activity against most bacteria as well as anti-inflammatory activity. Bacterial resistance is mainly acquired. Many infectious diseases can be treated with doxycycline including brucellosis, pasteurellosis, borreliosis, rickettsioses, trepanomatosis, cholera, leptospirosis, Q fever, pulmonary and urinary infections due to Chlamydia and Mycoplasma, gonococcia, and anthrax. Doxycycline also prevents development of Plasmodium in the blood and is thus useful for malaria prophylaxis. In dermatology, doxycycline is indicated for acnea and rosacea. Doxycycline is well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects are stomach upset, nausea, and diarrhea, but new formulations that reduce these manifestations are now available. Phototoxicity is dose-dependant and other side effects are rare. Like other tetracylines, doxycycline is contraindicated in children, pregnant women after the second trimester, and breast-feeding mothers.
