Different national attitudes exist between countries in Europe concerning eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection due to the wide differences in Helicobacter pylori prevalence, gastric cancer risk, bacterial resistance to antibiotics, health care systems and financial resources. The Cervia Working Group Report has been established in order to fill the gap in the absence of National Guidelines in Italy concerning the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. The recommendations made are, by and large, similar to the European Guidelines but differ slightly with regard to the "test-and-treat" approach to young dyspeptics without sinister symptoms. In the absence of a national validation of this strategy a case-by-case assessment of dyspepsia has been promoted, both at primary care and specialist level. Another area of partial disagreement concerns the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients undergoing long-term proton pump inhibitor treatment which has not been generally recommended as scientific evidence in support of this policy is at present rather weak.
