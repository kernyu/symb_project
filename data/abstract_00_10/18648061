The resistance rates of intestinal Escherichia coli populations from poultry were determined during treatment and withdrawal period with 3 antimicrobial agents commonly used as therapeutics in poultry medicine. A total of 108 chickens were considered: 18 were treated orally with enrofloxacin, 18 with doxycycline, and 18 with sulfonamides, whereas another 18 chickens were maintained as controls for each antimicrobial group. Fecal samples were taken during the treatment and after the withdrawal period, and E. coli were isolated through Fluorocult media plating. A total of 648 E. coli strains (216 per antimicrobial tested) were isolated and identified though biochemical methods. Minimal inhibitory concentrations to the antimicrobials used were also determined using a broth microdilution method. The resistance rates of intestinal E. coli to all of the antimicrobials tested significantly increased during the course of the therapeutic treatment. In addition, significant differences (P = 0.0136) in resistance rates persisted between the intestinal E. coli of the enrofloxacin-treated and control batches until the end of the withdrawal period, but this difference was not observed for the cases of doxycycline or sulfonamides treatments. Antimicrobial use in poultry medicine seems to select for antimicrobial-resistant strains of pathogenic bacterial species such as E. coli. In some cases, the higher frequencies of resistant strains may persist in the avian intestinal tract until the end of the withdrawal period, when it is legal to use these animals for human consumption.
