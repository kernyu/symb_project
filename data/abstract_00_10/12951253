Moraxella bovis expresses an iron-repressible 79-kDa outer-membrane protein, IrpA. DNA and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis indicate that IrpA is closely related to FrpB of Neisseria meningitidis, FetA of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and CopB of Moraxella catarrhalis. The results of manganese mutagenesis and a gel-shift assay suggested that the transcription of irpA is negatively regulated by the ferric uptake regulator. The insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette into the irpA gene affected the strain's ability to utilize bovine transferrin and lactoferrin. IrpA was detected in geographically diverse clinical isolates, and the antigenicity of IrpA was conserved in all the isolates tested. Therefore, IrpA may have potential as a candidate vaccine.
