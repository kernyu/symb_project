The genetic structure of A. baumannii hospital isolates, formed in the course of 2002 - 2004 in an intensive care unit for burn patients (St. Petersburg) was studied. The prolonged circulation of only some clonal strains was shown, 35% of the isolates belonged to dominating strains. Phenotypically, all cultures were characterized by resistance to the preparations of the cephalosporin row and gentamicin. The presence of class 1 integron with variable segment sized 2.5 kbp was found in the genotype of four isolates with the use the polymerase chain reaction. The restriction analysis revealed its similarity with integron, detected earlier (in 1989 - 2001 ) in A. baumannii in European hospitals abroad.
