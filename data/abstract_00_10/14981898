BACKGROUND: Malignant progression of lymphoma cells is associated with acquisition of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, xc-, enhancing cystine uptake. Recently, we showed that sulfasalazine (SASP) is a specific xc- inhibitor. Here, we investigated xc- in mammary cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression and function of xc- were evaluated by RT-PCR and 35S-cystine uptake analysis. RESULTS: Xc- expression was elevated 4-fold (p < 0.001) in cells of the most malignant line, MDA-MB-231, associated with increased 35S-cystine uptake (p < 0.001). Proliferation was inhibited by 0.2-0.5 mM SASP. 2-Mercaptoethanol (60 microM), a cystine uptake enhancer, completely prevented SASP-mediated growth inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cultures, but only partially in 184A1 and MCF-7 cultures. SASP-induced growth arrest was reversible and not cell cycle-specific. CONCLUSION: The results suggest: (i) malignant progression of human mammary cancer may be associated with acquisition of xc- expression potentially leading to increased growth autonomy and drug resistance, (ii) xc- may act as a therapeutic target.
