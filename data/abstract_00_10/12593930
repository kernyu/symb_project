The presence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in various foods of animal origin was surveyed in northwestern Greece. Six hundred samples of unpasteurized cows', ewes' and goats' milk, raw minced meat, uncooked frozen beef hamburgers, sandwiches (containing ham or turkey, mixed vegetable salad with mayonnaise and lettuce), fresh traditional Greek pork sausages and swine intestines appropriate for traditional Greek kokoretsi were assayed for E. coli serogroup O157:H7 using the standard cultural method and the immunomagnetic separation technique. The pathogen was detected in 1 out of 100 (1.0%) samples of ewes' milk, 1 out of 75 (1.3%) fresh sausages and 1 out of 50 (2.0%) swine intestines prepared for kokoretsi. The isolated strains were nonsorbitol fermenters, MUG-negative, O157 agglutinating, verotoxin-producing and carried both VT1 and VT2 genes. The three isolated strains were tested for antibiotic resistance and were found to be susceptible to eight antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tetracycline).
