AIMS: To investigate the effects of salicylates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae exposed to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). METHODS AND RESULTS: Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cultured through to the postlogarithmic phase of growth. Stress was induced by the addition of 1.5 mmol l(-1) H(2)O(2) for 1 h, while N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSSG) were used as control agents that affect the redox balance. Sodium salicylate, at 0.01-10 mmol l(-1)or acetylsalicylic acid, at 0.02-2.5 mmol l(-1) was administered at various times before hydrogen peroxide stress. Both agents conferred resistance to a subsequent hydrogen peroxide stress, similarly to the induction of the adaptive response observed upon pretreatment with NAC and GSSG. Sodium salicylate was more potent as a short-term, but not as a long-term pretreatment agent, compared to acetylsalicylic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological pretreatment with salicylates resulted in dose related increases in cell survival, indicating the induction of the protective response in yeast. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The possible role of salicylates in the modulation of the hydrogen peroxide stress response in eukaryotic cells address questions on the effects of these commonly used therapeutic agents in a number of disorders exhibiting an oxidative stress component.
