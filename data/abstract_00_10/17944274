The VII International Symposium on Respiratory Viral Infections was a multidisciplinary forum for the presentation of recent advances in respiratory virus research with special emphasis on antiviral therapies and vaccine strategies. Topics covered in invited lectures included detection of novel respiratory viral pathogens and viral evolution, characterization of the 1918 pandemic virus, human metapneumovirus infections, human respiratory epithelial cultures for studying viral pathogenesis, the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of asthma, influenza-bacterial interactions, advances in generating vaccine candidates against global respiratory threats like avian influenza and SARS, antiviral resistance surveillance in influenza viruses, and a mini-symposium on advances in viral diagnostics. Other talks covered the live, attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine, monoclonals for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), mechanisms of antiviral resistance in influenza B, and novel inhibitors for influenza, RSV and rhinovirus infections.
