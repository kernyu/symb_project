Tigecycline is the first member of a new class of broad-spectrum antibacterials, the glycylcyclines, that has been specifically developed to overcome the two major mechanisms of tetracycline resistance (ribosomal protection and efflux). In vitro, tigecycline was active against a wide range of Gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria implicated in complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs). Intravenously administered tigecycline (recommended dosage regimen 100 mg initially, followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5-14 days) has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cSSSIs and cIAIs. In well designed, pivotal phase III studies, tigecycline monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy with vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 2 g every 12 hours in hospitalised adult patients with cSSSIs (two trials; pooled clinical cure rates, 86.5% vs 88.6%) or broad-spectrum therapy with imipenem/cilastatin 200-500 mg/200-500 mg every 6 hours in hospitalised adult patients with cIAIs (two trials; pooled clinical cure rates, 86.1% vs 86.2%). Tigecycline was generally well tolerated in phase III studies; nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were the most frequent adverse events in patients treated with tigecycline or an active comparator (vancomycin plus aztreonam or imipenem/cilastatin).
