Enterobacter aerogenes is an agent of hospital-acquired infection that exhibits a remarkable resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics during therapy. Five successive isolates of E. aerogenes infecting a patient and exhibiting a multiresistance phenotype to beta-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones were investigated. Among these clinical strains, four presented resistant phenotypes during successive imipenem and colistin treatments. The involved resistance mechanisms exhibited by the successive isolates were associated with alterations of the outer membrane that caused a porin decrease and lipopolysaccharide modifications.
