Municipal and agricultural pollution affects the Rio Grande, a river that separates the United States from Mexico. Three hundred and twenty-two Escherichia coli isolates were examined for multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes and the prevalence of class 1 and class 2 integron sequences. Thirty-two (10%) of the isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Four (13%) of these isolates contained class 1-specific integron sequences; one isolate contained class 2 integron-specific sequences. Sequencing showed that the class 1 integron-bearing strain contained two distinct gene cassettes, sat-1 and aadA. Although three of the four class 1 integron-bearing strains harbored the aadA sequence, none of the strains was phenotypically resistant to streptomycin. These results suggest that integron-bearing E. coli strains can be present in contaminated irrigation canals and that these isolates may not express these resistance markers.
