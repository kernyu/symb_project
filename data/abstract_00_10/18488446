The results of molecular analysis of 15 influenza A(H3N2) and 17-A(H1N1) epidemic strains isolated in the Russian Federation in 1995-2007 are described. The analysis on the M2 and neuraminidase influenza A virus genes was performed. The M2 sequences analysis among the remantadin resistant viruses demonstrated the S31N substitution in all strains. Besides S31N substitution, additional mutations were detected in both proteins. Mutations associated with S31N substitution were detected in each virus subtype, which may be considered as new markers for the identification of remantadin-resistant strains. The sequencing of the NA segments from all viruses showed no amino acid substitutions known to cause resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors, which indicates susceptibility to NA inhibitors among the strains.
