The susceptibilities of 40 recent Belgian field isolates of Mycoplasma bovis to 10 antimicrobial agents were assessed. Tiamulin was the most active antimicrobial agent against M bovis, with an initial inhibitory concentration (IIC50) of 0.06 microg/ml, but it is not licensed for the treatment of cattle. All three fluoroquinolones tested (danofloxacin, enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin) were effective against strains of M bovis, and had a minimum mycoplasmacidal concentration (MMC50) less than or equal to 1 microg/ml. Gentamicin was poorly effective, having an IIC50 of 8 microg/ml. Many strains of M bovis were resistant to tylosin, spectinomycin, lincomycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline.
