The performances of the Etest and the disk diffusion methods for testing of the susceptibilities of 235 Candida glabrata isolates to fluconazole and voriconazole were compared with that of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) approved standard broth microdilution (BMD) method. The NCCLS method used RPMI 1640 broth medium, and MICs were read after incubation for 48 h at 35 degrees C. Etest MICs were determined with RPMI 1640 agar containing 2% glucose (RPG agar) and with Mueller-Hinton agar containing 2% glucose and 0.5 microg of methylene blue per ml (MBE agar) and were read after incubation for 48 h at 35 degrees C. Disk diffusion testing was performed with MBE agar, 25-microg fluconazole disks, and 1- microg voriconazole disks and by incubation at 35 degrees C for 24 h. Overall agreements between the Etest and the BMD MICs obtained with RPG and MBE agars were 91 and 96%, respectively, for fluconazole and 93 and 95%, respectively, for voriconazole. Categorical agreements between the agar-based methods and BMD were 52.3 to 64.7% with fluconazole and 94.8 to 97.4% with voriconazole. The vast majority of the discrepancies by the disk diffusion and Etest methods with fluconazole were minor errors. The agar-based methods performed well in identifying isolates with resistance to fluconazole and decreased susceptibility to voriconazole.
