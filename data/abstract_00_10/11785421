It has been shown that cells of trichoma cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum G o m. strain CALU 465 do not possess natural resistance to antibiotics ampicyllin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and canamycin. A shuttle vector pSTS1 has been constructed on the basis of cyanobacterial plasmid pSM1 and vector pBR 322. Conditions have been developed and conjugative transfer of pSTS1 to the cells of cyanobacterium P. boryanum has been performed. As the result of expression of beta-lactamase gene pSTS1 the resistance of cells-conjugantes to ampicillin increased by three orders.
