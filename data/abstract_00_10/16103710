The diagnosis and management of bacterial diseases has been done by traditional methods for a century or more. With the advent of molecular methods, however, these traditional approaches are being challenged. This review examines the pros and cons of traditional versus modern methods and tries to answer the question: when are molecular methods useful or essential? The following topics are addressed with appropriate examples: diagnosis; identification, typing and fingerprinting; pathogenesis; patient management; susceptibility to disease, and resistance to antimicrobial agents. It was concluded that there is still a place for both traditional and modern molecular methods, and training of staff must include both methodologies. Innovation is encouraged--but new technologies must be thoroughly tested before introduction into the routine lab. Liaison between laboratory scientist and physician is important, but above all experience is paramount.
