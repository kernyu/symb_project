This review describes the present status of purely synthetic peroxides and 1,2,4-trioxanes and how they perform in various preclinical tests as potential antimalarial drug candidates. The literature is reviewed from 1986 onwards, comprising mostly articles published in the last ten years. As several papers on antimalarial peroxides have already been published, this review focuses on more recent studies detailing the novelty and potential of synthetic peroxides.
