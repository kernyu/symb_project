Salicylic acid is an important regulator of induced plant resistance to pathogens. Consequently, the biosynthesis of salicylic acid and its regulation has received a lot of attention. Salicylic acid can be made from phenylalanine via cinnamic and benzoic acid. Recently, genetic studies in Arabidopsis have shown that salicylic acid is made in the chloroplast from isochorismate, a pathway that is known to operate in prokaryotes.
