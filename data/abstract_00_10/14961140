Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for numerous infections, mainly in hospitals and in immunocompromised patients. This pathogen has a great ability to acquire resistance. Given the increase in prevalence of multiresistant isolates, a continuous analysis of the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to antimicrobial drugs is required. We therefore evaluated all the P. aeruginosa isolates from clinical samples taken at our hospital in 2002, and included only one sample per patient. We studied the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to 11 active antimicrobial drugs. Identification of the isolate and determination of susceptibility were carried out using an automated system (VITEK 2, bioMerieux). Overall, the antibiotic with the highest in vitro activity was piperacillin-tazobactam. The percentage of multiresistant isolates (resistance to at least two groups of antibiotics) was 20.9%. In samples taken from the ICU, it showed high resistance to imipenem (20%). P. aeruginosa isolated from abscesses was extremely resistant to gentamicin (41.6%). The resistance of P. aeruginosa to antimicrobial drugs is inconsistent as it depends on the source of the isolates and the type of clinical samples. Consequently, individualized monitoring should be conducted.
