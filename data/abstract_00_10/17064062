The 3-aminoquinzolinediones represent a new series of antibacterial agents structurally related to the fluoroquinolones. They are inhibitors of bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase IV and demonstrate clinically useful antibacterial activity against fastidious Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including multidrug- and fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms. These agents also demonstrate in vivo efficacy in murine systemic infection models.
