Salmonella enterica serotype Newport is an important cause of non-typhoidal salmonellosis, a clinically less severe infection than typhoid fever caused by S. enterica serotype Typhi. In this investigation, the virulence genotypes of S. enterica Newport isolated from a backwater environment were compared with Salmonella Typhi from clinical cases in the same region where salmonellosis is endemic. Genotyping was done by PCR screening for virulence markers associated with Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) and plasmids. The virulence genes associated with SPIs I-VI were detected in 95-100% of all the isolates, while the viaB locus representing SPI-7 was detectable in 66 and 73% of the environmental and clinical isolates, respectively. A significant number of Salmonella Newport lacked virulence genes shdA and sopE compared to S. Typhi. All S. Typhi and S. Newport isolates lacked large plasmid-borne virulence genes spvR and pefA. Further investigations into the antimicrobial resistance of S. Newport revealed multiple drug resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, cephalothin, and cephalexin. In comparison, S. Typhi were susceptible to all clinically relevant antimicrobials. The results of this study will help in understanding the spread of virulence genotypes and antibiotic resistance in S. Newport in the region of study.
