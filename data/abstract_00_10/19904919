Phytochemical investigation of the stem bark of Beilschmiedia zenkeri led to the isolation of four new methoxylated flavonoid derivatives, (2S,4R)-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavan-4-ol (1), (2S,4R)-4,5,6,7-tetramethoxyflavan (2), beilschmieflavonoid A (3), and beilschmieflavonoid B (4), together with seven known compounds. The structures of 1-4 were established by spectroscopic methods, and their relative configurations confirmed by X-ray crystallographic and CD analysis. The isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antibacterial activity against three strains of bacteria, Pseudomonas agarici, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus minor, and for their antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium falciparum, chloroquine-resistant strain W2.
