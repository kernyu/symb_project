In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of the two DNA N-glycosylases Ntg1p and Ntg2p does not result in a spontaneous mutator phenotype, whereas simultaneous inactivation of Ntglp, Ntg2p and Radlp or Rad14p, both of which are involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), does. The triple mutants rad1 ntg1 ntg2 and rad14 ntg1 ntg2 show 15- and 22-fold increases, respectively, in spontaneous forward mutation to canavanine resistance (CanR) relative to the wild-type strain (WT). In contrast, neither of these triple mutants shows an increase in the incidence of Lys+ revertants of the lys1-1 ochre allele. Furthermore, the rad1 ntg1 ntg2 mutant is hypersensitive to the lethal effect of H2O2 relative to WT, rad1 and ntg1 ntg2 mutant strains. Moreover, the rad1 ntg1 ntg2 strain is hypermutable (CanR and Lys+) upon exposure to H2O2, relative to WT, rad1 and ntg1 ntg2 strains. Mutagen sensitivity and enhanced mutagenesis in the rad1 ntg1 ntg2 triple mutant, relative to the other strains tested, were also observed upon exposure to oxidizing agents such as tertbutylhydroperoxide and menadione. In contrast, the sensitivity of the rad1 ntg1 ntg2 triple mutant to gamma-irradiation does not differ from that of the WT. However, the triple mutant shows an increase in the frequency of Lys+ revertants recovered after gamma-irradiation. The results reported in this study demonstrate that base excision repair (BER) mediated by Ntglp and Ntg2p acts synergistically with NER to repair endogenous or induced lethal and mutagenic oxidative DNA damage in yeast. The substrate specificity of Ntg1 p and Ntg2p, and the spectrum of lesions induced by the DNA-damaging agents used, strongly suggest that oxidized DNA bases, presumably oxidized pyrimidines, represent the major targets of this repair pathway.
