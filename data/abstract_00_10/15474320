A commercially prepared dried-broth microdilution panel (Sensititre, TREK Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH) was compared with a reference frozen-broth microdilution panel for antifungal susceptibility testing of 728 clinical isolates of Candida spp. and 98 clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans. The antifungal agents tested were amphotericin B, fluconazole, 5-fluorocytosine (5FC), itraconazole, and voriconazole. Microdilution testing was performed according to NCCLS recommendations. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) endpoints were read visually after 48 hours of incubation (72 hours for C. neoformans) and were assessed independently for each microdilution panel. Discrepancies among MIC endpoints of no more than 2 log(2) dilutions were used to calculate the percentage of agreement. Overall levels of agreement between the study and reference panels were 98% for Candida spp. and 93% for C. neoformans. The agreement for each antifungal agent ranged from 96.6% for voriconazole to 99.4% for amphotericin B. The TREK dried microdilution panel appears to be a viable alternative to frozen-broth microdilution panels for testing of Candida spp. and C. neoformans.
