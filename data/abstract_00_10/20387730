During the two years period the prevalence of uropathogens responsible for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in outpatients was investigated including their differences in antimicrobial susceptibility according to the age and gender. Indwelling urinary catheter (IUC) constitutes 0.3% of all processed urine samples. Significant bacteriuria was found in 92.5% of IUC, and polimicrobial ethiology in 63.2%. The most CAUTI (79.3%) was found in elderly male patients (> 65 years). The most frequently isolated uropathogens were Esherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. The very high resistance of all Enterobacteriaceae to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and co-trimoxazole was observed with significantly much higher fluoroquinolone (p < 0.01) and co-trimoxazole (p < 0.05) resistance in elderly male patients as compared with younger ones.
