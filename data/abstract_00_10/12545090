Rates of antiretroviral resistance in recently transmitted virus in Sydney, Australia fluctuated over the past decade, influenced by treatment trends. Current rates of drug resistance are not high in historical terms or compared with those reported. Rates of resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors peaked in the mid-1990s, fell dramatically with the introduction of combination therapy and appear to have plateaued at 10-15% over the past 3 years. Primary resistance mutations in the protease gene are still rare.
