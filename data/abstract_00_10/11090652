Organic nitrates, such as glyceryltrinitrate, are nitric oxide (NO) donor drugs that engender tolerance with long-term use. Here, we tested the hypothesis that our novel S-nitrosothiols, N-(S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine)-2-amino-2-deoxy-1,3,4,6, tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranose (RIG200) and S-nitroso-N-valeryl-D-penicillamine (D-SNVP), do not induce vascular tolerance ex vivo. Femoral arteries from adult male Wistar rats were preconstricted with phenylephrine and perfused with the NO synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Perfusion pressure was measured during 20 h treatment with supramaximal concentrations of NO donor (10 microM). Perfusion with glyceryltrinitrate caused a vasodilatation, which recovered over 2-20 h. In contrast, the S-nitrosothiols caused vasodilatations that were maintained throughout the 20 h perfusion period. Responses to S-nitrosothiols were partially reversed by the NO scavenger ferrohaemoglobin and fully reversed by the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor [1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazole [4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ). Glyceryltrinitrate-tolerant vessels were fully responsive to bolus injections of S-nitrosothiols. Resistance to tolerance is an attractive property of our novel compounds, particularly in view of their sustained activity in arteries with damaged endothelium.
