Leishmaniasis treatment is hampered by the increased appearance of treatment failure. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are usually involved in drug resistance both in tumor cells and in microorganisms. Here we report the characterization of an ABCG-like transporter, LiABCG6, localized mainly at the plasma membrane in Leishmania protozoan parasites. When overexpressed, this half-transporter confers significant resistance to the leishmanicidal agents miltefosine and sitamaquine. This resistance phenotype is mediated by a reduction in intracellular drug accumulation. LiABCG6 also reduces the accumulation of short-chain fluorescent phospholipid analogues of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. As a whole, these results suggest that LiABCG6 could be implicated in phospholipid trafficking and drug resistance.
