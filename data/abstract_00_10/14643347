Ureas of 5-aminopyrazole and 2-aminothiazole emerged as lead compounds from a high-throughput screen assaying the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Structure-activity relationships were developed for each compound series. Several compounds were also tested for activity against drug resistant strains of S. aureus in vivo.
