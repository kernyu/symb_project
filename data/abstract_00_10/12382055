Rifamycin SV contains one amide nitrogen atom at its C(7)N moiety. Earlier labeling studies suggested that nitrogen might be incorporated from a pathway involved in a molybdenum-dependent nitrate reductase. However, no genetic evidence is available thus far. The structural gene moeA, which is involved in molybdopterin synthesis in various organisms, has been cloned from rifamycin SV-producing Amycolatopsis mediterranei strain U32. The amino acid sequence deduced from the moeA gene showed significant similarity to members of the MoeA protein family and contains all the structural features that are highly conserved in the putative functional domains of MoeA proteins. Southern hybridization showed that there is only one moeA gene in the A. mediterranei genome. To further investigate the possible physiological function of the moeA gene, a double crossover gene replacement was achieved by inserting an aparmycin resistance gene into moeA in the A. mediterranei U32 chromosome. Phenotype analysis showed that the moeA gene is required for A. mediterranei growth in a minimal medium with nitrate as sole nitrogen source, possibly because nitrate reductase activity is diminished due to disruption of the moeA gene. Compared to the wild type strain, moeA-disrupted mutants lost 95% of their rifamycin SV production capacity in complex fermentation media. The results demonstrate that the moeA gene is necessary for rifamycin SV production in A. mediterranei, and that the nitrogen assimilation pathway involved in nitrate reductase is the major pathway for the genesis of the amide nitrogen atom in the rifamycin SV molecule.
