Resistance to linezolid has been associated with a G2576U mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA. We analyzed nine clinical isolates of linezolid-resistant enterococci and showed a clear association between the number of 23S rRNA genes containing this mutation and the level of linezolid resistance expressed.
