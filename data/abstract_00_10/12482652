Susceptibility to IVM (IVM) of "strain A" Haemonchus contortus which had been exposed to IVM four times over a 2-year period was compared to IVM susceptibility of "strain C" H. contortus which had no prior field exposure to IVM, by in vivo and in vitro methods. In vivo, the percentage reduction in faecal egg counts (FEC) and the total worm counts (TWC) were compared between control animals (lambs and kids) and animals treated with low dose IVM (20 microg/kg). In vitro susceptibility to IVM was evaluated by larval migration inhibition (LMI) after the two strains of H. contortus were exposed to different concentrations of IVM. The dose response, measured as the proportion of larvae inhibited from migrating, was used to estimate LD(50). Although differences in response to IVM in the in vivo determinations were not significant, "strain A" H. contortus had a significantly higher LD(50) than "strain C" in the LMI assay. Coincident with the conduct of the in vivo experiment, it was observed that "strain A" H. contortus established and survived better than "strain C" in the control lambs.
