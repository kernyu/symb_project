During 2000-2002, 20 clinical microbiology centres collected 1623 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, rifampicin and teicoplanin was determined locally by the Etest and/or by the microdilution method by three co-ordinating centres. Total resistance to penicillin increased from 15.2% to 16.1% and macrolide resistance increased from 37.9% to 43.7%. Overall, the most effective drugs (>99% susceptible strains) were amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, levofloxacin and rifampicin. The most frequent serotypes were: 23F (15.8%), 3 (10.8%) 14 (9.1%), 19F (9.1%), 6B (7.2%), 19A (6.9%) and 6A (4.8%). In conclusion, penicillin and macrolide resistance is increasing in Italy, whilst fluoroquinolone currently remains active. The most common serotypes circulating are included in the heptavalent conjugate vaccine, with the exception of type 3.
