Seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality in adults and children. However, a worldwide influenza pandemic could cause considerably more deaths (20-40 million) and would majorly disrupt everyday life in most countries. Oseltamivir has proven to be safe and effective for the prevention or treatment of all known influenza subtypes, reducing the severity and duration of symptoms, the complications arising from influenza infection (pneumonia, hospitalisation, antibiotic use) and mortality. Oseltamivir has been shown to be effective against pandemic strains of influenza, including the currently circulating strain (H5N1). As a result, the World Health Organization has recommended the stockpiling of oseltamivir in the event of an influenza pandemic.
