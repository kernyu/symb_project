Beta-lactamases of Enterobacteriaceae are the most important mechanism of resistance against beta-lactam drugs. Two types of beta-lactamases can confer resistance against 3rd generation cephalosporins. Chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases are inducible and are not inhibited by clavulanic acid. Resistance due to these enzymes is non-transferable. The 2nd type of enzyme is plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, which are inhibited by clavulanic acid. These enzymes are more important clinically as these can be transferred between various species of Enterobacteriaceae. These enzymes are called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been responsible for numerous outbreaks of infection throughout the world and pose challenging infection control issues. Antibacterial choice is often complicated by multi-resistance. ESBLs can confer resistance against all beta-lactam drugs except carbapenems and cephamycins. Nursing home patients may be an important reservoir of ESBL-containing multiple antibiotic-resistant organisms. Use of broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and probably poor infection control practices may facilitate spread of this plasmid-mediated resistance. In addition to known populations at risk, ambulatory patients with chronic conditions represent another patient population that may harbor ESBL-producing organisms. Various methods can be used for detection of ESBLs in the laboratory. These tests include double disc diffusion test, Vitek ESBL test, E Tests, MIC Determination, genetic method, and isoelectric focusing (IEF).
