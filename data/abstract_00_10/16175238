The increasing antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria calls for the development of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Possible approaches include the development of novel, broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as specific targeting of individual bacterial virulence factors. It is impossible to decide currently which strategy will prove more successful in the future since they both promise different advantages, but also introduce diverse problems. Considering both approaches, our laboratory's research focuses on the evaluation of hemocidins, broad-spectrum antibacterial peptides derived from hemoglobin and myoglobin, and staphostatins, specific inhibitors of staphopains -- Staphylococcus aureus secreted proteases that are virulence factors regarded as possible targets for therapy. The article summarizes recent advances in both fields of study and presents perspectives for further development and possible applications.
