Based on resistance selection, the life tables of abameetin-resistant (AbR), fenpropathrin-resistant (FeR), and susceptible (S) strains of Tetranychus cinnabarinus at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 C, 28 degrees C, 31 degrees C, 34 degrees C, and 36 degrees C were constructed, and the development duration, fertility, and intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) of the strains were compared, aimed to understand the relative fitness of T. cinnabarinus resistant strains at different temperatures. The results indicated that compared with S strain, AbR and FeR strains had longer development duration at 15 degrees C but lower fertility at 20 degrees C-28 degrees C, and their relative fitness (represented by r(m)) was smaller at 15 degrees C but similar at 20 degrees C - 31 degrees C. For AbR and FeR strains, the fitness cost was moderate at 15 degrees C but lower at 20 degrees C - 31 degrees C. However, at high temperatures ( > or =34 degrees C), FeR strain possessed remarkable fitness cost while AbR strain showed better fitness.
