Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is characterized by sudden onset of non-follicular aseptic pustules with erythema often accompanied by fever and leukocytosis. While the most frequent cause of AGEP is drug reactions, especially antibiotics. Occasional cases have been described as parainfectious. An 82-year-old female presented with recurrent AGEP along with a chronic urinary infection with Escherichia coli. Her cutaneous findings resolved following antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis. To the bets of our knowledge, this is the first case of AGEP associated with an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
