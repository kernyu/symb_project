In this study, a series of thiazolyl thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (Va-f and VIa-f) were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA ATCC 43300), methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA isolate), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 23556) and C. albicans (ATCC10145). All the compounds were found active against used microorganisms.
