Bacteria were isolated from dairy cows, dairy farm environments, and dairy workers in 2 geographically different areas of eastern and northern Taiwan. Isolates were evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility and the phylogenetics of isolated Escherichia coli O157:H7 were characterized. A total of 1,346 bacteria were identified, including 226 E. coli, 30 Pseudomonas spp. (7 Pseudomonas aeruginosa), 259 other gram-negative bacteria, 271 Enterococcus spp., 314 Staphylococcus spp., 195 Streptococcus spp., and 51 other gram-positive bacteria. Among them, 88% (1,184/1,346) of the isolates were resistant to sulfadimethoxine. The percentages of gram-negative bacteria resistant to oxy-tetracycline and streptomycin were 48% (249/515) and 78% (404/515), respectively. Gram-positive bacteria isolated from eastern Taiwan, the least polluted region of Taiwan, were found to have greater antimicrobial resistance than those isolated from northern Taiwan. Two E. coli O157:H7 from 2 different geographical areas were isolated. Both were vt2-positive but vt1-negative and had phylogenetic similarities of 82 and 67%, respectively, compared with previous isolates. Information on antimicrobial susceptibility revealed from this dairy farm survey may serve as a baseline for future studies and may also highlight the need to formulate better regulation strategies for the safe use of antimicrobials on food-producing farms.
