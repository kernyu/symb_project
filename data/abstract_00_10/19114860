OBJECTIVE: Whether therapeutic drug monitoring of protease inhibitors improves outcomes in HIV-infected patients is controversial. We evaluated this strategy in a randomized, open-label clinical trial, using a normalized inhibitory quotient (NIQ), which incorporates drug exposure and viral drug resistance. NIQs < or = 1 may predict poor outcome and identify patients who could benefit from dose escalation. DESIGN/METHODS: Eligible patients had a viral load > or =1000 copies/ml on a failing regimen, and began a new protease inhibitor containing regimen at entry. All FDA-approved protease inhibitors available during the study recruitment (June 2002-May 2006) were allowed. One hundred and eighty-three participants with NIQ < or = 1, on the basis of their week 2 protease inhibitor trough concentration and pre-entry drug resistance test, were randomized at week 4 to standard of care (SOC) or protease inhibitor dose escalation (TDM). The primary endpoint was change in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration from randomization to 20 weeks later. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were randomized to SOC and 92 to TDM. NIQs increased more in the TDM arm compared to SOC (+69 versus +25%, P = 0.01). Despite this, TDM and SOC arms showed no difference in outcome (+0.09 versus +0.02 log10, P = 0.17). In retrospective subgroup analyses, patients with less HIV resistance to their protease inhibitors benefited from TDM (P = 0.002), as did black and Hispanic patients (P = 0.035 and 0.05, respectively). Differences between black and white patients persisted when accounting for protease inhibitor susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: There was no overall benefit of TDM. In post hoc subgroup analyses, TDM appeared beneficial in black and Hispanic patients, and in patients whose virus retained some susceptibility to the protease inhibitors in their regimen.
