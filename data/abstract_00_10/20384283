In Burkina Faso, a Western African country, reports on pneumococci carriage, resistance patterns and serotypes are inconsistent. The present study was conducted in order to evaluate these parameters. Thus 860 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children attending vaccination centers for pneumococci isolation, identification and serotype determination. The susceptibility to 16 antibiotics was assayed as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS). The results revealed that the majority of children were of 2 to 24 months age and 73.4% of children were well vaccinated. A carriage rate of 50.6% was recoded among the children. The main serotypes were: 6 (22.22%); 23 (16.67%); 7 and 9 (3.70%); 4, 11, 14, 15, 20 and 24 (1.85%). Serotypesl9, 23, 6, 7 and 18 were linked to penicillin resistance. Globally, high resistance rates to: amikacin, tetracyclin, pefloxacin, cotrimoxazol and penicillins (resistance rates greater than 25%) were recorded; however the following antibiotics remained active on the strains: rifampicin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, spectinomycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, lincomycin and ciprofloxacin.
