Four hundred methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains (MRSA) from different geographical areas in Malaysia were tested for mupirocin susceptibility using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. The majority of these strains (98.75%) were susceptible to mupirocin with MICs of < or = 4 mg/l. Fifty-percent of these strains had MICs of 0.125 mg/l or less while 90% of the strains had MICs of 1 mg/l or less. Mupirocin resistance was detected in five strains (1.25%) and one of these (0.25%) had an MIC of 64 mg/l and the other four strains (1%), high-level resistance with MICs > 512 mg/l. Even though the rate of mupirocin resistance in MRSA is still low in Malaysia, its presence calls for a strict policy on mupirocin usage in Malaysian hospitals.
