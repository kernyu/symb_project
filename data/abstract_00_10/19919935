Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and ethanolic extracts of the aerial parts of Centaurea austro-anatolica Hub.-Mor. (Asteraceae) were evaluated against microorganisms, including multiresistant bacteria, using a paper disc diffusion method. The chloroform extract exhibited significant antibacterial activity toward all bacteria tested. The chemical composition of the chloroform extract was determined by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major compounds of the extract were caryophyllene oxide (21.32 %), spathulenol (10.86 %), n-tricosanol (9.58 %) and geranyl isovalerate (8.71 %).
