Bacterial pathogens are often involved in contact lens-related adverse responses. This study aimed to find antimicrobial peptides and proteins that effectively eradicate or inhibit ocular bacteria. The antimicrobials were screened against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria originating from ocular sources. The viability of these ocular bacteria was measured after exposure to the peptides and proteins. Two conditions were used to grow bacteria, low nutrient phosphate-buffered saline and high nutrient tryptone soya broth. Samples were taken at different times up to 48 h. In low nutrient conditions, protamine was found to be the most effective against all strains. Melittin was very effectve against all strains except Serratia and one Pseudomonas isolate which were partially affected. In high nutrient condition, only melittin was effective in killing Staphylococcus aureus. Protamine and the combination of protamine and melittin had the greatest effect in eradicating the bacteria tested in low nutrient condition. Protamine alone and its combination with melittin may have potential therapeutic agents for ocular infections in an era of emerging antibiotic resistance.
