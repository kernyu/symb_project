In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Wright and colleagues report an elegant method for inhibiting enzymes critical for rendering bacteria drug resistant. By using cationic peptides as inhibitors, the authors have exploited two antibacterial mechanisms, making it doubly difficult for microbial retaliation.
