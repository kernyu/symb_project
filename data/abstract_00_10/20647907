Abacavir's effect on cardiovascular function has not been studied prospectively. We measured augmentation index (a measure of arterial stiffness) in 20 men who switched from abacavir to tenofovir. After 4 weeks, mean augmentation index reduced from 22% by 4% (P = 0.03) and Framingham risk score by 2% (P = 0.01), which was driven by lower total cholesterol (0.8 mmol/l; P = 0.002). Consistent trends were observed through week 24. Changes in C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and D-dimer were inconsistent and only occurred from week 12. Abacavir may impair cardiovascular function by increasing total cholesterol levels.
