The incidence of Campylobacter jejuni has increased during the last decade, and today it is the leading cause of bacterial enteritis in most developed countries. Still, there is a lack of knowledge about infection routes and to what extent identified sources are responsible for spreading the bacterium to humans. The major objective of this work was to explore the genetic similarity between C. jejuni isolated from different sources. C. jejuni isolated from patients (n = 95), five types of meat (n = 71), and raw water (n = 11) during the year 2000 were subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The pulsotypes obtained after digestion with SmaI revealed not only that C. jejuni is genetically diverse but also that specific pulsotypes occur frequently. Five clusters comprising 88 of the 162 SmaI-digested isolates were obtained. After digestion with KpnI most isolates in four of the five clusters were still indistinguishable, while the fifth cluster was strongly dissolved. The clusters comprised high frequencies of human and meat isolates, while only one of nine water isolates belonged to a cluster. The largest cluster comprised 21 human isolates, one raw water isolate, and seven chicken meat isolates, originating from at least six different broiler flocks. Low frequencies of antibiotic resistance were revealed when the meat and water isolates were tested for sensitivity to six antibiotics. Interestingly, the five isolates resistant to quinolones displayed similar or identical pulsotypes. The results showed that PFGE has proved useful in identifying clones and will be used in future work focusing on identification and eradication of the major reservoirs for common clones.
