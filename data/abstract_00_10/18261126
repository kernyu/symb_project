As part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (TEST), bacterial isolates were collected from 39 centres in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK between January 2004 and August 2006. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined according to CLSI guidelines. Italy had the highest rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (36.4%), and was the only country to report vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (8.6%). Tigecycline was the only agent to which all Gram-positive isolates were susceptible. For many of the Gram-negative organisms collected, antimicrobial susceptibilities were lowest among isolates from Italy and highest among isolates from Spain. The notable exception was Acinetobacter baumannii, where the poorest susceptibility profile was among isolates from Spain. For A. baumannii, MIC(90)s of imipenem varied from 1 mg/L for isolates in France and Germany to > or =32 mg/L for isolates from Italy and Spain. Tigecycline was the only agent to maintain an MIC(90) of < or =1 mg/L against isolates from all five countries. The in-vitro activity of tigecycline against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates may make it valuable in the treatment of hospital infections, including those caused by otherwise antimicrobial-resistant organisms.
