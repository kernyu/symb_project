Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model system to characterize the effect of cytochrome b mutations found in fungal and oomycete plant pathogens resistant to Q(o) inhibitors (QoIs), including the strobilurins, now widely employed in agriculture to control such diseases. Specific residues in the Q(o) site of yeast cytochrome b were modified to obtain four new forms mimicking the Q(o) binding site of Erysiphe graminis, Venturia inaequalis, Sphaerotheca fuliginea and Phytophthora megasperma. These modified versions of cytochrome b were then used to study the impact of the introduction of the G143A mutation on bc(1) complex activity. In addition, the effects of two other mutations F129L and L275F, which also confer levels of QoI insensitivity, were also studied. The G143A mutation caused a high level of resistance to QoI compounds such as myxothiazol, axoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, but not to stigmatellin. The pattern of resistance conferred by F129L and L275F was different. Interestingly G143A had a slightly deleterious effect on the bc(1) function in V. inaequalis, S. fuliginea and P. megasperma Q(o) site mimics but not in that for E. graminis. Thus small variations in the Q(o) site seem to affect the impact of the G143A mutation on bc(1) activity. Based on this observation in the yeast model, it might be anticipated that the G143A mutation might affect the fitness of pathogens differentially. If so, this could contribute to observed differences in the rates of evolution of QoI resistance in fungal and oomycete pathogens.
