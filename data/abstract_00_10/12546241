The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate susceptibility rates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates against streptomycin, rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol between January 1998 and December 2000 in the Turkish Army. Specimens collected from patients were cultured both conventionally and radiometrically. Differentiation of MTBC bacteria from Mycobacteria other than tuberculosis bacilli was made by the BACTEC p-nitro-alpha-acetyl-amino-beta-hydroxypropiophenone test. Susceptibility testing of MTBC isolates was performed using the BACTEC radiometric susceptibility assay for mycobacteria. Most of the specimens originated from respiratory system. A total of 98 isolates in 1998, 123 isolates in 1999, and 84 isolates in 2000 were obtained and identified as MTBC using the radiometric BACTEC TB460 system. Initial resistance was most frequent to isoniazid followed by ethambutol, streptomycin , and rifampicin in this study period. The differences between resistance rates were not statistically significant on an annual basis. None of these isolates was resistant to all four antimycobacterial agents. Although resistance rates of our isolates were not as high as previously reported by some authors from Turkey and there was no significant difference between the annual susceptibility rates, routine screening of antituberculosis drug susceptibility should be continued to control the resistance development and its spread.
