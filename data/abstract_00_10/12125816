As the number of completed microbial genome sequences continues to grow, there is a pressing need for the exploitation of this wealth of data through a synergistic interaction between the well-established science of bacteriology and the emergent discipline of bioinformatics. Antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in virulent bacteria has become an increasing problem, with even the strongest drugs useless against some species, such as multi-drug resistant Enterococcus faecium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The global spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has contributed to the re-emergence of tuberculosis and the threat from new and emergent diseases. To address these problems, bacterial pathogenicity requires redefinition as Koch's postulates become obsolete. This review discusses how the use of bacterial genomic information, and the in silico tools available at present, may aid in determining the definition of a current pathogen. The combination of both fields should provide a rapid and efficient way of assisting in the future development of antimicrobial therapies.
