The treatment of systemic fungal infections has undergone changes in the last years as several new antifungal agents have come on the market. Because of the existence of these therapeutic alternatives, it is clear that not all fungal infections should be treated in the same manner; thus, the identification of fungal species and susceptibility testing are increasingly important. The emergence of strains resistant to antifungal agents has led to variations in the treatment guidelines between different geographical areas. Therefore, knowledge of the properties, mechanisms of action, and activity profile of antifungal agents is essential for daily clinical practice.
