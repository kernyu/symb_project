The susceptibilities to macrolides and telithromycin of 161 Streptococcus pyogenes and 145 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, consecutively isolated from five Greek hospitals, were determined by Etest. Moreover, mechanisms of resistance to macrolides were phenotypically and genetically determined by double disk induction test and PCR, respectively. Of the S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates, 42.8% and 30.8%, respectively, were found to be resistant to erythromycin. Of the erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates, 57.5% and 59.5%, respectively, displayed the M phenotype and harbored the mefA/E gene. Telithromycin was found to be more active than both erythromycin and clarithromycin against both species, with considerably lower MIC50 and MIC90 values.
