The problems addressed are: (1) comparison of prevalences of Salmonella spp. in different herd types in the Danish pig population after implementation of the Danish Salmonella Control Program (DSCP), and (2) to make a reference to a study from 1993/1994 (pre-implementation) with a discussion of possible biases when diagnostic methods differ slightly. The objectives were to present the prevalences of Salmonella spp., Salmonella Typhimurium, and multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT104 in Danish pig herds in 1998. Further, to discuss how herd prevalences may be compared to a previous study.A bacteriological study in 1998 comprised: (a) a random sample of slaughter pig producing herds (N=1962); (b) a random sample of farrow-to-grower (sow) herds (N=305); and (c) all breeding and multiplying (genetic) herds (N=366). A previous bacteriological study on Salmonella presence in 1993/1994 served as a model for the present study. The results of the study were that multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT104 was detected in one herd producing slaughter pigs. The herd apparent prevalences (HAPs) of Salmonella spp. were 11.7, 16.7 and 11.4% in genetic, sow, and slaughter pig herds, respectively. The conclusion of the study was that prevalence of multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT104 was low in the examined slaughter pig herds. The herd true prevalence (HTP) of Salmonella spp. in pigs had declined from before the start of the DSCP in 1993/1994 to 4 years later (1998).
