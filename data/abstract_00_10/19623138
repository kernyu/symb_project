Since antibiotic resistance among uropathogens have gradually been rising, so it is important to have knowledge about the pattern and antimicrobial susceptibility to choose the correct treatment regimen. A cross sectional study was carried out in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College between July 2007 to June 2008 to determine the prevalence, relationship between pyuria and urine culture and antibiotic resistance pattern among the bacterial isolates of community acquired UTI (CUTI). A total of 100 urine samples were subjected to microscopy and culture. Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was done by disk diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) 2007. Of the total samples, 45(45%) were culture positive and among them female were more (71.1%) than the male (28.9%). The predominant age group was 15-29. Having pus cell >5/HPF, 93.3% culture positive patients showed significant pyuria. The isolated microorganisms were Escherichia coli (73%) followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (11.1%), Klebsiella spp (6.7%), Enterobacter spp (4.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.2%) and Proteus spp (2.2%). All the bacterial isolates were sensitive to imipenem, while they showed variation in sensitivity to other commonly used antibiotics. Imipenem, nitrofurantoin and gentamicin were found to be effective for Gram-negative isolates and imipenem, azithromycin, vancomycin, ceftazidime for Gram-positive isolates. Our study emphasized over the changing etiology and emergence of drug resistance of the UTI within our country.
