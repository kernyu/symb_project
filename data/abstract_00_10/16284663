In this work an excitation emission molecular fluorescence technique with PARAFAC calibration is proposed for enrofloxacine determination in feeding water from poultry farms. In accordance with the working criteria of the 2002/657/EC European Decision, the proposed method has a capability of detection, CCbeta, of 6.8 microg l(-1), for both probabilities of false positive and false negative of 5%. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated and its precision is 1.7 microg l(-1), expressed as standard deviation. This method allows one to identify and determine the quantity of enrofloxacine present in water samples from poultry farms without it being necessary to determine the possible interferents, nor separate them in a step previous to calibration.
