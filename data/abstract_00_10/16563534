A rapid and accurate antimycobacterial susceptibility test is essential for effective treatment of tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate a modified method applying 2,3-diphenyl-5-thienyl-(2)-tetrazolium chloride (STC) to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline for susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A total of 132 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, forty-eight isolates showing resistance to one or more of the first-line antituberculosis drugs, and eighty-four fully susceptible isolates were collected from hospitals of a nationwide distribution from June to September 2004. The modified procedure was conducted basically according to the agar-proportion method described in the CLSI Guideline both with STC 50 mug/mL. The amount of growth in each well was recorded and graded at 2nd and 3rd weeks after inoculation. After 3 weeks of incubation, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the detection of drug-resistant strains of STC-containing agar proportion methods were 100%, except ethambutol-low level resistance, of which the diagnostic sensitivity was 93.4%. After two weeks of incubation in STC-containing agar proportion methods, one hundred of the 107 strain-drug combinations have shown drug resistance, indicating the sensitivity of 93.5%. Especially, all 41 isoniazid-resistant strains and 19 of 21 rifampin-resistant strains (90.5%) could be detected after two weeks of incubation. A modification of the agar proportion method using STC resulted in a reliable and more easily interpretable data, and detected most of resistant strains a week earlier than conventional method.
