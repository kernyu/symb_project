Present methods of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Bordetella pertussis are time consuming and require specialized media that are not commercially available. We tested 52 isolates of B. pertussis for resistance to erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and rifampin by agar dilution with Bordet-Gengou agar (BGA) containing 20% horse blood (reference method), Etest using BGA and Regan-Lowe agar without cephalexin (RL-C), and disk diffusion using BGA and RL-C. The organisms tested included four erythromycin-resistant isolates of B. pertussis from a single patient, a second erythromycin-resistant strain of B. pertussis from an unrelated patient in another state, and 47 nasopharyngeal surveillance isolates of B. pertussis from children in the western United States. The results of agar dilution testing using direct inoculation of the organisms suspended in Mueller-Hinton broth were within +/-1 dilution of those obtained after overnight passage of the inoculum in Stainer-Scholte medium, which is the traditional method of testing B. pertussis. The Etest method produced MICs similar to those of the agar dilution reference method for three of the four antimicrobial agents tested; the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole results were lower with Etest, particularly when the direct suspension method was used. Most of the Etest MICs, except for that of erythromycin, were on scale. Disk diffusion testing using RL-C medium was helpful in identifying the erythromycin-resistant strains, which produced no zone of inhibition around the disk; susceptible isolates produced zones of at least 42 mm. Thus, the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of B. pertussis can be simplified by using the Etest or disk diffusion on RL-C to screen for erythromycin-resistant isolates of B. pertussis.
