Klebsiella aerogenes K41, resistant to third generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, was isolated from clinical samples of 153 in-patients. Blood cultures accounted for 24 (15.7%) of isolates. The MIC(90) of ceftazidime for the isolates of 84 patients was >512 mg/l and was reduced to 2.0 by 4 mg/l of clavulanic acid, but only to 64 by 4 mg/l of sulbactam. Isolates of K. aerogenes K41 produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) SHV-5 and TEM-1, identified by isoelectric focusing. Plasmid profiles showed that co-dissemination of cephalosporin and aminoglycoside resistance, plus ESBL production, coincided with the acquisition of a 116-kb plasmid. This plasmid was transferable in vitro from K. aerogenes K41 to other serotypes and genera of the Enterobacteriaceae.
