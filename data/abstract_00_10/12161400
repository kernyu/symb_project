The susceptibility of 135 Streptococcus suis strains isolated from pigs (n = 110) and from humans (n = 25) to 13 antimicrobial agents was studied by microdilution and disc diffusion methods using Mueller-Hinton Agar II (MH) supplemented with either defibrinated sheep blood (MHSB) or horse serum (MHHS). Results were similar for both methods used except for penicillin G whose zone diameters were reduced with MHSB compared with MHHS. When MH was supplemented with sheep blood, 39% of S. suis strains classified as penicillin susceptible by MHHS microdilution showed intermediate susceptibility. Nearly all strains were susceptible to penicillin G (except by disc diffusion in MHSB), amoxicillin, ceftiofur, florfenicol, gentamicin and bacitracin. The least active antimicrobial agents were doxycycline and macrolides/lincosamides. High-level resistance (MIC > 500 mg/L or zone diameters < 10 mm) to streptomycin and kanamycin was detected in only a few strains. The virulence of strains did not seem to be related to antimicrobial resistance because no statistical difference was reported between the proportion of resistant strains of S. suis isolated from pigs with meningitis, septicaemia and arthritis, and those from tonsils and nasal cavities. However, significant differences were found in the proportions of macrolide- or doxycycline-resistant strains between S. suis serotype 2 and other serotypes. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing presented in this study indicate that beta-lactams can be used in empirical treatment of human and pig S. suis infections in France.
