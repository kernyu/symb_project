BACKGROUND: The pharmacodynamic parameter that best correlates with bacteriological eradication for fluoroquinolones is the free (f) area under the 24 h serum concentration curve (AUC24) to MIC (fAUC24/MIC) ratio. This study assessed garenoxacin fAUC24/MIC against ciprofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae using an in vitro pharmacodynamic model. METHODS: A total of 14 S. pneumoniae including 1 fluoroquinolone-susceptible and 13 ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae (ParC, efflux, ParC with efflux, and ParC and GyrA) were studied. The quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of parC and gyrA were sequenced and efflux was assessed using a reserpine assay. S. pneumoniae with garenoxacin MICs (mg/L) [number of strains] studied were: 0.03 [1], 0.06 [2], 0.12 [2], 0.25 [2], 0.5 [3], 1 [2] and 2 [2]. The in vitro pharmacodynamic model was inoculated with 1 x 10(6) cfu/mL and garenoxacin was dosed once daily at 0 and 24 h to simulate fAUC24 and t1/2 obtained after standard oral doses in healthy volunteers (400 mg once daily, free AUC24 20 mg.h/L, t1/2 16 h). Sampling was performed over 48 h to assess viable growth. RESULTS: Garenoxacin fAUC24/MIC achieved in the model ranged from 12 to 800. Garenoxacin fAUC24/MIC 200-800 was bactericidal (> or = 3 log(10) killing) at 6, 24 and 48 h against ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae mutants including ParC mutants only, efflux mutants only and ParC/efflux mutants. Garenoxacin fAUC24/MIC 48-96 was bactericidal (> or = 3 log(10) killing) at 24 and 48 h against all ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae mutants. Garenoxacin fAUC24/MIC < or = 24 (against ParC and GyrA mutants) resulted in a bacteriostatic effect with regrowth at 24 and 48 h. CONCLUSIONS: Garenoxacin was bactericidal against ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae at fAUC24/MIC > or = 48. Garenoxacin fAUC24/MIC < or = 24 resulted in a bacteriostatic effect with regrowth at 24 and 48 h.
