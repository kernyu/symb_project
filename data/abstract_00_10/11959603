Mechanisms for tetracycline and macrolide resistance in 54 isolates of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae were analyzed by PCR. The erm(B), erm(A), and mef(A) genes, either alone or in combination, were detected in all the erythromycin-resistant isolates. The tet(M) and tet(O) genes were responsible for tetracycline resistance. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA indicated different clonal origins of the isolates.
