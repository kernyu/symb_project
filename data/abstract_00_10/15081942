In the last two decades important progress has been made in the understanding the epidemiology and the disease burden of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted nematodes infection. In addition, practical tools for disease control have been developed and a strategy for the prevention and control of morbidy of schistosomaisis and soil-transmitted nematodes infection has been endorsed by the World Health Organization. This paper presents the recent progress in the prevention and control of these infections: the estimates of chronic and subtle morbidity in high risk groups and the evidence that these chronic and severe sequelae of infections can be reversed by appropriate treatment; the use of anthelminthic drugs during pregnancy and lactation; the relevance to control morbidity due to these infections also in pre-school children; the efficacy of anthelminthic drugs and the possible threat of drug resistance; price, quality and accessibility of treatment by delivering drugs through the school system and ways of reaching also non-enrolled school-age children. Finally, the strategy, targets and recommendations of the World Health Organization for the control of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted nematodes infection are described.
