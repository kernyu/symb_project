Occurrence and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from purulent infections of soft tissue were examined. The specimen was from hospital and ambulatory patients in 1996-1998. In general, 3665 samples were examined: 1841 wound swabs, 870 pus samples, 753 ulcer swabs and 101 from the decubitus ulcers. The ulcer of shank was the main diagnosis from which the Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated (38.8%). The susceptibility to antimicrobial agents according to the disc-diffusion method was analyzed among the 59 S. pyogenes strains. 10.2% strains with the MLSB resistance were detected. All S. pyogenes strains were susceptible to penicillin, new quinolons and glicopeptides.
