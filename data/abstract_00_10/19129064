We compared the in vitro activity of dalfopristin and quinupristin combined with five intravenous antibiotics in a 3-dimensional model. We tested six strains of Staphylococcus aureus selected with different patterns of resistance to methicillin and erythromycin. Dalfopristin and quinupristin displayed a very synergistic activity against all the strains with a mean 16- or 32-fold decrease of inhibitory concentrations in combination. That synergy was even better against erythromycin-resistant strains. In combination with tigecycline or fosfomycin, the antibacterial activity could be consistently enhanced with the same decrease of inhibitory concentrations. A synergy was also observed, less regularly and at a lower level, with rifampin, gentamicin or vancomycin. Combinations of dalfopristin and quinupristin with tigecycline or fosfomycin could be very interesting in clinical practice because the inhibitory effect could be achieved with very low concentrations of each component, even when erythromycin-resistant strains are concerned.
