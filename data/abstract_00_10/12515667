OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the use of antibiotics in a burn unit and the change in the drug - resistance of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). METHODS: By calculating the defined daily doses (DDD) of accumulated consumption of antibiotics per unit time and expense consumption, the use of different kinds of antibiotics in a burn unit in recent five years was analyzed, and correlation analysis between the change of antibiotics consumption amount and the change in drug - resistance level of S. aureus were carried out. RESULTS: Amikacin, gentamycin and cephazolin were the commonest antibiotics used in our burn unit. They were relatively cheaper than some other antibiotics. The consumption amount of compound antibiotics application was negatively correlated with the penicillin resistance level of S. aureus. Seven correlation coefficients between the consumption of first generation cephalosporins and seven coefficiences of resistance rate of S. aureus were negative. The consumption amount of the 3rd generation of cephalosporin application was positively related to the resistance of S. aureus to erythromycin and oxacillin. CONCLUSION: Accumulated DDD might be one of the ideal indices of reflecting antibiotic use. The changes in the consumption amount of the 1st and 3rd generation of cephalosporins containing beta-lactamase-inhibitor might affect the drug-resistance levels of S. aureus to some degree.
