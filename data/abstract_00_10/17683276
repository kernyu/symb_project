Tests based on nucleic acid amplification can rapidly detect mycobacteria in clinical samples. These appear to be promising and may change how mycobacterial diseases are diagnosed in the future. Utilization of nucleic acid hybridization and DNA sequencing has enabled the identification of mycobacteria to the species level and detection of mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance. Combining nucleic acid amplification with genotypic identification methods allows detection and identification of mycobacteria directly in clinical samples and, to a limited extent, detection of antimicrobial resistance. IFN-gamma-based assays provide results faster than the tuberculin skin test and address many of its shortcomings, and are thus poised to replace the latter in the coming years.
