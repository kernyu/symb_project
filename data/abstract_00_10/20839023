Leuconostoc is a Gram-positive coccus characterized by its resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics. Generally, this bacterium is susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics; however, here we present a leukemia patient who developed leuconostoc bacteremia during antimicrobial therapy with carbapenem. The appropriate choice of antibiotics at optimal doses enables leuconostoc infection to be overcome, even in compromised hosts. We report 3 cases of leuconostoc bacteremia: the leukemia case which was successfully treated, along with discussions of two other cases with malignancies.
