Genotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs was analysed in plasma from 57 acute or recent HIV seroconverters in Madrid. The overall prevalence of drug-associated primary resistance mutations was 25.8% in 1997-1999, but declined to 3.8% in 2000-2001. The lower rate in recent years suggested that most new HIV infections derive from viraemic individuals unaware of their HIV- positive status, rather than from those failing antiretroviral treatment. Drug-resistance testing is thus not required before beginning antiretroviral therapy.
