The susceptibility of 3,058 bacterial strains isolated between January and March, 1997 from patients with severe infections in Japan to ciprofloxacin and other injectable antimicrobial agents was measured using broth microdilution method. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were generally sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and arbekacin, and resistant to CPFX and other antibacterial agents. MIC90 of CPFX against Streptococcus pneumoniae, to which MIC of ampicillin was more than 4 micrograms/mL, was below 2 micrograms/mL. PRSP (Penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae), which was also resistant to cephalosporins and carbapenems, showed no cross-resistance to CPFX. The susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to CPFX was as high as that to carbapenems. Especially, MIC90 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 micrograms/mL. 3 strains of isolated 446 P. aeruginosa strains had blaIMP gene. CPFX and pazufloxacin demonstrated good susceptibility with 0.25 microgram/mL of MIC to 2 strains of these 3 strains. The susceptibility rate of the most common isolates from patients suffering from lower respiratory tract infections excluding MRSA to CPFX was more than 80% (indication: % strains < pneumonia break point).
