PURPOSE: The purpose is to investigate the potential correlation between antioxidant enzyme (AOE) levels and resistance to anticancer drugs in human gastric carcinoma cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Protein contents of AOEs such as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase-pi, p-glycoprotein, and multidrug resistance-associated protein were observed by Western blot analysis, and MnSOD activity was measured in six Korean gastric cancer cell lines. The direct correlation between AOEs and the chemosensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX), mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil, and vinblastine was analyzed by cytotoxicity test. MnSOD was overexpressed by transient transfection of human MnSOD cDNA. RESULTS: Expressions of AOEs in gastric cancer cell lines were variable. MnSOD expression was related with the resistance to DOX and mitomycin C but not with that to 5-fluorouracil and vinblastine. In comparison, expressions of other AOEs, p-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein, were not correlated with tumor sensitivity to any of the drugs used. Cell lines with a high MnSOD protein content showed higher MnSOD activity than those with a low MnSOD protein content. In addition, MnSOD overexpression increased the resistance of gastric carcinoma cells to DOX. CONCLUSIONS: MnSOD is an important factor of drug response to reactive oxygen species-generating anticancer drugs in the gastric cancer cells. Thus, measurement of MnSOD levels in clinical samples may provide an indication of subsequent treatment response of gastric cancer patients.
