Changes in protein expression within a matched set of Candida albicans isolates representing the acquisition of azole resistance were examined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting. Proteins differentially expressed in association with azole resistance included Grp2p, Ifd1p, Ifd4p, Ifd5p, and Erg10p, a protein involved in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.
