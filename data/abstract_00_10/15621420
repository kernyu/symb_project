Atypical psychrophilic Aeromonas salmonicida isolates were obtained from farmed and wild fish in Northeastern North America. These bacteria were isolated between 1992 and 2001 and carried tetracycline resistance (Tc(r)) plasmids of approximately 58 kb. The nine isolates had plasmids which could be divided into four groups based on the specific tetracycline resistance (tet) gene carried [tet(A) or tet(B)], incompatibility of the plasmid [IncU or other], whether the plasmid carried the IS6100 sequences, the sul1 gene, coding for sulfonamide resistance, the dfrA16 gene, coding for trimethoprim resistance, and/or carried a complete Tn1721, and their ability to transfer their Tc(r) plasmids to an Escherichia coli recipient at 15 degrees C. Five of the isolates, with genetically related Tc(r) plasmids, were able to transfer their plasmids to an E. coli recipient at frequencies ranging from 5.7x10(-4) to 2.8x10(-6) per recipient. The 1992 isolate carried a genetically distinct plasmid, which transferred at a slightly higher rate. The three remaining isolates carried one of two genetically different plasmids, which were unable to transfer to an E. coli recipient. Conjugal transfer at 15 degrees C is the lowest temperature that has been documented in bacteria.
