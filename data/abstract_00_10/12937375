This mini-review describes a parent's search for evidence on the relative merits of two commonly used treatments for conjunctivitis. It was conducted in a very limited period of time with access to free databases (Pub Med, Cochrane Library) and only the abstracts of papers. Five relevant studies were identified that compared fusidic acid eye drops to chloramphenicol. Three of the five studies reported no difference in effectiveness between the two preparations with both drugs performing equally well. Two studies undertaken in less-developed countries showed fusidic acid to be far more effective but the cure rate with chloramphenicol was low, suggesting resistance or different causal agents. However, there was some evidence that chloramphenicol was less well tolerated and so fusidic acid may be the drug of choice. The review illustrates that evidence for practice can be found rapidly with access to limited facilities by an appropriately skilled practitioner.
