Nontyphoidal Salmonella are important foodborne pathogens that cause gastroenteritis, bacteremia, and subsequent focal infection. These hardy bacteria are especially problematic in a wide variety of immunocompromised individuals, including (but not limited to) patients with malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus, or diabetes, and those receiving corticosteroid therapy or treatment with other immunotherapy agents. Endovascular infection and deep bone or visceral abscesses are important complications that may be difficult to treat. The site of infection and the individual's immune status influence treatment choices. The harbingers of resistance of nontyphoidal Salmonella to both fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins have been reported recently, and such resistance is likely to be a therapeutic problem in the future. The current report presents a brief overview of the problems and trends associated with salmonellosis that are of interest to the infectious diseases clinician.
