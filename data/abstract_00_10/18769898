Nosocomial candidemia is the 4(th) most common pathogen in blood stream infection. Emergence of non-albicans Candida species with often intrinsically resistance fluconazole pattern may lead to difficulty in management of septicemia. Although the present study isolated 80% of non albicans candida species with C.tropicalis as the most common (35%) species, 96% of our Candida species isolated were sensitive to fluconazole. The probable causes of low resistance pattern to fluconazole in our institute are discussed. It is however necessary to identify the complete clinical response to the given treatment. Therefore, appropriate identification of species with susceptibility testing would be advisable before start of anti-fungals. This would prevent emergence of fluconazole resistance.
