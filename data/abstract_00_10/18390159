Antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coil isolated from pigs in Argentina. Sixty-nine Escherichia coli isolates from healthy pigs or with clinical signs non-compatible with diarrhea caused by this microorganism, were studied. The purpose was to determine the resistance profile against antimicrobials frequently used in veterinary and human medicine. The agar diffusion method was used. High resistance percentages against antimicrobials used in swine farms such as ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline were observed, as well as against trimetoprim-sulfametoxazole and chloramphenicol, compounds that were stopped being used several years ago. Sixty two percent of isolates showed multidrug-resistance. The results obtained in this work corroborate the hypothesis that the phenotypic distribution of resistance and possibly that of its genetic determinants, are directly influenced by the antimicrobial treatments used.
