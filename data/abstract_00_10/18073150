The in vitro activity of the peptide IB-367, alone or combined with either fluconazole (FLU) or amphotericin B (AMB), was investigated against 25 Candida isolates belonging to five species. IB-367 minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranged from 2.0 to 32 microg/ml and it was active against both FLU-susceptible and - resistant isolates. A rapid fungicidal activity was observed. Synergism was documented in 41.6% and 44% of IB-367/FLU and IB-367/AMB interactions, respectively. Antagonism was never observed. The broad antifungal activity and the positive interactions with AMB and FLU suggest that IB-367 represents a promising candidate against infections due to Candida spp.
