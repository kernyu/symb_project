BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial drugs exhibit different characteristics in their correlation between antimicrobial drug concentrations and effects on microorganisms. These correlations have been studied using different approaches including in vitro analyses with constant and fluctuating concentrations and in vivo analyses involving animals and humans. Mathematical analysis includes correlation of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) indices to an outcome parameter. Further insight can be gained by mechanism-based modelling of antimicrobial drug effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: This review aims to provide an overview on the various approaches used to analyse antimicrobial pharmacodynamics, to discuss the limitations of these approaches, to indicate recent developments and to summarise the current knowledge on PK-PD target values as derived from human studies. CONCLUSION: It is expected that PK-PD analysis of antimicrobial drug effects will lead to a more efficient and possibly also less toxic antimicrobial drug therapy.
