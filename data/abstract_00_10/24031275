This study was developed to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in two hospitals (A and B) in Goiania, GO, Brazil. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined using the MicroScan WalkAway (Dade Behring, USA). Tests to evaluate the genetic correlation between the isolates were also performed. For the ESBL phenotypic test, the Double-disk diffusion (DD) method was used. The strains isolated in Hospital B were submitted to DNA analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The study showed high prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (25% in hospital A and 66.7% in hospital B), with high rates of antimicrobial resistance. The most active compound was imipenem (100% susceptibility in vitro). The PFGE test showed similiarity in five strains and variability in six strains.The high prevalence of ESBL-producing Klebsiella may be due to individual selection and to dissemination of a common strain.
