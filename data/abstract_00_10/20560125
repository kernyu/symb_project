The occurrence of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in chickens was investigated. Specimens (n = 1,300) were collected from 400 chickens and were streaked on MacConkey agar plates. From each plate, presumptive growths of organisms were picked and streaked on eosin methylene blue and Baird-Parker agars, respectively. Typical colonies of E. coli and S. aureus with similar morphologies were identified by biochemical tests. Isolates were tested for beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Results indicated that 805 E. coli isolates from which 89 (11%) were beta-lactamase-positive and 660 S. aureus from which 58 (8.8%) were beta-lactamase-positive. Both isolates showed a high level of resistance to all twelve antibiotics screened. The increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst bacterial organisms is undoubtedly correlated with the discovery and characterisation of multiple, transferrable resistance determinants, such as beta-lactamases, corresponding to their respective phenotypes. The implications of this for humans when handling and/or consuming chickens and chicken products contaminated with strains of such isolates, is a risk of transferrable multi-drug resistance and a failure of treatment. The results of our study indicated that beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and S. aureus are prevalent in chickens in Nigeria.
