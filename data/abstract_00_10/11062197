Safety and efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin (an injectable streptogramin antibiotic) were evaluated in the treatment of a variety of infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in patients either intolerant of or failing prior therapy. The influence of resistance phenotypes on treatment outcome was also assessed. This worldwide, multicentre, open-label, non-comparative, emergency-use clinical study enrolled patients with one or more of nine predefined, culture-confirmed infections with MRSA, who had no clinically appropriate alternative antibiotic therapy. The recommended quinupristin-dalfopristin dose was 7.5 mg/kg administered iv every 8 h for a duration judged appropriate by the investigator. There were no restrictions on prior or concomitant treatment with other antibiotics. Clinical, microbiological and laboratory assessments were performed at baseline, during study drug treatment, within 24 h after the last dose, and 7-21 days post-therapy. Ninety patients [age (mean +/- S.D.) 57.4 +/- 18.5 years] with significant underlying medical illnesses were treated at 63 centres in five countries. The most common indications were bone and joint infection (44.4% of patients) and skin and skin structure infection (16.7%). The mean (+/- S.D.) daily dose and treatment duration was 20.2 +/- 2.9 mg/kg/day for 28.5 +/- 22.3 days, most frequently administered every 8 h. The overall success rate (defined as a clinical outcome of either cure or improvement and a bacteriological outcome of eradication or presumed eradication) was 71.1% in the all-treated population (n = 90) and 66.7% in patients who were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable (n = 27). Success rates for endocarditis, respiratory tract infection and bacteraemia of unknown source were below the population mean. The macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type B resistance phenotype did not appear to alter the response rate. The most common non-venous adverse events related to study medication were arthralgias (10.8%), myalgias (8.6%) and nausea (8.6%). Quinupristin-dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment option for infections caused by MRSA, especially in patients intolerant of or failing alternate therapy.
