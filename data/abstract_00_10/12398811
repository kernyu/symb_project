Following the demonstration of high levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) synthesis by the pig trophectoderm around implantation, an adequate experimental system was established so as to study the regulation of endogenous IFN-gamma gene. Several stable cell lines have been isolated from Day 14 and 15 pig trophoblast, that could withstand indefinite growth when cultured on collagen-coated supports. Since no feeder cells were used for culture, and cell lines could be successfully cloned, these lines represent the first pure porcine trophoblastic (TB) cell lines isolated so far. These cells were shown to exhibit most differentiation markers of epithelial cells and in addition to express the porcine trophectoderm-specific antigen SN1-38. The TB cell line A (TBA) was characterized in more details upon culture on microporous filters, where a high apico-basal polarity could be obtained. In those conditions, a transient and acute interferon-gamma secretion was detected only in the apical medium. Moreover, the two trophoblast-specific mRNA of 1.3 and 1.4 kb that have been described in the blastocyst collected in vivo were shown to be synchronously transcribed. This polarized synthesis and secretion of IFN-gamma was correlated with the acquisition of maximal levels of electric resistance of TBA monolayers on filters, and was not observed on the same cells cultured on plastic. This differentiation was maintained over 30 passages, demonstrating that the induction of IFN-gamma secretion by pig conceptus is not maternally controlled. This cellular model will be of prime importance for studies on the developmental regulation of the IFN-gamma gene, and more generally for studies on relationship between secretion and polarity in transporting epithelia.
