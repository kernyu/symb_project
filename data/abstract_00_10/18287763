The continued increase in antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens, coupled with a decrease in infectious disease research among pharmaceutical companies, has escalated the need for novel and effective antibacterial chemotherapies. While current agents have emerged almost exclusively from whole-cell screening of natural products and small molecules that cause microbial death, recent advances in target identification and assay development have resulted in a flood of target-driven drug discovery methods. Whether genome-based methodologies will yield new classes of agents that conventional methods have been unable to is yet to be seen. At the end of the day, perhaps a synergy between old and new approaches will harvest the next generation of antibacterial treatments.
