Chemotherapy that is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection focuses primarily on targeting virally encoded proteins. However, the combination of a short retroviral life cycle and high mutation rate leads to the selection of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants. One way to address this problem is to inhibit non-essential host cell proteins that are required for viral replication. Here we show that the activity of HIV-1 integrase stimulates an ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-dependent DNA damage response, and that a deficiency of this ATM kinase sensitizes cells to retrovirus-induced cell death. Consistent with these observations, we demonstrate that a novel and specific small molecule inhibitor of ATM kinase activity, KU-55933, is capable of suppressing the replication of both wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1.
