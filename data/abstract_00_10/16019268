Methicillin-resistant Staphylocosis aureus (MRSA) is an emerging infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). MRSA may be a management dilemma for healthcare workers (HCWs) with CF. Eradication of MRSA with long-term rifampicin and fusidic acid can be achieved in patients with CF. We describe a case of recurrent MRSA infection in a HCW with CF. Molecular typing of the MRSA isolates supported re-infection rather than re-emergence of an earlier MRSA infection. Infection control advice for HCWs with CF who acquire MRSA remains controversial.
