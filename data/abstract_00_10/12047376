Penaeidins are a family of antimicrobial peptides constitutively produced and stored in the haemocytes of penaeid shrimp. In response to microbial stimulation, they are released into the blood circulation and they further attach to shrimp cuticle surfaces through a chitin-binding property. In the present paper, we have analysed their expression, regulation and distribution in shrimp tissues in response to experimental microbial challenge. We have shown that penaeidin mRNA and protein are restricted to granular haemocytes and that their expression and distribution are regulated through dramatic changes in haemocyte populations, both circulating and infiltrating shrimp tissues. Two distinct phases in the immune reactions were evidenced: (a) a migration of haemocytes towards the infection site within the first 12 h following microbial injection, with a local and massive release of peptides; (b) the appearance into the blood circulation and tissues of a haemocyte population displaying increased penaeidin-transcriptional activity, which may correspond to a systemic reaction involving haemocyte proliferation process. Finally, in vitro confrontation of haemocytes and bacteria revealed that penaeidins are released from granular haemocytes by a novel phenomenon of intracellular degranulation, probably followed by the lysis of the cells. Furthermore, penaeidins were shown covering bacterial surfaces suggesting that the peptides could be involved in opsonic activity. Penaeidin-positive bacteria were observed to be phagocytosed mainly by hyaline cells, a population that does not express penaeidins.
