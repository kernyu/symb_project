AIMS: In this study, we examined whether hemokinin-1, the newest member of the tachykinin family and a close relative of substance P, has antimicrobial properties which have been attributed to other neuropeptides including substance P. MAIN METHODS: Top agar assays were performed to determine the antimicrobial activity of hemokinin-1 and substance P against various microorganisms. KEY FINDINGS: Here we provide evidence that hemokinin-1 peptide possesses antimicrobial properties against some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while substance P was only marginally effective. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study is the first to link hemokinin-1 to the essential role of defending the body against microbial challenges and adds hemokinin-1 to the list of potential drugs that could help in the fight against P. aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen.
