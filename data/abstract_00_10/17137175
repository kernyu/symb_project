A 21 year old man, previously healthy, presented with subcutaneous nodes consistent with gummas. Ultrasonography disclosed multiple subcutaneous abscesses and images suitable with piomiositis, pleural and pericardium effusion. A puncture-aspirate with fine-needle was performed and produced purulent material, with isolate of Staphylococcus aureus. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion showed resistant to cefalotin, erythromycin and clindamycin, and susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin. Methicilin-resistance was confirmed by Staphyslide agglutination testing (Biomerieux). The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin and rifampicin during four weeks, with a good clinical response. The frequency of CA-MRSA infections is increasing, and these are reported in patients without identified predisposing risks leading to failure on empiric therapy for community infections presumed to be due to staphylococcal agents.
