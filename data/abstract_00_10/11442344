We report here an evaluation of the dissemination of nim genes, encoding 5-nitroimidazoles resistance, among Bacteroides clinical strains isolated in Morocco. This study was done using a PCR method. Among 60 strains studied, nine contain a copy of a nim gene. The sequence determination of these genes showed that they are homologous to three nim genes previously characterized in strains isolated in France: nimB (five genes), nimC (three genes), and nimA (one gene). Although the nimA and nimC genes were previously identified on plasmids pIP417 and pIP419, respectively, we found here that they have a chromosomal location. The MICs of three 5-nitroimidazole antibiotics (metronidazole, ornidazole, and tinidazole) of the nim gene-containing strains were very low (0.5-2 microg/ml), indicating that the nim genes were not efficiently expressed in these clinical isolates.
