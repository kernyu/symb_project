Two hundred fungal isolates (Aspergillus and Fusarium species) from mycotic keratitis were tested for in vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin B and proteinase production. Geometric mean MICs for all fungal species increased fourfold with thousandfold increase in the inoculum. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values ranged between 3.12-6.25 and 3.12-12.5 microg/ml, respectively. Proteinase production was noted in 113 (56.5%) isolates. Ninety-eight (49%) showed MICs of > or =1.56 microg/ml that was above the criteria of > or =1 microg/ml for amphotericin B resistance (CLSI). Seventy-three (74.5%) of these 98 isolates were proteinase producers, whereas only 40 (39.2%) of the remaining 102 with low MICs (<1.56 microg/ml) were proteinase producers (p < 0.001). Proteinase seems to be an important virulence marker of filamentous fungi in mycotic keratitis, correlating significantly with amphotericin B resistance.
