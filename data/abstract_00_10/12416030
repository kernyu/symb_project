DC-3F/FA3 cells (FA3) were derived from antifolate-sensitive CHL cells by selection for growth in folate-free media containing 15 pM [6S]-5CHOFH4. These cells undergo a 30-fold decrease in intracellular folates, overexpress folate receptor alpha (FR alpha) and metallothionein II, and display increased sensitivity to the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) targeted anti-folates methotrexate (MTX) and trimetrexate (TMTX), which can be attributed primarily to the folate pool status. Upon folate repletion by growth in 15 nM [6S]-5CHOFH4, they display a 5- and 10-fold increase in resistance to both drugs, respectively, even though folate pools are restored by only 43%. Enforced overexpression of FR alpha in transfectants cultured in nanomolar folate did not confer resistance to MTX but did support a modest 2-fold increase in resistance to TMTX. Enforced overexpression of MTII had a similar effect, but when both were overexpressed together no increase in resistance beyond that conferred by each one separately was noted, suggesting that both confer resistance to TMTX through a common downstream mechanism. Analysis of three independent low folate selected clones, FA3, FA7, and FA14, showed that each had a 5- to 6-fold increase in DHFR activity accompanied by a similar increase in DHFR protein level. However, no differences were detected in the DHFR gene copy number or in the steady-state amount of DHFR mRNA, suggesting that a posttranscriptional mechanism was responsible for the increase in DHFR expression.
