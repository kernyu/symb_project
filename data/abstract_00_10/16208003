The oligonucleotide ligation assay is a genotypic assay for the detection of resistance-associated mutations to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype B. This assay has been modified and developed for non-B subtypes and recombinant strains and has been evaluated with sequencing, resulting in a more sensitive assay than sequencing for non-B subtypes.
