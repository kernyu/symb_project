The purpose of the present study was to assess the in vitro activity of daptomycin against a well-defined collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates (n = 98), including heterogeneously glycopeptide-resistant MRSA (hGISA) strains. Susceptibility testing was performed by using the Etest system. Daptomycin was potent against both glycopeptide-susceptible and hGISA strains.
