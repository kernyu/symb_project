Serious infectious complications may appear after a surgical procedure despite antimicrobial prophylaxis. We report a case of Escherichia Coli meningitis after a prostate puncture biopsy. Many factors may have contributed to this rare complication such as fluoroquinolone resistance, and/or the bacterium's ability to cross the brain blood barrier. The patient was not found susceptible to severe infections.
