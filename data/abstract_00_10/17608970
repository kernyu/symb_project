cDNA-AFLP (cDNA-Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism)-based strategy has been used to identify levamisole (LEV) resistance markers in the nematode Haemonchus contortus. Transcript profiles of adult nematodes from two LEV-resistant and two susceptible isolates were compared. Among the 17 280 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) amplified, 26 presented a polymorphic pattern between resistant and susceptible nematodes: 11 TDFs were present in both resistant isolates and absent from both susceptible isolates whereas 15 TDFs were present in both susceptible isolates and absent from both resistant isolates. 8 TDFs specifically present in resistant isolates were cloned and sequenced. Some of these TDFs could represent novel genes, as their sequences presented no homologies in databases. Interestingly, specific expression of one candidate (HA17) in resistant nematodes from different isolates was confirmed by RT-PCR experiments. The finding that HA17 expression correlates with LEV resistance in three H. contortus isolates vs five susceptible isolates strongly suggest that we identified a new potential marker of LEV resistance. This differential approach at the transcriptome level could be of great interest for the identification of the molecular mechanism involved in this phenotype.
