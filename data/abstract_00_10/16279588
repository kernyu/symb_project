Ganciclovir resistance in cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an increasing problem in lung-transplant recipients with adverse clinical outcomes. We experienced the successful treatment of ganciclovir-resistant CMV infection in a lung-transplant recipient still receiving CMV prophylaxis. A 24-year-old woman with lymphangioleiomyomatosis underwent a living-donor lobar lung transplantation. She was a primary CMV mismatch (D+/R-) patient. She recovered from her postoperative complications, and was about to be discharged. However, she suffered ganciclovir-resistant CMV infection during prophylactic therapy. She was successfully treated with foscarnet, and is now alive without recurrence 18 months after surgery.
