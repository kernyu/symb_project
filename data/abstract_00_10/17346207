Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) are members of the Herpesviridae family. HSV infections have been known since ancient times and are one of the most common communicable diseases in humans. Although infections are often subclinical, HSV can cause mild to severe diseases, especially in immunocompromised patients. Herpes simplex viruses establish latency in the nuclei of neuronal cells and may reactivate, with or without symptoms, throughout the host's lifetime. Over one third of the world's population suffer from recurrent HSV infections several times a year and are thus capable of transmitting HSV by close personal contact. There are few drugs licensed for the treatment of HSV infections. Most target the viral DNA polymerase, and indeed acyclovir remains the reference treatment some thirty years after its discovery! Extensive clinical use of this drug has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients. This highlights the crucial need for the development of new anti-herpes drugs that can inhibit infection by both wild-type viruses and drug-resistant strains. Over the last few years, significant efforts have been made to set up a range of strategies for the identification of potential new anti-viral drugs. One alternative is to develop drugs with different mechanisms of action. The present article reviews potential viral and cellular targets that are now known to be involved in HSV infection and for which specific inhibitors with anti-HSV activity, at least in cell culture, have been identified.
