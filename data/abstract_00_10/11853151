The in vitro susceptibilities of 285 isolates of Escherichia coli from preweaned and postweaned pigs with diarrhea and edema disease were tested with the 15 commonly used antimicrobial drugs by an agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentration procedure according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines. All E. coli isolates tested in this study belonged to enterotoxigenic E. coli, attaching and effacing E. coli, or Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Field isolates had low MIC90 for ceftiofur (1 microg/ml). No correlation in antimicrobial resistance was found in three types of E. coli.
