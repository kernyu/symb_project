Non-typhoidal salmonella (NTS) bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals worldwide. Recent reports have noted increasing resistance of NTS isolates to fluoroquinolones, the recommended first-line therapy for NTS bacteremia. The outcomes and risk factors for NTS bacteremia in HIV-infected patients in an urban US setting were evaluated. From January 2002 to December 2006, 26 episodes of NTS bacteremia were identified in 16 patients. The risk factors for NTS bacteremia were low CD4 count, high viral load, and lack of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Recurrences appeared related to lack of immune reconstitution in patients not on ART. Unlike reports from Asia, no fluoroquinolone resistance was identified in any of the Salmonella strains isolated in this setting. Optimal treatment of NTS in the HIV-infected patient in the United States should include therapy with fluoroquinolones as well as attaining complete viral suppression and immune reconstitution with ART.
