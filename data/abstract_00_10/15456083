OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs), which limit the bioavailability of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), modulate the anti-HIV activity of NRTIs, non-NRTIs and PIs in vitro. DESIGN: We used primary cultures of major HIV target cells: human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and lymphocytes. METHODS: P-gp and MRP expression in response to long-term zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) or indinavir treatment was quantified by RT-PCR. MDM and lymphocytes were infected in vitro with HIV-1/Ba-L and HIV-1-LAI, respectively, and treated with antiretroviral drugs. We evaluated the activity of these drugs in combination with PSC833, a P-gp inhibitor, and/or probenecid, an MRP1 inhibitor. Intracellular AZT triphosphate derivative (AZT-TP) was quantified by HPLC-MSMS. P-gp ATPase activity was measured with inside-out native membrane vesicles enriched in P-gp. RESULTS: Levels of MDR1, mrp4 and mrp5 mRNA were high following AZT treatment. In infected MDM, PSC833 and probenecid increased the anti-HIV activity of AZT and indinavir. AZT (5 nM) decreased HIV replication by 34% alone and by 72% in combination with P-gp/MRP inhibitors. Indinavir (10 nM) gave 14% inhibition alone and 81% in combination. The increase in anti-HIV activity of AZT was correlated with an increase in intracellular AZT-TP concentration. However, unlike PIs, neither AZT nor its metabolites interacted with P-gp. CONCLUSION: AZT increases the expression of multidrug transporters, thereby decreasing its pharmacological activity. The cellular efflux of AZT probably involves MRP4 or MRP5. In contrast, increases in indinavir anti-HIV activity require the inhibition of both P-gp and MRP1.
