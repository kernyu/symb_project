PURPOSE: The authors sought to develop a technique for isolating and culturing angular aqueous plexus (AAP) cells from more plentiful porcine eyes. AAP is an analogue of Schlemm's canal. METHODS: Cells were differentially selected with puromycin, a toxin often used to select brain microvascular endothelial cells based on the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a multidrug resistance efflux pump. Trabecular meshwork containing AAP was dissected and pooled from fresh porcine eyes, digested in collagenase I, washed, filtered, and cultured for 8 days in a gelatin-coated plastic flask. Cells were then selected by exposure to 4 mug/mL puromycin for 2 days in the culture medium. Cells were fixed and immunostained for P-gp, ICAM II, von Willebrand factor (vWF), VE-cadherin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). RESULTS: Histology of the limbus showed that the dissection was limited to the trabecular meshwork region, including the AAP. Before puromycin treatment, cells appeared heterogeneous and polygonal, suggestive of a mixed population. More than 90% of the cells were removed by puromycin, leaving a population that appeared uniformly cobblestone-like when grown to confluence and that was contact inhibited. Puromycin-selected cells stained positively for the endothelial markers ICAM II, vWF, and VE-cadherin but negatively for alpha-SMA, consistent with staining patterns in whole tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Based on marker expression, morphology, and behavior in culture, puromycin-selected cells from porcine outflow tissues are AAP endothelial cells. Thus, porcine eyes can provide a plentiful alternative cell source for studying Schlemm's canal biology related to ocular hypertension.
