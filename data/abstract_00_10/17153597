The most characterized roles of taurine include osmoregulator and membrane-stabilizing activities. However, much remains to be understood about its role in human physiology concerning its anti-hyperglycemic effect. Studies indicate that taurine-supplemented diet helps alleviate hyperglycemia or insulin resistance. This hypoglycemic effect has been postulated as taurine helping to increase the excretion of cholesterol. Alternatively, this study investigated the effect of taurine on glucose transporter using heterologous expression of sodium-glucose transporter-1 (SGLT-1). SGLT-1 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the effect of taurine on the expressed SGLT-1 was analyzed utilizing 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG) uptake and voltage clamp studies. In the oocytes expressing SGLT-1, taurine was shown to inhibit SGLT-1 activity compared to the non-treated controls in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of taurine, the glucose uptake was greatly inhibited and the glucose-generated current was significantly inhibited. Synthetic taurine analogs were also shown to be effective in inhibiting SGLT-1 activity in a manner comparable to taurine. These effects might offer a promising opportunity in designing functional foods with anti-hyperglycemic potential by supplementing taurine and its analogs to the diet.
