The effectiveness of 13 disinfectants used in hospitals, day-care centers, and food service kitchens in killing Enterobacter sakazakii in suspension, dried on the surface of stainless steel, and in biofilm was determined. E. sakazakii exhibited various levels of resistance to the disinfectants, depending on the composition of the disinfectants, amount and type of organic matrix surrounding cells, and exposure time. Populations of planktonic cells suspended in water (7.22 to 7.40 log CFU/ml) decreased to undetectable levels (<0.30 log CFU/ml) within 1 to 5 min upon treatment with disinfectants, while numbers of cells in reconstituted infant formula were reduced by only 0.02 to 3.69 log CFU/ml after the treatment for 10 min. The presence of infant formula also enhanced the resistance to the disinfectants of cells dried on the surface of stainless steel. The resistance of cells to disinfectants in 6-day-old and 12-day-old biofilms on the surface of stainless steel was not significantly different. The overall order of efficacy of disinfectants in killing E. sakazakii was planktonic cells > cells inoculated and dried on stainless steel > cells in biofilms on stainless steel. Findings show that disinfectants routinely used in hospital, day-care, and food service kitchen settings are ineffective in killing some cells of E. sakazakii embedded in organic matrices.
