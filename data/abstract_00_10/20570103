The orthopedic community has begun to witness a worrisome rise in the incidence of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) caused by resistant organisms. Besides other challenges associated with treating these infections, it appears that these infections may pose a higher cost compared to infections caused by sensitive organisms. Significantly higher cost of care for treatment of infections due to methicillin-resistant organisms were seen at a mean of $107,264 per case compared to $68,053 for treating PJI caused by sensitive strains (P < .0001). More effective strategies for preventing the spread of infections caused by resistant organisms need to be implemented to ease the social and economic strains facing the orthopedic community due to resistant organisms.
