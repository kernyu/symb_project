Due to excessive and inappropriate use of dewormers anthelmintic resistance has developed as a significant problem in horse parasites in the Netherlands. Since it is unlikely that new classes of anthelmintics against horse nematodes will be introduced in the near future, it is important to use the present drugs wisely. Veterinarians should advice horse owners about worm control programs with a more targeted approach. The number of anthelmintic treatments should be reduced and, through selective anthelmintic treatments, further development of anthelmintic resistance should be delayed. Preferably, horses with a low faecal egg count should not be treated at all to ascertain a reduction of the selection pressure for anthelmintic resistance. The propensity for low faecal egg counts is hereditary. This implies that mature horses with consistent low egg counts can be detected by faecal examination and that it is not necessary to repeat faecal examination each time in these animals. New horses on the farm should always be dewormed on arrival and should be introduced only after the efficacy of treatment has been determined. Anthelmintic resistance can also be introduced with the arrival of a new animal that is infected with drug-resistant parasites.
