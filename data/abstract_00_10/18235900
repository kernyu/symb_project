PURPOSE: To assess the in vitro susceptibility of conjunctival and corneal coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) to methicillin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. METHODS: A total of 707 conjunctival and corneal CoNS disk diffusion test results were retrospectively analyzed, from January 2000 through December 2003. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2003, there was an increase in number of CoNS isolated from conjunctiva (n=57 to n=153) and cornea (n=28 to n=78). The frequency of conjunctival and corneal methicillin-resistant CoNS also increased (1.8 to 19.6% and 14.3 to 29.3%, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between fluoroquinolones-resistant CoNS percentages in conjunctiva (ofloxacin: 1.8 to 7.8% and ciprofloxacin: 3.5 to 9.2%) and cornea (ofloxacin: 14.3 to 9.0% and ciprofloxacin: 14.3 to 10.3%). Evaluating the results of the conjunctival samples, there was increased resistance to tobramycin (15.8 to 34.0%) and to gentamycin (10.5 to 25.5%). There was no change in resistance of corneal isolates to tobramycin (28.6 to 26.9%) and to gentamycin (21.4 to 23.1%). CONCLUSIONS: there was a decrease in in vitro CoNS susceptibility to methicillin, tobramycin and gentamycin. Fuoroquinolones represented by ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin demonstrated stable in vitro susceptibility.
