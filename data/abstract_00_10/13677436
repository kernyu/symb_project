The study was carried out to determine the prevalence and pattern of antimicrobial resistance of Shigella species among patients with acute diarrhoea in Karaj, Tehran, Iran. The study included all acute diarrhoea patients who visited the hospitals and treatment centres of Karaj during November 2001-October 2002. Of 734 stool samples collected from patients with acute diarrhoea and analyzed for Shigella spp., 123 (16.8%) yielded Shigella spp. (7.5% Shigella flexneri, 5.2% S. sonnei, 2.6% S. dysenteriae, and 1.5% S. boydii). Of the Shigella isolates, 90.8% were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agent(s), and 87.8% were multidrug resistant. The most common resistance was to tetracycline (73.5%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (70.4%), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (50.0%). Resistance to cefixime, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and nalidixic acid was observed in 6.1%, 3.1%, 2.0%, and 1.0% of the isolates respectively. These findings suggest that Shigella spp. may be an important aetiological agent of diarrhoea with a high rate of drug resistance in this region, which requires further study.
