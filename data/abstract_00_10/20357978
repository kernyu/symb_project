This study demonstrates a novel method by which multiple separate plasmids can be stably integrated into the genome using single antibiotic resistance for selection. This method was used to integrate three different cardiac-specific promoters driving different fluorophores into murine embryonic stem cells, allowing sequential visualization of various stages of cardiac differentiation. This method is broadly applicable to the study of cell lineage of different stem/progenitor cells.
