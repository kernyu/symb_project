OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility of bacteria drug resistance determinated by matrix-assisted laxer desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). METHODS: 11 strains of 8 genera in drug resistant-bacteria separated from clinical specimens and the corresponding standard strains were detected by MALDI-TOF-MS, and the differences of the mass spectrums were analyzed. At the same time, 30 strains of Staphylococcus aureus separated from clinical specimens were detected by MALDI-TOF-MS and their antimicrobial susceptibility were tested. All bacteria were cultured under the same conditions. RESULTS: When drug-resistant bacteria determinated by MALDI-TOF-MS, it was efficient for Staphylococcus, especially the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but it was not efficient for other genera. CONCLUSION: MALDI-TOF-MS can be used to detect drug resistance of some bacteria.
