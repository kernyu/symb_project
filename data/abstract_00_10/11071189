We report an outbreak of sepsis from contaminated disinfectant in a neonatal and paediatric intensive-care unit. 28 infants were infected with Klebsiella oxytoca and basic measures to control the outbreak failed. The resistance of K. oxytoca against the disinfectant was probably mediated by capsule formation, visible as mucoid colonies.
