The Capnocytophaga sputigena isolate NOR, responsible for septicemia, was resistant to amoxicillin and narrow-spectrum cephalosporins. In a cloning experiment, a new gene, bla(CSP-1), was identified; this gene encodes a novel extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) that shares only 52% and 49% identities with the CME-1 and VEB-1 beta-lactamases, respectively. The G+C content of this gene, its genetic environment, the absence of conjugation transfer, and its detection in two reference strains suggested that it was an intrinsic resistance gene located on the chromosome.
