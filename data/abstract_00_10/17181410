Linezolid is the first member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Linezolid is showing great promise currently for the treatment of multiresistant gram-positive bacterial infections, especially complicated skin infections, catheter-induced bacteremia or nosocomial pneumonia both in the community and in a hospital setting, in children and in adults. Although most recent reports are favorable and anticipatory of a more extensive use of linezolid in appropriately selected pediatric population groups in the near future, following treatment failure of conventional antimicrobial agents, more clinical trials are, however, required to investigate the safety profile and tolerability of this new antibiotic in the pediatric population.
