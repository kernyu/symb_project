The prevalence of clarithromycin resistance-associated mutations, the cytotoxin-associated gene (cagA), and the various vacuolating cytotoxin (vacA) genotypes was determined in 50 gastric biopsy specimens from Helicobacter pylori-infected patients, using line probe assays. The clarithromycin resistance-associated mutation A2143G was detected in H. pylori strains from 26% of the specimens, which suggested that the high rate of H. pylori treatment failure in Ireland may be partly attributable to the presence of these mutations. All strains examined carried the vacA s1 genotype, and 76% were cagA positive. Of these 50 specimens, 13 (26%) carried H. pylori strains with vacA midregion genotype m1, 29 (58%) carried strains that were m2, 1 (2%) was infected by a strain that was positive for both m1 and m2, and 7 (14%) carried strains that could not be typed.
