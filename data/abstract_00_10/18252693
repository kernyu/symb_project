OBJECTIVES: The identification and in vitro characterization of novel protease mutations strongly associated with known protease resistance mutations. METHODS: The association between pairs of protease amino acid substitutions was identified using a database of protease sequences derived from protease inhibitor-experienced patients (n = 803). In vitro characterization included drug susceptibility and viral replication studies performed on recombinant viruses harbouring site-directed mutations. RESULTS: The K55R mutation, which is not a natural polymorphism, was identified to be strongly associated with protease mutations M46I/L and to a lesser extent L24I, I54V and V82A/T/S/F. In vitro characterization of the K55R substitution indicated a primary role for this substitution in increasing replicative capacity in the presence of specific protease mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The K55R mutation is a secondary drug resistance mutation that can improve viral replication capacity in the presence of other primary protease mutations.
