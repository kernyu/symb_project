OBJECTIVE: TO evaluate the antimicrobial in vitro tigecycline activity at a infectious disease hospital. METHODS: Using plaque microdilution technique for 20 different antimicrobials, the antimicrobial susceptibility percentages and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined form 135 Gram-negative and 65 Gram-positive organisms obtained from severely infected hospitalized patients of both genders and any age. RESULTS: Tigecycline showed a good antimicrobial activity and MIC 50- and 90-fold lower of all antibiotics assessed for isolated microorganisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for microorganisms in the enterobacteriaceae family and Acinetobacter baumanii. CONCLUSIONS: The extensive use of antimicrobial, disinfectants and antiseptics in the hospital setting have developed elevated antimicrobial resistance levels. Tigecycline could be an initial therapeutic alternative against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms, including multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumanii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in intra-abdominal, skin and skin structure infections and in community-acquired pneumonia.
