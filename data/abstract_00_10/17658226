The objective was to study the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the mechanisms implicated in faecal enterococci of wild boars in Portugal. One hundred and thirty-four enterococci (67 E. faecium, 54 E. hirae, 2 E. faecalis, 2 E. durans and 9 Enterococcus spp.) were recovered from 67 wild boars (two isolates/sample), and were further analysed. High percentages of resistance were detected for erythromycin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin (48.5%, 44.8%, and 17.9%, respectively), and lower values were observed for high-level-kanamycin, -streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin resistance (9%, 6.7%, 4.5%, and 3.7%, respectively). No isolates showed vancomycin or high-level-gentamicin resistance. The erm(B), tet(M), aph(3')-IIIa, and ant(6)-I genes were demonstrated in all erythromycin-, tetracycline-, kanamycin-, and streptomycin-resistant isolates, respectively. Specific genes of Tn916/Tn1545 and Tn5397 transposons were detected in 78% and 47% of our tet(M)-positive enterococci, respectively. The tet(S) and tet(K) genes were detected in one isolate of E. faecium and E. hirae, respectively. Three E. faecium isolates showed quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance and the vat(E) gene was found in all of them showing the erm(B)-vat(E) linkage. Four E. faecium isolates showed ampicillin-resistance and all of them presented seven amino acid substitutions in PBP5 protein (461Q-->K, 470H-->Q, 485M-->A, 496N-->K, 499A-->T, 525E-->D, and 629E-->V), in relation with the reference one; a serine insertion at 466' position was found in three of the isolates. Faecal enterococci from wild boars harbour a variety of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes and resistant bacteria that could eventually be transmitted to other animals or even to humans.
