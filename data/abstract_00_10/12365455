Schiff bases derived from oxaldiamide/oxalylhydrazine and pyrrol-2-carbaldehyde, or salicylaldehyde respectively, as well as their Zn(II) complexes have been prepared and tested as antibacterial agents. These Schiff bases function as tetradentate ligands, forming octahedral Zn(II) complexes. The ketonic form for the diamide derived Schiff base and the enolic form of the hydrazide derived Schiff base were the preferred tautomers for coordination of the metal ions. The title compounds and their Zn(II) derivatives were evaluated for antibacterial activity against several bacterial strains which easily develop resistance to classical antibiotics, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Some of them showed promising biological activity in inhibiting the growth of such organisms.
