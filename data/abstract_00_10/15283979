Bacterial resistance due to the misuse of antibiotics has become a global issue and alternative methods are being developed that might decrease the use of antimicrobials in agricultural settings. Bacteriophage therapy represents a novel way to control the growth of plant-based bacterial pathogens. Although this method shows promise, a recent paper by Gill and Abedon has shown that the complex bacteriophage-host interactions in the plant environment must be investigated further.
