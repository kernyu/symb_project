It is well established that oxidative stress is involved in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Study of the induction and consequences of oxidative stress in the peripheral tissues of the familial AD patients can help to elucidate the inherent abnormalities and the mechanism of pathogenesis of this disease. AD fibroblasts have been used as a model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of oxidative stress. In our study, we used AD fibroblasts from six different donors who are either at high risk of developing AD or have already been diagnosed with AD to study the effect of oxidative stress in comparison with the effect on non-AD normal human fibroblast. Oxidative stress was induced by a brief exposure of the cells to 250microM H(2)O(2) followed by incubation in normal conditions. Neuronal loss due to oxidative stress is a characteristic of Alzheimer's patients; however, our results showed that AD fibroblasts were more resistant to oxidative stress compared to non-AD fibroblasts. Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicated that AD fibroblasts produced more ROS than did non-AD NHF cells either in basal conditions or after induction of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that expression of p21 was significantly higher in AD cells than in non-AD cells and expression of Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein was downregulated/absent in AD cells during normal or under conditions of external oxidative stress. Further experiments revealed that mitochondria in AD cells moved to the peri-nuclear region following induction of oxidative stress. Thus, these results suggest that AD fibroblasts are chronically exposed to oxidative stress that may trigger senescent phenotype, making AD cell resistant to apoptosis by external oxidative stress.
