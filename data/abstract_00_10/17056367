PURPOSE: To present the microbiologic spectrum and susceptibilities of isolates in posttraumatic endophthalmitis, and to provide a review of the literature. DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive case series. METHODS: A review of 1182 consecutive open globe injuries was performed, identifying 10 patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis. RESULTS: Thirteen organisms were isolated from 10 eyes with posttraumatic endophthalmitis. Isolated organisms included Streptococcus species (46.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (23.1%), and Bacillus cereus (15.4%). All organisms tested were susceptible to vancomycin and tobramycin. The most commonly isolated organisms from an aggregate posttraumatic endophthalmitis pool of 372 cases obtained by literature-based meta-analysis were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (21.5%) and Bacillus cereus (18.5%). CONCLUSION: We report a high prevalence of gram-positive pathogens and a notable prevalence of Bacillus cereus in posttraumatic endophthalmitis. Susceptibility results suggest that posttraumatic endophthalmitis isolates are generally susceptible to vancomycin and tobramycin.
