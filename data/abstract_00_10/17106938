AIM: To determine the insulin resistance (IR) and oxidative status in H pylori infection and to find out if there is any relationship between these parameters and insulin resistance. METHODS: Fifty-five H pylori positive and 48 H pylori negative patients were enrolled. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to assess insulin resistance. Serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) were determined in all subjects. RESULTS: The total antioxidant capacity was significantly lower in H pylori positive group than in H pylori negative group (1.36 +/- 0.33 and 1.70 +/- 0.50, respectively; P < 0.001), while the total oxidant status and oxidative stress index were significantly higher in H pylori positive group than in H pylori negative group (6.79 +/- 3.40 and 5.08 +/- 0.95, and 5.42 +/- 3.40 and 3.10 +/- 0.92, respectively; P < 0.001). Insulin resistance was significantly higher in H pylori positive group than in H pylori negative group (6.92 +/- 3.86 and 3.61 +/- 1.67, respectively; P < 0.001). Insulin resistance was found to be significantly correlated with total antioxidant capacity (r = -0.251, P < 0.05), total oxidant status (r = 0.365, P < 0.05), and oxidative stress index (r = 0.267, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Insulin resistance seems to be associated with increased oxidative stress in H pylori infection. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying this association and elucidate the effect of adding antioxidant vitamins to H pylori eradication therapy on insulin resistance during H pylori infection.
