The purpose of this study was to evaluate the aetiology and susceptibility of different Candida species originating from blood cultures received from different clinical wards of the University Hospital in Szeged, Hungary, from 1996 to 2000. A total of 145 episodes of fungaemia occurred in 68 patients. In 73.5% of the patients the infections were due to Candida albicans, 7.3% to C. parapsilosis, 5.9% to C krusei, 4.4% to C. tropicalis and 3% each to C. glabrata, other Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans. There were no appreciable differences in the distribution of yeast species during the 5-year period: C. albicans remained the predominant species causing bloodstream infections in this hospital, similar to the results of other studies (Norway, SENTRY Program in USA, Canada and South America). Most of the Candida isolates (39.3%) were from blood cultures of patients hospitalised in surgical wards, 28.3% were from adult intensive care units (ICUs), 13.8% from paediatric ICUs, 11% from haematology and 7.6% from cardiology departments. MICs for amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole were determined for 83% of the isolates. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B. The percentage of yeast isolates with decreased susceptibility or resistance to fluconazole was smaller (15.7%) than that for itraconazole (24%).
