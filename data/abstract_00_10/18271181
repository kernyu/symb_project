Batumin-resistant variants of two clinical strains of Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and of strain ATCC 6538 P (209 P) were produced in vitro by continuous subculture in the presence of batumin. Their phenotypic characteristics differed substantially from the parent strains properties and did not correspond to those of S. aureus or of the genus Staphylococcus, since the colonies were small and colourless and not haemolytic, since the cells did not produce phosphatase, catalase, lecithinase, coagulase and acid from some carbohydrates and since the thickness of the cell wall and the cellular fatty acid composition were altered. On the other hand, tRNA-intergenic length polymorphism analysis and amplification of the femB gene confirmed an identification as S. aureus and AFLP-analysis and mecA gene amplification did not reveal genetic differences between batumin-susceptible and resistant strains.
