Enterococcus has become a more frequent cause of serious infections over the last 10-15 years. The infections are primarily nosocomial, owing to compromised immunity in the patients and excessive use of antibiotics in the hospitals. The rise is marked in the USA, where the enterococci furthermore tend to become multiresistant. Abroad, many enterococci have developed resistance to all available antibiotics, and their spread is now controllable only by strict hygienic precautions. No increase in enterococcal infections has been noted in Denmark, and very few clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been found. Because of the worldwide relevance, we present a review of enterococcal infections with the focus on endocarditis and bacteraemia. However, we would emphasise that the classic combination of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside still provides adequate treatment of enterococcal infections in Denmark.
