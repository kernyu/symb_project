This review has highlighted some of the developments in pharmacology likely to impact dentistry as we enter the 21st century. While dentistry will naturally lag behind medicine in the introduction of new drugs, we must constantly explore all information resources available to keep abreast of developments in pharmacology that will affect our patients and our use of drugs in dental practice. This century will abound with new therapies, some of which will hopefully lead us out of our tradition of using rather non-selective, widely distributed chemicals with multiple actions and side effects into an age of highly-selective therapies, including the repair and replacement of defective genetic determinants of disease with healthy ones.
