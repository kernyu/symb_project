A retrospective analysis of 381 pediatric heart-transplant recipients was performed to determine the frequency, characteristics, and risk factors for post-transplant diabetes. The rate of post-transplant diabetes was 1.8% with antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine and azathioprine as primary immunosuppressive therapy. Time from transplant to diabetes was 0.25-13 years. Diabetes was characterized by reversibility, and lack of insulinopenia and autoimmunity. The post-transplant diabetes rate in tacrolimus-converted children (n = 45) was 8.8%. In tacrolimus-converted children, age at transplant, mean and maximum tacrolimus blood levels, and first-year rejection episodes were higher in the post-transplant diabetes group, which also consistently had DR-mismatched transplants and HLA DR3/DR4 haplotypes. Body mass index was not different between diabetic and control tacrolimus-converted children. In conclusion, pediatric post-transplant diabetes may be related to reversible insulin resistance. Tacrolimus levels, HLA DR mismatch, and older age at transplant may predispose to post-transplant diabetes.
