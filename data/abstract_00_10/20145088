Synergy time-kill studies of 47 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains with differing resistance phenotypes showed that combinations of subinhibitory concentrations of ACHN-490 and daptomycin yielded synergy against 43/47 strains at 24 h, while the combination was indifferent against the remaining 4 strains. ACHN-490 and ceftobiprole showed synergy in 17/47 strains tested at 24 h, while 6/47 strains showed synergy for subinhibitory combinations of ACHN-490 and linezolid.
