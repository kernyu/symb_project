In this study, the susceptibility to amphotericin B of Candida spp. isolates obtained from patients with candidemia was related to their respective clinical outcomes. The susceptibility tests were carried out in three culture media: RPMI 1640, Antibiotic medium 3 and Yeast Nitrogen Base dextrose. We have found that minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal fungicidal concentrations obtained using AM3 and YNBd media were significantly higher for Candida spp. from patients who died than for those from patients who survived the candidemia (P < 0.05). The assays with RPMI 1640 medium did not show these differences.
