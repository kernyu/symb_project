Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are attractive biologic drugs because of their specificity and well understood mechanisms of action. So far, most mAb have been developed for treating cancers or immunological disorders. However, the antibiotic resistance crisis, emerging viral diseases and bioterrorism have increased the development of anti-infectious mAb, for which more than twenty clinical trials are in progress to evaluate their safety and efficacy. The synergies obtained using combinations of anti-infectious mAb and small molecule drugs will certainly offer new opportunities for the treatment of infectious diseases.
