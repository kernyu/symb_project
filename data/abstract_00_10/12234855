Alterations within the penicillin-binding domain of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) genes pbp1a, pbp2b, and pbp2x were determined for 15 Canadian isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. All penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae isolates showed a variety of PBP 2X substitutions and contained a Thr445-Ala change after the PBP 2B SSN motif. Only isolates for which penicillin MICs were > or =0.5 micro g/ml had PBP 1A alterations near the STMK and SRN motifs. Sequence analysis revealed identical PBP 1A, PBP 2B, and PBP 2X substitution patterns among all isolates for which penicillin MICs were > or =1 micro g/ml.
