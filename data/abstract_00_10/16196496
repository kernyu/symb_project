Formation and transport of glucuronide metabolites were studied in LLC-PK1 cells. Glucuronidation of 17beta-estradiol, 1-naphthol, mycophenolic acid, and 4-methylumbelliferone was examined in microsomes prepared from LLC-PK1 cells, human livers, human kidneys, and human intestines. The rate of glucuronide metabolite formation observed with LLC-PK1 microsomes was comparable to rates observed with various human tissue microsomes. The fate of the glucuronide metabolite formed in the LLC-PK1 cells was studied by examining its extracellular transport using mycophenolic acid as a model substrate. After administration of mycophenolic acid, the amount of the glucuronide metabolite exiting to the extracellular compartments significantly decreased in the presence of MK-571, an inhibitor for the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) transporter. However, the intracellular levels of the glucuronide metabolite did not change, suggesting that MK-571 was probably blocking metabolite efflux. In summary, these results suggest that the glucuronidating enzyme(s) expressed in the LLC-PK1 cells are capable of sufficient glucuronidation activity and that endogenous transporter(s) in LLC-PK1 cells are active and determine the distribution of the formed metabolites. Since these cells have been previously used to study drug transport, they may be a useful tool in future studies to explore the effect of drug transporters on glucuronidation.
