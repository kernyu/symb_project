Both oxaliplatin (OXA) and gemcitabine (GEM) have shown single agent activity in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Response rates to second-line therapies remain low and there is a need to develop more effective regimens. In view of the synergistic effect of using GEM followed by OXA, we studied these agents in elderly patients with recurrent ovarian cancer refractory or resistant to first-line chemotherapy using platinum with or without paclitaxel. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of combination GEM 1000 mg/m(2) Day 1 i.v. and OXA 100 mg/m(2) in 2h infusion Day 2; treatment was repeated every 2 weeks for 6 courses or until progression of disease or intolerable toxicity. The study was monoinstitutional and started in November 2002. 21 patients, median age 68.6 years (range 65-82) have been treated. Median Performance Status was 0-1, all had at least 1 prior platinum based chemotherapy and 11 had received also a taxane. Patients received a median of 6 cycles of treatment (range 4-11). There were 2 patient (9%) with complete response, 3 patients (14%) achieved a partial response. Low profile toxicity (grade 1-2, WHO criteria) was observed: nausea/vomiting 52%, thrombocytopenia 13%, neuropathy 28%. The GEMOX combination is well tolerated and even in this small group of patients, encouraging responses were documented.
