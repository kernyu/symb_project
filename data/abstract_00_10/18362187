A detailed biochemical characterization of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa VIM-11 metallo-beta-lactamase (MbetaL) is reported. The only substitution differentiating VIM-11 from VIM-2 (N165S) promoted a slightly improved catalytic efficiency of the former on 3 out of 12 substrates, notably the bulky cephalosporins. Thus, MbetaL-mediated resistance also may be modulated by remote mutations.
