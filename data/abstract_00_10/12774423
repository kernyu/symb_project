The paper shows a rapid method for diagnosing the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to rifampicin in the testing of clinical sputum samples. The sputum samples from 12 patients ineffectively treated for pulmonary tuberculosis were treated by the immunomagnetic mycobacterial separation technique; polymerase chain reaction was used to perform the amplification and direct sequencing of the gene fragment rho poB by identifying the mutations responsible for mycobacterial rifampicin resistance. Other equal parts of the same sputum samples were cultured on liquid medium for 5 days and subsequently examined in the same manner and also cultured on the Lowenstein-Jensen solid medium, followed by the determination of rifampicin sensitivity by the routine procedure. Routine examination revealed 7 cases of rifampicin resistance. Short-term (5-day) cultivation of sputum samples, followed by a molecular genetic study, also established rifampicin resistance in all the 7 cases of the 12 tested samples.
