The development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria confronts hospitals and nursing homes with new problems which affect patients, their relatives and friends as well as staff. In order to gain insights into the experience of patients suffering from prolonged isolationas a result of MRSA, a qualitative study was conducted using narrative interviews. The results indicate that for patients isolation due to MRSA is for various reasons an enormous stress factor. They experience fear and anger while their future perspective remains unclear. The infections cause a lack of control of their own situation. To cope with isolation for an unforeseen duration the patients withdraw into themselves, although they try to rationalise their situation. They feel imprisoned. To build or maintain confidence contact to doctors is important. Single room accommodation is not always a strain for patients, because co-patients can cause even higher stress factors. Protective clothing often encumbers visitors which conclusively do not come at all or stay for a shorter period. Due to protective clothing patients do not easily recognise who enters the room. Nevertheless, the strict sanitary standards are not consequently fulfilled by staff members. For various reasons patients experience anger. The results of this study should be taken into account at the nursing of patients suffering from MRSA or similar infections.
