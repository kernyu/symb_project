CURRENT REGIMENS: The regimen recommended for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and cicatrization of a duodenal ulcer is the association, for 7 days, of a double-dose of gastric anti-secretory drug and 2 antibiotics, followed by a usual dose of an anti-secretory for a further 3 weeks. During randomized studies, this therapeutic regimen led to an eradication rate of 80 to 90%. However, in current practice in France, the eradication rate is of only 60 to 75%. THE QUESTIONS RAISED: Phenomena of resistance to antibiotics are not the only cause. Lack of compliance is frequent, partly generated by poor tolerance to the antibiotherapy. Many recently published studies have provided elements of response to several questions concerning the eradication of Helicobacter pylori: can one reduce the duration of treatment by associating a triple antibiotherapy or, to the contrary, should one prolong treatment to be sure that patients fully comply to the 7 days of treatment? Should the dose of anti-secretory drug be doubled? And, with regard to cicatrizing the duodenal ulcer: can one reduce the duration of the anti-secretory agent? WITH THE RESULTS OF RECENTLY PUBLISHED CLINICAL TRIALS: It is legitimate today to prescribe double antibiotherapy for 10 to 14 days, associated with a double dose of an anti-secretory, without having to prolong the anti-secretory after this initial period, in order to cicatrize the duodenal ulcer. Further studies will specify the optimal duration between 10 and 14 days. However, till now, this therapeutic regimen for eradicating Helicobacter pylori and cicatrizing a duodenal ulcer has not obtained marketing authorization and is not appropriate for treating gastric ulcers and for complicated (notably hemorrhagic) gastroduodenal lesions.
