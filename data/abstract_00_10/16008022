UNLABELLED: Monitoring infections and antibiotic resistance patterns in dialysis populations is an important component of efforts to improve patient safety and quality of health care. The objective of this report is to update findings from the Dialysis Surveillance Network and describe the soon-to-be-available National Healthcare Safety Network. METHODS: Volunteer dialysis centers in the DSN submitted reports of hospitalizations, outpatient intravenous antimicrobial starts, and positive blood cultures. From these reports, an online system calculated rates of important adverse events. For this report, we summarize adverse-event data submitted to the DSN from September 1999 through March 2005. RESULTS: There were 53,804 events in the 321,519 patient-months during the period of analysis. The rate of hospitalization was 13 per 100 patient-months; the rate of outpatient IV vancomycin starts was 3 per 100 patient-months. The rate of vascular access infection was 3.1 per 100 patient-months and varied from 0.6 for fistulas to 10. 1.for temporary catheters. Of the 8,359 blood isolates reported, 77% (6,427) were primary bacteremias (5,275 were catheter-associated, 1,152 were fistula- or graft-associated), 19% (1,587) were secondary bacteremias, and 4% (345) were contaminants. CONCLUSIONS: Infection-related adverse events remain lowest among patients with vascular access in the form of fistulas and grafts. In the future, adverse events in dialysis will be monitored in the NHSN. The new, Web-based, NHSN surveillance system allows centers to monitor their rates and compare with other outpatient dialysis centers. In 2006, CDC plans to open enrollment for outpatient dialysis centers not already in the DSN.
