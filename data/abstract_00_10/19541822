Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable disease derived from the monoclonal expansion of CD5(+) B lymphocytes. High expression levels of ZAP-70 or CD38 and deletions of 17p13 (TP53) and 11q22-q23 (ATM) are associated with poorer overall survival and shorter time to disease progression. DNA damage and p53 play a pivotal role in apoptosis induction in response to conventional chemotherapy, because deletions of ATM or p53 identify CLL patients with resistance to treatment. Forodesine is a transition-state inhibitor of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase with antileukemic activity. We show that forodesine is highly cytotoxic as single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in primary leukemic cells from CLL patients regardless of CD38/ZAP-70 expression and p53 or ATM deletion. Forodesine activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by decreasing the levels of antiapoptotic MCL-1 protein and induction of proapoptotic BIM protein. Forodesine induces transcriptional up-regulation of p73, a p53-related protein able to overcome the resistance to apoptosis of CLL cells lacking functional p53. Remarkably, no differences in these apoptotic markers were observed based on p53 or ATM status. In conclusion, forodesine induces apoptosis of CLL cells bypassing the DNA-damage/ATM/p53 pathway and might represent a novel chemotherapeutic approach that deserves clinical investigation.
