Meningitis caused by gram-negative bacilli increased since the 1970, with a higher incidence in small children. Within this group of infections, the meningitis caused by Pseudomonas sp is rare. The case of a 54-year-old patient with a clinical picture of meningitis is reported. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. The meningitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa should be taken into consideration because of the severity of the clinical picture and the high mortality and increasing strain resistance.
