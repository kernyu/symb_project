OBJECTIVE: To compare information on body fat changes from questionnaire and clinical examination and to study lipoatrophy in HIV-1 patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHODS: The study was cross-sectional within a randomized trial. One hundred and sixty-eight male HIV-1 patients were examined by questionnaire and clinical examination. Clinical lipoatrophy was studied and defined as fat wasting in the face, legs and/or arms. Fasting blood samples reflecting lipid and glucose metabolism were taken and the role of indinavir, ritonavir (RTV) and RTV/saquinavir (SQV) on lipoatrophy was investigated. RESULTS: After a median of 17 months on HAART, concordance rates between information on changes in body fat from questionnaire and clinical examination were significant and varied from 70 to 96%. With a positive criteria of lipoatrophy in both assessments, 14% of patients had lipoatrophy. These patients had lower weight (P = 0.0007), weight loss from baseline (P = 0.003), lower circumferences at all measurements (P < 0.01), lower plasma triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P < 0.05) and longer treatment with stavudine (P = 0.0009). Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) estimates for insulin resistance and beta-cell function were comparable. Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) were higher in patients receiving RTV or RTV/SQV (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: Questionnaire and clinical assessment provide concordant information on changes in body fat. Lipoatrophic patients on HAART with neither increase in abdominal circumference, nor hyperlipidaemia nor glucose intolerance may have side-effects to protease inhibitor treatment, to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor treatment (stavudine) or suffer from a drug-independent condition.
