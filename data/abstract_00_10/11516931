We describe the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteraemia isolates from Norway. From March 1998 to February 1999, four university hospitals covering all parts of Norway collected their first 10 isolates each month. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined for: Enterobacteriaceae (n=192), staphylococci (n=89) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=69) using the Etest. NCCLS breakpoints were used. About 20% of all blood culture isolates in Norway in this period were investigated. Compared with countries outside Scandinavia antibiotic sensitivity still prevails. Only minor differences in resistance were found between participating hospitals, between hospital departments and between hospital- and community-acquired pathogens. The prudent use of antibiotics in Norway may contribute to the fact that antibiotic resistance still remains low in the most common bacterial pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
