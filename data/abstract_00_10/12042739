PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed and silver acetate/collagen-coated knitted polyester prostheses for the prevention of bacteremic graft infection in an animal model. METHODS: Eighteen 6.0-mm polyester grafts (length, 5.0 cm) were implanted in dogs end-to-end into the infrarenal aorta. The dogs were divided into four groups as a function of type of prosthesis implanted. The dogs in groups I (n = 3) and II (n = 3) received control gelatin-sealed or collagen-coated polyester prostheses, respectively. In group III (n = 6), the dogs received rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed polyester prostheses. In group IV (n = 6), the dogs received silver/collagen-coated polyester prostheses. Two days after implantation, the grafts were challenged with 6 x 10(9) Staphylococcus aureus intravenously. One week after implantation, the grafts were harvested with sterile technique. Quantitative cultures were obtained from all the harvested grafts. The results were expressed as colony-forming units per cm(2) of graft material. Bacteriologic study was also performed on various tissue samples. The chi(2) test was used to compare the culture proven infection of control and antimicrobial grafts. RESULTS: All the control grafts were infected with S aureus at the time of removal. Five of the six silver/collagen-coated grafts were infected, whereas none of the six rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed grafts grew S aureus (P <.01). There was no significant difference in the number of positive culture results of organ samples between the different groups of dogs. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that rifampin-bonded gelatin-sealed polyester grafts are significantly more resistant to bacteremic infection than are silver/collagen-coated polyester grafts in a highly challenging model.
