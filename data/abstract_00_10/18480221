This study validated abbreviated methods for the presumptive identification of Staphylococcus lugdunensis and studied the antibiotic susceptibilities of 106 isolates. The combination of positive responses to ornithine and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase identified all S. lugdunensis isolates. Resistance to penicillin and methicillin was detected in 27 and 5% of isolates, respectively.
