Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are a common cause of morbidity in both the community and the hospital. An SSTI is classified as complicated if the infection has spread to the deeper soft tissues, if surgical intervention is necessary, or if the patient has a comorbid condition hindering treatment response (e.g., diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus). The purpose of this study was to compare linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of suspected or proven methicillin-resistant gram-positive complicated SSTIs (CSSTIs) requiring hospitalization. This was a randomized, open-label, comparator-controlled, multicenter, multinational study that included patients with suspected or proven methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections that involved substantial areas of skin or deeper soft tissues, such as cellulitis, abscesses, infected ulcers, or burns (<10% of total body surface area). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive linezolid (600 mg) every 12 h either intravenously (i.v.) or orally or vancomycin (1 g) every 12 h i.v. In the intent-to-treat population, 92.2% and 88.5% of patients treated with linezolid and vancomycin, respectively, were clinically cured at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (P=0.057). Linezolid outcomes (124/140 patients or 88.6%) were superior to vancomycin outcomes (97/145 patients or 66.9%) at the TOC visit for patients with MRSA infections (P<0.001). Drug-related adverse events were reported in similar numbers in both the linezolid and the vancomycin arms of the trial. The results of this study demonstrate that linezolid therapy is well tolerated, equivalent to vancomycin in treating CSSTIs, and superior to vancomycin in the treatment of CSSTIs due to MRSA.
