The widespread use of antibiotics for medical and veterinary purposes has led to an increase of microbial resistance. The antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria has been studied extensively. However, antibiotics are not only selective for pathogens: they also affect all members of the gut microbiota. These microorganisms may constitute a reservoir of genes carrying resistance to specific antibiotics. This study was designed to characterize the gut microbiota with regard to the presence of genes encoding tetracycline resistance proteins (tet) in the gut of healthy exclusively breast-fed infants and their mothers. For this purpose we determined the prevalence of genes encoding ribosomal protection proteins (tet M, tet W, tet O, tet S, tet T and tet B) by PCR and characterized the gut microbiota by FISH in stools of infants and their mothers. The gene tet M was found in all the breast-fed infants and their mothers. tet O was found in all of the mothers' samples, whilst only 35% of the infants harboured this gene. tet W was less frequently found (85% of the mothers and 13% of the infants). None of the other genes analysed was found in any sample. Our results suggest that genes carrying antibiotic resistance are common in the environment, as even healthy breast-fed infants with no direct or indirect previous exposure to antibiotics harbour these genes.
