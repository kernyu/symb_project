This study characterized the prevalence and patterns of antiretroviral-drug-resistance mutations according to plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA load in a large population of patients with HIV-1 infection who underwent testing for resistance mutations in routine clinical practice. HIV-1 genotypic resistance test results with linked clinical data were obtained from national resistance and clinical databases in the United Kingdom. Among 7861 tests, detection of > or =1 resistance mutation was most frequent at viral loads of 300-10,000 copies/mL and decreased statistically significantly at viral loads of >10,000 copies/mL. Major resistance mutations were commonly detected in the subset of tests that were performed among patients with viral loads of <1000 copies/mL (1001 [12.7%] of 7861 tests). We conclude that HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing is informative for patients with low viral loads.
