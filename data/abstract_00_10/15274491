Culture filtrate of Lasiodiplodia theobromae increased respiration rate, phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity, and levels of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxides and salicylic acid in B. nigra plants. Salicylic acid (SA) level increased for 1 hr of interaction and reduced later. Development of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) was found restricted in plants infected with L. theobromae due to deficiency of SA, which is a major signal for development of SAR. Exogenously supplied SA did develop resistance and plant death was delayed. It was hypothesized that deficiency of SA could be due to jasmonic acid produced by fungus that inhibits SA biosynthesis.
