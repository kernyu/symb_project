The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2686c-Rv2687c-Rv2688c operon, encoding an ABC transporter, conferred resistance to ciprofloxacin and, to a lesser extent, norfloxacin, moxifloxacin, and sparfloxacin to Mycobacterium smegmatis. The resistance level decreased in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitors reserpine, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and verapamil. Energy-dependent efflux of ciprofloxacin from M. smegmatis cells containing the Rv2686c-Rv2687c-Rv2688c operon was observed.
