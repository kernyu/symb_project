Ribosomal protein S12 contains a highly conserved aspartic acid residue that is posttranslationally beta-methylthiolated. Using mass spectrometry, we have determined the modification states of several S12 mutants of Thermus thermophilus and conclude that beta-methylthiolation is not a determinant of the streptomycin phenotype.
