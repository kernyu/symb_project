4-Aryl-substituted N-thiolated beta-lactams are a new family of antibacterial agents possessing unique structure-activity profiles and a mode of action. Unlike traditional beta-lactam antibiotics, which require highly polar enzyme-binding groups, these lactams bear hydrophobic groups on their side chains. In this study, we examine the effect that increasing hydrophobicity, through fluorine substitution in the C(4) aryl ring, has on the antibacterial properties.
