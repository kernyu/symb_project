Three sets of novel 4-deoxy-l-arabinose analogs were synthesized and evaluated as potential inhibitors of the bacterial resistance mechanism in which lipid A, on the outer membrane, is modified with 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N). One compound diminished the transfer of l-Ara4N onto lipid A. These results suggest that small molecules might be designed that would effect the same reversal of bacterial resistance observed in genetic knockouts.
