The yeast ABC (ATP-binding cassette protein) multidrug transporter Pdr5p transports a broad spectrum of xenobiotic compounds, including antifungal and antitumor agents. Previously, we demonstrated that substrate size is an important factor in substrate-transporter interaction and that Pdr5p has at least three substrate-binding sites. In this study, we use a combination of whole cell transport assays and photoaffinity labeling of Pdr5p with [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin in purified plasma membrane vesicles to study the behavior of two series of novel substrates: trityl (triphenylmethyl) and carbazole derivatives. The results indicate that site 2, defined initially by tritylimidazole efflux, requires at least a single hydrogen bond acceptor group (electron pair donor). In contrast, complete inhibition of rhodamine 6G efflux and [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin binding at site 1 requires substrates with three electronegative groups. Carbazole and trityl substrates with two groups show saturating, incomplete inhibition at this site. This type of inhibition is frequently observed in bacterial multidrug-binding proteins that use a pocket with multiple binding sites. The presence of multiple sites with different requirements for substrate-Pdr5p interaction may explain the broad specificity of xenobiotic compounds transported by this protein.
