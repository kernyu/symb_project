BACKGROUND/AIMS: Reinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplantation (OLT) is associated with an unfavourable clinical course. Lamivudine/hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) combination treatment reduces reinfection rates. However, it is unclear at what time point lamivudine should be started and which HBIG doses are sufficient. METHODS: Twenty-one patients receiving combination treatment were studied. Lamivudine was started up to 16.5 months before OLT and continued thereafter. HBIG was started intraoperatively and continued according to anti-HBs-titers. Median follow-up after OLT was 20 months. RESULTS: Eleven patients received lamivudine pretreatment for >2 (median 6) months due to initial HBV-DNA-positivity (median 749 pg/ml). After initial lamivudine response HBV-DNA increased in two of them to concentrations above 10 pg/ml prior to OLT. Both had developed mutations in the YMDD motif and suffered from HBV reinfection 13 and 75 days postoperatively. Individual HBIG consumption was highly variable (range 787-4,766 lU/month). Twenty-two percent of anti-HBs titers measured before HBIG administration were below 100 IU/l. CONCLUSIONS: Combined reinfection prophylaxis with lamivudine and HBIG is effective in patients with controlled viral replication at the time of OLT. However, pretransplantation lamivudine resistance is a risk factor for reinfection. Low dose HBIG maintenance therapy individualized according to anti-HBs-titers appears to be tenable.
