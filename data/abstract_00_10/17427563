Flavimonas oryzihabitans is an uncommon bacterial species isolated from clinical specimens. In this report, a 53 years old female patient who had been followed up with the diagnosis of rectum cancer and renal failure for five and two years, respectively, was presented. F. oryzihabitans was isolated from the urine culture of the patient, and the clinical response to ofloxacin therapy was excellent even the urinary catheter has not been removed. Although this pathogen is mostly community aquired, it was found resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents tested. Since it was susceptible to fluoroquinolones and carbapenems, these antibiotics could be the drug of choice for the treatment of infections caused by F. oryzihabitans. The aim of this presentation was to withdraw attention to this bacterium which is thought to be the first urine isolate in our country.
