The nucleotide sequences coding the CA-SP1 Pr55(gag) in 61 samples of HIV-1 subtype A variant IDU-A isolated in Russia were analyzed for bevirimat resistance mutations (CA-H226V, CA-L231F, CA-231M, SP1-A1V, SP1-A3T, SP1-A3V) and for polymorphisms in the GAG CA-SP1 cleavage site. None of the six bevirimat resistance mutations was found in the sequences analyzed. There were three polymorphisms CA-G225S, CA-R229K, CA-V2301 and a high variability in the C-terminus of SP1. The substitution SP-T8Q was observed in 98% of cases, which could probably affect the clinical efficacy of bevirimat. Therefore bevirimat can be potentially active in Russian patients infected with IDU-A variant, but strain-specific polymorphisms in combination with other virus genome mutations can influence the efficiency of bevirimat treatment.
