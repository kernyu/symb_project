A 6.09-kb plasmids vector pOri253 was constructed from the plasmid pIL253 (5.2 kb) and a 0.89-kb fragment of oriColE1 from pBluescript II KS. The bifunctional plasmid pOri253 conferred erythromycin resistance in both Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. It has unique sites for EcoRI, BamHI, SalI, and PstI derived from pIL253 and was lost at a low rate in E. faecalis JCM8726 when cultured in Man, Rogosa, & Sharpe broth without antibiotic. The lactococcal promoter P23 was inserted at one end of the pOri253 multicloning site. Gene expression was assessed by an entAI gene, which produced bacteriocin N15. The E. faecalis harboring constructed plasmid carrying P23 (pOrient23) had more antibacterial activity than parental E. faecalis JCM8726 and its clone harboring non-P23-containing plasmid (pOrient), as determined by means of an overlay method.
