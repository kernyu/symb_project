OBJECTIVE: To measure the in-vitro activity of various antibiotics including tigecycline against Gram negative and positive nosocomial aerobic isolates. METHODS: A total of 430 clinical isolates of both Gram positive (143) and negative (287) aerobic bacteria were used from 3 centres during the year 2006 and 2007. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using broth micro dilution panels. Antibiotic resistance was interpreted using CLSI guidelines. RESULTS: Most of the isolates were resistant to more than one drug. Resistance to tigecycline was not found. Tigecycline (1 microg/ml) had low MIC against organisms tested. CONCLUSION: This data indicates that tigecycline, a new drug in its class, has broad-spectrum in-vitro activity against both Gram negative and positive nosocomial isolates. Therefore, it may be a suitable drug to be used for the treatment of highly resistant nosocomial infections.
