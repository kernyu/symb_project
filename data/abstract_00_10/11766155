The increasing trend of a multimodal therapeutic approach in gynecologic oncology in the last few years has markedly changed the nature, frequency, and clinical presentation of infectious diseases. Despite the improved diagnostic tools, refined surgical technique, and routine use of prophylactic antibiotics, the morbidity and mortality of infectious complications remain significant. The rational use of available treatment resources, the recognition of risk factors, and increased awareness of host-cancer interactions should reduce the incidence of these serious infectious complications. The improved prevention and more efficient treatment of infections in the gynecologic oncology patient will not only improve prognosis but also have a significant economic impact as well.
