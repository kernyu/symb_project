WHAT IS KNOWN: Acute upper respiratory tract infections are among the most frequent reasons for encounters in primary health care. Relevant data about antibiotics use in respiratory tract infections in Poland are scarce. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency of use and choice of antibiotics in empirical first-line treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in adults in eastern Poland. METHODS: An analysis of the medical records of 4047 adult patients from 47 health centres in Lublin region (eastern Poland) within the period of 1 year (1 September 2005 to 31 August 2006). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In 1267 patient visits, the reasons for encounter were classified by physicians as acute infections of the upper respiratory tract. Most frequently diagnosed were acute pharyngitis and tonsillitis, acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and unspecified sites and the common cold. Overall, antibiotics were used as empirical first-line therapy in 78.7% of cases. Amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, macrolide and doxycycline were most commonly prescribed. Physician's specialty was not associated with antibiotic use. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: There is still considerable overuse of antibiotics in primary care patients with respiratory tract infections in Poland. Campaigns aiming at changing prescribing behaviour of primary care physicians and informing the public should be undertaken.
