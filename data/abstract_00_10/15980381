A total of 301 German pediatric group A streptococcus isolates were screened for the presence of macrolide resistance and the fibronectin binding protein F1 gene (prtF1) encoding an adhesin and cell invasiveness protein. The prtF1 gene was present significantly more often among macrolide-resistant isolates. The majority of these were not clonally related.
