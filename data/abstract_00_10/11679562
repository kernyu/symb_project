Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate PA35 is resistant to amino- and ureido-penicillins, has intermediate susceptibility to cefsulodin, cefepime and aztreonam, and is susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime. Cloning and sequencing revealed a new beta-lactamase variant, OXA-35, sharing 96% amino acid identity with OXA-10. OXA-35 displays a restricted-substrate hydrolysis profile with improved hydrolysis of amoxicillin and cloxacillin compared with OXA-10. OXA-35 differs from derivatives OXA-19 and OXA-28 by one amino acid substitution and may be a progenitor of these OXA-13-like extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
