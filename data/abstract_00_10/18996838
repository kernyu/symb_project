In higher plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, omega-3 trienoic fatty acids (TFAs), represented mainly by alpha-linolenic acid, serve as precursors of jasmonic acid (JA), a potent lipid signal molecule essential for defense. The JA-independent roles of TFAs were investigated by comparing the TFA- and JA-deficient fatty acid desaturase triple mutant (fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 (fad3 fad7 fad8)) with the aos (allene oxide synthase) mutant that contains TFAs but is JA-deficient. When challenged with the fungus Botrytis, resistance of the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant was reduced when compared with the aos mutant, suggesting that TFAs play a role in cell survival independently of being the precursors of JA. An independent genetic approach using the lesion mimic mutant accelerated cell death2 (acd2-2) confirmed the importance of TFAs in containing lesion spread, which was increased in the lines in which the fad3 fad7 fad8 and acd2-2 mutations were combined when compared with the aos acd2-2 lines. Malondialdehyde, found to result from oxidative TFA fragmentation during lesion formation, was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Its levels correlated with the survival of the tissue. Furthermore, plants lacking TFAs overproduced salicylic acid (SA), hydrogen peroxide, and transcripts encoding several SA-regulated and SA biosynthetic proteins. The data suggest a physiological role for TFAs as sinks for reactive oxygen species.
