Integrons are strongly associated with the multidrug resistance seen in gram-negative bacilli in the hospital environment. No data, however, are available on their prevalence in the community. This study is the first to show that integrons are widespread in Enterobacteriaceae in the community and that integron-associated resistance genes in the community constitute a substantial reservoir for multidrug resistance in the hospital.
