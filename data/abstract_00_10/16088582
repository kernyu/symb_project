Biofilms are defined as collections of microorganisms attached to a surface and embedded in a matrix. This attached state is the primary mode of microbial growth in the environment and within the body. However, biofilms represent a significant clinical concern because they are recalcitrant to antimicrobial agents. This is particularly troublesome in the respiratory tract where biofilms clearly complicate traditional therapies. This review focuses on the biology, development, and antimicrobial resistance properties of biofilms formed by three significant respiratory tract pathogens; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Recent research has begun to shed light on the molecular events governing biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms with these organisms. A deeper understanding of these concepts will be necessary for the development of rational strategies to control biofilms in the future.
