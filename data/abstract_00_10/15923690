Meropenem is a new carbapenem antibacterial agent with wide spectrum of activity against gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic organisms. It is stable against most beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative bacteria and has greatest utility in treating severe infections in hospitalized children. It has good CSF penetrability and useful in treatment of childhood meningitis and infections in neutropenic children. Due to concern relating to emergence of resistance, it should be used as a reserve drug in difficult-to-treat infections caused by resistant organisms or when conventional treatment fails.
