Piezoelectric diffuse reflectance spectroelectrochemistry (PDRSEC), a new technique of diffuse reflectance spectroelectrochemistry (DRSEC) in combination with electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), was developed to study the electrochemical copolymerization of aniline and o-anthranilic acid in 1.0 mol l(-1) HClO4 and the properties of these copolymers. The DRSEC using an integral sphere was proven to possess a higher optical sensitivity at the unpolished piezoelectric quartz crystal electrodes used than the mirror reflectance spectroelectrochemistry mode. The copolymers grown from the copolymerization bath of different molar fractions of o-anthranilic acid (F1, relative to the total amount of the two monomers) showed intermediate properties between those of the homopolymers, which varied gradually with F1. The swelling/dissolution behavior of the copolymers vs solution pH was traced via the EQCM frequency and resistance signals, and its large dependence on F1 was found and discussed. In a HAc-NaAc buffer solution at pH 5.6, the amount of adsorbed lysozyme was found to be positively correlated with F1, via an EQCM impedance investigation, demonstrating the feasibility of using poly(aniline-co-o-anthranilic acid) as a load-adjustable immobilization matrix for cationic proteins. The novel PDRSEC method proposed is highly recommended for surface electrochemistry studies at relatively rough electrodes.
