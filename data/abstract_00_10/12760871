The penetration of ertapenem, a new carbapenem with a long half-life, reached 7.1 and 2.4% into inflamed and noninflamed meninges, respectively. Ertapenem had excellent antibacterial activity in the treatment of experimental meningitis due to penicillin-sensitive and -resistant pneumococci, leading to a decrease of 0.69 +/- 0.17 and 0.59 +/- 0.22 log(10) CFU/ml x h, respectively, in the viable cell counts in the cerebrospinal fluid. The efficacy of ertapenem was comparable to that of standard regimens (ceftriaxone monotherapy against the penicillin-sensitive strain and ceftriaxone combined with vancomycin against the penicillin-resistant strain). In vitro, ertapenem in concentrations above the MIC was highly bactericidal against both strains. Even against a penicillin- and quinolone-resistant mutant, ertapenem had similar bactericidal activity in vitro.
