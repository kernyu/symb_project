Reasoned and consensual protocols, by means of diversification of the use of antibiotics, significantly influence their consumption, preventing and reducing the development of bacterial resistance against the Gram-negative microorganisms most frequently isolated in general hospitals. The increase in the consumption of piperacillin-tazobactam was found to be significantly associated with an increased resistance of E. cloacae, but less so in K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Its activity against P. aeruginosa and against P. mirabilis was not affected throughout the study and it maintained a high sensivity to the end against P. aeruginosa and against P. mirabilis and partial recovery of activity against A. baumannii. No statistically significant differences were found between the stable consumption of cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and imipenem and bacterial resistance against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and A. baumannii. Imipenem presented greater activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and A. baumannii. Piperacillin-tazobactam showed greater activity against P. aeruginosa, while ciprofloxacin showed the least activity against E. coli and P. mirabilis. Cefotaxime had the least activity against E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Ceftazidime showed stable activity and was similar to piperacillin-tazobactam against E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and A. baumannii.
