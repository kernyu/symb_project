The yeast-like fungus Cryptococcus neoformans favours respiration as a mechanism of energy production, and thus depends heavily on mitochondrial function. Previous studies of a C. neoformans vad1Delta mutant revealed reduced expression of the mitochondrial elongation factor TUF1 and defects in glycerol utilization, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we found that in trans expression of TUF1 in the vad1Delta mutant suppressed the mitochondrial defects, including growth on respiration-dependent carbon sources and fluconazole resistance, associated with VAD1 deletion. Tetracycline, an inhibitor of mitochondrial translation, was found to confer resistance to fluconazole in the wild-type and vad1Delta mutant, whereas the fluconazole susceptibility of the TUF1-overexpressing strain was unaffected by tetracycline treatment. In the presence of fluconazole, the vad1Delta mutant exhibited increased activation of the global transcriptional regulator Sre1. TUF1 overexpression failed to alter cleavage of Sre1 in response to fluconazole in the vad1Delta mutant, suggesting that TUF1 repression in the vad1Delta mutant is distal to Sre1, or that it occurs through an independent pathway.
