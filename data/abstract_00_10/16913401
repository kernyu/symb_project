We analyzed Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in Gifu prefecture between November 2004 and December 2004. We analyzed isolates of 160 strains from 8 medical facilities to determine antibiotic susceptibility, genotype of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) genes and macrolide resistant genes, and the serotypes of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). When referred to the classification in CLSI (formerly NCCLS), the overall incidence of penicillin-susceptible (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate (PISP) and penicillin-resistant (PRSP) were 48 (30.0%), 81 (50.6%) and 31 (19.4%) strains, respectively, and the susceptibility distribution to benzylpenicillin showed triplet peaks. The incidence of PISP and PRSP was higher in the material of throat and nasal cavity, and area of Chuno and Gifu district. The sum of the incidence of PISP and PRSP was slightly higher in inpatient-derived stains than outpatient-derived strains. The incidence that didn't possess mutations in PBP genes and macrolide-resistant genes was 6 (3.75%) and the others 154 strain (96.25%) had abnormal PBP genes or macrolide-resistant genes. The 90% of pneumococcal serotypes of PRSP 31 strains were serotype 6 (14 strains, 45.2%), 19 (7 strains, 22.6%) and 23 (7 strains, 22.6%). The MIC90 of each antibiotics was as follows; 0.1 microg/mL for panipenem, 0.2 microg/mL for imipenem and tosufloxacin, 0.39 microg/mL for meropenem and gatifloxacin, 0.78 microg/mL for amoxicillin, cefteram and cefditoren, 1.56 microg/mL for piperacillin, cefcapene and levofloxacin, 3.13 microg/mL for flomoxef, 6.25 microg/mL for cefdinir and cefotiam, 12.5 microg/mL for norfloxacin and minocycline, 25 microg/mL for cefixime, and 100 microg/mL for clarithromycin.
