BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections are widespread and are important contributors to morbidity and mortality. Prevalence studies are useful in revealing the prevalence of hospital-acquired infections. OBJECTIVES: To determine the bacterial pathogens associated with hospital acquired surgical site infection (SSI) and urinary tract infection (UTI) and assess their susceptibility patterns in patients admitted in Mekelle Hospital in Ethiopia. METHODS: From November 2005 to April 2006 a prospective cross sectional study was conducted at Mekelle Hospital, Tigray region, North Ethiopia. The study population comprised of a total of 246 informed and consented adult patients hospitalized for surgical (n = 212) and Gynecology and Obstetrics cases (n = 34). RESULTS: Of the 246 admitted patients, 68 (27.6%) developed nosocomial infections (SSI and/or nosocomial UTI) based on the clinical evaluations, and positive wound and urine culture results. Gram negative bacteria were predominantly isolated with a rate of 18/34 (53%) and 34/41 (83%) from SSI and UTI respectively. Most of the isolates from UTI have high rates of resistance (> 80%) to the commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole; and in isolates from SSI to amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the prevalence of HAIs (SSI and nosocomial UTI) in the Hospital is high when compared to previous Ethiopian and other studies despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics. The pathogens causing SSI and UT7 are often resistant to commonly used antimicrobials. The findings underscore the need for an infection control system and surveillance program in the hospital and to monitor antimicrobial resistance pattern for the use of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics.
