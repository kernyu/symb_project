The occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus intermedius strains was investigated in 13 dogs affected by deep pyoderma, their owners and 13 individuals without daily contact with dogs (control group). A total of 90 canine and 33 human S. intermedius isolates were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to determine their possible identity. The occurrence of S. intermedius in dog-owners was significantly higher compared with the control group (Fisher's exact test, P=0.03), with S. intermedius being detected in seven dog-owners and in one individual not exposed to dogs. The results of the PFGE analysis showed that six out of 13 (46%) owners carried strains identical to those isolated from their dogs. Strains detected in both dogs and humans were resistant up to five different antimicrobial classes, including penicillins, fusidic acid, macrolides/lincosamides, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Based on the results of this study, owners of dogs affected by deep pyoderma often carry multiple antimicrobial-resistant strains of S. intermedius occurring in their dogs. Independent of the direction and modalities of transmission, this finding raises questions concerning the possible transfer of resistance genes from canine S. intermedius to human pathogenic staphylococci.
