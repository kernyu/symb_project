The authors report a case of adult-onset minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) that was resistant to steroid and cyclophosphamide therapy. Introduction of cyclosporin induced an usual cutaneous reaction of severe flushing attacks. Tacrolimus successfully alleviated both the nephrotic syndrome and the cutaneous side effect associated with cyclosporin use. The antiproteinuric mechanisms of tacrolimus and its potential in treating refractory MCNS and other forms of primary glomerulonephritides are discussed.
