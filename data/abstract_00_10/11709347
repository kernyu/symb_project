Reports of an increased clinical incidence of pertussis and the development of resistance by Bordetella pertussis to erythromycin prompted the collection and testing of recent clinical isolates from patients in northern California against a range of antimicrobial agents by the Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) method. All isolates were fully susceptible to all eight agents tested (MIC, <or=0.38 microg/ml), including newer fluoroquinolones, such as gatifloxacin (MIC of which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited, 0.006 microg/ml), which may be used in cases of adolescent or adult pertussis. Continued surveillance of B. pertussis isolates appears to be a prudent practice.
