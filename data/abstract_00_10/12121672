Schistosome antigenic components are being tested as vaccine candidates with various degrees of success, but there are only few reports using multivalent antigens to stimulate an appropriate immune response that leads to resistance or granuloma modulation. We investigated the in vitro response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from chronic intestinal schistosomiasis individuals to PIII, a multivalent antigen prepared from Schistosoma mansoni adult worm antigen, and response to P24, a single antigen obtained from PIII. Treatment of PBMC with either PIII or P24 caused significant decrease in cellular proliferation and granuloma formation induced by S. mansoni antigens, and a significant elevation in IL-10 and TNF-alpha but not in IFN-gamma production. Moreover, P24 promoted an elevation in TNF-alpha level on the in vitro granuloma reaction, when cocultured with polyacrylamide beads (PB) coupled to S. mansoni antigens. These findings suggest that, besides inducing protective immunity, PIII and P24 antigens seem to be important in the regulation of in vitro granuloma formation through stimulation of IL-10 and TNF-alpha production in human schistosomiasis. The more pronounced effect of P24 on reducing the in vitro granulomatous reaction could be associated with a balance between IL-10 and TNF-alpha production.
