OBJECTIVE: To analyse the plasmid-mediated SHV type beta-lactamases-encoding genes sequence and to identify its subtype of multiple-drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii isolated from Huzhou district, Zhejiang province, China. METHODS: Sixty strains of acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from hospitalized patients between Jul, 2000 and Dec, 2002. Susceptibility of antimicrobial agents and confirmatory tests for Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were tested by microdilute method. SHV type beta-lactamases-encoding genes were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). SHV sequences of acinetobacter baumannii HZ02 and HZ10 strains were detected by ABI automated sequencer and were analysed to compare with SHV genes that had been published in GenBank. RESULTS: Eighteen (30.0%) strains of acinetobacter baumannii isolated between Jun, 2001 and Jan, 2002 were carrying SHV beta-lactamases resistant gene of plasmids. Detected SHV sequences of acinetobacter baumannii HZ02 strain and HZ10 strain had 825 and 833 nucleotides respectively and had the same gene sequence as the gene encoding SHV-12 subtype of ESBLs discovered in Switzerland. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty percentage of the clinically isolated acinetobacter baumannii were carrying SHV type (extended-spectrum) beta-lactamases resistant gene of plasmids and causing an outbreak in hospital and was discovered to have carried the strains of SHV-12 subtype producing ESBLs gene in acinetobacter baumannii which was the first reported case in the world.
