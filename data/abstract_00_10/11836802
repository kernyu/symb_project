Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a significant cause of pulmonary infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Because these organisms are frequently multidrug-resistant, most patients require intravenous therapy with vancomycin. We report on the first case of successful treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation due to MRSA in a CF patient with a new antimicrobial, linezolid. We demonstrated equivalence of intravenous and oral dosing in this patient, suggesting that oral linezolid may be an excellent alternative to intravenous vancomycin for CF patients infected with MRSA.
