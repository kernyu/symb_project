Group G Streptococcus strains isolated from patients with severe invasive infections in the period 2002-2008 were surveyed and their prevalence compared with that observed in the period 1995-2001 in Japan. Strains with genotypes stg485, stg6792, stc36, stg6, and stg652 were isolated in both periods, whereas various new genotypes appeared in 2002-2008 and some genotypes found in 1995-2001 were not found subsequently, thus indicating a change in the prevalent genotyped strains causing severe invasive streptococcal infections.
