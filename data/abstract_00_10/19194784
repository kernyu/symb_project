Neonates are highly sensitive to infections because they are biased to develop Th2 immune responses. When exposed to certain agents, such as DNA vaccines or CpG DNA motifs, neonates are capable to mount adult-like Th1 protective responses. This study investigates the capacity of Candida albicans (C. albicans) dsDNA to induce host resistance in newborn mice against gastrointestinal C. albicans infection. The protective properties of dsDNA are related to an increased number of spleen CD4+ T cells secreting IFN-gamma. In infected DNA-treated mice, an enhanced production of IFN-gamma by Peyer's patch cells was observed together with reduced colonization and histopathological changes in the stomach. Our results indicated that C. albicans dsDNA administration in neonates elicited the protective immune response against gastrointestinal Candida infection.
