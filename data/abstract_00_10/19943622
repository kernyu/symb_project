Five new compounds, 2alpha-hydroxyjatropholone (1), 2beta-hydroxyjatropholone (2), 1,5-dioxo-2,3-dihydroxyrhamnofola-4(10),6,11(18),15-tetraene (3), 2-keto-5-hydroxyguai-3,11-diene (4), and a sesquiterpene-coumarin conjugate, jatrophadioxan (5), and nine known compounds have been isolated from the roots of Jatropha integerrima. The structures were established from spectroscopic data, and the relative configuration of 1 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Six diterpenes were evaluated for their antiplasmodial, antituberculosis, and cytotoxic activities.
