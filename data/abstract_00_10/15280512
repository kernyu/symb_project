OBJECTIVE: To review and evaluate clinically relevant epidemiology, microbiology, and clinical studies regarding the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections. DATA SOURCES: Pertinent literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (1966-September 2003) and through secondary bibliographies of pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles identified from data sources were evaluated for clinical relevance. DATA SYNTHESIS: Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a worldwide problem as a nosocomial pathogen in hospitalized patients. Acinetobacter spp. can cause a multitude of infections including pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections, and the mortality associated with these infections is high. Isolates resistant to almost all commercially available antimicrobials have been identified, thus limiting treatment options. The development of new agents and reappraisal of older compounds (ie, polymyxins, ampicillin/sulbactam) are necessary as we consider the optimal treatment of these multidrug-resistant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: There is no simple answer to the treatment of Acinetobacter infections. Eradication of Acinetobacter spp. requires adherence to good infection control practices and prudent antibiotic use, as well as effective antimicrobial therapy. Alternative therapies such as colistin, ampicillin/sulbactam, and tetracycline are potential options, but prospective, randomized, controlled trials are still lacking.
