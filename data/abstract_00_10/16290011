OBJECTIVES: The authors had for aim to show that preventing the diffusion of multidrug-resistant organism (MRO) is possible thanks to the coordination of recommended preventive actions and the implementation of a sensible anti-infective prescription policy. They also wanted to highlight the role played by the nursing care staff in enforcing recommendations. METHOD: We compared the results of two health care facilities having both implemented the same strategy aimed at preventing cross-transmission and prescribing anti-infective drugs. RESULTS: Audits reported a very variable enforcement of recommendations. The results obtained from microbiological monitoring confirmed the essential impact of protocol enactment by every team, on the control of MRO diffusion. The antibiotherapy specialist has a key role in the suggested strategy, allowing a significant decrease in the number of anti-infective prescriptions and a more rational use. CONCLUSION: The collaboration of a hygiene specialist with an antibiotherapy specialist has proved operational in the fight against MRO diffusion, as long as the competences of both specialists are acknowledged and their cross-disciplinary activities accepted. For the entire staff, enacting a corporate culture is a crucial asset.
