Cycloheximide (CYH) resistance in Candida maltosa is dependent on the induction of a ribosomal protein, Q-type L41, the 56th residue of which is glutamine, not proline as in ordinary P-type L41. We found that a 38-kDa protein in a wild-type C. maltosa ribosomal fraction became undetectable upon CYH treatment but detectable again with the establishment of CYH resistance by the induction of Q-type L41. We cloned a gene coding for this protein and named it RAY38 (ribosome-associated protein of yeast). Ray38p is a homolog of a purine motif triple-helical DNA-binding protein, Stm1p, and has a putative RNA-binding motif RGG. The ribosome-associated Ray38p was phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues, and Ray38p that was dissociated from ribosome by CYH treatment was highly phosphorylated in threonine residues. A ray38 null mutant recovered faster from CYH-caused growth stasis than the wild-type strain, suggesting that the dissociation of Ray38p from ribosome facilitates the induction of CYH resistance in C. maltosa.
