To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage at the time of admission to our hospital, we screened the medical records of 1,128 patients for demographic and clinical data. The antimicrobial resistance pattern and genotype of MRSA isolates were studied. The prevalence of MRSA carriage at hospital admission was 1.4%. Older patients and patients previously admitted to healthcare centers were the most likely to have MRSA carriage at admission.
