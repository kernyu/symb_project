Currently, antibacterial activity is measured primarily via in vitro laboratory tests. Clinicians rely heavily upon the reported susceptibility gained via in vitro laboratory tests when choosing an antibacterial agent. An evolving concept is to utilise pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug properties in addition to in vitro susceptibility reports to assess the potential effectiveness of an antibacterial agent against a specific pathogen. This article presents examples of the utility of these concepts in terms of optimal clinical use of common antibacterials as well as more informed interpretation of the in vitro literature.
