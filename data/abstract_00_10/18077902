Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
