Posaconazole is a lipophilic triazole antifungal agent that is structurally similar to itraconazole but has an expended spectrum of activity including yeast, molds, and dimorphic fungi. Posaconazole was licensed by the European Commission for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, fusariosis, mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis in adults who are refractory, or intolerant to other antifungal agents. Posaconazole was recently indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following patients: patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose immunosuppressive therapy for versus host disease. The spectacular activity of posaconazole against refractory infections due to zygomycetes is encouraging and suggests using posaconazole in this case. Posaconazole is only available in oral suspension formulation. Posaconazole was well tolerated in clinical trials and has lower drug interaction profile compared to other available azoles.
