We report the activity of the new glycylcycline antimicrobial agent GAR-936 against 37 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including organisms carrying the vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2/3 genes), 26 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 30 clinical isolates of high-level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. All isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 1, < or = 2, or < or = 0.25 microg/ml of GAR-936, respectively. Time kill experiments using vancomycin-resistant enterococci did not demonstrate synergy or antagonism between 2 microg/ml of GAR-936 and 0.25 microg/ml of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
