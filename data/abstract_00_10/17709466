The diarylquinoline R207910 is in clinical development for tuberculosis treatment. The MIC(50) for 41 drug-susceptible and 44 multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates was 0.032 microg/ml. Out of 20 additional mycobacterial species, three were found to be naturally resistant to R207910 and were shown to exhibit a polymorphism in their atpE genes.
