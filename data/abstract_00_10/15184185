A total of 30 Megasphaera elsdenii strains, selectively isolated from the feces of organically raised swine by using Me109 M medium, and one bovine strain were analyzed for tetracycline resistance genotypic and phenotypic traits. Tetracycline-resistant strains carried tet(O), tet(W), or a tet gene mosaic of tet(O) and tet(W). M. elsdenii strains carrying tet(OWO) genes exhibited the highest tetracycline MICs (128 to >256 microg/ml), suggesting that tet(O)-tet(W) mosaic genes provide the selective advantage of greater tetracycline resistance for this species. Seven tet genotypes are now known for M. elsdenii, an archetype commensal anaerobe and model for tet gene evolution in the mammalian intestinal tract.
