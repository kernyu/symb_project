NOSOCOMIAL PNEUMONIA DUE TO GRAM-POSITIVE COCCI: In a randomized multicentric trial comparing Synercid with vancomycin, the cure rate (56.3% vs 58.3%) were equivalent in the 2 treatment arms. Treatment failures were also similar: 44% vs 42%. Mortality (25% vs 22%) was likewise comparable, as was tolerance. SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS: For erysipela, infections requiring surgical dissection, post-trauma infections, postoperative wound infections, or diabetes-related infections, the rate of success obtained in 2 open randomized comparative multicentric trials was equivalent in the 2 treatment arms: 68.2% for Syncercid, 70.7% for the compared treatments. EMERGENCY PRESCRIPTION: For E. faecium, the success rate was 74% based on clinical assessment and 70.5% based on bacteriological assessment. For meti-S S. aureus infections, the clinical success rate was 74% for all patients and 80% for bacteriologically evaluable patients; the bacteriological success rate was 74% and 71% respectively. In case of infection due to C-MLSB meti-R S. aureus, the percentage of clinical success was 89% for bacteriologically evaluable patients.
