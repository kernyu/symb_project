BACKGROUND: Infections with Staphylococcus aureus are a significant problem in patients in liver transplant units. An association between prior nasal carriage with and subsequent infections has been documented previously in liver transplant recipients and patients with cirrhosis. However, the role of decolonization with mupirocin applied intranasally for the prevention of S. aureus infections in these patients has not been determined. METHODS: S. aureus nasal carriage was prospectively sought in 70 consecutive liver transplant candidates. Mupirocin two times per day for 5 days was administered to the carriers. Follow-up nasal cultures to document decolonization were performed 5 days after the final application of mupirocin. The primary endpoint was the development of S. aureus infections. RESULTS: Thirty-one of 70 patients (44%) were found to be nasal carriers and 27 of 31 nasal carriers (87%) were successfully decolonized. However, 12 of 27 patients (37%) successfully decolonized became recolonized with S. aureus, and an additional nine patients who were initially noncarriers became newly colonized with S. aureus during the study period. Despite the use of mupirocin, 16 of 70 patients (23%) developed an infection with S. aureus. No isolate was found to be mupirocin resistant. CONCLUSION: Elimination of S. aureus nasal carriage by mupirocin did not prevent S. aureus infections in patients in our liver transplant unit.
