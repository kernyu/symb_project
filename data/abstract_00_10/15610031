The mechanism underpinning chloroquine drug resistance in the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum remains controversial. By investigating the kinetics of chloroquine accumulation under varying-trans conditions, we recently presented evidence for a saturable and energy-dependent chloroquine efflux system present in chloroquine resistant P. falciparum strains. Here, we further characterize the putative chloroquine efflux system by investigating its substrate specificity using a broad range of different antimalarial drugs. Our data show that preloading cells with amodiaquine, primaquine, quinacrine, quinine, and quinidine stimulates labeled chloroquine accumulation under varying-trans conditions, while mefloquine, halofantrine, artemisinin, and pyrimethamine do not induce this effect. In the reverse of the varying-trans procedure, we show that preloaded cold chloroquine can stimulate quinine accumulation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the putative chloroquine efflux system is capable of transporting, in addition to chloroquine, structurally related quinoline and methoxyacridine antimalarial drugs. Verapamil and the calcium/calmodulin antagonist W7 abrogate stimulated chloroquine accumulation and energy-dependent chloroquine extrusion. Our data are consistent with a substrate specific and inhibitible drug efflux system being present in chloroquine resistant P. falciparum strains.
