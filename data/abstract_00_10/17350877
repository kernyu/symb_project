Microbial cells constitutively express the Large Conductance Mechanosensitive Channel which opens in response to stretch forces in the lipid bilayer. The channel protein forms a homopentamer with each subunit containing two transmembrane regions and gates via the bilayer mechanism evoked by hydrophobic mismatch and changes in the membrane curvature and/or transbilayer pressure profile. During the stationary phase and during osmotic shock the channel protein is up-regulated to prevent cell lysis. Pharmacological potential of MscL may involve discovery of new age antibiotics to combat multiple drug-resistant bacterial strains.
