BACKGROUND: Infections caused by antibiotics-resistant Gram-positive bacteria have been reported from many pediatric hematology-oncology centers. METHODS: The susceptibility profiles to meropenem, piperacillin, and vancomycin among oral flora isolates of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (AHS) obtained from six children with cancer who received several empirical therapies (ET) against febrile neutropenia, were investigated. RESULTS: Meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AHS isolated from ET patients was 2.167 +/- 0.258 microg/mL (mean +/- SD), which was significantly higher than the MIC of AHS isolated from control groups. Intriguingly, AHS isolated approximately 6 months after hospital discharge indicated recovery of susceptibility to meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: AHS isolates from neutropenic children with cancer should be checked for antibiotic susceptibility, even against carbapenems.
