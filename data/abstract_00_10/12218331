Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been associated with several extrahepatic diseases, such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). alpha-Interferon is currently the treatment of choice for this association. When this therapy fails clinicians face a difficult challenge due to the lack of useful information in these particularly difficult patients. We report the case of a severe nephrotic syndrome due to MPGN associated HCV infection, in which a triple association--interferon plus ribavirin and cyclophosphamide--was needed to control the disease.
