In this study, 90 episodes of pneumococcal bacteremia that occurred over an 8-year period in two hospitals in Barcelona were analyzed retrospectively to determine the clinical and bacteriological characteristics of pneumococcal bacteremia, the risk factors for antibiotic resistance, the outcome, and the vaccine coverage. The mean age of the patients was 3.1 years and the male/female ratio was 1.7. The overall rates of penicillin-non-susceptible, cefotaxime-non-susceptible, and erythromycin-resistant isolates were 48.8, 24.4, and 25.5%, respectively. Antibiotic resistance was associated with children under the age of 2 years and with previous antibiotic treatment. The percentage of antibiotic resistance was higher in the nine episodes that occurred in patients with an underlying illness. The most prevalent serotypes identified were 1, 14, 6B, 18C, 5, and 19A. Serotypes 6A/B, 14, and 19A/F were isolated primarily from children under 2, whereas serotypes 1 and 5 were recovered more frequently from older children. Apparent relationships between serotypes 6A/B, 14, and 19A/F and occult bacteremia and between serotypes 1 and 5 and bacteremic pneumonia were confounded by the age variable. The proportion of bacteremic episodes preventable by all (7-valent, 9-valent, and 11-valent) of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccines was 60% in children under 2. In older children, the serotype coverage rate for the three formulations was 48, 87, and 87%, respectively. In summary, these data expand upon previous Spanish studies in which serotypes 1 and 5 were reported to be among the leading causes of severe systemic pneumococcal infections in children over 2, findings that should be taken into consideration when planning vaccine programmes.
