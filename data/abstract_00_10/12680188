We investigated the mechanistic role of Src and Ras, important oncoproteins implicated in the pathogenesis of many human cancers, in taxane-induced apoptosis using v-src or c-H-ras transfected HAG-1 human gallbladder epithelial cells. Compared with the parental HAG-1 cell line, v-src-transfected HAG/src3-1 cells became 6.0-fold and 7.5-fold sensitive to taxotere, and 1.8-fold and 3.9-fold sensitive to taxol, for 2-hour and 24-hour exposures, respectively. By contrast, HAG-1 cells transfected with activated Ras, which acts downstream of Src, acquired approximately 2.7- and 5.0-fold taxotere resistance, and 2.3- and 2.8-fold taxol resistance, for both exposures, respectively. To examine the mechanism(s) whereby Src augments sensitivity to taxanes, we investigated the functional role of Src in taxotere-induced apoptosis. Treatment of HAG/src3-1 cells with taxotere resulted in subsequent induction of apoptotic cell death, whereas apoptosis did not occur in parental or c-H-ras-transfected HAG/ras5-1 cells. Moreover, a protein kinase C (PKC) and a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) inhibitors (H-7 and wortmannin, respectively) did not alter either taxotere sensitivity or taxotere-induced apoptosis in these cells. Similarly, non-cytotoxic concentrations of geldanamycin, which destabilizes c-Raf-1 kinase, did not prevent apoptosis in HAG/src3-1 cells. These data indicate that the ability of activated Src to sensitize HAG/src3-1 cells to taxotere might be mediated by apoptotic events occurring through Src to downstream signal transduction pathways, excluding activated Ras, Raf-1 kinase, PI-3 kinase and PKC.
