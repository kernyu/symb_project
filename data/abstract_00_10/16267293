Connections among biochemical pathways should help buffer organisms against environmental stress and affect the pace and trajectory of genome evolution. To explore these ideas, we studied consequences of inactivating the gene for polyphosphate kinase 1 (ppk1) in strains of Helicobacter pylori, a genetically diverse gastric pathogen. The PPK1 enzyme catalyzes synthesis of inorganic polyphosphate (poly P), a reservoir of high-energy phosphate bonds with multiple roles. Prior analyses in less-fastidious microbes had implicated poly P in stress resistance, motility, and virulence. In our studies, ppk1 inactivation caused the expected near-complete absence of poly P (>250-fold decrease) but had phenotypic effects that differed markedly among unrelated strains: (i) poor initial growth on standard brain heart infusion agar (five of six strains tested); (ii) weakened colonization of mice (4 of 5 strains); (iii) reduced growth on Ham's F-12 agar, a nutritionally limiting medium (8 of 11 strains); (iv) heightened susceptibility to metronidazole (6 of 17 strains); and (v) decreased motility in soft agar (1 of 13 strains). Complementation tests confirmed that the lack of growth of one Deltappk1 strain on F-12 agar and the inability to colonize mice of another were each due to ppk1 inactivation. Thus, the importance of ppk1 to H. pylori differed among strains and the phenotypes monitored. We suggest that quantitative interactions, as seen here, are common among genes that affect metabolic pathways and that H. pylori's high genetic diversity makes it well suited for studies of such interactions, their underlying mechanisms, and their evolutionary consequences.
