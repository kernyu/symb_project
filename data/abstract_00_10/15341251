Data of etiology characteristics of uroinfections with pregnant women are presented treated at University Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology "Maichin dom" in three periods. Gram negative species of microorganisms (E. coli, proteus, Klebsiella) are the agens of uroinfections in 95.4% of cases in the period 1988/89. After 10-year period gram (-) are the uroinfection in 66.1% of the cases. The growing etiologycal importance of Gram positive species of microorganisms (S. aureus, Enterococcus, GBS) is 33,9% in the period 1997/98 and it is preserved in june 2001/may 2003 too. In cases of long lasting hospitalization or after repeated treatment with antibiotics the probability grows that the agents of uroinfections be polyresistant strains. In the period june 2001/may 2003 in 7% of the cases polyresistant E. coli are isolated, in 2.6% MRSaureus, in 7.6% Ampicillin - R Enterococcus spp. That suggest exact identification of the agen and therapy according to sensitivity to antibiotics.
