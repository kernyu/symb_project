Immunostimulatory effect of leaf extract of T. cordifolia on (i) specific immunity (antibody response), (ii) non-specific immunity (neutrophil activity) and (iii) disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila was investigated in O. mossambicus. Ethanol and petroleum ether extracts of the leaves were used. Both ethanol and petroleum ether extracts administered at doses of 0.8, 8 or 80 mg/kg body weight, prolonged the peak primary antibody titres upto one to three weeks. Ethanol extract at the dose of 8 mg/kg and petroleum ether extract at the doses of 0.8 or 8 mg/kg enhanced the secondary antibody response. All the doses of ethanol extract significantly enhanced neutrophil activity. Fish injected with petroleum ether or ethanol extract at a dose of 8 mg/kg were protected against experimental infection with virulent A. hydrophila. The results indicates the potential of T. cordifolia leaf extracts for use as an immunoprophylactic to prevent diseases in finfish aquaculture.
