BACKGROUND: To evaluate the outcome of dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) for dacryocystitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). CASES: Four otherwise healthy patients with dacryocystitis caused by MRSA were studied (3 with chronic dacryocystitis; 1, acute dacryocystitis). Ophthalmic symptoms were epiphora with purulent discharge in 2 cases, with blepharoconjunctivitis in 1 case, and with lacrimal fistula in 1 case. Culture of the purulent discharge from the affected conjunctival sacs revealed MRSA infection. Initial treatment, which was unsuccessful, included intravenously administered common antibiotics, the use of topical antibiotics and povidone-iodine in the conjunctival sac and mupirocin ointment in the nasal cavity. Subsequently, standard DCR was performed with a bicanalicular silicone tube inserted under local anesthesia, accompanied by the administration of common antibiotics. OBSERVATION: Cultures from all patients were negative for MRSA as soon as 4 days after DCR. None of the patients had epiphora with pus, and the lacrimal passage became patent postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Dacryocystitis due to MRSA was resistant to conservative therapy. DCR subsequent to the conservative therapy resulted in almost immediate resolution of the lacrimal fistula and nasolacrimal obstruction, rapid control of dacryocystitis, and a decrease in the period of MRSA infection in the conjunctiva and the nasal cavity.
