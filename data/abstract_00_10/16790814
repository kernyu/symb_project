Interleukin-12 (IL-12) orchestrates acquired resistance in intracellular Leishmania donovani infection in the liver, inducing gamma interferon and, in turn, macrophage activation and parasite killing. Nevertheless, testing in IL-18(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice and in IL-12p40(-/-) compared to IL-12p35(-/-) mice also suggested both early-acting (IL-18) and late-acting (IL-23) antileishmanial effects independent of IL-12.
