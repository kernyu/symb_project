Disseminated Scedosporium prolificans infections are almost uniformly fatal because of their resistance to antifungal agents. Recently, synergy between triazoles and terbinafine has been demonstrated against Scedosporium prolificans in vitro. Reported here is a patient who developed disseminated Scedosporium prolificans infection following bone marrow transplantation and who was successfully treated with a combination of voriconazole and terbinafine in addition to aggressive surgical debridement. Antifungal synergy testing and combination therapy should be considered in cases of disseminated infection with Scedosporium prolificans.
