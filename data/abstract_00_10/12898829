Respiratory tract infections still represent a serious medical problem, mainly in people with different dysfunctions of the immune system. That kind of infections frequently occurs in the children and in the elderly. The aim of the present work was to estimate paediatrician's preferences in antibiotics prescription and therapy effectiveness in cases of ambulatory bacterial upper respiratory tract infections in children. Paediatricians working in the Lublin area were asked to fill in an inquiry that estimated their preferences to the prescription of antibiotics in children. Additionally, the microbiological examinations were performed determining the treatment effectivity. The inquiry was filled by 47 persons. The most frequently prescribed antibiotic was cefuroxime (93.6%), and the macrolids were prescribed rarely. During infection state, the predominant strain isolated was S. aureus (70.5%) and S. pyogenes (14.7%). After treatment, there was a significant increase in C. albicans isolation (44.1%) and H. influenzae (20.5%). There was a significant fall in isolation of S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Antibiotic prescription without earlier determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents had an influence on the appearance of postantimicrobial candidiosis, establishment of carrier state and increasing resistance among bacteria.
