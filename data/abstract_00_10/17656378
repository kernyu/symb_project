There is growing concern about the quality and safety of prescribing in the UK. Added to the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, this makes a persuasive case for improving education about antimicrobials within a broader programme of education about prescribing. Moreover, the need for education is not confined to the professionals who prescribe antimicrobials, it extends to all the professionals who are involved in the patient's journey from presentation to outcome. The work of the Specialist Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance Professional Education Committee has focused on two areas. First, we have worked with professional societies on regional workshops that translate evidence into improvement in practice. Second, we have explored mechanisms for interdisciplinary collaboration on education between the professions involved in the management of infection. Our recommendation is that this work needs to be continued through an initiative that will ensure UK collaboration on defining learning outcomes for prudent antimicrobial use for all health professionals.
