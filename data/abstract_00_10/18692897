The high incidences of waterborne diseases are frequently associated with shiga toxin (STEC) and enterotoxin producing Escherichia coli (ETEC). Therefore, in the present study, surface water samples collected from the river Saryu were analyzed for the presence of multi-antimicrobial resistant ETEC and STEC. Forty-two E. coli isolates were screened for virulence determinants of STEC and ETEC. Eighteen E. coli isolates exhibit both stx1 and stx2 genes (66.6%) or only stx1 (33.3%) gene. eaeA, hlyA, and chuA genes were present in 94.5%, 83.3%, and 55.6% of STEC, respectively. Further, it was observed that 12 isolates exhibit only ST1 gene (25%) or both LT1 and ST1 genes (75%). The resistance to multi-antimicrobials was observed in 100% and 27.7% of ETEC and STEC isolates, respectively. The presence of multi-antimicrobial resistant diarrheagenic E. coli in surface waters of south Asia is an important health concern due to risk of developing waterborne outbreaks.
