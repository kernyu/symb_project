Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) coated with human serum albumin (HSA) were fabricated for formulating nevirapine (NVP). Here, NLCs contained low-melting-point oleic acid (OA) in the internal lipid phase. The results revealed that the two nanoparticles were uniformly distributed with the average diameter ranging from 145 to 180 nm. The surface HSA neutralized the positive charge of dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DODAB) on SLNs and NLCs and reduced their zeta potential. In a fixed ratio of solid lipids, SLNs entrapped more NVP than NLCs. The incorporation of OA also reduced the thermal resistance of NLCs and accelerated the release of NVP from the nanocarriers. When incubated with DODAB-stabilized SLNs, the viability of human brain-microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) reduced. However, the surface HSA increased the viability of HBMECs about 10% when the concentration of SLNs was higher than 0.8 mg/mL. HSA-grafted SLNs and NLCs can be effective formulations in the delivery of NVP for viral therapy.
