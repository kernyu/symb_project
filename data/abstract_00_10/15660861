BACKGROUND: Arbekacin (ABK) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that has a dose-dependent bactericidal action. Because it inhibits the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), it has attracted attention as a therapeutic drug for MRSA infection. In this study, the authors investigated the pharmacokinetics of ABK based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), in order to establish an effective dosage regimen with minimal adverse reactions in MRSA infected newborns and infants. METHODS: Arbekacin was administered to nine MRSA infected newborns and infants between October 2000 and March 2002. Following the initial ABK administration, blood was collected and the blood concentration of ABK was measured. The blood concentrations of ABK were analyzed by the two-compartment model or by a model-independent method in order to elucidate the pharmacokinetics of ABK. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using WinNonlin Professional V3.1. RESULTS: The mean age at initial ABK administration was 24.0 +/- 26.0 days (postconceptional age: 39.2 +/- 3.9 weeks). The increase in the peak blood concentration of ABK was 2.40 +/- 0.20 microg/mL per mg ABK per kg bodyweight, showing great consistency among cases. The elimination half-life of ABK was 0.22-3.52 h in the alpha phase (T(1/2alpha)) and 2.42-33.44 h in the beta phase (T(1/2beta)), showing great variation among cases. The distribution volume was 0.75 +/- 0.13 L/kg, and systemic clearance was 0.054 +/- 0.012 L/h/kg. ABK alleviated clinical symptoms and inflammations in all cases. CONCLUSION: Nine newborns and infants with MRSA infection and various underlying diseases were successfully treated with TDM-based administration of ABK with no severe adverse reactions.
