Antibacterial activity-guided fractionation of the CHCI3-MeOH (1:1) extract of Paeonia suffruticosa root bark furnished three monoterpene glycosides, 6-O-vanillyoxypaeoniflorin (1), mudanpioside-H (2), and galloyl-oxypaeoniflorin (3). Of the isolated compounds, compound 1 is a new compound. All isolated compounds showed broad, but moderate, antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range of 100 to 500 microg/mL against eighteen pathogenic microorganisms of concern for public health or zoonosis.
