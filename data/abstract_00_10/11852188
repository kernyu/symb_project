Intraspecific variation in the 16S rRNA genes of 17 Mycoplasma agalactiae and eight Mycoplasma bovis isolates was investigated to determine the degree of sequence variation in these two species and to determine whether the polymorphisms in the 16S rRNA genes could be used for the construction of an evolutionary tree and as epidemiological markers. A high degree of variation was found within isolates (between operons) and between isolates of both species. In contrast to M. capripneumoniae no distinct evolutionary pattern could be seen, probably because there are functional systems for gene conversion in M. agalactiae and M. bovis. However, the non-European isolates of M. agalactiae shared three characteristic nucleotides and European isolates from the same or neighbouring countries were very similar. Differences within isolates included both polymorphic positions and sequence length differences between operons. The amount of variation within isolates of the respective species ranged from zero to seven polymorphisms for M. agalactiae and from zero to four polymorphisms for M. bovis. The high degree of variation suggests the potential for misdiagnosis of species in diagnostic PCR assays based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences. All isolates of both species had a thymidine in position 912 (E. coli numbering) that causes streptomycin resistance in several bacterial species and which is characteristic for the members of the hominis group. As expected, when five M. agalactiae and three M. bovis isolates were tested for streptomycin susceptibility, they all demonstrated streptomycin resistance. M. agalactiae and M. bovis were found to have high intraspecific variation in their 16S rRNA gene and the polymorphisms patterns indicate that gene conversion takes place.
