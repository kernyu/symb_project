Twenty two Bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from clinical samples in different countries (England, France, the Netherlands, Poland and USA) were used in the experiments. In all strains the presence of enterotoxin (fragilysin) gene was found by PCR with primers 404/407. Drug susceptibility of B. fragilis strains was determined with Etest (MICs for penicillin G, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole). MICs were estimated in accordance to the NCCLS recommendations (1997). All tested strains were susceptible to imipenem and metronidazole. Twenty one strains were susceptible and one was intermediate susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Fourteen strains were resistant to ceftriaxone and five were found highly resistant to clindamycin. All examined strains were resistant to penicillin G. Four tested strains were simultaneously resistant to penicillin G, ceftriaxone and clindamycin (three French human strains isolated from postoperative wound, peritoneal fluid and bone inflammation, and one strain isolated from a pig).
