Resistance to gentamicin, amikacin and kanamycin was screened in 270 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae originated from April 19 to May 19, 2010 in a regular hospital in Warsaw, Poland. Most of the isolated bacteria were considered pathogenic. Nineteen isolates (7%) were simultaneously resistant to two or three of the tested aminoglycosides. MICs of the three aminoglycosides ranged form 128 to 1024 mcg/ml for six isolates. These isolates were suspected to produce 16S rRNA methylase. Genes encoding for three methylases reported in Europe: ArmA, RmtB and RmtC were searched by PCR. The armA gene was detected in all of the six isolates. This group encompassed Enterobacter cloacae (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1). Five isolates of this group carried the bla(CAX-M) gene for CTX-M type ESBL. The remaining isolate E. cloacae DM0340 was ESBL negative and lacked bla(CRX-M) that may suggest an altered genetic environment of the armA gene in this isolate. Our results showed that 2.2% of the tested isolates produced 16S rRNA methylase ArmA. This finding may argue for a high incidence of ArmA producing Enterobacteriaceae in Poland when compared to reports from other European countries.
