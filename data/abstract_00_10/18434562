A total of 78 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa grouped according to the phenotype for ceftazidime and imipenem susceptibility/resistance were used to assess the accuracy of the Vitek 2 system in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Comparisons were made with a MIC gradient test for piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin. For the total of 546 isolate-antimicrobial combinations tested, the category agreement was 83.6%, with 2.0, 1.6, and 12.8% very major, major, and minor errors, respectively. Vitek 2 accuracy was influenced differently by the mechanism responsible for resistance, and interpretation of the results in relation to phenotype could improve the performance of the system.
