The antibacterial activities of clindamycin, synercid, telithromycin, linezolid and mupirocin were evaluated against erythromycin-resistant Gram-positive coccal clinical isolates collected in Korean hospitals. In Staphylococcus aureus, synercid, linezolid and mupirocin were the most active agents. Against coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), synercid, linezolid and mupirocin were also active. Telithromycin and synercid resistance was common against enterococci, only linezolid and mupirocin were active. The reason of low activity of telithromycin against staphylococci and enterococci is because most of the isolates were constitutively resistant to erythromycin. Synercid, telithromycin, linezolid and mupirocin were active against streptococci.
