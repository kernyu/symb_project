In this prospective, double-blind, multicentre trial, adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) randomly received sequential intravenous (i.v.)/oral (p.o.) moxifloxacin (400 mg once a day) or a control regimen of i.v. piperacillin-tazobactam (3.0/0.375 g every 6 h) followed by p.o. amoxicillin-clavulanate (800 mg every 12 h), each for 7-14 days. Clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit (10-42 days post therapy) for the efficacy-valid population were 79% (143/180) for the moxifloxacin-treated group and 82% (153/187) for the control group (95% confidence interval, -12.04, 3.29). Bacteriological eradication rates for Staphylococcus aureus, the most prevalent organism, were 78% and 80%, respectively. The incidence of drug-related adverse events was similar for both groups (31% moxifloxacin, 30% control). Sequential i.v./p.o. moxifloxacin was as effective and well tolerated as i.v. piperacillin-tazobactam followed by p.o. amoxicillin-clavulanate in treating patients with cSSSI.
