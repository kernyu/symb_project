The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae that produce extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBL) was investigated in patients of a university hospital in Split, Croatia. Patients were grouped according to age (pediatric vs. adult), antibiotic type, and hospital ward. From Jan. 2001 to Dec. 2002, the susceptibility of E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates to antimicrobials was tested. ESBL production was assayed using the double-disk synergy test. ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae were detected in all sites of infection sampled. The percentages of ESBL-positive isolates were higher in the pediatric wards than in the adult wards. The antibiotics most commonly prescribed to patients in all hospital wards belonged to the third-generation cephalosporin group. Among ESBL producers, E. coli isolates were more resistant to aminoglycosides, but less resistant to ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. Resistance of E. coli and K. pneumoniae to ciprofloxacin was exclusively found in isolates from adult patients. None of the isolates, regardless of ESBL production, was resistant to carbapenemes. In addition, the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates differed between pediatric and adult patients.
