Genetic crosses between E. coli Hfr C--donor and E. coli AB 1157--recipient cells sensitive to single target inhibitor glyphosate gave rise to offspring which could tolerate not only minimal inhibitory concentration of this inhibitor but also six-fold increased concentrations. No change in glyphosate target enzyme activity in transconjugants (resulted from recombination occurred at arg G and proAB genome regions, respectively) compared to that of parent strains was observed. If new combinations due to recombination of some genetic factors is responsible for emergence of this resistance the question is raised on the nature of these factors and their role in cell biology.
