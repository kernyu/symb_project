BACKGROUND: Palivizumab (PZ) is the only monoclonal antibody in use against a human infectious disease. PZ is given as prophylaxis against infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). An RSV escape mutant, MP4, has been shown to resist PZ prophylaxis in cotton rats. METHODS: To further define the potential of RSV to resist prophylaxis, additional PZ-resistant viruses were selected in cell culture and were tested for susceptibility to PZ in cotton rats. RESULTS: Mutant MS412 had an A-->C mutation at nucleotide position 827 in the F gene, resulting in an amino acid change from Lys to Gln at position 272. Mutant F212 had an A-->T mutation at position 816, leading to an amino acid change from Asn to Ile at position 268. In vitro, F212 had impaired growth kinetics. In cell culture, F212 was partially and MS412 was completely resistant to PZ neutralization. A single prophylactic dose of 15 mg/kg PZ protected cotton rats from infection with F212 but not with MS412. CONCLUSION: Both in vitro and in vivo, individual RSV PZ escape mutants varied in their susceptibility to PZ. Mutations associated with resistance to PZ did not always result in failure of PZ prophylaxis.
