Posaconazole is a triazole antifungal for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infection and treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis. We evaluated the effects of gender, age, and race/ethnicity (black or white) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of posaconazole in two studies on healthy adult subjects (>or=18 years of age). Additionally, we explored the effect of P-glycoprotein expression and MDR1 genotype on posaconazole pharmacokinetics in black and white subjects. Age, gender, and race/ethnicity had no clinically relevant effects on posaconazole pharmacokinetics. No association was observed between any MDR1 single-nucleotide polymorphism and the area under the concentration-time curve for posaconazole. Posaconazole was safe and well tolerated regardless of age, gender, or race/ethnicity. In conclusion, age, gender, and race/ethnicity have no clinically relevant effects on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of posaconazole in healthy adults; therefore, dosage adjustments based on these covariates are unnecessary.
