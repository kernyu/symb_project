In search for potential synergistic antimicrobial combinations against Staphylococcus aureus isolates, which display heterogeneous resistance to vancomycin, we evaluated the activities of 21 various combinations involving ampicillin/sulbactam, daptomycin, gentamicin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, rifampin, and vancomycin by Etest and time-kill methods. A number of combinations demonstrated either synergistic or additive effects against hGISA SA118 and GISA SA179. Agreement between the Etest and time-kill methods for detecting antimicrobial synergy ranged from 66.6% to 71.4%. The Etest method appears promising, and further investigations are warranted.
