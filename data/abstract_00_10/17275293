As part of an ongoing project to identify plant natural products as efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), bioassay-guided fractionation of the methanolic extract of Mirabilis jalapa Linn. (Nyctaginaceae) led to the isolation of an active polyphenolic amide: N-trans-feruloyl 4'-O-methyldopamine. This compound showed moderate activity as an EPI against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus aureus overexpressing the multidrug efflux transporter NorA, causing an 8-fold reduction of norfloxacin MIC at 292 microM (100 microg/mL). This prompted us to synthesize derivatives in order to provide structure-activity relationships and to access more potent inhibitors. Among the synthetic compounds, some were more active than the natural compound and N-trans-3,4-O-dimethylcaffeoyl tryptamine showed potentiation of norfloxacin in MDR S. aureus comparable to that of the standard reserpine.
