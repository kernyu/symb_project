OBJECTIVES: DC-159a (a novel quinolone) and sitafloxacin (DU-6859a) are structurally related quinolones, bearing a 3-aminopyrrolidyl substitution. We investigated the relationship between the target preferences of these 3-aminopyrrolidyl quinolones, in vitro potencies and emergence of quinolone-resistant mutants in Streptococcus pneumoniae, compared with other quinolones. METHODS: MICs, resistance frequencies and mutant prevention concentrations (MPCs) were determined using quinolone-susceptible strains and first-step parC mutant strains of S. pneumoniae. Target preferences were tested by the following two methods: antibacterial activities against gyrA or parC mutants and in vitro enzyme assays for the determination of 50% inhibition (IC(50)) values. RESULTS: DC-159a and sitafloxacin exhibited potent antibacterial activities, low frequencies of mutant selection, low MPCs and narrow mutant selection windows against both quinolone-susceptible strains and first-step parC mutants of S. pneumoniae, compared with gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and other quinolones tested. DC-159a and sitafloxacin showed relatively low MIC ratios against single gyrA or parC mutants relative to the wild-type strain and low IC(50) ratios against DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. CONCLUSIONS: DC-159a and sitafloxacin demonstrated a more balanced dual-targeting activity than gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and other quinolones tested. In addition, DC-159a and sitafloxacin have a lower propensity for selecting first- and second-step resistant mutants.
