Morphologically atypical Fusarium verticillioides causing a nasal abscess in a severely immunosuppressed child was successfully treated with repeated surgical intervention and liposomal amphotericin B, despite amphotericin B resistance in vitro. Definitive identification was achieved by sequencing the translation elongation factor alpha gene after ribosomal sequencing proved inadequate.
