Aminocandin is a new representative of the echinocandins that could potentially affect the cellular morphology and metabolic status of Candida albicans cells within biofilms. This study investigated the influence of a sub-inhibitory concentration (MIC/2) of aminocandin on in-vitro growth of C. albicans and subsequent fungal adherence to plastic surfaces coated with fibronectin or extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Eleven strains of C. albicans were studied, of which six were susceptible and five were resistant to fluconazole. All 11 strains were susceptible to aminocandin in vitro, regardless of the culture medium used for the microdilution method. Aminocandin induced a significant (p <0.005) decrease in adherence when polystyrene was coated with ECM gel (ten strains) or fibronectin (seven strains). Growth in medium containing aminocandin (MIC/2) decreased the adherence of five (ECM gel) or three (fibronectin) of the six strains susceptible to fluconazole, and inhibition was observed for all five (ECM gel) or four (fibronectin) of the five fluconazole-resistant strains. Overall, the study demonstrated the anti-adherent properties of aminocandin with fluconazole-susceptible strains, and suggested that this activity was at least equivalent with fluconazole-resistant strains. Thus, the ability of aminocandin to inhibit the first step in the development of C. albicans biofilms appeared to be independent of the in-vitro resistance of C. albicans to fluconazole.
