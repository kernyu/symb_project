Several next-generation nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are currently in clinical development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. However, the efficacy of newer agents against lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) has not been fully explored. To investigate this in vitro, we generated novel stable cell lines expressing HBV encoding the four major patterns of lamivudine resistance mutations (rtL180M+rtM204V, rtV173L+rtL180M+rtM204V, rtM204I and rtL180M+ rtM204I). Using these cell lines, we assessed the susceptibility of all four strains of lamivudine-resistant HBV to eleven nucleoside analogues in various stages of clinical development. Our studies indicate that lamivudine-resistant HBV remain sensitive to acyclic phosphonate nucleotides (adefovir, tenofovir, and alamifovir), have reduced susceptibility to entecavir, and have high-level cross-resistance to all L-nucleosides tested including emtricitabine, telbivudine, clevudine, and torcitabine.
