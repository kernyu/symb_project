OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a single intranasal dose of modified-live bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) vaccine protects calves from BRSV challenge and characterize cell-mediated immune response in calves following BRSV challenge. ANIMALS: 13 conventionally reared 4- to 6-week-old Holstein calves. PROCEDURES: Calves received intranasal vaccination with modified live BRSV vaccine (VC-group calves; n = 4) or mock vaccine (MC-group calves; 6) 1 month before BRSV challenge; unvaccinated control-group calves (n = 3) underwent mock challenge. Serum virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies were measured on days -30, -14, 0, and 7 relative to BRSV challenge nasal swab specimens were collected for virus isolation on days 0 to 7. At necropsy examination on day 7, tissue specimens were collected for measurement of BRSV-specific interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production. Tissue distribution of CD3+ T and BLA.36+ B cells was evaluated by use of immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The MC-group calves had significantly higher rectal temperatures, respiratory rates, and clinical scores on days 5 to 7 after BRSV challenge than VC-group calves. No difference was seen between distributions of BRSV in lung tissue of VC- and MC-group calves. Production of BRSV-specific IFN-gamma was increased in tissue specimens from VC-group calves, compared with MC- and control-group calves. Virus-specific IFN-gamma production was highest in the mediastinal lymph node of VC-group calves. Increased numbers of T cells were found in expanded bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue and airway epithelium of VC-group calves. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An intranasal dose of modified-live BRSV vaccine can protect calves against virulent BRSV challenge 1 month later.
