AIMS: To identify factors associated with the Staphylococcus aureus pine-oil disinfectant-reduced-susceptibility (PD(RS)) mechanism and to describe one possible PD(RS) model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comparative genomic sequencing (CGS) and microarray analysis were utilized to detect mutations and transcriptome alterations that occur in a S. aureus PD(RS) mutant. Mutant analysis, antimicrobial gradient plates, growth studies and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase assays were then performed to confirm the biological consequences of the 'omics' alterations detected in a PD(RS) mutant. CGS uncovered three mutations in a PD(RS) mutant in a(n): alcohol dehydrogenase (adh), catabolite control protein A (ccpA) and an NADPH-flavin oxidoreductase (frp). These mutations lead to increased growth rates; increased transcription of an NAD-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ddh); and increased flux through the mevalonate pathway. PD(RS) mutants demonstrated reduced susceptibility to bacitracin and farnesol, and one PD(RS) mutant displayed upregulation of bacA, a bacitracin-resistance gene. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates altered undecaprenol metabolism in PD(RS) mutants. CONCLUSIONS: The PD(RS) mechanism proposed results from increased catabolic capabilities and increased flux through the mevalonate pathway as well as altered bactoprenol physiology. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A novel mechanism that bacteria utilize to overcome the killing effects of PD formulations is proposed that is unique from the PD(RS) mechanism of the enterobacteraciae.
