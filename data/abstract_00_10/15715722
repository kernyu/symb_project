This report describes the first patient in Cyprus to be infected with a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, as well as the microbiological characteristics of a cluster of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates from the intensive care unit where the index case was hospitalised. All isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecalis, belonged to the same clone, and contained the vanA gene cluster. Transfer of glycopeptide resistance to a susceptible strain of E. faecalis could not be detected.
