Of 142 pulmonary tuberculosis patients, 76 were considered high risk for the development of resistance, and 24 were confirmed as resistant strain carriers. Resistant isoniazid strains presented a high frequency of katG and ahpC mutations (90%) correlated with an MIC >4 microg/mL (94%). inhA mutations were not seen. rpoB mutations were identified in 78.6% of rifampicin-resistant strains, usually in codon 531 (72.7%), and 75% had an MIC >16 microg/mL. katG and rpoB mutations recognized 88.2% of multidrug-resistant strains and proved more efficient than the katG and rpoB mutations alone. Seventy percent of resistant pyrazinamide strains had pncA mutations between genes 136 and 188, 62.5% of them with an MIC >900 microg/mL. Pyrazinamidase inactivity was not an efficient resistance marker because 60% of pncA-mutated strains maintained enzymatic activity despite displaying good correlation with high resistance levels. Resistant ethambutol strains had embB mutations in codon 306, with MIC >16 microg/mL.
