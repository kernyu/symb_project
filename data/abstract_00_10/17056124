Macrophage function is an important factor for resistance to infection and anti-oxidative vitamins and minerals can affect how macrophages function in fish. We report the in vivo effect of adding singular or combined vitamins (A, C, and E) and/or minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe) in diets on the immune system of tilapia (Oreochromis hybrids) peripheral blood monocyte-derived, anterior kidney-derived, and spleen-derived macrophages. An optimal dose of vitamins and/or minerals in diets increased macrophage proliferation and protective activity, maintained macrophage viability, increased body weight and length, and increased lysozyme activity, however, at improper doses and combinations of vitamins or minerals a decrease was observed. Furthermore, vitamins and/or minerals at any doses and combinations in diets decreased superoxide and nitric oxide production. Therefore, appropriate doses and combinations of vitamins and/or minerals in diets may increase tilapia macrophages immunity.
