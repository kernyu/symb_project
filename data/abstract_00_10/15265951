The major limiting factor in the successful application of adjuvant therapy for metastatic disease is the lack of adjuvant specificity that leads to severe side effects. Reasoning that T cells of the immune system are highly specific, we generated tumor-specific T cells by genetic modification of mouse primary T cells with a chimeric receptor reactive with the human breast cancer-associated Ag erbB-2. These T cells killed breast cancer cells and secreted IFN-gamma in an Ag-specific manner in vitro. We investigated their use against metastatic breast cancer in mice in an adjuvant setting, and compared their effectiveness with the commonly applied adjuvants doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and herceptin. Mice were inoculated orthotopically with the human erbB-2-expressing spontaneously metastatic mouse breast cancer 4T1.2 in mammary tissue, and the primary tumor was surgically removed 8 days later. Significant metastatic disease was demonstrated in lung and liver at the time of surgery on day 8 with increased tumor burden at later time points. T cell adjuvant treatment of day 8 metastatic disease resulted in dramatic increases in survival of mice, and this survival was significantly greater than that afforded by either doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, or herceptin.
