Pig weaning period is frequently associated with infectious disease, mainly caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88. Plant extracts exert different beneficial effects and may represent antibiotic alternatives to reduce piglet infection. In this study, plant extracts and other natural substances (PENS) have been evaluated on the pig intestinal IPEC-1 cells, for potential protection against ETEC K88 induced membrane damage. Several PENS have been considered: yeast extract, yeast nucleotides, unsaturated oligo-mannuronic acid, ulvan, bromelain and three fractions of bovine colostrums, as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory compounds; daidzein and Chlorella vulgaris extract, as anti-oxidant compounds; allicin, cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol, as anti-bacterial compounds. First, possible toxic effect of PENS on cell membrane permeability was verified by assessing the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular flux of the extracellular marker phenol red. The highest non-toxic PENS concentration was added to ETEC infected cells to test the protection against membrane damage. The results showed that yeast extract, daidzein, bovine colostrum, bromelain and allicin protected the cells against the increased membrane permeability caused by ETEC, whereas the other PENS did not show this ability. Allicin protection was not due to its anti-bacterial activity, since ETEC growth was unaffected by the presence of allicin.
