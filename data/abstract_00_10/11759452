BACKGROUND: Acne is one of the commonest dermatological problems, experienced by approximately 80% of Western adolescents. If left untreated it can be the source of significant physical sequelae and psychological problems. Prevalence studies show that acne is not just a problem of youth but for some, it persists into middle age. OBJECTIVE: To review both the causes of acne and current acne management issues in relation to problems and options for improving outcomes. DISCUSSION: The earlier acne is treated the more likely scarring will be minimised, so a proactive approach is important. The development of oral isotretinoin has offered those with severe, nodulocystic acne the chance of not only disease containment but suppression. However, it is still the only available treatment that targets all four pathological processes involved in acne. The development of antibiotic resistance is becoming a global problem and causing a need to revise our approach to acne.
