Contributions of thymidine kinase (TK) mutations to acyclovir (ACV) resistance were evaluated in herpes simplex virus type 1 recombinant viruses generated using a set of overlapping cosmids and plasmids. Alterations in both conserved and nonconserved regions of the TK gene were shown to confer high levels of resistance to ACV.
