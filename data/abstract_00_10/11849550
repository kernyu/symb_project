Aspergillus fumigatus, an important human nosocomial pathogen, is resistant to sordarin derivatives, a new family of antifungals that inhibit protein synthesis by interaction with the EF-2-ribosomal stalk complex. To explore the role of the A. fumigatus ribosome in the resistance mechanism, the fungal stalk proteins were biochemically and genetically characterized and expressed in the sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two acidic phosphoproteins homologous to the 12 kDa P1 and P2 proteins described in other organisms were found together with the 34 kDa P0 protein, the third stalk component. The genes encoding each fungal stalk protein were expressed in mutant S. cerevisiae strains lacking the equivalent proteins. Both AfP1 and AfP2 proteins interact with their yeast counterparts of the opposite type and bind to the ribosomal particles in the presence of either the S. cerevisiae or the A. fumigatus P0 protein. The A. fumigatus acidic phosphoproteins did not alter the yeast ribosome sordarin sensitivity. On the contrary, the presence of the fungal P0 induces in vivo and in vitro resistance to sordarin derivatives when present in the yeast ribosome. The mutations A117-->E, P122-->R and G124-->V in A. fumigatus P0 reduce the resistance capacity of the protein. An S. cerevisiae strain with the complete ribosomal stalk of A. fumigatus was obtained, which could be useful for the screening of new antifungals against this pathogenic fungus.
