As part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, a total of 1078 Acinetobacter species and 842 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates were collected between January 1997 and December 1999 from 5 geographic regions (Canada, the United States, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific). The frequency of infections (by geographic region and body site), including those due to imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter species and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ)-resistant S. maltophilia, was evaluated. The possibility of seasonal variations in bloodstream infections caused by Acinetobacter species was studied, as was the activity of several therapeutic antimicrobials against all strains. Acinetobacter species and S. maltophilia were most frequently associated with pulmonary infections, independent of the region evaluated. In contrast, patterns of antimicrobial resistance markedly varied among distinct geographic regions, especially for nosocomial isolates. Although the carbapenems were the most active antimicrobials against Acinetobacter species, nearly 11.0% of the nosocomial isolates were resistant to this drug group in both regions. TMP-SMZ, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin were the only agents with consistent therapeutic activity against S. maltophilia isolates. Rates of resistance to TMP-SMZ ranged from 2% in Canada and Latin America to 10% in Europe. The geographic differences in resistance patterns among Acinetobacter species and S. maltophilia isolates observed in this study emphasize the importance of local surveillance in determining the most adequate therapy for acinetobacter and S. maltophilia infections and the possible clonal, epidemic nature of occurrence.
