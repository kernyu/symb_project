A patient with newly diagnosed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) received a femoral catheter for hemodialysis (HD). Shortly thereafter he developed fever, and blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The catheter was removed and the patient was treated with both vancomycin and rifampin; however, blood culture positivity persisted. The cerebrospinal fluid showed sterile meningitis. Subsequent imaging studies demonstrated aortic valve endocarditis and multiple mycotic aneurysms that appeared to include the intra- and extracranial vessels. The patient eventually died from sepsis. This case illustrates the aggressive and invasive nature of systemic infection with S. aureus and underscores the high morbidity and mortality associated with infections related to HD catheters.
