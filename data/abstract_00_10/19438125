OBJECTIVES: To evaluate resistance rates in methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) against clindamycin, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, fusidic acid, rifampicin and chloramphenicol isolated from skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). METHODS: Descriptive analysis of SSTI samples yielding MRSA in clinical laboratory of a tertiary care center; receiving specimens across Pakistan from January 2005 to June 2007. MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS: MRSA were identified using standard microbiological techniques. Susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) against fusidic acid, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, clindamycin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of rifampicin were determined using agar dilution method according to CLSI. RESULTS: During the study period 501 MRSA were isolated from SSTI. Overall variable susceptibility pattern with high resistance rates to tetracycline (82%), clindamycin (79%), cotrimoxazole (59%), and rifampicin (50%) were observed. Resistance to chloramphenicol (10%) and fusidic acid (9%) was low. CONCLUSION: There is a strong need in resource limited countries to review the utility of conventional antibiotics for the management of MRSA SSTI as new agents are expensive and not available. High resistance rates were observed against cotrimoxazole, tetracycline and clindamycin. Resistance to fusidic acid, rifampicin and Chloramphenicol was low.
