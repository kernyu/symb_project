Six representative teat dips from five different teat dip classes were tested for germicidal activity against challenge exposure to Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma californicum, and Mycoplasma bovigenitalium using a modified excised teat model. All teat dip formulations tested were efficacious against all of the Mycoplasma species, providing bacterial logarithmic reductions above 4. The germicides performed best against M. bovigenitalium with an average log reduction (LR) of 6.29. Average LR were 5.41 and 5.70 against M. bovis and M. californicum, respectively. The iodine and chlorhexidine products performed best against M. bovis and M. californicum, respectively, with complete kill of all organisms. The chlorhexidine and the barrier chlorine product also had complete kill of M. bovigenitalium organisms.
