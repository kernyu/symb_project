Antimicrobial resistance of micro-organisms in biofilms requires novel strategies to evaluate the efficacy of caries preventive agents in actual biofilms. Hence we investigated fluorescence intensity (FI) in Streptococcus mutans biofilms constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Upon addition of glucose FI in these biofilms increased significantly to steady state levels. FI-increase could be inhibited by oral care products in a dose-responsive manner. Lactic acid produced in these biofilms was measured at the end of the FI-recording. A linear correlation with a coefficient of 0.96 (p<0.01) was observed between FI-increase and lactate production, irrespective of the inhibitor used. The viability of biofilm cells after chlorhexidine (CHX) titration was also examined. Reduction of FI-increase was observed at low concentrations of CHX whereas a loss in viability was only seen at high concentrations. In conclusion, GFP synthesis can be used as a metabolic activity indicator in S. mutans biofilms.
