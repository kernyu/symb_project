PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and safety of a newly developed concomitant administration of fludarabine and alemtuzumab (FluCam) in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 36 patients were treated in this phase II study (median age, 61.47 years; mean number of prior chemotherapies, 2.6; Binet stage C, n = 28). After an initial dose escalation of alemtuzumab over 3 days, alemtuzumab 30 mg and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 were administered on 3 consecutive days. Treatment was repeated after 28 days for up to six cycles. Restaging (following National Cancer Institute criteria) was carried out after cycles 2 and 4 and 1 month after the end of treatment. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 83% (11 complete responses, 19 partial responses, one stable disease, and five progressive diseases). Two patients with progressive disease developed fungal pneumonias, and one patient died as a result of Escherichia coli sepsis. Two subclinical cytomegalovirus reactivations occurred. CONCLUSION: The new FluCam regimen is effective and feasible in patients with relapsed and refractory B-CLL.
