FREQUENCY OF BETA-LACTAMASE ACTIVITY: Prevotella spp. are anaerobic pathogenic bacteria. Among 100 strains isolated, beta-lactamase producing strains accounted for 58%. Fifty-two percent of the strains were pigmented and 63% were non pigmented. ACTIVITY AGAINST BETA-LACTAMASE PRODUCERS: In general, all the antibiotics exhibited higher activity against non producers than against beta-lactamase producers. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for amoxicillin/davulanic acid was lower or equal to 2 mg/l for all strains isolated.
