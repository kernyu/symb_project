Tuberculosis (TB) is the second most deadly infectious disease. Despite potentially curative pharmacotherapies being available for over 50 years, the length of the treatment and the pill burden can hamper patient lifestyle. Thus, low compliance and adherence to administration schedules remain the main reasons for therapeutic failure and contribute to the development of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains. Pediatric patients constitute a high risk population. Most of the first-line drugs are not commercially available in pediatric form. The design of novel antibiotics attempts to overcome drug resistance, to shorten the treatment course and to reduce drug interactions with antiretroviral therapies. On the other hand, the existing anti-TB drugs are still effective. Overcoming technological drawbacks of these therapeutic agents as well as improving the effectiveness of the drug by targeting the infection reservoirs remains the central aims of Pharmaceutical Technology. In this framework, nanotechnologies appear as one of the most promising approaches for the development of more effective and compliant medicines. The present review thoroughly overviews the state-of-the-art in the development of nano-based drug delivery systems for encapsulation and release of anti-TB drugs and discusses the challenges that are faced in the development of a more effective, compliant and also affordable TB pharmacotherapy.
