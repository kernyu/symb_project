OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize variation in the use of HIV genotypic resistance tests and how results were reported. METHODS: Clinicians and laboratory managers at all Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers were asked to complete a survey in March 2003 regarding HIV resistance testing practices. RESULTS: Surveys from 131 of 150 sites were returned. Forty-eight percent of HIV clinicians indicated that US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines were the usual basis for ordering tests. Although between 12% and 31% of respondents indicated that they always, sometimes, seldom, or never ordered resistance tests in patients with acute or chronic HIV infection, >70% ordered tests in adherent patients with treatment failure. Among the 32 centers with >200 patients in care, 13 +/- 8 (mean +/- standard deviation) tests were performed per 100 patients in care during 2002. Forty-nine percent of clinicians said that tests were helpful, but only 33% expressed confidence in using test results. Only 40% of sites entered results in the VA electronic medical record. CONCLUSION: Ordering patterns for HIV resistance tests differed significantly among VA sites. A minority of clinicians indicated confidence in the use of test results. A consistent system to capture and present complete results was absent.
