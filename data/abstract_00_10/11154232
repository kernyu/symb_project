Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) comprise a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders that are characterized by an accumulation of T-lymphocytes in the skin and occasionally in blood known as Sezary syndrome (SS). In most cases the dominant clone displays T-helper 2 cytokines. Because IFN-gamma is a natural inhibitor of T-helper 2 cells and IFN-alpha is frequently used in CTCL, the impact of IFNs on SS-derived purified clonal T-helper 2 cells was studied using anti-Vbeta antibodies. Moreover, IFNs are known to mediate virus resistance in normal cells. The isolated clonal CD4(+) cells, but not the nonclonal CD4(+) cells, appeared resistant to IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha stimulation in terms of human leukocyte antigen up-regulation and MxA induction caused in part by alterations in Stat-1 molecule mRNA and IFNgammaR1 mRNA transcription. The IFN resistance of the patient-derived clonal cells was then targeted by vesicular stomatitis virus infection after IFN-alpha priming, resulting in selective viral replication in clonal cells. In contrast, nonclonal cells of the same patient showed IFN-dependent MxA expression, which is a major mediator protein of viral protection. The IFN resistance of the dominant T-helper 2 cells might be important for lymphomagenesis. Interferon signaling deficiencies can be targeted for purging patients' cells in vitro. Furthermore, this approach may allow specific molecular interventions, resulting in the efficient treatment of CTCL and other IFN-resistant neoplasms such as lung cancer.
