Progress in the treatment and prophylaxis of cyst-forming coccidial infections (Neospora, Sarcocystis Toxoplasma) and Cryptosporidium infections has been limited (Table 1: Haberkorn 1996: Croft 1997: Wang 1997). However, new possibilities have been opened up in the treatment of Eimeria-induced coccidiosis in poultry and mammals. due to improvements in treatment and, or metaphylaxis. A new polyether antibiotic. semduramycin, has recently been added to the range of effective prophylactic preparations. The development of resistance to anticoccidial agents is now posing similar problems to those encountered with malaria, coccidiosis in poultry being particularly affected. Because no new active ingredient from a new family of chemical substances has been developed for more than 10 years, the following approaches are being adopted to get round this problem: the use of older preparations which have not been used for a long time, the introduction of combinations such as narasin nicarbazin or methyl benzoquate clopidol and the alternating use of anticoccidial agents in rotation and shuttle programmes. The goal of a real alternative, i.e. vaccination, has been achieved to a certain extent in the form of live vaccines for laying hens and broiler breeders and is being practiced in some countries.
