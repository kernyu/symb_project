BACKGROUND: Dalbavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibacterial agent with in vitro and in vivo activity against a number of Gram-positive organisms, including some with multidrug resistance. This is a review of the available literature explaining the pertinent information regarding dalbavancin's pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse event profile and potential place in therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explain the relevant data on dalbavancin's administration, efficacy and tolerability. METHODS: A PubMed/MEDLINE search was used to review data published from January 1966 through to February 2008 with the keywords dalbavancin, lipoglycopeptide or BI 397. CONCLUSIONS: Dalbavancin, currently pending full FDA approval, has favorable minimum inhibitory concentrations against many Gram-positive organisms as compared to currently available antimicrobials. Dalbavancin has a prolonged half-life (149 - 300 h), which may lead to a therapeutic option that is different from available antimicrobials. Its efficacy and tolerability have been established in treating complicated skin and skin structure infections. Future data are required in order to determine dalbavancin's true place in therapy, if approval is achieved.
