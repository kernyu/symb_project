This study investigated slime production by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) using the standard tube (ST), Congo red agar (CRA) plate and Christensen's tube (CT) methods, and compared the results with those of the crystal violet reaction (CVR) test. The potential correlation between slime production and antimicrobial resistance was also evaluated. In total, 205 CNS strains were isolated from biological samples: 92 (44.9%) were shown to produce slime by the ST method; 96 (46.8%) by the CRA plate method; 90 (43.9%) by the CT method; and 89 (43.4%) strains were CVR positive. Eighty-three (40.5%) CNS strains were positive for slime production by the ST, CRA and CT methods. The findings of the ST, CRA and CT test methods were consistent with each other but were not related to CVR positivity. Based on the ST method, rates of antibiotic resistance to several antimicrobial agents were higher in slime-positive strains than in slime-negative strains and, in some cases, this was statistically significant.
