Sensitivity of two groups of lipophilic corynebacteria strains of different species, which form stable residential flora on human skin, to therapeutically significant groups of antibiotic was compared. Strains were isolated from people who did not have any contact with hospital environment, and from doctors closely connected with hospital. It was shown that strains isolated from doctors, which were in fact not under antibiotic pressure, were five times more multiresistant whilst at the same time being resistant to antibiotics used only in hospital treatment.
