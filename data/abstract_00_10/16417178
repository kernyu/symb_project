Previous studies in the Zenica--Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina, indicated some different epidemiological features of Campylobacter infections and high degree of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, it was important to investigate epidemiology of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli infections by demographic features and antimicrobial resistance in the 1999-2001 period. A total number of 40 (75.5%) C. jejuni and 13 (24.5%) C. coli non-repeated clinical isolates were analyzed. More than half of isolates, 30 (56.6%) were from urban dwellers. Campylobacter isolates mainly obtained from children under 6 years of age, 42 (79.2%), resulting in far off highest incidence rate of 41.4/100,000/year in this age group. There was noted high degree of resistance to ciprofloxacin in children less than 6 years of age (14.3%), and extremely high overall erythromycin-resistance rate (30%). Campylobacteriosis in this region is a public health concern not in the term of the number reported cases, but of distinctive epidemiologic features.
