Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis fingerprints of 98 Campylobacter jejuni isolates from patients (85) and chicken carcasses (13) in Hong Kong in 2002 demonstrated high genetic diversity. The prevalence of quinolone resistance among the isolates was 85.9%, and replacement of the threonine-86 residue in the gyrase subunit A was the major resistance mechanism.
