Resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial compounds continues to increase. There are several possibilities for protection against pathogenic microorganisms, for instance, preparation of new vaccines against resistant bacterial strains, use of specific bacteriophages, and searching for new antibiotics. The antibiotic search includes: (1) looking for new antibiotics from nontraditional or less traditional sources, (2) sequencing microbial genomes with the aim of finding genes specifying biosynthesis of antibiotics, (3) analyzing DNA from the environment (metagenomics), (4) re-examining forgotten natural compounds and products of their transformations, and (5) investigating new antibiotic targets in pathogenic bacteria.
