Osteomyelitis of the jaw is of relatively low incidence. Maxillary Osteomyelitis is however rare compared with mandibular osteomyelitis. The extensive blood supply and the strut-like bones of the maxilla make it less prone to chronic infections. Systemic conditions that alter the host's resistance such as diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disorders, agranulocytosis, anaemia, especially sickle cell anaemia are predisposing factors for the development of this condition. An unusual case of chronic maxillary osteomyelitis induced by trauma in a diabetic, with subsequent atypical necrotising ulceration of palatal mucosa resulting in total maxillary sequestration is presented.
