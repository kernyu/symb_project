The meropenem susceptibility surveillance study was performed between 2002 and 2006 in Japan. Meropenem resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was nearly constant at about 10% during the period. For all species of the bacteria tested, the MIC(90) of meropenem in 2006 was not more than 4-fold higher than that in 2002 and 2004.
