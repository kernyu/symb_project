Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a well-known complication of viral upper respiratory tract infection and is associated with a significant socioeconomic burden. Difficulties in diagnosis, a substantial spontaneous resolution rate, and growing concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance make the proper management of ABRS quite challenging. Treatment guidelines have been developed, taking into account the major bacterial pathogens, rates of antimicrobial resistance, spontaneous resolution rates, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations. Optimal choices for initial treatment of ABRS in patients without prior antibacterial exposure include the oral beta-lactam agents amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime. Clinicians are encouraged to consider the local pathogen distribution and rates of antibacterial resistance in selecting therapy for ABRS.
