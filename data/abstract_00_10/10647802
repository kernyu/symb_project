OBJECTIVE: To update recommendations for antiretroviral therapy for adult human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, based on new information and drugs that are available. PARTICIPANTS: A 17-member international physician panel with antiretroviral research and HIV patient care experience initially convened by the International AIDS Society-USA in December 1995. EVIDENCE: Available clinical and basic science data including phase 3 controlled trials; data on clinical, virologic, and immunologic end points; research conference reports; HIV pathogenesis data; and panel expert opinion. Recommendations were limited to therapies available (US Food and Drug Administration approved) in 1999. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The panel assesses new research reports and interim results and regularly meets to consider how the new data affect therapy recommendations. Recommendations are updated via full-panel consensus. Guidelines are presented as recommendations if the supporting evidence warrants routine use in the particular situation and as considerations if data are preliminary or incomplete but suggestive. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of new antiretroviral drugs has expanded treatment choices. The importance of adherence, emerging long-term complications of therapy, recognition and management of antiretroviral failure, and new monitoring tools are addressed. Optimal care requires individualized management and ongoing attention to relevant scientific and clinical information in the field.
