Due to the emergence of resistance to known antibiotics to various organisms, for example, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococci, and Pseudomonas there is a renewed interest in the discovery of new antibacterials. Oxazolidinones, totally synthetic class of novel antibacterials, possess activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, especially MRSA. Linezolid, the first approved drug from this class, has shown a great promise in saving lives of many patients by acting against drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms. However, its use is somewhat limited because of its myelotoxicity when used long term (>21 days). Various research groups are active in this area either to improve myelotoxicity profile of linezolid or to expand the spectrum of activity of linezolid. In spite of active research in this area, the discovery of an oxazolidinone possessing improved myelotoxicity compared to linezolid, linezolid-like efficacy, and PK remains challenging.
