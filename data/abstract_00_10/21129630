The celestial rise in antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative bacteria has challenged both the scientific and pharmaceutical sectors. The hallmark of this general increase is the unbridled dissemination of carbapenem resistance genes, namely KPC, OXA and metallo-beta-lactamase variants. In particular, the media attention given to the NDM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase has highlighted the global consequences of human behaviour on spreading antibiotic resistance.
