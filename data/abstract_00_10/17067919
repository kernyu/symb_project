Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen that colonises the stomach of about half of the world's population. The bacterium has now been accepted as the causative agent of several gastroduodenal disorders, ranging from chronic active gastritis and peptic ulcer disease to gastric cancer. The recognition of H pylori as a gastric pathogen has had a substantial effect on gastroenterological practice, since many untreatable gastroduodenal disorders with uncertain cause became curable infectious diseases. Treatment of H pylori infection results in ulcer healing and can reduce the risk of gastric cancer development. Although H pylori is susceptible to many antibiotics in vitro, only a few antibiotics can be used in vivo to cure the infection. The frequent indication for anti-H pylori therapy, together with the limited choice of antibiotics, has resulted in the development of antibiotic resistance in H pylori, which substantially impairs the treatment of H pylori-associated disorders. Antimicrobial resistance in H pylori is widespread, and although the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance shows regional variation per antibiotic, it can be as high as 95%. We focus on the treatment of H pylori infection and on the clinical relevance, mechanisms, and diagnosis of antimicrobial resistance.
