Inappropriate use of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance worldwide. In Latin America, antibiotics are easily obtained over the counter. In the United States, the Latino population is the largest and fastest growing immigrant group. Hence, it is necessary to understand Latino cultural practices in regards to antibiotic use to develop effective interventions that reduce inappropriate antibiotic use among this population. We conducted a systematic review of descriptive and intervention studies measuring knowledge, attitudes, and practices of antibiotic use among Latinos in the United States. The search yielded only 11 descriptive studies and no interventions. The literature suggests that many Latinos in the United States self-prescribe antibiotics because of financial and sociocultural barriers and inaccurately believe that antibiotics help treat viral infections. Increased access to health care and appropriate culturally tailored interventions specific to Latinos are needed to promote judicious antibiotic use among Latinos.
