OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characterization of cefoperazone resistance gene (CPZr) on plasmid pFC in E. coli HX88108 and inquire into the mechanism of resistance to CPZ at the molecular level. METHODS: E. coli HX88108 strain which demonstrated high-level resistance to cefoperazone (MIC, > 512 micrograms/ml) was isolated from a severely infected patient in 1988. Five plasmids coexisting in the strain were designated pFC, pFT1; pFT2, pFT3 and pFX, respectively. Four plasmids except pFX conferred CPZ resistance. Cefoperazone resistance gene (CPZr) has been cloned from plasmid pFC. beta-lactamase assays with Nitrocefin were performed. RESULTS: The expression product of CPZr was beta-lactamase. The high level beta-lactamase enzymatic activities against cephaloridine of CPZr transformants which were detected spectrophotometrically at 260 nm wave length demonstrated high level similarities to that of pFC. MICs of 18 antibiotics were determined according to a guideline of NCCLS by broth dilution method. CPZr transformants showed moderate level resistance to ampicillin, cefazolin, cefazolin, cefamandole and CPZ (MIC, 64 micrograms/ml). Meanwhile, susceptibility testing results demonstrated that the level of resistance to CPZ of pFC transformant in this study (MIC, 64 micrograms/ml) was much lower than that in 1988 (MIC, > 512 micrograms/ml) and resistance to nofloxacin and aminoglycosides was not observed. Induction experiment and temperature-sensitive mutation of CPZ resistance were performed. CPZr colonal strains revealed the higher-level of resistance to CPZ (MIC, 512 micrograms/ml) due to antibiotic CPZ induction rather than temperature sensitive mutation. CONCLUSION: This observation suggests that resistance to antibiotics encoded by plasmid might have been lower or lost under no antibiotic stress in a certain period, but higher under heavy stress.
