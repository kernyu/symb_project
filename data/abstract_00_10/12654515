The increased oxidative stress induced by mutant SOD1 is associated with motor neuron degeneration in both human ALS and transgenic mice expressing mutant SOD1. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is neurotrophic and also protects from hypoxia-induced neuronal injury. The potential role of VEGF in preventing mutant SOD1-mediated motor neuron cell death was examined using a mouse NSC34 motor neuron-like cell culture system. Infection with adenovirus containing mutant G93A-SOD1, but not vector control or wild-type SOD1, increased cellular oxidative stress and motor neuron-like cell death. However, NSC34 cells pretreated with VEGF displayed a dose-dependent resistance to oxidative damage from hydrogen peroxide, TNF-alpha, and mutant G93A-SOD1. VEGF activated both PI3-K and MAPK activities in mouse NSC34 motor neuron-like cells. Pharmacological inhibitors and constitutively active as well as dominant negative mutants of MAPK and PI3-K revealed that the protective effects of VEGF were mediated via the PI3-K activity, and that MAPK activation was not associated with NSC34 cell survival. Furthermore, VEGF-induced downstream Akt activation promoted motor neuron-like NSC34 cell survival in the presence of mutant G93A-SOD1. Thus, VEGF protected mouse NSC34 motor neuron-like cell death from mutant G93A-SOD1 effects via PI3-K/Akt activation.
