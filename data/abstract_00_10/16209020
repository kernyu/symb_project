Two hundred and two patients with different forms of pulmonary tuberculosis were examined to study the characteristics of sensitivity with the signs of multidrug resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, by using a microbiological assay of the absolute concentrations and determining mutations in the genes rpoB, katG, inhA, oxyR, and kasA, by employing different molecular biological assays. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) DNA was isolated from both a diagnostic material (such as sputum, bronchial secretion), and clinical MBT isolates. By showing a higher sensitivity and a higher specificity, as cultural techniques, molecular biological assays of MBT drug sensitivity in patients with tuberculosis were ascertained to accelerate its diagnosis until the patient was admitted to a clinic.
