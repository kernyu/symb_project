Several treatment failures and widespread antimicrobial resistance to ciprofloxacin have been documented, subsequent to its initial recommendation in 1989 as a single dose alternative therapy for gonorrhoea. Still, it continues to be part of various treatment schedules in National STD control guidelines including India. This prompted us to study the current status of this drug in the treatment of gonorrhoea. Thirty-five male patients with gonococcal urethritis were included in the study. The susceptibility to penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone was determined by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin by agar plate dilution method. The clinical and bacteriological response was assessed on day 5 after treatment with single dose ciprofloxacin, 500 mg. The sensitivity pattern of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was observed to be: ceftriaxone 100%, azithromycin 100%, tetracycline 65.7%, penicillin 40% and ciprofloxacin 5.7% by disc diffusion method. The MIC for ciprofloxacin was below 0.06 microg/mL (sensitive) in one (2.5%) isolate only. On the fifth day a large number of treatment failures (88.5%) were seen with ciprofloxacin while none was noted one week after re-treatment with ceftriaxone. The location of endemic quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG) in New Delhi has increased alarmingly, resulting in an extremely high proportion of therapeutic failures, and thus requiring appropriate alterations in the presently recommended treatment regimens.
