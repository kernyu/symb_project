OBJECTIVES: To determine geographic and temporal trends in anti-bacterial resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections as part of the PROTEKT US surveillance study (2000-2003). METHODS: From 2000 to 2003, 31 001 isolates of S. pneumoniae were collected. Anti-bacterial minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined at a central laboratory using the CLSI broth microdilution method. Macrolide resistance genotypes were determined by PCR. RESULTS: Overall, 29.4, 22.5, 0.9, and 0.02% of S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to erythromycin, penicillin, levofloxacin, and telithromycin, respectively, with considerable regional variability. Multidrug resistance was stable at approx. 31%. Among macrolide-resistant isolates, mef(A) was the most prevalent resistance gene identified; however, the percentage of isolates with this gene decreased from 68.8% (2000) to 63.9% (2003), while the prevalence of isolates containing both the erm(B) and mef(A) genes increased (2000, 9.7%; 2003, 16.4%). Over 90% of these erm(B)+mef(A)-positive isolates were also resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, while 98.6% were susceptible to levofloxacin and 99.1% were susceptible to telithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin and erythromycin resistance among isolates of S. pneumoniae from the U.S.A. remained high over the 3 years of the study. Telithromycin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against pneumococcal strains.
