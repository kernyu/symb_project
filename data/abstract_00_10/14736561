PURPOSE: Seven days triple therapies combining a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 2 antimicrobial agents (clarithromycin [C], amoxicillin [A], metronidazole [M]), are recommended for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. The eradication failures have increased these last years, particularly in France (about 30%). They are essentially related to the development of antimicrobial agents resistance, mainly concerning macrolides and nitro-imidazoles. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Primary resistance to clarithromycin is variable, but reaching now about 10% throughout the world and about 20% in France. It reduces the eradication success rate at 25%. The secondary resistance is very high, contra-indicating the use of clarithromycin in second line regimens. Primary resistance to amoxicillin has recently appeared, but remains very low until now, less than 2%, as the tetracyclin (T) resistance. Primary resistance to metronidazole is 3 times higher than macrolides resistance, but its determination is less accurate. Metronidazole resistance reduces eradication rate of about 25%, leading to the use of metronidazole in second line therapy, in increasing the triple therapy duration at 14 days (PPI-A-M), or in combination with quadruple therapy (Bismuth-PPI-T-M). Other rescue-treatments are efficacious, based on ranitidine bismuth citrate combined regimens or on rifabutine (R) based regimens (PPI-A-R). FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: The recent knowledge of the mutations mainly responsible for H. pylori resistance to antimicrobial agents now allows the development of detection methods based on the study of bacterial DNA. These methods have been validated for clarithromycin and should favour in the near future the determination of resistance by the use of biopsy culture or directly on the gastric biopsy.
