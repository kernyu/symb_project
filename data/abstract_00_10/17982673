Cisplatin is commonly used as a chemotherapeutic agent for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it cannot satisfactorily improve the survival rate for patients with advanced HCC due to intrinsic or acquired drug resistance caused by multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). To clarify whether or not glycyrrhizin and lamivudine have modulator effects on HCC treated with cisplatin, we established a cisplatin-resistant Huh7 HCC cell line and analyzed the mRNA expression of MRPs in the resistant cells. The resistant cells showed 14.1-fold higher resistance to cisplatin, and they expressed higher levels of MRP2 (6.29-fold), MRP3 (3.2-fold), MRP4 (11.3-fold) and MRP5 (3.39-fold) mRNAs than the wild-type cells by using real-time PCR. However, MRP1, MDR1 and GST-pi mRNA were not induced. Compared with the treatment of the resistant cells with cisplatin only, co-treatment with cisplatin and glycyrrhizin or lamivudine significantly decreased the cell viability to 76.8% and 79.5%, respectively. Co-treatment with cisplatin and both glycyrrhizin and lamivudine further decreased the cell viability to 65.1%. Intracellular concentration of cisplatin in the resistant cells decreased to 36.4% of that of the wild-type cells while it increased to 47.7% or 48.4% when glycyrrhizin or lamivudine were added separately, or 60% when they were added together. Our findings indicate the following: i) high expression of MRP2, MRP3, MRP4 and MRP5 decreases cisplatin accumulation in cisplatin-resistant HCC cells and contributes to cisplatin resistance; ii) glycyrrhizin and/or lamivudine accumulate cisplatin in resistant cells by inhibiting the cisplatin efflux from the cells; and iii) glycyrrhizin and lamivudine both act as modulators and have the effect of reversing cisplatin resistance, and co-treatment with glycyrrhizin and lamivudine enhances modulator activity in reversing the cisplatin resistance.
