The prevalence of transmitted resistance to antiretroviral drugs varies geographically, with little known about this effect in Asia. In Korea, zidovudine has been widely administered, without charge, through the National AIDS program since the early 1990s; with other potent antiretroviral agents also being introduced in the late 1990s. An analysis of the drug susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs was performed by genotyping of the drug-resistant mutations in HIV on plasma samples from 50 HIV-infected patients who had received no treatment, between February 1998 and November 2002, which was interpreted according to the consensus guidelines of the International AIDS Society-USA panel. The median CD4 cell count was 100 cells/mm3; the mean plasma RNA level was (5.19 +/- 0.56) log copies per milliliter. Of the 50 subjects tested 4 (8.0%) had one or more major drug-resistance mutation. The prevalence of resistance to multiple classes of drugs was 2.0%. No mutations, associated with resistance to non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, were identified. Resistant mutations of the reverse-transcriptase gene were found at codons 67, 70, 118, 215, and 219, and a resistant mutation of the protease gene was found only at codon 46 (2.6%, 1 of 39). There was an 8.0% prevalence of primary drug resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Korean patients infected with HIV-1.
