In Japan, Neisseria meningitidis is not sufficiently recognized as the primary causative bacteria of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as the number of reported cases is small. Here, we summarize reports from 3 medical institutions, present clinical courses for each case, as well recommending precautions to prevent infection with this bacterium. Fourteen cases of N. meningitidis urethritis (MU) were admitted between April 2001 and June 2006. All patients were male, consulted a doctor after experiencing subjective symptoms, such as micturition pain and pus discharge, and were diagnosed as having urethritis using isolation culture methods. In 8 of the 14 cases, history of sexual contact in the preclinical stage was confirmed, and contact was with a commercial sex worker (CSW) in 6 of these cases. Many of these patients recalled oral contact. All strains indicated susceptibility to many drugs, and there were no problems with treatment. With regard to serotype, there were 10 cases of type Y, 1 case of type B, and 3 cases that were not classifiable or unidentified. In addition, among the 9 strains that were subjected to genotype identification, 7 strains were ST-23. The recent increase in availability of nucleic acid amplification methods has facilitated simultaneous detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. However, we fear that MU will become latent. For screening of urethritis, Gram staining and culture of urethral material must be performed to detect this disease. The relationship of the detected strain and its role in the pathogenesis of meningitis are uncertain, but its serotype and genotype are common in cases of meningitis. Thus, precautions are required to prevent spread of this bacterium.
