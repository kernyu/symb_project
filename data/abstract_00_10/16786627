It is shown that the temperate coliphage P1Cmcts100 can transduce resistance to chloramphenicol in the cells of phytopathogenic bacteria Erwinia horticola and E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica. In the latter case the extrachromosomal DNA is inherited by recipient cells as the authentic prophage P1. The prophage P1 expresses rectification-modification EcoP1, as well as the genes of lysogenic conversion in phytopathogenic erwinia. Here the character of superinfection of transductants of E. atroseptica g125 by erwiniophage ZF40, by certain carotovoricines and coliphage T21 changes. Besides, the expression of genes of prophage P1 leads to the increase of survival of E. atroseptica when raising the environment temperature. Under these conditions the trans mutagenesis of bacterial chromosome can precede, that permits considering the phage P1 as a special tool for studying the molecular genetics of erwinia.
