Resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin (amoxicilline) was found in 82, 3.8, and 1.9% of 106 Helicobacter pylori isolates, respectively. No tetracycline-resistant isolates were found. In all of the clarithromycin-resistant isolates, only one point mutation was present, either A2143G or A2142G. Our results indicate that metronidazole should not be included in the empirical treatment of H. pylori infection in this region.
