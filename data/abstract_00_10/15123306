A 2.5 kb full-length cDNA clone of a channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) Mx gene was obtained using RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from RNA extracted from the liver of poly I:C stimulated channel catfish. The gene consists of an open reading frame of 1905 nucleotides encoding a 635 amino acid protein. The predicted protein is 72.5 kDa and contains the dynamin family signature, a tripartite GTP binding motif and a leucine zipper, characteristic of all known Mx proteins. The catfish Mx protein exhibited 79% identity with perch Mx and between 71% and 74% identity with the three Atlantic salmon and the three rainbow trout Mx proteins. Mx mRNA was constitutively expressed in channel catfish ovary (CCO) cells, but in higher quantities in response to poly I:C treatment. Mx was induced in channel catfish following injection with channel catfish virus (CCV) and poly I:C.
