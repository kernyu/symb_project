Ten xanthones with one or two isoprenoid groups and a prenylated benzophenone isolated from roots of Cudrania cochinchinensis (Moraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Among these compounds, gerontoxanthone H exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against five VRE strains (VanA, VanB and VanC) (MICs = 1.56 microg/ml). Four xanthones, 1,3,7-trihydroxy-2-prenylxanthone, gerontoxanthone I, alvaxanthone and isoalvaxanthone, showed weaker antibacterial activity against these VREs (MICs = 3.13-6.25 microg/ml). .
