We investigated the activities of linezolid, vancomycin, and teicoplanin in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Our results demonstrate that linezolid clearly reduced bacterial numbers in the methicillin-resistant S. aureus hematogenous infection model and significantly improved the survival rate of immunocompromised mice infected with vancomycin-insensitive S. aureus compared with vancomycin and teicoplanin. The pharmacokinetic profiles also reflected the effectiveness of linezolid.
