We showed how eugenol blocks the synaptic transmission and gave a possible interpretation how it inhibits the excitation-contraction coupling that several authors described previously. Eugenol acts both in the pre- and postsynaptic side of the neurons. It blocks the Ca2+-currents, decreases the membrane potential of the neurons, increases the inward resistance and decreases the GABA, ACh and glutamate evoked excitatory responses in submillimolar concentration.
