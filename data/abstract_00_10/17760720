BACKGROUND: Standard triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori has an eradication rate of about 50% in Turkey. It may be due to an increased resistance of H. pylori to antibiotics. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new second-generation fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin-containing triple therapy in H. pylori eradication. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an open-label, prospective, single-center, pilot study. We studied 71 dyspeptic patients infected with H. pylori diagnosed by both histology and rapid urease test. Out of 71 dyspeptic patients, 64 had non-ulcer dyspepsia and seven had peptic ulcer. Patients received pantoprazole (40 mg b.i.d.) plus moxifloxacin (400 mg/day) and amoxicillin (1000 mg b.i.d.) for 14 days. Eradication was assessed 4 weeks after completing the therapy by histology and rapid urease test. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat eradication rates were determined. RESULTS: The eradication rate was 42.2% for the intention-to-treat analysis and 47.6% for the per-protocol analysis. Of all patients included in the study, 29.5% had side-effects and only 2.8% of the patients discontinued the treatment because of side-effects. Most of the complications were mild and self-limiting. CONCLUSION: Triple therapy with pantoprazole, moxifloxacin, and amoxicillin for 14 days yielded unacceptably low eradication rates. However, using tests of susceptibility to antibiotics, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to judge these eradication rates of moxifloxacin containing eradication treatment.
