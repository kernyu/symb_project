The present study was conducted to study antibiogram pattern of isolates from urinary tract infection (UTI) cases at a referral hospital in Eastern Nepal. Of the total 2,799 of urine samples studied, 720 (25.7%) were positive for some kinds of bacterial agents. Escherichia coli was most predominant organism (59.0%) followed by Klebsiella sp. (12.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%), Acinetobacter sp. (5.9%), Enterococcus sp. (4.2%) and others (2.6%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method following National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Services (NCCLS) guidelines. Most strains of Esch. coli and Klebsiella sp. were resistant to Ampicillin and Ciprofloxacin. Ps. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. showed relatively higher resistance to Aminoglycosides. These organisms were often multidrug resistant. Ps. aeruginosa showed 68.0% resistance to even Ceftazidime. For Enterococcus sp. Nitrofurantion and Gentamicin were the drugs of choice. Of the all antimicrobial agents tested, Ciprofloxacin showed most disappointing result.
