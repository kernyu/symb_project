The genetic basis of the fungicidal activity of strains of Lactobacillus brevis and L. fermentum isolated from indigenous fermented foods was determined. A 5.5-kb plasmid was isolated from L. brevis while L. Fermentum was found to harbor no plasmid. Plasmid curing indicated no correlation between the plasmid and the fungicidal activity of the Lactobacillus species. The fungicidal activity of the isolated organisms can be supposed to be mediated by the chromosome. No antibiotic resistance genetic markers were detected on the plasmid and hence it was classified as cryptic.
