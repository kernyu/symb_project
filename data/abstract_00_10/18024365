We report a fifty-year-old woman presenting with severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) and prolonged high Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) variant A DNAeamia detected by quantitative PCR. Multiple antiviral treatments failed to affect the HHV6 DNAemia and subsequent immunosuppressive treatment reached only partial improvement as judged by bone marrow examinations. The patient remained dependent on thrombocyte transfusions and G-CSF treatment. After one year of steady high HHV6 DNA load in blood, viral chromosomal integration was proved by demonstrating the viral DNA in hair follicles. This condition appeared to be unconnected with, and to have no effect, on the original SAA.
