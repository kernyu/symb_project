We analyzed mechanisms decreasing hind-limb perfusion pressure (PP) with blackcurrant concentrate (BC) in the rat. The decrease in PP with BC was abolished by endothelial removal, nitroarginine plus tetraethylammonium, nitroarginine plus catalase or 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one as an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase and potassium channel(s), and accompanied by the increased cyclic GMP level. Partial but significant inhibition caused by KCl was observed during contraction. Authentic H2O2 decreased the PP in a sensitive manner to catalase and tetraethylammonium. The decrease in PP with BC in the presence of nitroarginine was significantly attenuated by diverse potassium channel blockers. Two delphinidins of 4 anthocyanins purified from BC definitely decreased the PP through similar mechanisms to BC. These results suggest that the decreased PP with BC is possibly mediated by endothelial NO and H2O2, and partially through the activation of diverse potassium channels, and that 2 delphinidins play a major role as active components of BC.
