We present a case report of a patient who had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Campylobacter fetus infection with a number of unusual clinical and microbiological features. The patient had prominent gastrointestinal symptoms, splenic infarction, splenomegaly with hypersplenism, and hemophagocytic histiocytosis in the spleen and lymph nodes; the organism displayed growth on Campy-selective blood agar, thermotolerance, and resistance to quinolones, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and erythromycin.
