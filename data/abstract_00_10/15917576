We analyzed the resistance to cefotaxime of a Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis isolate from a stool culture of a 4-year-old boy. It produced a beta-lactamase CTX-M-14, encoded by two related R plasmids. The region surrounding the blaCTX-M-14 gene had an original mosaic structure containing insertion sequences (IS26 and IS903D).
