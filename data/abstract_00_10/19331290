The global campaign toward malaria eradication has received a tremendous boost with the addition of artemisinin compounds to the therapeutic armament. Artemisinin drugs are now being recommended in combination with existing antimalarials, a pairing often referred to as artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). The World Health Organization considers ACT first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in endemic regions. In the United States, ACT is not currently FDA-approved. The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, however, is studying its use and developing artemisinin compounds for the treatment of severe malaria. Artesunate, one of the artemisinin derivatives, is available to eligible patients in the United States free of charge. The drug is stocked at the CDC headquarters, as well as at 7 of the 20 quarantine stations.
