Resistance patterns that are currently problematic in Europe can vary greatly within the same species over time, among various patient populations and among geographic regions on the same continent. The results from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program, which monitors carbapenem resistance rates in institutions using meropenem, were used to determine resistance differences among Proteus mirabilis. MIC results from 688 P. mirabilis strains were classified into 4 patient care groups: ICU (n=426), neutropenia patients (NP; n=145), general wards (n=97) and cystic fibrosis patients (CF; n=20). A total of 40 centers from 12 European countries have participated since 1997, divided into 3 geographic regions (East, North, South). All testing was performed by NCCLS reference methods and interpretive criteria, including screening of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes. Over the monitored interval the resistance rates varied for each agent without a clear trend toward a greater rate. Rank order of susceptibility was: meropenem (99%) > piperacillin/tazobactam (TAZ; 96%) > cefepime (95%) > ceftazidime (CAZ; 94%) > imipenem (IPM; 92%). Ciprofloxacin (CIP) was the least active agent tested (MIC90 4 microg/ml; 86% susceptible). Unexpectedly, 3.6% of P. mirabilis were imipenem-resistant (MIC, > or = 16 microg/ml). Greater rates of resistance were found for strains from NP and CF patients, and from eastern or southern European sites, usually associated with epidemic clusters. Generally susceptible species such as P. mirabilis have recently emerged as therapeutic problems in European medical centers following mutations that compromise CIP, CAZ and aminoglycoside use. Imipenem also showed decreased susceptibility of greater than 7% compared to less than 1% for meropenem. Continued surveillance by the MYSTIC Program appears to be a prudent practice to focus effective empiric treatment regimens.
