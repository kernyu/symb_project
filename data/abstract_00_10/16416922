Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Infantis isolates from retail raw chicken meat (n = 98) and broiler chickens on farms (n = 70) were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility and antimicrobial resistance genes. A total of 15 antimicrobial resistance types, 14 in meat and 10 in broiler isolates, were identified, and 9 of the 15 types were indistinguishable between meat and broiler isolates. Resistance to both oxytetracycline and dihydrostreptomycin accounted for 94.0% of the resistance types in meat and broiler isolates, and each type harbored aadA1 within 1.0 kb of class 1 integron and tetA. Of nalidixic acid resistance types, point mutations at 87Asp (GAC) to Tyr (TAC) in the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA was detected in 10 of 13 meat isolates and at 87Asp to Asn (AAC) in four of seven broiler isolates. These findings suggest that the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella Infantis in retail chicken meat predominantly originates from broiler chickens.
