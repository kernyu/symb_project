Isolated inflammatory disease of the sphenoid sinus is very uncommon in the pediatric population. A 10-year review of all patients at our institution 16 years of age or younger with inflammatory sphenoid sinus disease found 8 patients with isolated sphenoid sinusitis and 3 with sphenoid mucoceles. The most common symptoms were headache and visual disturbance. Five patients with uncomplicated sinusitis were successfully managed medically, while 3 with either complicated sinusitis or sinusitis not responding to antibiotics were treated by endoscopic sphenoidotomy. All patients with a mucocele were treated surgically. Isolated inflammatory sphenoid sinusitis should be considered in children age 7 years or older who present with headache that does not respond to simple analgesia. Delayed diagnosis and advanced disease may lead to life-threatening complications.
