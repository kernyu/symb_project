The results of 3-year (2002-2004) local microbiological monitoring of secondary infections due to opportunistic microflora that complicated the treatment of the main disease in patients of a regional (Moscow) tuberculosis hospital are presented. The monitoring revealed the leading microorganisms, the etiological agents of the secondary lower respiratory tract infection in the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The level of their resistance to the up-to-date antimicrobials was determined. Recommendations for optimization of antibacterial therapy of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by secondary lower respiratory tract infection due to opportunistic microorganisms were developed and validated.
