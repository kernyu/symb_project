Present study was carried out to find out the prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in school children of Pokhara city in western, Nepal. A total of 184 randomly selected children younger than 15 years were included in the study. Nasal swabs collected were subjected to standard bacteriological culture. S. aureus isolates were identified by mannitol fermentation, coagulase positivity and DNase positivity. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed on muller-hinton agar (MHA) by modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Out of total 184 nasal swabs, S. aureus was isolated in 31.0% (n=57). Among the isolates, 35.1% (n=20) were from male children whereas 64.9% (n=37) were from female. There was no significant sex difference in colonization of S. aureus. Out of 57 isolates, 56.1% (n=32) were MRSA. MRSA isolates indicated relatively high rate of resistance to antibiotic cloxacillin (68.7%) followed by ofloxacin (40.6%), tetracycline (15.6%), erythromycin (9.4%), ciprofloxacin (6.2%) and vancomycin (3.1%).This study showed a high prevalence of MRSA carriage in school children indicating the spread of MRSA in the community.
