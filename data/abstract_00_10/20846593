During phase 3 clinical studies of telavancin for treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, a total of 1530 aerobic Gram-positive isolates were identified at baseline. The majority of these strains were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1214; 62% methicillin-resistant). All isolates were inhibited by </= 1 mug/mL of telavancin.
