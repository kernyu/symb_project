BACKGROUND: Resistance to antiretroviral treatment is prevalent. There is limited knowledge of the determinants of disease evolution in subjects infected with multidrug-resistant HIV (MDR-HIV). METHODS: Infectivity, replication, chemokine receptor usage, and env, gag, protease and reverse transcriptase sequence analysis was performed for MDR-HIV isolates from 14 HIV-infected individuals and compared to wild-type HIV isolates from individuals naive to antiretroviral treatment. Expression of CD45RO/RA, Ki67 and interferon-gamma and CD4 proliferative response to various antigens was determined for individuals infected with MDR-HIV and compared to that in individuals with optimal suppression of viral replication. RESULTS: Infectivity and replication are diminished for various MDR-HIV isolates, usually in the context of an increase in CD4 and CD4+CD45RA+ T-cell counts. However, a number of MDR-HIV isolates are associated with high in vivo viraemia and pronounced immunosuppression, and display in vitro levels of infectivity and replication comparable to those of wild-type strains. No specific genetic sequence or chemokine receptor usage predicted the fitness of an MDR isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the biological diversity of resistant viruses and the range of host responses observed, our descriptive analysis indicates that viral factors play a role in determining the degree of immune damage observed in the context of MDR-HIV infection.
