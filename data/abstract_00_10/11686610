As described in the preceding article, utilizing a novel combinatorial disulfide exchange strategy, a library of psammaplin A (1) analogues was constructed and screened for antibacterial activity leading to the identification of a collection of diverse lead compounds. These combinatorial leads were subsequently refined, through parallel synthesis, to afford a series of highly potent antibacterial agents (e.g. 17, 57, 58, 69, and 70), some possessing greater than 50-fold higher activities than the natural product. Evaluation of the selectivity and serum binding properties of some of the most promising compounds and preliminary studies directed at deciphering the mechanism of action of this novel class of antibacterial agents are also included.
