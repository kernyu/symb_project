BACKGROUND: We present 2 case reports in the United States and investigations of diphtheria-like illness caused by toxigenic Corynebacterium ulcerans. A fatal case occurred in a 75-year-old male Washington resident who was treated with clindamycin but did not receive equine diphtheria antitoxin. A second, nonfatal case occurred in a 66-year-old female Tennessee resident who received erythromycin and diphtheria antitoxin. METHODS: Both case patients and close human and animal contacts were investigated by their respective state health departments. RESULTS: C. ulcerans isolated from the patient who died was resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. For both isolates, conventional polymerase chain reaction results were positive for A and B subunits of diphtheria toxin gene tox, and modified Elek tests confirmed toxin production. The source of infection remained undetermined for both cases. Neither patient was up-to-date with diphtheria toxoid vaccination. CONCLUSION: These case reports highlight the importance of early treatment with diphtheria antitoxin, the selection of effective antimicrobial agents, and prevention through up-to-date vaccination.
