The last decade has witnessed a shift in the epidemiology of acute otitis media (AOM) with an earlier onset of disease and a greater proportion of children with recurrent episodes before 1 year of age. In addition antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactams, macrolides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among otopathogens has increased significantly. Most recently universal administration of a seven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Earlier onset of disease and the decrease in antimicrobial susceptibility among pediatric respiratory bacterial pathogens is likely to increase the risk of failure among young children with AOM. A seven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has demonstrated efficacy for prevention of serotype-specific pneumococcal otitis; however, increase in disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes and Haemophilus influenzae has been reported. With these events as the background, I have reviewed the strategies most likely to be successful for the treatment of AOM in 2002.
