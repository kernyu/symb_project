Social work practitioners and researchers have greatly understudied the idea of how social support correlates with combination therapy medication compliance, in people living with HIV disease. Meanwhile, such data could help health social workers better assist HIV-infected people who want to cope well, live long, and avoid drug resistance. Therefore, this article presents findings from a three-stage empirical secondary data analysis that examined seven specific types of social support, psychological history and stage of illness variables, and sociodemographics and their connection to medication compliance ratings. A sub-sample of 179 HIV-infected clinical trial study participants enrolled in a federally funded combination therapy treatment study and a nested compliance study were analyzed. Analysis of 14 bivariate hypotheses and 20 predictor variables at the multivariate level revealed that having emotional support and being employed seemed to be predictive of being a "Good Complier." Also, having higher levels of HIV symptoms appeared to be associated with being a "Poor Complier."
