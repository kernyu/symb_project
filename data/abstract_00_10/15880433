BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for a wide range of infections. In immunocompromised patients with cancer, the emergence of multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa may have grave consequences. METHODS: Patients with cancer who were infected with multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa with polyclonal DNA restriction patterns were used as the case group. Two control groups were used: one group of cancer patients who were infected with multidrug-susceptible P. aeruginosa and another group of cancer patients who had the same underlying disease and the same intensive care unit exposure as patients in the case group but who were not infected or colonized by P. aeruginosa. RESULTS: Risk factors that were associated significantly with multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infection were the use of carbapenem for > or = 7 days, a history of P. aeruginosa infection during the preceding year, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenems may need to be used more judiciously as first-line empirical therapy for cancer patients with prior pseudomonal infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who require hospitalization, and alternative, antipseudomonal antibiotic regimens may need to be considered, especially in this patient population.
