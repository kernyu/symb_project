OBJECTIVE: To establish a new method for rapidly selecting anti-hepatitis B virus drugs in clinical therapy. METHODS: The full-length hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes from 8 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All patients were resistant to lamivudine therapy. Their HBV DNA fragments were inserted into Sap I site of pHY106 eukaryotic expression vector separately. The recombinant plasmids containing 1.1 copies of HBV genome were transfected into Huh7 cell line; the levels of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA in supernatants of Huh7 cells were measured by ELISA and real-time quantitative PCR, and intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were detected by Southern blot. Antiviral effects of lamivudine and adefovir were evaluated in this vitro system. RESULTS: The 8 recombinant plasmids containing a full-length genome of clinical HBV isolates could replicate and be expressed in Huh 7 cells. There were 6 isolates with polymerase YVDD mutations and 2 isolates with polymerase YIDD mutations. Adefovir, but not lamivudine, inhibited the HBV replication and gene expression in vitro. Furthermore, adefovir inhibited HBV replication in these CHB patients. CONCLUSION: The method described here enables a rapid selection of anti-HBV drugs in clinical therapy and is very useful in antiviral therapy for CHB patients.
