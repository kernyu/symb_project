Multidrug efflux pumps are major contributors to intrinsic antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. The basic structure of these pumps comprises an inner membrane transporter, a periplasmic membrane fusion protein and an outer membrane channel. However, the architecture and composition of multidrug efflux complexes vary significantly because of the topological and functional diversity of the inner membrane transporters. This article presents the current views on architecture and assembly of multicomponent drug efflux transporters from Gram-negative bacteria.
