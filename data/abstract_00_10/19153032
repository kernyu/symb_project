We studied the in vitro activity of tigecycline and 10 other commonly used antibiotics against 135 clinical isolates of non-diphtheria Corynebacterium spp. using the Etest system. Tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms (MIC(50) and MIC(90) values, respectively, in mg/L) were: Corynebacterium urealyticum, 0.094 and 0.125; Corynebacterium amycolatum, 0.125 and 2; Corynebacterium jeikeium, 0.094 and 0.75; Corynebacterium coyleae, 0.064 and 0.064; Corynebacterium striatum, 0.064 and 1; Corynebacterium aurimucosum, 0.094 and 0.125; and Corynebacterium afermentans, 0.064 and 0.094. The activities of all other antimicrobials were variable, with good activity of glycopeptides, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and daptomycin and with resistance to macrolides in a high number of isolates. Tigecycline is a good alternative for the therapy of infections caused by non-diphtheria corynebacteria.
