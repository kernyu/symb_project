A small heat-shock protein (p26) purified from stress-resistant embryos of the crustacean, Artemia franciscana, was introduced into cultured cells of green monkey kidney (Cos-1) using the BioPORTER delivery system. Cells containing p26 exhibited impressive resistance to hydrogen peroxide compared to controls. Introduction of the disaccharide trehalose did not provide protection against oxidative damage, but enhanced substantially the protective performance of p26 when both were present. These studies extend previous research on the protective role played by p26 in cells exposed to various forms of stress, presumably through its ability to function as a molecular chaperone.
