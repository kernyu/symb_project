From a prospective cohort study on tuberculosis/human immunodeficiency virus (TB/HIV) interaction in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, drug susceptibility results were available for 94 TB patients (46% HIV-infected). Resistance to one or more drug(s) was detected in 21 (22.3%) and multidrug resistance in five (5.3%) patients. Occurrence of resistance was not related to HIV status or outcome after 24 months of follow-up. However, among HIV-infected TB patients who died during follow-up, survival time in those with a resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain was significantly shorter compared to those with a sensitive strain (6 vs. 13 months). Early detection of drug resistance and timely treatment change can therefore have a positive impact on survival in HIV-infected TB patients.
