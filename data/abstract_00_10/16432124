A 61-year-old man with tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma (case 1) and a 28-year-old woman with benign tracheal stenosis (case 2) were treated with sleeve resection of the lower trachea through a median sternotomy and prophylactic omental wrapping. The resected tracheas were 4.5 cm (case 1) and 4.0 cm (case 2) in length. Both patients had an uneventful course after surgery despite postoperative irradiation in case 1 and preoperative infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in case 2.
