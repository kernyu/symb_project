OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of Hep-2 cell with multidrug resistance (MDR) induced by Taxol. STUDY DESIGN: Hep-2 cells were exposed in stepwise escalating concentration of Taxol to develop the resistant cell line-Hep-2T. Cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and rhodamine accumulation were studied through flow cytometry. The MDR1 and MRP1 genes were detected through real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and the corresponding proteins were detected through Western blotting. RESULTS: The drug resistance of Hep-2T cells to Taxol, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, 5-FU, and cisplatin all increased. The percentage of G0/G1 phase and the antiapoptosis ability increased significantly compared with Hep-2 cells. Both MDR1 and MRP1 also increased at gene and protein level, though MDR1 was more prominent. CONCLUSION: More emphasis should be laid on MDR1/Pgp, the non-Pgp substrate chemotherapeutic agents, and the changes of cell cycle distribution to prevent MDR induced by Taxol. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings may provide theoretical support for the reverse of MDR.
