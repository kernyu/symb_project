The 2008 International HIV Drug Resistance Workshop explored six topics on viral resistance: new antiretrovirals; clinical implications; epidemiology; new technologies and interpretations; HIV pathogenesis, fitness, and resistance; and mechanisms of resistance. The last of these topics provided a forum for new work on resistance of hepatitis B and C viruses, which were also explored in two poster sessions. Much work focused on resistance to the two most recent antiretroviral classes (integrase inhibitors and CCR5 antagonists), a new set of entry inhibitor candidates and one new class represented by the maturation inhibitor bevirimat. Other research explored two novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, etravirine and IDX899. Epidemiological work analysed rates of transmitted resistant virus, multiclass resistance in antiretroviral-experienced patients and a heightened resistance risk in injecting drug users regardless of adherence. New research on resistance technologies involved an enhanced assay for HIV-1 coreceptor determination and improved gene-based tools for predicting coreceptor use. In the pathogenesis arena, a small study of intensification shed light on the likely source of residual viraemia in patients on successful antiretroviral therapy. A large study in Mozambique correlated the timing of infant infection with selection, transmission and persistence of nevirapine resistance mutations. Mechanistic research explored resistance to the integrase inhibitor raltegravir, K65R-mediated resistance to tenofovir and the role of connection domain mutations in resistance to zidovudine.
