In the midst of an outbreak, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was grown from samples of multiple environmental sites in an intensive care unit. A commercial oxidizing disinfectant (potassium peroxomonosulphate 50%, sodium alkyl benzene sulphonate 15%, and sulphamic acid 5%) was introduced throughout the intensive care unit, and its use coincided with cessation of the outbreak.
