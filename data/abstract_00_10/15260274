SETTING: Health care facilities in Nairobi, Kenya. OBJECTIVE: To document the presence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains in patients from Nairobi between September 1999 and October 2001. DESIGN: Descriptive study. RESULTS: Of the 983 referred patients who submitted sputum for culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST), 59% were males. Two hundred and nine (21.3%) patients had a positive culture, of whom 15.2% had a request for DST against isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol. Of these, 65 (43.6%) had an isolate resistant to one or more drugs, while 17 (11.4%) had MDR-TB. Ten (59.0%) cases were referred from public health care facilities while seven (41%) were from the private sector. Sixteen isolates were resistant to all four drugs. All MDR-TB cases but one were from Nairobi. CONCLUSION: The emergence of MDR-TB in Nairobi is a cause for concern. An outbreak would be catastrophic, creating not only increased morbidity and mortality but also a tremendous strain on already limited health care resources. Lack of policies for the treatment and management of MDR-TB and the unavailability of appropriate diagnostic facilities may increase its spread. Efforts to prevent outbreaks of MDR-TB should be emphasised.
