Mycobacterium fortuitum is a member of the rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria. Although mortality is rare from M. fortuitum, morbidity depends on the localized site of infection. M. fortuitum is ubiquitous in the environment and has been reported to cause infections of prosthetic devices. There have been seven previously reported cases of prosthetic joint infections due to M. fortuitum. This article presents three additional cases of postoperative joint infections due to M. fortuitum. All three cases were confirmed to be genetically indistinguishable by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. Awareness of its importance is especially noteworthy in the realm of ongoing antibiotic resistance.
