Yeast tolerance to Cr (III) and Cr (VI) as well as chromium accumulation potential were shown to depend on treatment time, metal concentration, biomass density and the phase of growth. Kinetic studies as exemplified by Pichia guilliermondii ATCC 201911 revealed a biphasic mode of Cr (III) uptake: a rapid sorption phase was followed by a slow process of accumulation, in which the contribution of the cell-bound Cr fraction increased, while the total cellular Cr level remained constant. Cr (VI) uptake was characterized by a time-dependent increase of total Cr and by a constant fractional contribution of the cell-adsorbed chromium, which suggests that the amount of cell-accumulated Cr also tended to increase over time. The resistance to Cr and metal accumulation levels were substantially elevated for a given strain when cultures were treated at high initial biomass densities (1 mg dry weight/ml) of exponentially proliferating cells. Maximum accumulation capabilities ranged between 4.0 and 13 mg Cr (III)/g dry weight and 2-6.7 mg Cr (VI)/g dry weight. The total cell-accumulated Cr contained 29.3% and 52.3% of organically bound chromium for the treatment of P. guilliermondii with Cr (III) and Cr (VI), respectively. Selected yeast strains, under specified physiological conditions, can be applied for bioremediation of environmental Cr contamination, and might be useful too for attempts to obtain chromium-enriched biomass containing biostabilized and nontoxic Cr forms for nutritional applications.
