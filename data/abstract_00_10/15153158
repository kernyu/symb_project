In all, 90 nalidixic acid-resistant clinical strains of Salmonella Hadar and Salmonella Enteritidis isolated in Norway but of predominantly foreign origin were subjected to sequencing of the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes. All the isolates contained at least one mutation in gyrA codon 83 or codon 87. A highly significant correlation between mutations in gyrA codon 83 and strains originating from Southeast Asia was found in S. Hadar but not in S. Enteritidis. A novel gyrA codon 81 Gly to His mutation was discovered in one S. Enteritidis isolate. One amino-acid (aa) changing mutation was found outside the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of S. Hadar parC at codon 57, which has previously only been observed once in Salmonellae.
