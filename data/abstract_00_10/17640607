The rapidly changing epidemiology of antifolate-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Africa requires monitoring. The present study was designed to assess the degree of association between the clinical and parasitological response to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and allelic combinations of dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes. Of 357 children who completed the 14-day follow-up, an adequate clinical and parasitological response was observed in 316 patients (88.5%) and early and late failures occurred in 18 (5%) and 23 (6.4%, mostly due to recrudescence) patients, respectively. The majority of clinical isolates were characterized as "quadruple" (n=196, 55.2%; N51I-C59R-S108N in DHFR and A437G in DHPS) or "triple" mutants (n=97, 27.3%; N51I-C59R-S108N in DHFR and wild-type DHPS; S108N+N51I or C59R in DHFR and A437G in DHPS). Wild-type, single mutation, and double mutation were observed in 29, 20, and 13 parasites, respectively. The comparison of different sets of mutations and early or late failures did not reveal any molecular marker associated with treatment outcome when the follow-up period was limited to 14 days (P>0.05). In this study, the determination of dhfr-dhps genotypes was of limited value to predict the treatment outcome in individual patients, mostly due to few treatment failures and few wild-type haplotypes. Further monitoring will be required to define the relationship between clinical response to SP therapy and parasite genotypes in our epidemiological setting.
