BACKGROUND: Burkholderia cepacia has the potential to cause fatal infections in ICUs, and multidrug resistance makes them a serious threat in hospital settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of B. cepacia infections in our hospital. METHODOLOGY: The incidence, clinical characteristics, antimicrobial susceptibility, and outcomes of nosocomial B. cepacia infections during a five-year period were retrospectively analysed according to the infection control committee records. RESULTS: A total of 39 cases with nosocomial B. cepacia infection were included in the study. B. cepacia was identified from 0.7% of the nosocomial isolates. Its incidence was 0.26 per 1,000 admissions with 53.8% crude mortality rate. The most frequent nosocomial B. cepacia infection was pneumonia (58.9%), followed by bloodstream infections (25.6%), surgical site infections (7.6%), urinary tract infections, (5.1%), and skin-soft tissue infections (2.5%). Nosocomial B. cepacia infections were most commonly observed in intensive care units (61.5%). The most active antimicrobial agents were piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, and carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of nosocomial B. cepacia infections was rare in our hospital, and no outbreak was detected during the study period. However, infections caused by B. cepacia should be taken into consideration because of their high mortality due to multidrug resistance in ICU settings.
