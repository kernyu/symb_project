OBJECTIVE: Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who relapse more than 6 months following completion of platinum-based primary chemotherapy are considered platinum-sensitive, and can be effectively retreated with cisplatin or carboplatin. The nucleoside analogue gemcitabine has proven activity in both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant disease. We conducted a phase II study using the combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive and paclitaxel-pretreated EOC. METHODS: Forty-three patients were treated with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2), intravenously, over 30 min on days 1 and 8, and carboplatin at AUC 5 on day 1. Courses were administered every 3 weeks on an outpatient basis. RESULTS: Among 37 patients with measurable or evaluable disease, 15 (40.5%) achieved an objective response including 10 complete and 5 partial responses. The median overall survival was 24.5 months, and the median time to progression for all patients was 9 months. The treatment was well tolerated without toxic deaths; the most common toxicities were Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia that occurred in 69%, 26%, and 24% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine is a well-tolerated outpatient regimen with activity in patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive and paclitaxel-pretreated EOC. However, a randomized prospective study is justified to define whether the addition of gemcitabine to single-agent carboplatin results in improved efficacy in this subset of patients.
