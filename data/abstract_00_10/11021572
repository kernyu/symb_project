The effect of Saccharomyces boulardii on the immune system was evaluated, comparing germ-free Swiss/NIH mice monoassociated with the probiotic with germ-free mice. Saccharomyces boulardii colonized the gut of germ-free mice and survived the gastrointestinal conditions. An increase in sIgA production, both total and anti-S. boulardii, was observed in the intestinal contents of monoassociated mice when compared with germ-free controls. The number of Kupffer cells was significantly higher in monoassociated mice than in germ-free controls. In S. boulardii-monoassociated mice, clearance of Escherichia coli B41 was higher than in germ-free controls. TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-12 serum levels were higher at earlier time points in monoassociated mice when compared with germ-free mice. These results show that the yeast S. boulardii modulates the host immune responses. This effect may be of interest for improving the resistance to enteropathogenic bacterial infections.
