A fatal case of meningoencephalitis caused by Bacillus cereus, an uncommon but potential pathogen, resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, is described in a 28-day old premature neonate. Difficulties for clinical diagnosis and treatment are discussed. A review of the literature (26 published cases) is given. Early diagnosis of neonatal B. cereus infection is crucial as it leads to a standard treatment including vancomycin.
