Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) isolates were identified as a cause of traveller's diarrhoea in 50 (9%) of 517 patients and their antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. Molecular epidemiological characterisation and investigation of the mechanisms of acquisition of quinolone resistance among nalidixic acid-resistant EAggEC strains was performed. Seventeen (34%) of 50 patients needed antimicrobial therapy, because of persistence of symptoms in nine cases and the severity of symptoms in eight cases. Ampicillin and tetracycline resistance was high, whereas chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole showed moderate activity and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin showed very good activity. Resistance to nalidixic acid was demonstrated in three isolates, two from patients who had travelled to India. In all three strains the resistance was linked to mutations in the gyrA gene alone or in both gyrA and parC genes. Although ciprofloxacin shows excellent in-vitro activity and could be useful in the treatment of traveller's diarrhoea in patients travelling abroad, it may not be useful in patients who have journeyed to India or to Mexico.
