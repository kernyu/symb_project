An application of evolved gas analysis-mass spectrometry (EGA-MS) with skimmer interface was carried out to investigate the pyrolysis mechanism of an antibacterial and antifungal material that is expected with thermostability. The skimmer interface between a furnace and a vacuum chamber with a mass spectrometer transmitted the gaseous species, which were trapped by a general capillary interface. As a result, it became clear that the thermostability of antimicrobial activity was limited by the heat resistance of the coordinate bond between nitrogen and silver in the silver chelate.
