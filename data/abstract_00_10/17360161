Twenty-six high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) Enterococcus faecium strains colonising neutropenic bone marrow transplant patients were studied. Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that high-level gentamicin resistance was mediated by the aac(6')-Ia-aph(2'')-Ie gene; the aph(2'')-Id gene responsible for gentamicin resistance was also detected in 16 strains. Multiple antibiotic resistance was related to the presence of aph(3')-IIIa, ant(6)-Ia, erm(B), erm (A) and tet(M) genes. Strains clustered into 18 groups according to their plasmid content as well as 16 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. Although the majority of PFGE patterns were single isolates, three microclones were identified. Hybridisation showed that in the majority of the strains the aac(6')-aph(2'') gene resided on a large plasmid of ca. 96kb detected only on PFGE gels. Based on these findings, colonisation by HLGR E. faecium strains was a result of either possibly related plasmid spread or strain dissemination.
