As resistance increases against fungal antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides are receiving attention as possible replacements. The dermal glands of frogs secrete, among other things, antimicrobial peptides. As part of the innate immune system, stressors may affect the production of antimicrobial peptides by dermal glands. The dermal secretions of some salamanders have been examined for their toxic secretions, but little attention has been given to salamander antimicrobial peptides. This study examines the skin from the tail region for the production of antimicrobial peptides in the terrestrial salamander, Plethodon cinereus. Fractions of tail extracts were isolated using cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. An HPLC fraction eluting at 15.75 min (HPLC run: 30 min, 30-80% acetonitrile/water gradient, Aquapore RP-300 C18 column) showed activity against Staphylococcus aureus but not against Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity gradually increased over a 4-hr incubation time up to about 85% inhibition of bacterial growth. Lysis of guinea pig red blood cells also increased gradually over a 1-hr time period. J. Exp. Zool. 287:340-345, 2000.
