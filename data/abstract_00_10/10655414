Recent cases of infections caused by glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) have highlighted the emergence of these organisms in the Republic of South Africa. During May 1998 we conducted a prevalence study in four hospitals in Johannesburg and obtained 184 rectal swabs from patients identified as being at high risk for GRE colonization. Twenty enterococcal isolates showing various glycopeptide resistance genotypes were recovered: 3 Enterococcus faecium vanA isolates, 10 E. faecium vanB isolates, 6 E. gallinarum vanC1 isolates, and 1 E. avium vanA isolate. Macrorestriction analysis was used to demonstrate the clonal spread of GRE strains within hospitals. Evidence also demonstrated the likely persistence of the original E. faecium vanA isolate associated with the first confirmed death contributed to by GRE infection in South Africa in March 1997.
