It is as for now evident that in-depth researches of the genotype of a patient are needed to enhance the efficiency of therapeutic measures. The purpose of the present study was to enhance the efficiency of complex antituberculous therapy, by genetically identifying the allelic polymorphism of the HLA-DRB1* gene in a person who had ill with tuberculosis. The material of the study was the results of a followup and treatment of 100 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The subject of a special study was the molecular typing of the HLA genes of the DRB1* locus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP). The findings suggest that an individual approach to choosing treatment regimens (chemotherapy and pathogenetic therapy) for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, by taking into account the HLA-DRB1* genotype enables one to enhance the efficiency of treatment in the major clinical and X-ray parameters.
