Susceptibility to 14 antibiotics was determined for 125 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae collected over a 3-year period in Crete, Greece. Twenty-three isolates (18.4%) showed intermediate resistance and 15 (12%) high-level resistance to penicillin. Erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and sparfloxacin resistance rates were 16.8, 10.4, 19.2, 24.8 and 9.6%, respectively. Multiple resistance was observed in 22 strains. Vancomycin and levofloxacin were the most active agents tested. The most prevalent serotype among penicillin-susceptible pneumococci was 14, followed by 9, 7 and 1, while among penicillin-intermediate or -resistant strains serotype 23 was predominant followed by 19 and 9. These results show that as well as a high level of penicillin resistance in this region, some strains are also resistant to other antibiotics and may show multi-drug resistance.
