BACKGROUND: Nebulized amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBd) has been used to prevent invasive pulmonary aspergillosis after lung transplantation. METHODS: In this retrospective study we compared the safety and tolerability of nebulized AmBd and nebulized liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) in 38 consecutive lung transplant recipients. Progress notes, medication administration records, microbiology, and pulmonary function reports were reviewed. Histologic sections from lung tissue were examined. Plasma amphotericin B levels were measured. RESULTS: A total of 1206 doses of AmBd and 1149 doses of L-AmB were administered. Eighteen patients received AmBd only, 11 received L-AmB only, and 9 received the medications sequentially. The total number of complaints vs. the number of doses administered was 1.0% for AmBd-treated patients and 1.2% for L-AmB-treated patients. No differences were observed between the treatment groups on lung biopsy specimens. Plasma amphotericin B levels were <0.2-0.9 microg/mL in AmBd-treated patients and <0.2 microg/mL in L-AmB-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: In lung transplant recipients, both inhaled AmBd and L-AmB were safe and well tolerated over a large number of medication exposures.
