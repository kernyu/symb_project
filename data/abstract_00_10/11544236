This study describes the characterization of the recently described Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) (D. A. Boyd, G. A. Peters, L.-K. Ng, and M. R. Mulvey, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 189:285-291, 2000), which harbors the genes associated with the ACSSuT phenotype in a Canadian isolate of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104. A 43-kb region has been completely sequenced and found to contain 44 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) which comprised approximately 87% of the total sequence. Fifteen ORFs did not show any significant homology to known gene sequences. A number of ORFs show significant homology to plasmid-related genes, suggesting, at least in part, a plasmid origin for the SGI1, although some with homology to phage-related genes were identified. The SGI1 was identified in a number of multidrug-resistant DT120 and S. enterica serovar Agona strains with similar antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. The G+C content suggests a potential mosaic structure for the SGI1. Emergence of the SGI1 in serovar Agona strains is discussed.
