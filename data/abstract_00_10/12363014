Azole resistance in Candida albicans may be due to several mechanisms. It has been demonstrated that C. albicans possesses sequences with a high degree of homology with the human MDR-1 gene coding for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), belonging to the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) superfamily and responsible for the multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumor cells. On this basis, the expression and intracellular localization of human P-gp-like molecule in C. albicans strains showing different sensitivity to fluconazole were investigated by flow cytometry and immunoelectron microscopy. Post-embedding immunolabeling revealed that monoclonal antibody (mAb) MM4.17, which recognizes an external epitope of human P-gp, reacted with both fluconazole-sensitive (3153 and CO 23-1) and fluconazole-resistant (AIDS 68 and CO 23-2, isolated from AIDS patient and in vitro drug-selected, respectively) strains of C. albicans. However, the resistant strains displayed a number of MM4.17-reactive epitopes much higher than the drug-sensitive ones. The C. krusei ATCC 6458 strain, whose resistance is not mediated by the presence of ABC transporters, was not reactive at all with mAb MM4.17. The specificity of the immunolabeling was confirmed by a competitive inhibition assay performed by using phage clone particles capable of mimicking the MM4.17-reactive epitope. The flow cytometric analysis confirmed a higher level of intracytoplasmic P-gp expression in azole-resistant strains of C. albicans. Both cyclosporin A and verapamil, which are well-known MDR inhibitors, strongly reduced the MICs for fluconazole and itraconazole of the tested azole-resistant AIDS 68 strain, while they did not influence the MICs of either the sensitive 3153 strain of C. albicans or the ATCC 6458 strain of C. krusei. Overall, our data suggest the existence of a P-gp-like drug efflux pump in C. albicans that may participate in the mechanisms of azole-resistance of this fungus.
