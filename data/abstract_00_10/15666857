To determine if free-living waterfowl residing in a zoological setting pose health risks for its animal collections, visitors, and employees, 450 fecal samples were collected and cultured for the presence of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Pasteurella multocida. A survey of endoparasites infecting the waterfowl was also conducted. Sixty-seven percent, 42%, and 1.7% of the samples tested positive for E. coli, C. jejuni, and Salmonella spp., respectively. No P. multocida was isolated from the sampled population. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for the bacterial isolates demonstrated that a majority of the isolates were susceptible to the antibiotics tested. A survey for parasites revealed 16% of the samples had coccidia oocytes; 8% of the sample had spirurid ova; and 17% of the sample had strongylate-type nematode ova. Ascaris spp. ova, Capillaria spp. ova, oxyurid ova, and mites were also noted in some fecal samples.
