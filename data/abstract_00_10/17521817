Aeromonas infection in burn patients is extremely uncommon. Here we report on four cases of Aeromonas infection in burn patients admitted to the BICU at the Singapore General Hospital burn unit between June 2001 and May 2006. Two patients had positive blood cultures, and the other two had tissue samples with growth. There was no history of exposure to soil or fresh water in all patients. The average age of patients was 35 years (range 24-41) and the average % TBSA was 48% (range 35-80). Cultures were isolated between days 2 and 4 post burn. There was one mortality in the series. Increasing antibiotic resistance was noted among isolates of Aeromonas. Continued vigilance is essential to detect infection early, even in the absence of a suggestive history, with adequate debridement and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
