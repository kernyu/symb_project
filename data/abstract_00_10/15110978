Many variables affect the outcome of keratomycosis and systemic fungal infections in animals. These include pathogenicity of the fungal organism(toxins, trophisms, and evasion of host response); previous treatment with topical or systemic corticosteroids, which can have a dramatic negative impact on host defense mechanisms: concurrent systemic illness or immunocompromise: severity/extent of infection; and degree of pain (ie,increased reflex tearing dilutes topical medication) [14]. Experimental work suggests that antibiotics may occasionally exacerbate fungal infections [142],and some researchers advocate that concurrent antibiotic therapy is contraindicated in horses with yeast infections and septate fungal infections unless bacterial infection is also suspected [14]. Nevertheless, given that normal conjunctival flora often include bacteria and fungi and because care of keratomycoses often includes mixed bacterial and fungal infections, the possible dynamics (natural influences and local competition) between ocular surface microorganisms merit further investigation. There are many unanswered questions regarding the accuracy of in vitro susceptibilities and corneal concentration capabilities for antifungal topical medications [14]. Inherent host resistance or other immune interactions between the patient and fungus are perhaps the most important determinants of the outcome but are currently difficult to measure or assess except by subjective clinical observation [14].
