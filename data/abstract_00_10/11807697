Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), a major form of tea catechins, has a variety of biological activities. Tobacco smoking, nicotine in particular, is one of the risk factors for respiratory infections. In the present study, a possible immunotherapeutic effect of EGCg on the nicotine-induced impairment of alveolar macrophages regarding antimicrobial activity, as well as immune function, was examined. The treatment of MH-S macrophages with nicotine significantly enhanced Legionella pneumophila replication in the cells and selectively down-regulated the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha induced by infection but did not alter IL-10 production. The EGCg treatment of nicotine-suppressed macrophages reconstituted the resistance to the infection. Furthermore, EGCg diminished the nicotine-induced inhibition of cytokine production. Experiments with TNF-alpha treatment, neutralization of cytokines with antibodies, and analysis of interferon (IFN)-gamma messenger RNA showed that the mechanism of the EGCg-induced recovery of anti-L. pneumophila activity impaired by nicotine may be due to the recovery of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma production by the macrophages.
