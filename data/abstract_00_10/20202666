The aim of this study was elucidation of the difference in inhibition influence of 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (juglone) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (lawsone) on jack bean urease activity. It was found that juglone acted as a strong, time and concentration dependent inactivator of urease. On the contrary, lawsone showed an inconsiderable inhibition influence. The reactivation of juglone modified urease showed the participation of reversible and irreversible contribution in the inactivation. In the presence of an excess of DTT, urease inactivated by juglone regained 70% of its activity. The reversible inactivation was attributed to oxidation of the essential urease thiols by reactive oxygen species (ROS) realizing during reduction of juglone to seminaphthoquinone. Presence of hydrogen peroxide in the incubation system was proved by direct determination and by application of catalase. The irreversible contribution in the inhibition was assumed as an arylation of urease thiol groups by juglone. The insignificant urease inhibition by lawsone was concluded as an effect of a low hydrogen peroxide generation and lawsone resistance for reaction with protein thiols. It was found that lawsone well reacted with l-cysteine, poorly with glutathione and hardly with urease thiols. The observed sequence was arranged according the rule the more complex thiol the less susceptible for reaction with lawsone. On the other hand, juglone displayed an excellent reactivity towards both thiols and urease. Thus, this indicated a significance of a steric hindrance which appeared when the hydroxyl group changing position from 5 in juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) to 2 in lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone).
