The biofilm-forming capability of Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium and Heidelberg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from humans, animal farms, and retail meat products was evaluated by using a microplate assay. The tested bacterial species showed interstrain variation in their capabilities to form biofilms. Strong biofilm-forming strains of S. enterica serotypes, E. coli O157: H7, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii were resistant to at least four of the tested antibiotics. To understand their potential in forming biofilms in food-processing environments, the strong biofilm formers grown in beef, turkey, and lettuce broths were further investigated on stainless steel and glass surfaces. Among the tested strains, Salmonella Typhimurium phage type DT104 (Salmonella Typhimurium DT104) isolated from retail beef formed the strongest biofilm on stainless steel and glass in beef and turkey broths. K. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, and P. aeruginosa were also able to form strong biofilms on the tested surface materials. Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 developed a biofilm on stainless steel in beef and turkey broths through (i) initial attachment to the surface, (ii) formation of microcolonies, and (iii) biofilm maturation. These findings indicated that Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 alongwith other bacterial pathogens could be a source of cross-contamination during handling and processing of food.
