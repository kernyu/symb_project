Reutericyclin is an inhibitory compound produced by sourdough isolates of Lactobacillus reuteri that is structurally but not functionally related to naturally occurring tetramic acids. It is bacteriostatic or bactericidal to gram-positive bacteria based on its activity as a proton-ionophore, and a broad range of food-related spoilage organisms and pathogens is inhibited by reutericyclin. Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to reutericyclin because of the barrier properties of their outer membrane, and resistance of beer-spoiling lactobacilli towards hop bitter acids provides cross-protection to reutericyclin. Remarkably, reutericyclin-producing strains were shown to persist for a period of 10 years in an industrial sourdough fermentation, and reutericyclin was shown to be produced in concentrations active against competitors during growth of L. reuteri in sourdough. Based on the known properties of reutericyclin and L. reuteri, reutericyclin-producing strains may have applications in the biopreservation of foods. Furthermore, these strains were shown to colonize reconstituted lactobacilli-free mice at high levels. Therefore, they could serve as a suitable model system to evaluate a possible impact of antimicrobial compounds on the intestinal microflora of humans and animals.
