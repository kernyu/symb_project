OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug resistance of acinetobacter isolated from burn wounds. METHODS: The acinetobacter strains were isolated and identified by routine methods. Based on the recommendation of NCCLS, AmpC enzyme was determined by cefoxiti three-dimensional test, ESBLs by disk diffusion method and bacterial susceptibility by Kirby-Bauer agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Among the 69 strains of acinetobacter clinically isolated from burn wounds, 52 were baumannii (75.6%). The acinetobacter strains were identified to be highly resistant to 17 kinds of antibiotics. The drug resistance rate of beta-lactamase-producing strains (68.25%) was higher than that of non-beta-lactamase-producing strains (20.33%). The strains isolated in our burn ward exhibited multiple drug resistance which was mainly due to the production of many kinds of beta-lactamases. Among the 38 strains of beta-lactamase-producing acinetobacter, those producing AmpC beta-lactamase (AmpC BLA) accounted for 42.1%. CONCLUSION: Acinetobacter strain was one of the pathogens in burn wound infection, and its isolation and identification of its drug resistance could be beneficial to the doctors to make right choice of antibiotics.
