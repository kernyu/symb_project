Spontaneous and in vitro induced (with 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml dioxidine and 0.1 and 1.0 U/ml bleomycin) chromosome aberrations were counted in cultured peripheral blood cells from 11 donors before and after 2-week therapy with a vitamin complex. The complex contained the major vitamins in doses not surpassing the recommended daily doses. Vitamins had no effect on spontaneous mutations, but increased cell resistance to clastogenic effects of dioxidine in a concentration of 0.1, but not 0.01 mg/ml. Cell sensitivity to bleomycin notably increased after vitamin therapy in some donors and decreased in others, the mean parameters in the group remained virtually unchanged.
