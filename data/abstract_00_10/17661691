Widespread parasitic resistance has led to an urgent need for the development and implementation of new drugs for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives are becoming increasingly important, used preferably in combination with a second antimalarial agent to increase the efficacy and slow the development of resistance. However, cost, production and pharmacological issues associated with artemisinin derivatives and potential partner drugs are hindering the implementation of combination therapies. This article reviews the molecular basis of the action of, and resistance to, different antimalarials and examines the prospects for the next generation of drugs to combat this potentially lethal human pathogen.
