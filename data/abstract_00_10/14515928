A 56-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and cadaveric renal transplantation had vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium tricuspid valve endocarditis. Relapse followed 6 weeks of treatment with intravenous gentamicin and high-dose ampicillin. On the basis of previous data suggesting the potential for synergistic activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin plus high-dose ampicillin, therapy with this combination was administered for 63 days. Cure was achieved and later confirmed at 2-year follow-up.
