We examined 28 children with HIV-1 infection who were not responding to existing antiviral regimens and were enrolled into clinical trials conducted at the National Cancer Institute to receive salvage therapy. In 3 of the 28 patients (10.7%), the Q151M complex amino acid substitutions were identified. The three patients had received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) monotherapy and/or combination regimens with multiple NRTIs for 4.3-8.6 years prior to the study. Recombinant infectious clones generated by incorporating the RT-encoding region of HIV-1 isolated from patients' plasma samples were highly resistant to zidovudine, didanosine and stavudine, while they were moderately resistant to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TDF-containing regimens reduced HIV-1 viremia in two of the three children carrying the Q151M complex. These data suggest that the Q151M could be prevalent in pediatric patients with long-term NRTI monotherapy and/or dual NRTI regimens and that HAART regimens containing TDF may be meritorious in such patients.
