AIMS: To study the importance of bacteriocin production for the antilisterial effect of a bacteriocinogenic Carnobacterium piscicola strain A9b on growth of Listeria monocytogenes in broth and cold-smoked salmon systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: Acriflavin treatment of strain A9b resulted in loss of bacteriocin production and of immunity to carnobacteriocin B2. Two plasmids present in the wild-type were lost in the variant that was also more sensitive to bavaricin and leucocin A than the wild-type indicating cross-resistance to class IIa bacteriocins. The growth rate of the bac- mutant was higher than that of the wild-type at 5 and 37 degrees C but not at 25 or 30 degrees C. In salmon juice the maximum cell density of L. monocytogenes was suppressed 3 and 6 log by co-culture with C. piscicola A9b bac- and bac+, respectively, as compared with the control. Sterile filtered cultures of C. piscicola A9b bac- caused a limited suppression of the maximum cell density of L. monocytogenes similar to that observed when sterile buffer was added in equal amounts. Semi-purified carnobacteriocin B2 caused a 3.5 log decline in viable cell count after 6 day of incubation in cold-smoked salmon juice at 5 degrees C. High resistance level to carnobacteriocin B2 was observed for L. monocytogenes cells exposed to semi-purified and in situ produced carnobacteriocin B2. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of bacteriocin production in C. piscicola enhances its inhibition of L. monocytogenes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Due to the emergence of resistance, a bacteriocin negative lactic acid bacteria may be more suited for practical use as a bioprotective agent against L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods.
