We have studied the in vitro antifungal activity of sertaconazole against 114 dermatophytes with low susceptibility to fluconazole following the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards for filamentous fungi (M38-P). However, several important factors such as the temperature (28 vs. 35 degrees C) and time of incubation (4-10 days vs. 21-74 h), have been found to affect dermatophytes. Isolates were recently recovered from human samples. Sertaconazole was active against 114 isolates of 12 fungal dermatophyte species, showing an overall geometric mean of 0.41 microg/ml with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.01-2 microg/ml against these isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility. Differences between both antifungals were significant (p < 0.05). MIC(50) and MIC(90) of sertaconazole were of 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, while the MIC of fluconazole was >/=16 microg/ml. None of the isolates was resistant to sertaconazole during the study while for four isolates the MIC of fluconazole was >/=64 microg/ml. No evidence of cross-resistance between both antifungals was found.
