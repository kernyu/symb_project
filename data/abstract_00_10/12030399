We report a case of severe tracheobronchitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a man exhibiting symptoms of upper airway obstruction after infection with influenza. Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse pseudomembrane formation throughout the trachea and bilateral bronchi, which were nearly obstructed. In this case, it was helpful to perform bronchoscopy, protected brushing and tracheotomy immediately in order to avoid choking.
