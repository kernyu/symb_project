OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficiency and safety of itraconazole oral solution with those of fluconazole to prevent invasive fungal infections (IFI) in postoperative patients receiving orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, open trial, 60 patients receiving OLT were randomized into itraconazole treatment group (n = 30) and fluconazole treatment group (n = 30). The patients in itraconazole treatment group were given itraconazole oral solution in a dose of 20 ml once a day for 15 days and the patients in the fluconazole treatment group were given fluconazole in a dose of 150 mg once a day also for 15 days. The incidences of fungal infections after liver transplantation and the resistance to drugs were recorded. RESULTS: There were three patients in the itraconazole treatment group getting IFI; the infection rate was 10.0%. One patient had confirmed diagnosis and two other patients were diagnosed clinically. In the fluconazole treatment group there were 10 patients getting IFI, the infection rate was 33.3%. Two patients had confirmed diagnosis, six patients were diagnosed clinically and the remaining two were diagnosed tentatively. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with fluconazole, itraconazole oral solution is more effective in the treatment of invasive fungal infections in postoperative patients receiving OLT.
