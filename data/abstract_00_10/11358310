The aim of this study was to examine the catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) in the presence of iron oxides. Granular ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite were selected as catalysts in this study. 2-CP was used as the model compound because it is a typical toxic compound and has not been investigated in the catalytic decomposition by iron oxides. The catalytic activity for hydrogen peroxide decomposition followed the sequence: granular ferrihydrite > goethite > hematite. However, hematite exhibited the highest activity in catalyzing 2-CP oxidation. The oxidation efficiency of 2-CP corresponded with the inverse sequence of specific area and pHpzc of the iron oxides. The catalytic activity of granular ferrihydrite was affected significantly by the mixing speed and particle size for its large value of Thiele modulus (phi) and Damkohler number (Da). The strong diffusion resistance for granular ferrihydrite was attributed either to its microporous structure or to the formation of oxygen in the pores of the iron oxide leading to the unexpected catalytic activity of granular ferrihydrite to hydrogen peroxide and 2-CP.
