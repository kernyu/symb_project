This editorial commentary discusses the strategies for prevention of catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) in children on hemodialysis, which is associated with high morbidity and the increase of hospital cost. There is evidence that the use of arteriovenous fistulae in children on hemodialysis is associated with lower infection rates. Therefore, the use of catheters in these patients should be decreased by improving arteriovenous fistulae use rates or by increasing peritoneal dialysis patient recruitment. However, despite the wide adoption of such policies, hemodialysis catheters are still being used in a significant number of cases. For these patients, implementation of effective strategies for preventing contamination of the catheter hub should be a priority. The appropriate recording and evaluation of CRB rates are important for assessing preventive policies. In addition, the successful management of a CRB is essential for preventing recurrence of bacteremia. Recently it was documented in a number of randomized clinical trials that antimicrobial lock solutions were effective for preventing CRB. It is suggested that the use of antimicrobial locks should be considered in children who are at high risk of developing CRB, with caution for their long-term use, because of the possibility of bacterial resistance. Now is the time for action, and all preventive steps should be performed simultaneously to minimize the risk of CRB.
