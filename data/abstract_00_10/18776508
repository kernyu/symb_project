Nucleosides are ubiquitous in biological systems and as such, have been a focus of medicinal chemistry research in the search for new and potent therapeutic compounds. There are a number of modified nucleosides on the market, however increasing reports of resistance by mutation of either the enzyme binding site or the pathway that they are designed to interrupt are surfacing. As shown in recent reports, a candidate that can change conformation and still maintain recognition by the target enzyme would be highly desirable, and it is for this reason that flexible substrates have recently been sought as potential therapeutics. With this goal in mind, we have begun investigation into novel flexible scaffolds capable of overcoming viral resistance mechanisms resulting from binding site mutations.
