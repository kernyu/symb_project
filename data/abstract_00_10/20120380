The highest malaria morbidity rates have been observed in the Tajikistan's Khatlon Region that is contiguous with Afghanistan. This area is notorious for its high malariogenicity ("susceptibility" according to the WHO terminology), caused by natural climatic factors, as well as a significant vulnerability associated with socioeconomic conditions (intensive migration of populations among which there are many infected subjects). In children, tropical malaria is generally characterized by an acute onset, abnormal fever, and its polymorphism of clinical manifestations that are exemplified by the lack of typical malaria paroxysms, as well as a gradual progression of parasitemia during the first malaria attacks. Recurrences are induced by ineffective treatment and chloroquine resistance in the tropical malaria pathogen. The reduction in malaria morbidity has resulted from a package of large-scale malaria-controlling measures implemented with the support of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.
