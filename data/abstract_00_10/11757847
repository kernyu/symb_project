With the continuing increase in clinically important fungal disease, especially seen in the neutropenic patient, the need for new and improved systemic antifungal agents marches on. A pharmacy and therapeutics committee may select an antifungal agent based on these criteria: spectrum of action, pharmacokinetic profile, toxicity, potential for resistance, and cost. A number of agents are now available for treating deep fungal infections, including amphotericin B in conventional and liposomalformulations, and the triazoles itraconazole (Sporanox) and fluconazole (Diflucan). It is important to note that there is lack of agreement in practice over what constitutes ideal therapy. The lipidformulations of amphotericin B and the improved oral solution and new intravenous formulation of itraconazole are recent additions to therapeutic options that are already having a significant influence on drug selection and treatment practices.
