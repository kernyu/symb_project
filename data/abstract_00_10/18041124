Microbiological monitoring of microbial landscape of gram-negative bacteria--etiological agents of nosocomial surgical infections--was performed as well as their level of antibiotic resistance was studied. Two hundred forty-four strains were isolated. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by the method of serial microdilutions. Spectrum of Gram-negative microorganisms was represented by 3 groups: fermenting (62.7%), nonfermenting (34.8%), and nonidentified microbes (2.5%). Spectrum of gram-negative etiological agents of nosocomial surgical infections was represented mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella. Most active antibacterial drugs against studied strains were carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem).
