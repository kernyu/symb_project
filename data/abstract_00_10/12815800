Oral cavity is the site of numerous HIV infection manifestations. Oral mucosa candidiasis is the most common one. It may be the earliest sign of the underlying disease. Long lasting observations give evidence that antiretroviral therapy is beneficial also in the cases of this opportunistic infection because it reduces both the number and severity of relapses, however, the prolongation of the patients' survival time creates the need of antifungal therapy prolongation, and thorough observation of its effectiveness and methods. We decided to analyze the influence of antiretroviral therapy with at least three drugs on the development of oral mucosa candidiasis in the out- and inpatients of the Jagiellonian University Medical College Clinic of Infectious Diseases (or Outpatient Clinic) in Cracow. The study was carried out in 75 patients with confirmed HIV infection. We have shown a decrease in the number of fungi present in the oral cavity in patients under antiretroviral treatment as well as higher susceptibility to fluconazole.
