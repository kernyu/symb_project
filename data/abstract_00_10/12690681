Beta-lactamase production was investigated in 1033 bacterial pathogens--262 gram-positive bacteria, 482 Enterobacteriaceae, 289 non-fermenting bacilli. These were isolated from nosocomial infections in paediatric patients. Beta-lactamase was detected using chromogenic cephalosporin and starch paper methods. More than 80% of the isolates produced the enzyme, which was not detected in enterococci and streptococci. There was no appreciable difference ([symbol: see text] 2 = 5.31, P > 0.05) in the number of Beta-lactamase producers obtained using the two methods. Great caution must be exercised in the therapeutic use of Beta-lactam drugs for nosocomial bacterial infections.
