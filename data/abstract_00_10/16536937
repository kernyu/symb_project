OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis at the National Chest Hospital in Jamaica. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the hospital records of 537 patients admitted over a seven-year period from 1995 to 2001. We used a standardized data collection form to obtain data for sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, signs and symptoms, laboratory diagnosis, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: We found that 11.6% (47/406) of the patients who met the inclusion criteria and were diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis were HIV-1 seropositive. Most HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis were males, and prevalence of HIV coinfection among patients with tuberculosis was highest in patients aged 30-39 years. The mortality rate in patients with tuberculosis and HIV infection was 23.4% (11/47) compared to 3.9% (14/359; P = 0.001) in HIV-negative patients. Patients were treated with standard quadruple drug therapy. No multiple drug resistance was noted in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HIV in patients with tuberculosis in Jamaica is similar to that in other developing countries, but the mortality rate is higher and this warrants prompt diagnosis of HIV infection and early institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy.
