This study describes the genetic relationships and antimicrobial resistance determinants found among 99 clinical isolates of enterococci from 15 different hospitals in Cuba. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis SmaI analysis demonstrated a high degree of genetic diversity. A limited number of multiresistant Enterococcus faecalis clones, showing resistance to three or more families of antimicrobial agents, were detected simultaneously in different institutions, suggesting inter-hospital circulation of selected clones, and/or selection of particular clones following their introduction into the hospital environment. Antimicrobial resistance determinants, including erm(B), aac(6')-aph(2'), aph(3'), ant(6), vanB (E. faecalis) and vanA (Enterococcus faecium) were detected by PCR in various isolates.
