Resistance to linezolid among Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis isolates has been reported in patients who receive a prolonged course of the drug. We report two cases of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis that occurred in patients who previously received linezolid for infections with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Both isolates had the G2576U mutation in the 23S rRNA previously reported in isolates of Enterococcus faecium. The number of gene copies mutated in the 23S rRNA correlated with the level of resistance.
