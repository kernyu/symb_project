The crystal structure of the antibiotic drug candidate RWJ-416457 (systematic name: N-{(5S)-3-[4-(5,6-dihydro-2H,4H-2-methylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazol-5-yl)-3-fluoropheny l]-2-oxo-1,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}acetamide), C(18)H(20)FN(5)O(3), which belongs to the first new class of antibiotics discovered in the past 30 years, has been determined at 150 K. Each molecule of this drug donates one hydrogen bond to a neighboring molecule and accepts one hydrogen bond to give (O=C-R-N-H...O=C-R-N-H...)(n) linkages along the b-axis direction. The compound contains a pyrrolopyrazole ring, which, owing to its uncommon structure, has been shown to have particular effectiveness against multi-drug-resistant bacteria.
