The outcomes of surgical treatment of 546 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were analyzed in relation to the bacteriological characteristics. Seeding detected sputum bacterial isolation in 52.4% of cases. Mycobacterial drug resistance was detected in 83.6% of the tested cultures. It has been concluded that the resistance is a first-order infectious agent whose action is shown in lowering the efficiency of preoperative courses of chemotherapy by 2.5 times, in increasing the incidence and severity of postoperative pleural and pulmonary complications by 6-7 times, in deteriorating the immediate outcomes of surgical treatment to 82.4% with a 7.4% mortality rate. Intensive bacterial isolation unarrested by surgery is a second-order infectious agent which more clearly shows a relationship of the efficiency of surgical treatment to a reduction in the cure rate to 74.2% with a total mortality of 15.2%. There is evidence for that it is advisable to apply an active surgical policy in a group of patients having an infectious risk factor.
