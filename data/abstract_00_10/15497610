Polymethacrylate methylene (PMMA) used as the carrier for antibiotic gentamycin (Septopal) shows today very limited effectiveness. Only 24% of the staphylococcus strains is still susceptible for it. In 1982 this factor was as high as 97%! Because of the growing resistance of different strains of staphylococcus, enterococcus and G(-) bacillus for antibiotics in present use, came into being the necessity for evaluation of the state-of-the-art antibiotic carrier of the new generation, which should be effective to destroy the resistant strains of bacteria. The porous corundum ceramics proved to be good material for this purpose, specially in use for bone surgery. During the laboratory tests it was confirmed that corundum ceramics could be soaked with the different antibiotics of the new generations. The bacteriological tests proved that corundum ceramics soaked with the Vancomycin show the highest possibly antibacterial activity. On the basis of those results we undertook the implantation test on animals. The implantation was carried out on 10 rabbits in which the samples of tested ceramic with Vancomycin were implanted into femoral bone. The investigation periods were set up for 1, 3, 6 and 9 months. On the basis of received results of macroscopic, microscopic and radiological findings we can stated that corundum ceramic with Vancomycin can be used in the treatment of bone infections.
