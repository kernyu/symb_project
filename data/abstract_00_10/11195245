UNLABELLED: An HIV-negative infant presented with VZV primary infection during the maintenance therapy for megakaryoblastic leukaemia. The lesions were initially vesicular and necrotic but became verrucous and hyperkeratotic. A clinical resistance to acyclovir was suspected and confirmed by histologic and virologic studies. The patient was successfully treated by foscarnet. CONCLUSION: resistance of VZV to acyclovir may occur after a short treatment in a non-AIDS patient.
