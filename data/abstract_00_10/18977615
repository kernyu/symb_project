In this review of the literature, mastitis-causing coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Staphylococcus aureus are compared. Staphylococci are the bacteria most commonly isolated from bovine mastitis, and CNS are now predominant over S. aureus in most countries. CNS include various species, but only a few prevail in bovine mastitis. S. aureus can cause clinical mastitis, but often causes subclinical mastitis, which remains persistent and increases milk somatic cell count. CNS, traditionally regarded as minor pathogens, seem to lack the ability to cause severe mastitis. CNS can, however, persist in the mammary gland and moderately increase milk somatic cell count. Resistance to various antimicrobials is more common in CNS than in S. aureus, but CNS mastitis responds much better to antimicrobial treatment than S. aureus mastitis.
