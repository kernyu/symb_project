Following repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm a patient developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus perigraft abscess. The patient's clinical condition did not permit conventional open surgical correction. Ultrasound-guided aspiration and insertion of percutaneous drain enabled local antibiotic irrigation accompanied by systemic therapy. At 2 years follow-up the patient remains well with no evidence of sepsis.
