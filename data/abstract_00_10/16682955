Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling can bypass the requirement for estrogen receptor (ER) activation in the growth of ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells. Fibroblast growth factor-1 stimulation leads to phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Suc1-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated target (SNT-1) on C-terminal tyrosine residues, whereas it is constitutively bound through its N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) to FGF receptors (FGFRs). By expressing the PTB domain of SNT-1 (SNT-1 PTB) in an inducible manner in an ER+ breast carcinoma line, ML20, we asked whether we could uncouple FGFR activation from its downstream signaling components and abrogate FGF-1-induced antiestrogen-resistant growth. Induction of SNT-1 PTB resulted in a significant decrease of FGF-1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous SNT-1, strong inhibition of complex formation between SNT-1, Gab-1 and Sos-1, and reduced activation of Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase), and Akt. SNT-1 PTB also inhibited the phosphorylation of p70S6K on Thr421/Ser424 and Ser411, which may result from the abrogation of MAP kinase activity. Moreover, we also observed a decreased phosphorylation of the MAP kinase-independent site Thr389. This may reflect both inhibition of PI-3 kinase pathways and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent signaling, as the phosphorylation of Thr389 site was sensitive to treatment with the PI3-K and mTOR inhibitors, LY294002 and rapamycin, respectively. Collectively these results suggest that SNT-1 plays a pivotal role in FGF-dependent activation of the Ras-MAP kinase, PI-3 kinase, and mTOR pathways in these cells. Fibroblast growth factor-1 dependent colony formation of ML20 cells in media containing the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 was also markedly inhibited upon induction of SNT-1 PTB, suggesting that blockade of FGFR-SNT-1 interactions might abrogate FGF-mediated antiestrogen resistance in breast cancers.
