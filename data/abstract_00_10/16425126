The frequency of resistance mutations was estimated in the cohort of Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA Ditrame Plus, a study that evaluated the combination of short-course zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC) and single-dose nevirapine (SD-NVP) followed by 3 days of postpartum ZDV plus 3TC for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The frequency with which resistance mutations were detected in mothers at week 4 postpartum was 1.14% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03%-6.17%) for NVP and 8.33% (95% CI, 3.66%-15.76%) for 3TC. In multivariate analysis, 3TC resistance was associated with a longer duration of ZDV plus 3TC prepartum prophylaxis (P=.009). This regimen, which is feasible in resource-limited settings, prevents most peripartum HIV-1 transmission and minimizes the development of NVP resistance.
