Urine bacteriological examination is one of the most frequently asked for examinations, in ambulatory as well as in hospitals, regarding specialty prophyle. The present study comprises a group of 3971 pacients that were sent to the laboratory for uroculture and showed a percentage of only 21.85% significant urocultures--the etiological groups most frequently isolated being Gram-negative bacilli--96.05%, respectively Escherichia sp. 76.95%, Klebsiella sp. 14.68%, Proteus sp. 4.66%. Out of the Gram-positive bacteria we encountered only group B streptococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Colimycine, phosphomycine, fluorurated quinolones were the most active on the Gram-negative flora, and the Gram-positive cocci were most frequently sensitive to amikacine, amoxycyline and ceftazidim.
