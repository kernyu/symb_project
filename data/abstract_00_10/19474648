We investigated the phenotypic impact of a number of uncommon amino acid substitutions at HIV-1 reverse transcriptase positions 103 and 138, which are not part of the etravirine resistance score and were found in combination with the high-impact mutation K101P. Etravirine phenotypic fold changes were 380-1400 for K101P + E138A/G/Q + K103N/S/T + V179I and 12-130 for K101P + (K103S +/- V179I) in the absence of E138A/G/Q. Although the effect of K103S is unclear, additional position 138 substitutions seem important for etravirine susceptibility.
