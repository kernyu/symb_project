In this paper we report on an experimental evaluation of phenotypic and molecular methods as means for the detection of oxacillin resistance in members of the Staphylococcus sciuri group. A total of 109 S. sciuri group member isolates (92 S. sciuri isolates, 9 S. lentus isolates, and 8 S. vitulinus isolates) were tested by the disk diffusion method, the agar dilution method, the oxacillin salt-agar screening method, slide latex agglutination for PBP 2a, and PCR assay for mecA as the reference method. The mecA gene was detected in 29 S. sciuri isolates, and the true-positive and true-negative results of the other tests were defined on the basis of the presence or the absence of the mecA gene. For the different methods evaluated, the sensitivities and specificities were as follows: for the disk diffusion test with a 1-microg oxacillin disk, 100% and 55.9%, respectively; for the disk diffusion test with a 30-mug cefoxitin disk, 93.5% and 100%, respectively; for the agar dilution method, 100% and 50%, respectively; for the oxacillin salt-agar screen test (with 6 microg of oxacillin per ml and 4% NaCl) 100% and 100%, respectively; and for the slide latex agglutination test for PBP 2a, 100% and 100%, respectively. The disk diffusion test with various beta-lactam antibiotics was performed to evaluate their use for the prediction of oxacillin resistance. The results indicate that meropenem, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefotetan, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, moxalactam, cefaclor, and cefprozil may be used as surrogate markers of oxacillin resistance, although further studies of their use for the detection of oxacillin resistance are required.
