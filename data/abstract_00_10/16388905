Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to monitor the growth of mammalian cancer cells and evaluate the cytotoxicity of chemicals using Fe(CN)6(3-/4-) as a redox probe. Cancer cells, the human hepatocarcinoma cell line (BEL7404), were grown on optically transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) semiconductor slides, which were used as the working electrodes in electrochemical experiments. Attachment and proliferation of cancer cells on ITO surfaces resulted in increase of electron-transfer resistance (R(et)) between the redox probe of Fe(CN)6(3-/4-) in electrolyte solution and ITO electrode surface. For cytotoxicity assessment, cells grown on ITO substrates were further cultured in the presence of different cytotoxicants and electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out at different time intervals. Gemcitabine, a promising antineoplastic drug showing activity against a wide spectrum of human solid tumors, was selected as a model for long-term cytotoxicity effect study, whereas mercury chloride represented a model for acute toxicants. The inhibitions of gemcitabine and mercury chloride on the viability and proliferation of BEL7404 cells were observed from the electrochemical impedance experiments, and the different action modes were discriminated. Additionally, microscope images were also used to observe the effects of these two chemicals on the morphology of the cells. General consistency has been found between the electrochemical impedance response and the morphological observation. Such an impedance method provides a simple and inexpensive way for in vitro assessment of chemical cytotoxicity.
