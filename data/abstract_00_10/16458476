The CombiChip Mycobacteriatrade mark Drug-Resistance Detection DNA chip, recently developed by GeneIn (Pusan, South Korea), is an oligonucleotide microchip coupled with polymerase chain reaction for the detection of mutations associated with resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF). This oligonucleotide chip was compared with DNA sequencing and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing with 69 INH- and/or RIF-resistant and 27 all tested drug-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Two selected codons (the katG codon 315 and inhA15) allowed identification of 84.1% of INH-resistant isolates and 100% of RIF resistance were detected by screening for 7 codons: rpoB511, rpoB513, rpoB516, rpoB522, rpoB526, rpoB531, and rpoB533. The overall specificity of this oligonucleotide chip for detecting INH and RIF resistance were 100 and 95.3%, respectively. This level of sensitivity and specificity is concordant with that from the determination of M. tuberculosis drug resistance by DNA sequencing. This oligonucleotide chip is a rapid and reliable genotypic method capable of detecting multiple mutations associated with INH and RIF resistance simultaneously in a single microchip slide.
