Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are resistant to the antiviral action of interferon. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this report, we show that unlike that of wild-type HSV-1, replication of the gamma 1 34.5 null mutants was significantly inhibited by exogenous interferon-alpha in cells devoid of interferon-alpha/beta genes. Using a series of gamma 1 34.5 deletion mutants, the domain required for interferon resistance was mapped to the region containing amino acids 146 to 263 in the gamma 1 34.5 protein. Interestingly, Val193 Glu and Phe195 Leu substitutions in the protein phosphatase 1 interacting motif of the gamma 1 34.5 protein rendered HSV-1 sensitive to interferon-alpha. Furthermore, gamma 1 34.5 null mutants were sensitive to interferon-alpha/beta in PKR+/+ but not in PKR-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts. These findings provide evidence that the gamma 1 34.5 protein contributes to HSV-1 resistance to interferon-alpha/beta by inhibiting PKR function.
