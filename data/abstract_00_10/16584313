The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and different resistance patterns for Salmonella isolates collected from Belgian sows and fattening pigs at different ages and at slaughter. The most frequently isolated serotypes were S. Typhimurium (42.3%), S. Derby (25.1%), S. Goldcoast (7.3%), and S. Infantis (4.8%). All 901 isolates were submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility testing for 14 compounds using the disc agar diffusion test. The highest percentage of resistance was found to oxytetracycline (34.2%), streptomycin (32.5%), sulfamethizole (27.6%), and ampicillin (24.9%). Three of the isolates showed resistance to cephalosporins and none to second-generation fluoroquinolones. Multiresistance (resistance to > or =2 antimicrobials) was observed in 33.2% of the strains. Differences in resistance patterns were observed between and within serotypes as well as genotypes. A significant lower proportion (p < 0.01) of resistant strains was recovered in fecal samples from sows (23/56) than from fattening pigs during the weaning (30/30), growing (79/85), and finishing periods (45/52). The proportion of resistant strains recovered from fecal samples taken at the herd (154/167) was higher than in the samples collected at the slaughterhouse (75/140). When designing antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs for Salmonella in pigs, it is important to take multiple samples within each herd from both sows and fattening pigs at different time points.
