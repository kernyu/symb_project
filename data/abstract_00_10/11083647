L-Nucleoside analogs are new therapeutic agents for treatment of chronic hepatitis B. However, their clinical application was limited by the emergence of viral resistance. It is important to develop a new system to evaluate drug cross-resistance and to test new agents that may overcome resistant virus. In this report, three cell lines HepG2-WT10, HepG2-SM1, and HepG2-DM2 are presented; these cell lines were established by transfection of HepG2 cells with unique fully functional 1.1x hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes: wild-type HBV-adr and its L526M and L526MM550V variants, respectively. We have demonstrated that these genomes have different susceptibilities to lamivudine [L(-)SddC] and penciclovir (PCV). By examining HBV RNA transcription, antigen expression, progeny DNA replication, and viral susceptibilities to L(-)SddC, PCV, and other nucleoside analogs, it is concluded that the cell lines are able to stably produce L(-)SddC- and PCV-sensitive and -resistant HBV virions. In addition, the relative susceptibilities of the wild-type and mutant HBV produced from the stably transfected cell lines to several anti-HBV nucleoside analogs were also examined and found to be about the same as those found by using a transient infection system. PMEA [9-(2-phosphonylmethoxytehyl)-adenine] and QYL685 are able to suppress L(-)SddC- and PCV-resistant HBV. In conclusion, this cell culture system is a novel and useful tool for evaluating anti-HBV compounds and biologics.
