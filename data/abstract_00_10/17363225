Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and mutant prevention concentrations (MPCs) of prulifloxacin against 30 strains of Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections as well as the 'biological cost' related to acquisition of resistance to the same drug in 10 uropathogenic E. coli were assessed. In terms of MIC(90), prulifloxacin was more potent than ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Prulifloxacin produced lower or equal MPC values than the other two fluoroquinolones (93.3% and 73.3% compared with levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively). Compared with susceptible strains, prulifloxacin-resistant mutants showed a reduced rate of growth (ranging from 20.0% to 98.0% in different culture media and incubation conditions) and a decreased fitness index (ranging from 0.959 to 0.999). They were also impaired in their ability to adhere to uroepithelial cells and urinary catheters (11.7-66.4% and 16.3-78.3% reduction, respectively) and showed a lower surface hydrophobicity (51.2-76.0%). They were more susceptible to ultraviolet irradiation (30.6-93.8% excess mortality), showed increased resistance to colicins and diminished transfer of plasmids (<1-8.5x10(-8) vs. 3.3x10(-7)-2.4x10(-4)). Synthesis of haemolysin and type I fimbriae and production of flagella were also adversely affected. This study demonstrates a strict relationship between acquisition of prulifloxacin resistance and loss of important virulence traits. In this transition, E. coli pays a severe biological cost that entails a general reduction of fitness, thus compromising competition with susceptible wild-type strains in the absence of the drug.
