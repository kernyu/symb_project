The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in childhood varies by age. As in adults, GER can result in a spectrum of disease manifestations. Children with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may become adults with GERD, as suggested by the frequency of childhood reflux symptoms reported by adults with reflux disease. Some studies suggest a causative association between Helicobacter pylori infection and GERD, whereas others postulate a protective role for H. pylori. To better understand pediatric GERD, age-appropriate case definitions and multicenter randomized controlled treatment trials are critically needed.
