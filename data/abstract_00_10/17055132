An animal model of otitis media using chinchillas was developed to evaluate the efficacy of tebipenem pivoxil (TBM-PI) against experimental otitis media. Chinchillas inoculated via the transbullar approach with Streptococcus pneumoniae serogroup 6 were included in the efficacy study with TBM-PI, amoxicillin (AMX) or untreated as controls. TBM-PI resulted in survival rate of 83%, compared with 25% survival for AMX and 0% survival for controls (p<0.01). Quantitative cultures in the middle ear effusions at day 5 of the TBM-PI group yielded 3.5+/-2.4log(10)CFUs/ml. TBM-PI is a promising antibiotic for the treatment of acute otitis media.
