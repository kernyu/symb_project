Bromantan administration markedly increases the stroke and minute blood volume at a reduced heart rate and peripheral resistance in anaesthetized rats, while the systemic arterial pressure exhibits an insignificant short-time increase. Bromantan also weakly increases the pressor effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline. In anaesthetized cats, bromantan modifies the shape of the amplitude-frequency characteristic of EEG measured in the upper cervical ganglion, reducing (against the initial level) the induced potential in the frequency range of the preganglionic fiber stimulation (1-10 and 25-30 Hz). In freely moving rats, capable of well-learnt Sidman's [correction of Seedman's] operant activity, bromantan showed a reliable tendency to decrease the rate of noradrenaline and adrenaline excretion with urine.
