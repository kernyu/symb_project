Nocardia is an infrequent but significant cause of infections in the immunocompromised host. Clinical syndromes are varied and ranges from pulmonary, disseminated, cutaneous, and CNS involvement. Here we describe a case of disseminated subcutaneous nodules in a patient with multiple myeloma caused by Nocardia farcinica. The diagnosis was made by FNA biopsy which revealed gram positive filamentous bacilli in background of acute inflammation on smears. This was confirmed by 16S ribosomal gene sequencing. Prompt identification of N. farcinica is important because of its intrinsic resistance to broad spectrum cephalosporins and high risk of dissemination.
