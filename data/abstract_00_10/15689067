Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.
