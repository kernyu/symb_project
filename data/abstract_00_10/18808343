Coadministration of oral divalent or trivalent cation-containing compounds with oral fluoroquinolones may impair fluoroquinolone absorption. Among 3,134 patients who received a course of oral levofloxacin, coadministration was significantly associated with subsequent identification of a levofloxacin-resistant isolate. Strategies to curb the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance should include avoiding the coadministration of divalent or trivalent cation-containing compounds and fluoroquinolone.
