PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to show that even while properly treated, pneumococcal disease may proceed to a life-threatening condition including purulent pericarditis and multiple organ failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a case-report describing one patient treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Helsinki University Central Hospital in March 2001. CONCLUSIONS: In the antibiotic era, purulent pericarditis is an extremely rare yet possible condition complicating pneumococcal disease. Because of the growing incidence of penicillin resistance of this community-acquired pathogen, purulent pericarditis may become more common. Early detection and treatment of this otherwise fatal condition may lead to a good outcome.
