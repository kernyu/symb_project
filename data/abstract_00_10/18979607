Unit-specific antibiograms serve as useful guides to clinicians and infection control personnel. We compared trends in antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units using traditional 2-y unit-specific antibiogram data and 3 y of data. Three-y unit-specific antibiogram data may provide increased statistical power to detect changes in antimicrobial resistance.
