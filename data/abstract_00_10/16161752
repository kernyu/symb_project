For the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP, Carbenin), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including PAPM against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 1,356 isolates of 28 species were tested, 1,221 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 1,403 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of PAPM were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of PAPM in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Carbenin was launched. This result suggests that PAPM still maintains potent activity. In these surveillances spanning three years, the incidence rates of resistance in various species were as follows (2000.6-2001.3 --> 2001.4-2002.3 --> 2002.4-2003.3): methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (39.3% --> 43.9% --> 47.3%), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (48.9% --> 44.2% --> 25.7%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 13.8% --> 26.3% --> 43.2%), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (0.9% --> 0% --> 1.4%), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 1.3% --> 3.1%), beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae (19.2% --> 8.9% --> 42.9%), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR, 22.1% --> 30.7% --> 33.0%), and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.0% --> 4.4% --> 1.0%). PAPM showed the most potent activity among tested drugs against PRSP, whose incidence rate increased notably. BLNAR, whose incidence rates also increased, exhibited low susceptibility to all tested drugs and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa also exhibited high resistance. The findings of this surveillance indicate that it is necessary to pay careful attention to the trends of resistant bacteria such as PRSP, BLNAR, and metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains.
