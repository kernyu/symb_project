The Staphylococcus lentus plasmid pSCFS2 carries a novel florfenicol-chloramphenicol resistance gene, designated fexA, encoding a protein of 475 amino acids with 14 transmembrane domains. The FexA protein differs from all previously known proteins involved in the efflux of chloramphenicol and florfenicol. Induction of fexA expression by chloramphenicol and florfenicol occurs via translational attenuation.
