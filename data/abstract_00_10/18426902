We evaluated a novel truncated hygromycin A analog in which the furanose ring was replaced with a 2-fluoro-2-cyclopropylethyl substituent for its activity against multidrug resistant gram-positive bacteria and compared its activity to the activities of linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and vancomycin. CE-156811 demonstrated robust in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria that was comparable to that of linezolid.
