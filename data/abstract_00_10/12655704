There has not yet been systematic studies which attempt to elucidate detailed profiles of the interaction between antimicrobial drugs and macrophage microbicidal mechanisms. We examined the effects of antisense oligo DNAs (AsDNAs) against oxyR and ahpC on the susceptibility of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) to the H2O2-halogenation system and combined antimycobacterial drugs [clarithromycin (CAM) + rifampicin (RFP)], both separately and in combination. It was found that AsDNA treatment of MAC did not affect the susceptibility of the organisms to any of the antimicrobial systems tested. Since the present AsDNAs did not efficiently reduce the expression of AhpC mRNA, attempts to increase bacterial uptake of AsDNAs are necessary to achieve significant increase in the drug susceptibility of MAC organisms due to AsDNA treatment.
