Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains of phage types DT104 and U302 are often resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline (the ACSSuT resistance type) and are major zoonotic pathogens. Increased consumption of goose meat may enhance the risk of transferring S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and other enteric pathogens from geese to human due to the consumption of meats from infected geese or improper preparation of meats. Therefore, we characterized S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains isolated from four goose farms (farms A, B, C, and D) and one hatchery farm (farm E) to determine the epidemic and genetic differences among them. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and multiplex PCR confirmed that 77.6% (52/67) of strains were ACSSuT strains isolated from farms A, C, and E. Antibiotic-susceptible strains were isolated mostly from farm B, and no strain was observed in farm D. All ACSSuT strains harbored a 94.7-kb virulence plasmid and contained one 1.1-kb conserved segment identical to that of Salmonella genomic island 1. Four genotypes were determined among these S. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of XbaI-digested DNA fragments. Most isolates (85.29%; 29/34) of major genotype Ib were ACSSuT strains isolated mainly from goslings of farm C and egg membranes of farm E, a hatchery farm, suggesting that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains in isolates from goslings might originate from its hatchery, from the egg membranes to the gosling fluff after hatching. Multiple phage types, types 8, 12, U283, DT104, and U302, were identified. In conclusion, geese were a reservoir of diverse multidrug-resistant (type ACSSuT) S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains, and each farm was colonized with genetically closely related S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains.
