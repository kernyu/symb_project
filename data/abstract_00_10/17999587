BACKGROUND: Postoperative spinal infections are relatively rare. They can become life-threatening. CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old man developed multisegmental spinal infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after discectomy at L3/4. A staged ventrodorsoventral intervention was needed for radical debridement and stabilization. After femoral head necrosis developed as a result of the infection, a Girdlestone hip was maintained until the joint was aseptic and a hip prosthesis could be implanted. Two years postoperatively, the patient remained free of infection recurrence. CONCLUSION: Radical debridement and a tightly controlled antibiotic regimen are necessary for the management of postoperative spinal infections. This should include staged interventions until recovery from infection is possible. Early intervention can prevent systemic sepsis caused by widespread bacterial dissemination.
