Post-burn microbial infections are a major problem in recovering from the trauma of third-degree burns, and the survival of patients can depend upon the severity of the burn and the infections encountered. Within 24 hours, patients can start suffering from opportunistic bacterial attacks, which can vary from simple infection, such as those easily treatable by antibiotics, to more complicated types, which may have natural or acquired resistance to drugs. Infection by multiple drug-resistant bacteria can create additional complexity to the problem. As an alternative to treating bacterial infections by antibiotics, bacteriophages have been in use in certain parts of the world, such as at Tbilisi in Georgia and in Poland, and this approach has now been more widely recognized. Results have shown that phage therapy has an 80% success rate against Enterococcus infections and up to 90% against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Here it is proposed that bacteriophages can effectively be used for the treatment of post-burn infections, particularly the ubiquitous opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas spp., known to be notoriously resistant to a variety of antibiotics. This kind of treatment may be of particular importance in Third World countries where the incidence of burns and infections, due to lack of stringent safety regulations and proper hygiene respectively, may be more common and where cocktails of antibiotics may be less affordable. Phages that can possibly be employed in the treatment and their advantages compared to the use of antibiotics are also highlighted.
