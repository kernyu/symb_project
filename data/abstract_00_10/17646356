Mannan binding lectin (MBL) is an innate immune mediator belonging to the collectin family known to bind to the surfaces of many viruses, bacteria, and fungi. However, pathogenic strains of the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans are resistant to MBL binding. To dissect the mechanism of cryptococcal resistance to MBL, we compared MBL binding to an encapsulated wild-type strain, an encapsulated ccr4Delta mutant defective in cell integrity, and an acapsular cap60Delta strain. No MBL binding was detected on wild-type C. neoformans. In contrast, the ccr4Delta mutant bound MBL to the cell wall, predominantly at the ends of enlarged buds, whereas the acapsular strain bound MBL only at the bud neck and bud scars. In addition, the ccr4Delta mutant was sensitive to the cell wall-active antifungal caspofungin and other cell wall stress inducers, and its virulence was reduced in a mouse model of cryptococcosis. Interestingly, treatment of wild-type cells with caspofungin also increased MBL binding to C. neoformans. These results suggest that both the presence of capsule and wild-type cell wall architecture preclude MBL binding to C. neoformans.
