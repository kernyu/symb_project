A new system was developed for producing conditional-lethal vaccinia virus mutants using the tetracycline controlled gene expression system from bacteria. The tetracycline resistance operon (tetO) sequence was placed between the promoter and coding sequence of the target gene of the virus. To regulate the expression of the target gene, the tetO-containing virus was used to infect a tetracycline repressor (TetR) expressing cell line. This method allowed isolation of a tetO-containing virus in the absence of the TetR thereby eliminating the risk of selecting for an inactivated viral tetR gene caused by recombination of the virus genome and improving the stability of the engineered mutants.
