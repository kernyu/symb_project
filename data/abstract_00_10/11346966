Inoculation of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) cell-suspension cultures with avirulent bacteria results in a salicylic acid (SA)-controlled programmed cell death (pcd). To unravel the nature of the SA-dependent step in pcd, a screening procedure for complementing compounds was performed. Diverse chemicals that are well known as activating ligands for orphan receptors in animals, particularly receptors of the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) subfamily, were found to be active. These include the compounds WY-14643, flufenamic acid, LY-171883, tolbutamide, indomethacin and clofibrate. A new marker gene (DD-CA9) from soybean that is induced in the hypersensitive reaction by SA and by PPAR ligands was isolated by differential display, and showed homology to antifungal lectins. In plants, SA is also involved in a signal transduction pathway leading to systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The PPAR ligands which act on the pcd pathway for plant resistance induce a beta-1,3-glucanase gene in soybean at high concentrations but do not induce marker genes of the SAR pathway such as the PR-1 gene in tobacco or Arabidopsis. Thus SA seems to act on two independent plant defence pathways that can now be separately activated by synthetic compounds. We propose a model for the control of pcd by SA in soybean, in which SA induces the transcription of (novel) genes required for the final completion of the cell death program.
