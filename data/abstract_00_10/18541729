The MIC for streptomycin in the presence of efflux pump (EP) inhibitors and the sequencing of rpsL, rrs, and gidB genes provided evidence for the possible participation of EP in low-level streptomycin (STR) resistance of some isolates without mutations. Mutation in the gidB gene and an EP could act synergistically to confer low STR resistance.
