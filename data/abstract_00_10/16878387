Ascorbigen, a natural product, is an indole derivative of L-ascorbic acid. Its effect on postnatal development and antibacterial resistance of the small intestine was studied on newborn mice. Ascorbigen was administered to 3-5-day old mice in a dose of 100 mg/kg orally every day for 7-10 days. 30 minutes before the last administration of the drug clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli were administered intragastrically to the young mice. The animals were killed in 24 hours and the frequency of the isolation of the microbes from the blood, spleen, kidneys and liver was developed. The oral use of the drug normalized the intestinal microflora, provided a reliable decrease of the bacteria isolation from the blood, spleen, kidneys and liver and prevented the animal death. The morphological examination showed that ascorbigen significantly increased the number and activity of the Paneth cells in the gland crypts, the goblet cells in the villi and mononuclear cells in the selfplate of the intestine mucous membrane vs. the intact control.
