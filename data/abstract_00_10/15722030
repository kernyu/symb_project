The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance profile, K65R, K70E and M184V, on reverse transcriptase gene was associated with the virologic rebound consecutively to the switch of lopinavir/r to tenofovir DF in a stable regimen with nucleoside backbone of abacavir, lamivudine and didanosine. The high selective pressure on the same resistance pathway was probably associated with the loss of antiviral potency, even in well-controlled patient.
