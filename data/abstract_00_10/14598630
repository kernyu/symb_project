Leprosy has definitely been present in China for at least 2,000 years. Through painstaking efforts over the past half century, China has put leprosy under control and reached the WHO's target at elimination of leprosy at the national and subnational level. But difficulties as well as problems like disabilities, discrimination, drug-resistance and dismissing of research still remain in the control of leprosy. Highly attention should be continuously paid on to attain the prevalence rate of less than 0.1/10,000 and the incidence rate below 0.5/100,000 in all counties (cities) throughout the country by the year 2010.
