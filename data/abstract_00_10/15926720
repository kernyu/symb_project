Nosocomial infections with organisms resistant to multiple antibiotic agents represent an evolving challenge in the intensive care setting, particularly in patients requiring surgical diversion of cerebrospinal fluid. The authors present the case of a 51-year-old woman who endured protracted hospitalization and required multiple surgeries including placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The shunt subsequently became colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which demonstrated intermediate sensitivity to amikacin and full resistance to all other antibiotics tested 'After failing to respond to intravenous imipenem as well as intravenous and intrathecal amikacin, the patient was successfully treated with intravenous and intrathecal colistin. Colistin is a polymyxin-type antibiotic, rarely used outside of topical application because of reported nephrotoxicity associated with parenteral administration. With activity limited to Gram-negative organisms, colistin is bactericidal by directly disrupting the structure of cell membranes. Authors of a few case reports in the literature have described successful treatment of various ventriculitis with the intrathecal administration of colistin. With bacterial resistances outpacing the pharmaceutical industry's ability to develop novel antibiotics, colistin represents an important alternative in situations involving multidrug-resistant organisms.
