OBJECTIVE: To analyse clonal diversity in 72 erythromycin-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci. METHODS: Clonal relationships were studied for streptococci of groups A (GAS, n = 30), B (GBS, n = 34), C (GCS, n = 4) and G (GGS, n = 4) by means of PFGE. Streptococcal isolates were obtained from a 450-bed hospital in Spain during the following periods: GAS (1996-2001), GBS (1999-2001), GCS and GGS (1997-2000). RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 30 GAS isolates showed the M resistance phenotype and harboured the mef(A) gene. Five unrelated PFGE patterns were identified among these 22 GAS isolates. Sixteen of them, obtained during four different years of the study, showed one of the two predominant PFGE patterns. The remaining eight GAS isolates showed the MLSB resistance phenotype, and four unrelated PFGE patterns were detected. All but one erythromycin-resistant GBS showed the MLSB resistance phenotype, and an erm gene was identified in all cases [erm(B) or erm(A)]. Twenty-two unrelated PFGE patterns were demonstrated among 25 GBS with the MLSB resistance phenotype; the remaining eight MLSB GBS isolates could not be typed by PFGE. The eight erythromycin-resistant GGS and GCS isolates of this study presented seven unrelated PFGE patterns. GGS and GCS strains showed an MLSB resistance phenotype and had the erm(A) gene. CONCLUSIONS: High clonal diversity was detected in this series of erythromycin-resistant GBS, whereas lower diversity was seen in the GAS isolates.
