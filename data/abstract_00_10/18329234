INTRODUCTION: The treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) in women is based mainly on empirical antibiotic therapy. It requires up-to-date knowledge of the susceptibility patterns of the bacteria most commonly identified in that setting. The aim of this prospective study was to measure the antibiotic susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolates responsible for UTIs in women from a single area and to compare it in hospital and community settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2003 through April 2004, UTI was diagnosed in 1838 women around Rennes (France), 893 of them inpatients admitted to the teaching hospital and 945 outpatients in the community. We determined the susceptibility to 7 antibiotics of the resulting 1217 E. coli isolates. RESULTS: E. coli resistance rates in hospitalized and community patients were respectively 47.9% and 39.2% for aminopenicillins, 47.3% and 25.4% for coamoxiclav, 19.2% and 14.1% for cotrimoxazole, 14.3% and 5.7% for first-generation quinolones, and 8.9% and 3.7% for fluoroquinolones. All these rates were significantly higher among hospitalized patients (p<0.05). Conversely, resistance to injectable third-generation cephalosporins and fosfomycin was similar and infrequent in both groups. CONCLUSION: Comparisons with previous data show that activity of third-generation cephalosporins and fosfomycin on E. coli appears unchanged, in contrast to the increased resistance rates to other antibiotics usually prescribed for UTI.
