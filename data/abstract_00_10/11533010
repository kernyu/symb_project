Quinolone resistance was studied in potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strains from healthy ruminants. In cattle, 5.9% of the strains were resistant to nalidixic acid and 4.9% were resistant to enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, whereas in sheep and goats only 0.5% and 1.4%, respectively, of the strains were resistant to nalidixic acid and none to fluoroquinolones. Most of the strains resistant to quinolones were non-pathogenic strains isolated from cattle. However, the results of this study do not show that the potentially pathogenic E. coli strains isolated from healthy ruminants are more susceptible to quinolones than the non-pathogenic E. coli strains.
