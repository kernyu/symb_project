Persistence of malaria symptoms after treatment with over the counter available antimalarial drugs has resulted in a gradual loss of faith in orthodox drugs. There is thus an increased tendency towards the use of herbs in the treatment of malaria in Imo State, Nigeria. In this study we report activities of two herbalists in the treatment of malaria as well as the effectiveness of the herbal treatment. The study covered two areas namely, Umuneke Ugiri in Isiala Mbano Local Government Area (LGA) and Odummara Obi-Orodo in Mbaitoli LGA of Imo State, Nigeria. A participant-observation technique was used. Finger prick blood samples were collected from patients who visited the herbalists complaining of malaria, and blood smears were stained with Field's B stain. Blood smears were taken again one-week post-treatment. A total of 75 patients from Umuneke Ugiri and 265 patients from Odumara Obi-Orodo were involved in the study. All the 75 patients (100%) from Umuneke Ugiri and 163 (61.51%) patients from Odummara Obi-Orodo were positive for malaria parasites. Only 13 (17.3%) patients from Umuneke Ugiri and 149 (56.23%) from Odummara Obi-Orodo returned for the post-treatment blood parasite analysis. From Umuneke Ugiri 4 (31%) were still positive for malaria parasite while 9 (69%) were negative. All 149 patients from Odummara Obi-Orodo were negative. This indicates that the herbal treatment was effective. However, there is need for further studies into the efficacy of herbal concoctions, their effective life span, as well as possible toxic effects.
