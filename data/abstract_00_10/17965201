Three strains of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis were compared to Salmonella enterica serotype Heidelberg, Salmonella enterica serotype Newport, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium for growth in the presence of 240 antibiotics arranged within a commercial high-throughput phenotype microarray. The results show that antibiotic resistances were different for subpopulations of serotype Enteritidis separated only by genetic drift.
