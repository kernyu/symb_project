Short-chain aldehydes such as (3Z)-hexenal and n-hexanal are formed from lipids through sequential actions of lipid-hydrolysing, lipoxygenase and fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase activities. The aldehydes are formed upon wounding of plant tissues, and are reported to have bactericidal and fungicidal activities. Furthermore, it has been reported that the aldehydes can induce expression of a subset of genes involved in disease resistance and that they are involved in a defence response against insect herbivores. Although several genes encoding lipoxygenases and the lyases have been isolated, and characterized to some extent, only little is known about the enzyme accountable for the lipid-hydrolysing step. In this study, we tried to characterize the lipid-hydrolysing activity involved in the short-chain aldehyde formation in Arabidopsis. When Arabidopsis leaves were homogenized, (3Z)-hexenal was formed rapidly within a few minutes. During this time period, the amount of alpha-linolenic acid and C(16:3) rapidly decreased. Such a rapid increase of the aldehyde was repressed almost completely when the leaves were homogenized under a nitrogen stream, and instead free trienoic acids accumulated. A lipase inhibitor, quinacrine, successfully repressed the hydrolysis. It was revealed that trienoic acids in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol were predominantly hydrolysed during the formation of short-chain aldehydes. Collectively, it is suggested that the lipolytic enzyme involved in the short-chain aldehyde formation is a galactolipid-specific lipase.
