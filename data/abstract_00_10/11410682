We have constructed new yeast vectors for targeted integration of desired sequences at the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO locus. Insertion at HO has been shown to have no effect on yeast growth, and thus these integrations should be neutral. One vector contains the KanMX selectable marker, and integrants can be selected by resistance to G418. The other vector contains the hisG-URA3-hisG cassette, and integrants can be selected by uracil prototrophy. Subsequent growth on 5-FOA permits identification of colonies where recombination between the hisG tandem repeats has led to loss of the URA3 marker and return to uracil auxotrophy. We also describe several new bacterial polylinker vectors derived from pUC21 (ampicillin resistance) and pUK21 (kanamycin resistance).
