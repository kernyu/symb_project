Pentamidine is a second-line agent in the treatment of leishmaniasis whose mode of action and resistance mechanism are not well understood. In this work, we show that the intracellular ABC protein PRP1 (pentamidine resistance protein 1) (ABCC7) can confer resistance to pentamidine in Leishmania sp. parasites in the intracellular stage.
