BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are an important cause of nosocomial infection occurring in critical care or immunocompromised patients. OBJECTIVES: To provide updated information about therapeutic options for VRE infection. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify in vitro susceptibility data of VRE isolates, randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, case series, and cohort studies of VRE therapy published before 31 July 2008. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The updated in vitro susceptibility data for VRE show high resistance to ampicillin and aminoglycosides. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is limited by its lack of activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faealis and its musculoskeletal side effects. Emerging linezolid resistance has been reported to cause hospital spread and may be related to prolonged linezolid use. Quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance is usually linked to agricultural use of streptogramin. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin are alternatives in uncomplicated VRE urinary tract infection. Daptomycin and tigecycline have shown excellent potential for treating VRE infection.
