This study was aimed to investigate the reversible effect of tetrandrine, toremifene and their combination on multidrug resistance of K562/A02 cell line. The IC(50) (the concentration causing 50% inhibition of cell growth) of adriamycin (ADR) were assayed by MTT method, the expression of MDR1 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR, the concentration of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and intracellular ADR were detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that the IC(50) of ADR on K562/A02 and K562 cells were 57.43 and 1.16 mg/L, respectively. The IC(50) of ADR on K562/A02 cells after treatment with tetrandrine, toremifene and both combination were 14.12, 20.74 and 9.14 mg/L respectively, but both drugs did not influence the IC(50) of ADR on K562 cells. Pretreating K562/A02 cells with toremifene (2.5 micromol/L), tetrandrine (1 micromol/L) or both for 72 hours partially restored the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to ADR. Tetrandrine and toremifene (alone or combination) elevated the ADR concentration in K562/A02, down regulated the expressions of P-gp and MDR1 mRNA. It is concluded that multidrug resistance of K562/A02 cells can be partially reversed by tetrandrine or toremifene, the combination of both drugs shows a higher synergistic reversal effect.
