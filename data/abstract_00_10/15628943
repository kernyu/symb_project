INTRODUCTION: Adequate antibiotic use clearly influences the development of bacterial resistance, adverse events and healthcare costs. Studies of drug usage allow us to detect deviations in antibiotic use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibiotic use during the period 1998-2002 was analyzed using data provided by management software applications. The prescription of restricted-use antibiotics during years 2001 and 2002 was analyzed by selecting patients according to the information available in the unit-dose drug distribution area database at the pharmacy department. RESULTS: Antibiotic use increased from 78 to 100 DDD during the period of time studied. The use of new quinolones has displaced macrolides. Two thirds of piperacillin --tazobactam prescriptions are for surgical patients. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Changes in the pattern of antibiotic use have been detected. 2. The relative weight of restricted-use antibiotics has increased. 3. This study allows a prioritization of intervention areas.
