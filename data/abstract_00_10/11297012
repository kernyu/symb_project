Altogether 130 clinical isolates of five Klebsiella species (K. pneumoniae, K. planticola, K. oxytoca, K. ornithinolytica and K. terrigena) were characterized, for their susceptibility to five antibiotics, for susceptibility to serum bactericidal activity and for their hydrophobic properties. All strains exhibited ampicillin resistance. Ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin and ofloxacin showed effectiveness in 63.1, 67.7 and 71.5% of the Klebsiella isolates. K. planticola manifested the highest level of resistance to these antibiotics. The majority of Klebsiella strains (93.9%) were susceptible to cefuroxime. Sixty-four strains (49.2%) were serum resistant and intermediate serum sensitivity was shown by 57 strains (43.8%). A high percentage of serum resistant strains (65%) was found in K. planticola. Moderately hydrophobic properties determined by adherence of bacteria to xylene were demonstrated in 25 strains (19.2%).
