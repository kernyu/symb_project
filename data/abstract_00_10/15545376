This study evaluated the prevalence of multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Kenyan milk and investigated any differences in antimicrobial resistance between large- (>200 L/d) and small- (<50 L/d) scale producers. Susceptibility profiles for penicillin G, tetracycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethazine, and chloramphenicol were determined for Staph. aureus (n=402) isolated from cows with subclinical mastitis. There was a significant difference in the overall mean resistance profile between large- (7.1%) and small-scale farm (14.7%) isolates. The overall prevalence of multidrug resistance (> or =2 antibiotics) differed significantly between isolates from small farms (34.3%) and those from large farms (18.0%). Additionally, the producers were interviewed about their usage of antimicrobial drugs and their attitudes toward education in related fields. There was an evident difference between the producer types in their documentation of the use of antimicrobial drugs. Small-scale farms were less inclined to documentation, and treatment records were available from 22% of small-scale farms, compared with 73% of large-scale farms. Farmers expressed a need for more information in 5 areas, ranking preventive management highest (34.0%); followed by affordable tests to control residues in milk (22.8%); preparation of antimicrobial drugs (20.0%); public health concerns (11.2%); disposal of surplus antimicrobial drugs (7.8%); and antimicrobial drug residue persistence in milk (4.2%). It was concluded that herd size might be an indirect risk factor in the development of antimicrobial resistance in Staph. aureus within the region.
