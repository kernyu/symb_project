Eighty-five atypical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus divided into 73 aminoglycoside-susceptible methicillinresistant (AS-MRSA) and 12 kanamycin-tobramycin-resistant methicillin-susceptible (KTR-MSSA) were phenotypically and genotypically examined for methicillin resistance. Among these tests, the diffusion method using the oxacillin and cefoxitin disks on Mueller-Hinton agar with and without NaCl, the incubation at 35 degrees C or 30 degrees C for 24 or 48 hr, respectively, and the determination of oxacillin MICs by E-test were performed. We also examined the presence of the mecA gene by PCR and its product PBP 2a by the Slidex MRSA Detection test after induction by cefoxitin disk. All of the AS-MRSA strains (100%) were detected by the cefoxitin disk in all conditions and by the oxacillin disk on Mueller-Hinton agar with 2% of NaCl at 35 degrees C. Without NaCl, the sensitivity fell to 97.2% by oxacillin disk. The oxacillin MICs for these isolates ranged from 2 to 128 mg/L. The mecA gene determinant and its product PBP 2a were detected in all AS-MRSA strains. All KTR-MSSA strains were phenotypically methicillin-susceptible and oxacillin MICs were below or borderline of breakpoint (< or =2 mg/L). The mecA gene determinant and its product were detected in one strain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was applied and revealed the presence of two major patterns A (36.9%) and B (46.2%) in AS-MRSA isolates and seven patterns in the KTR-MSSA strains.
