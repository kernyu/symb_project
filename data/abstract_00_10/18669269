The elicitor arachidonic acid in combination with jasmonic acid (JA) induced a higher level of defense against the late blight agent in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tissues than in combination with salicylic acid (SA). On the contrary, the elicitor chitosan displayed a higher inductive effect in combination with SA as compared with JA. The optimal concentrations of tested compounds were selected for designing the compositions activating wound repair, induction of proteinase inhibitors, and resistance to the biotrophic pathogen Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary. It was demonstrated that the compositions of elicitor and systemic signal molecules provided a faster spreading of an inducing effect in the potato tissues.
