OBJECTIVES: To evaluate if povidone-iodine (PVP-I) can be used topically in the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media-tubotympanic disease and to compare it with ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ear drops. DESIGN: Prospective double-blind randomized study. SETTING: Academic tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Forty patients with chronic suppurative otitis media were randomized into 2 groups. INTERVENTION: One group (19 patients) received 5% PVP-I ear drops, while the other group (21 patients) received 0.3% ciprofloxacin ear drops. Both were administered topically, 3 drops 3 times daily for 10 days. These patients were followed up at weekly intervals for up to 4 weeks after commencing therapy. RESULTS: Clinical improvement at the end of study was 88% in the PVP-I group and 90% in the ciprofloxacin group. The most commonly isolated organism was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro resistance to ciprofloxacin was seen in 17% of organisms, while no resistance was seen for PVP-I. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of PVP-I as a topical agent in the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media. The results show that clinically, topical PVP-I is as effective as topical ciprofloxacin, with a superior advantage of having no in vitro drug resistance. Also, there is an added benefit of reduced cost of therapy.
