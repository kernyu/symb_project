OBJECTIVE: This study assessed clinical differences between invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Patients with IPD confirmed during January 1996-December 2007 at three hospitals were included. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients infected with penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) and penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP). RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients with IPD were identified during the study period, 20 (29%) of whom were infected with PRSP and 49 (71%) with PSSP. Sex, mean age, underlying diseases and seasonal variation did not differ statistically between the two groups. No significant differences were identified in clinical course as measured by time until defervescence, duration of hospitalization and clinical outcome. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for other antibiotics were determined; 20% and 10% of PRSP isolates were nonsusceptible to cephalosporins and meropenem, respectively, but all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences identified in the clinical epidemiology of lPD cases caused by PRSP and PSSP.
