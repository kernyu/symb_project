Achyranthes aspera seed was incorporated in the diets (at 0.01%, 0.1% and 0.5%) of Labeo rohita, rohu fingerlings (3.0+/-0.4 g). After 2 weeks, the fish were immunized with heat-killed Aeromonas hydrophila, and after a further 2 weeks the rohu were experimentally infected with Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 49140). After 7 days blood and serum were sampled to determine superoxide anion production, bactericidal activity, lysozyme, serum protein, albumin, globulin, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Superoxide anion production, serum bactericidal activity, lysozyme, ALP, serum protein, albumin:globulin ratio (A/G) were enhanced in Achyranthes treated groups compared to the control group. SGOT and SGPT levels were elevated in control group, but in Achyranthes treated groups the levels were similar to the uninfected-control group. Higher cumulative mortalities were observed in the control group (77%) up to day-9 after infection. This gradually decreased with increasing dose of Achyranthes, 66% mortality in 0.01% group, 57% mortality in 0.1% group and 28% mortality in 0.5% group. These results indicate that Achyranthes aspera stimulates immunity and increases resistance to infection in L. rohita.
