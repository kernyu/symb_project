This report describes methods for the selection and analysis of antiretroviral resistance to HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs) in cell culture. The method involves the serial passage of HIV-1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of test inhibitors, followed by the cloning and sequencing of the integrase coding region from the selected viruses. The identified mutations are subsequently re-engineered into a reference wild-type molecular clone, and the resulting replication capacity and level of drug resistance are determined relative to the wild-type virus. Here we describe examples of selection and analysis of InSTI-resistant viruses using four integrase inhibitors from three structurally distinct chemical classes; a diketo acid, two naphthyridines, and a pyrimidinecarboxamide. Each inhibitor selected an independent route to resistance. Interestingly, the shift in the IC50 required to suppress the re-engineered resistant mutant viruses closely matched the concentration of compound used during the selection of drug resistance.
