The increase in antibiotic resistance over the past 10 years can be traced to several factors. This includes exogenous transmission of bacteria, usually by hospital personnel. The use of potent antibiotics also can select for resistant bacteria initially present in low quantities. Strategies to reduce antibiotic resistance can be tailored to specific outbreaks in a given ICU. General strategies for reducing antibiotic resistance, on the other hand, include varying the agents used in the ICU over time. Reduction of the duration of therapy may prove to be another method of reducing antibiotic resistance.
