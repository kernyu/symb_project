This study aimed at assessing the prevalence of complications encountered during prolonged intravenous antibiotic (AB) therapy when treating acute osteoarticular (OA) infections in children. We reviewed retrospectively 60 paediatric patients treated in our department between 1988 and 1998 for acute osteoarticular infections (27 with acute haematogenous osteomyelitis, 25 with septic arthritis and 8 with septic osteoarthritis). C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and full blood count were monitored during the entire treatment. Body temperature was recorded three times per day until the fever subsided, and then daily during the remaining hospitalisation. Finally, we listed complications related to the antibiotic therapy and those linked to the presence of a venous catheter. Seventeen allergic reactions to drugs were recorded during the intravenous AB therapy. This complications occurred on average after 24.4 +/- 4.4 days of treatment. The clinical manifestations most often encountered were a delayed rise in temperature and cutaneous symptoms. Blood tests showed an isolated increase in the ESR and eosinophilia (> 1000 eosinophils/ml). Four venous catheters had to be removed, in two cases owing to their obstruction and in two cases owing to an infection. Prolonged intravenous AB therapy is not without complications due to its duration and its mode of administration. Drug allergies to AB constitute a major complication of the treatment. They may render the treatment of subsequent infections problematic and expose these patients to major allergic reactions if they accidentally encounter the molecule incriminated. Moreover, the anaesthetics required to insert a central venous catheter and the need to leave it in place for a prolonged duration constitute another source of potential complications. The duration of i.v. AB therapy could therefore be shortened if the clinical and biological evolution is favourable and the pathogen is identified.
