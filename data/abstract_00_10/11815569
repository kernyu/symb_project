The in vitro activities of the novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone BMS-284756, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were tested against 248 genetically defined Staphylococcus aureus isolates, comprised of 116 unrelated S. aureus, seven heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hetero-VISA) strains and 125 clonally related MRSA. All strains were susceptible to BMS-284756 at an investigational breakpoint of 1 mg/L. Reserpine did not decrease the MIC of BMS-284756 in any of the strains tested. The novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone BMS-284756 showed a significantly increased anti-staphylococcal activity.
