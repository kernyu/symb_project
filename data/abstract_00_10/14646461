S. aureus causative agent is relatively pathogenic to humans and is found on the skin and mucosa of up to 40% of all population. Burn injuries are infected with S. aureus in 30% of cases; however, in many cases the injuries heal without the antibiotic therapy, solely by applying dressing with antiseptic solutions, early removal of necrotic masses and covering the injury with a skin graft. In 2000, in the Division of Plastic Surgery and Burns of our institution, the frequency of S. aureus infection among patients with burns was 47%, of which methicillin-resistant S. aureus - 45%. The study included 100 patients who had S. aureus grown in the samples of their injuries. The article compares the severity of the trauma and the results of treatment in groups of patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus.
