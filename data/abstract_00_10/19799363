An oxidative stress resistance in Paecilomyces lilacinus strain from Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station (ChAES) as well as in P. lilacinus strains from zones with control level of radioactive pollution has been studied. It was shown that radial growth rate of the colony of the ChAES strain in a range of glucose concentrations 0.002%; 0.2%; 0.5%; 1.0% showed maximum on the medium with 0.2% glucose. It was 1.5 times higher than growth rate of the control strains. Adaptation slowdown reaction has been found as a result of the first 10-30 min H2O2 treatment most profound in the ChAES (No 1941) strain. Under 10(-3) mol/l H2O2 growth of No 1941 resumed with 20% loss in growth rate. Cessation of growth of the control strain (No 10) was observed under these conditions. It has been shown that in the strain from ChAES zone adaptation to low glucose content in the medium (0.2%) was coupled with an increased resistance to oxidative stress.
