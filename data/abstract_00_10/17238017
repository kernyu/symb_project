In the years that followed the issuance in 2000 of the Guidelines for the Management of Helicobacter pylori Infection in Japan by the Japanese Society for Helicobacter Research (JSHR), a number of major issues arose, including the emergence of H. pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin as part of primary eradication therapy, and this led to the Guidelines being revised by the JSHR in 2003. While the JSHR aimed in the 2000 Guidelines to prepare clinicians for the task ahead in view of H. pylori eradication therapy becoming available, the JSHR went a step further in the 2003 Guidelines to include more evidence-based recommendations to address clinical and institutional challenges and issues of interest in the management of H. pylori infection in Japan. Thus, a number of diseases were upgraded to either class A or B indications for H. pylori eradication, including mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (class A), and after endoscopic mucosal resection for early gastric cancer, atrophic gastritis, and gastric hyperplastic polyp (all class B), with further diseases such as extragastric disease also included as class C indications requiring further examination. Concern was expressed over reliance on a single diagnostic test for H. pylori infection, which is in place due to institutional constraints. Metronidazole was also recommended for use in the place of clarithromycin as part of a second-line eradication regimen in light of increasing clarithromycin resistance, although metronidazole remains to be approved for health insurance coverage. Finally, areas requiring further clinical research and endeavors, including establishment of second-line eradication therapy, were also proposed in the 2003 Guidelines to point the way for the future.
