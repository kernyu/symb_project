We describe peptidomimetic oligomers that show rapid, nonhemolytic, broad-spectrum bactericidal properties in mice and do not induce the emergence of resistance. The oligomers contain acyl chains, which prevent the formation of stable secondary structure. This design appears advantageous over conventional antimicrobial peptides with respect to in vivo efficacy and safety, and may provide a convenient platform for the development of peptide antibiotics.
