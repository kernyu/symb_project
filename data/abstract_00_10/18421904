At present the left-handed "respiratory" quinolones such as moxifloxacin and levofloxacin are the most promising drugs for therapy of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR). Fast and specific diagnostics of sensitivity of M. tuberculosis (MBT) with MDR to this group of drugs is required for timely prescription of adequate chemotherapy and its correction in case of MBT resistance to fluoroquinolones. A new generation of biological microchips - TB-BIOCHIP-2 makes possible to detect 9 mutation types in quinolones resistant determination region (QRDR) of gene. About 800 samples from 169 patients in Antituberculosis center were studied. In patients with new detected tuberculosis 23.5% MBT resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (MDR) and sensitive to fluoroquinolones were revealed. In patients with chronic tuberculosis 65.5% MBT-MDR were revealed. Our results were confirmed with detecting ofloxacin resistance on Lowenstein - Jensen. In addition efficiency of TB-BIOCHIP-2 to control drug testing sensitivity of MBT-MDR on fluoroquinolones was confirmed.
