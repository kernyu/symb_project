Macrolide resistance in 156 consecutive group B streptococcal isolates was investigated. Thirty-five isolates (22.4%) had inducible (80%) or constitutive (20%) erythromycin resistance. The genes responsible were erm(B), erm(A) subclass erm(TR), and erm(B) plus erm(TR) in 62.9, 2.9, and 8.6% of isolates, respectively. Nine isolates (25.7%) harbored neither mef nor detectable erm genes.
