BACKGROUND: There is no effective regimen for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in our country. It may be due to the increasing prevalence of resistance to antibiotics used for the treatment of H. pylori. Recently, a study from Turkey has revealed that a new treatment scheme consisting of sequential administration of pantoprazole plus amoxicillin for 7 days followed by pantoprazole plus metronidazole, and tetracycline for the remaining 7 days was effective in the first-line treatment of H. pylori. Therefore, we aimed to confirm efficacy of a new therapy scheme in the first-line H. pylori eradication. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective, open label, single center, pilot study and included 32 patients infected with H. pylori diagnosed by both histologic examinations, rapid urease test and (13)C-urea breath test (UBT). The patients received a 14-day sequential regimen (pantoprazole 40 mg b.d. plus amoxicillin 1000 mg b.d. for 7 days and pantoprazole 40 mg b.d., metronidazole 500 mg b.d. and tetracycline 500 mg q.d. for the remaining 7 days). Eradication was assessed with (13)C-UBT 4 weeks after completion of the therapy. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol eradication rates were determined. RESULTS: At intention-to-treat analysis, the eradication rate was 50% (16/32). For the per protocol analysis, the eradication rate was 57% (16/28). There were no significant adverse effects and treatment compliance was good. CONCLUSION: A new therapy consisting of sequentially administered drugs for 14 days yielded unacceptably low eradication rates. This scheme was not efficient for H. pylori eradication in our region. Further investigations are needed to determine the effectiveness of this scheme in other regions of Turkey.
