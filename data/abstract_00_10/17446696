Seven new related compounds named bispolides A1, A2, A3, B1, B2a, B2b and B3, have been found in a culture of Microbispora sp. A34030, isolated from a Malaysian soil sample. The planar structures were elucidated to be new 20-membered ring macrodiolide antibiotics on the basis of MS and NMR spectroscopic analyses. These antibiotics showed a good anti-MRSA activity in vitro.
