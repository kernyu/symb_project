This is the first report, to our knowledge, of two temporally and geographically related nosocomial Asaia lannensis infections in a paediatric setting. Two patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy awaiting cardiac transplantation developed bacteraemia during their hospital stay. The physical location of both patients, the temporal association of infections, as well as the isolation of two identical pathogens suggested a nosocomial transmission. Commonly used identification methods and instruments failed to identify the isolated pathogens and only 16S rRNA gene sequencing provided definitive identification. These isolates of A. lannensis showed an unfavourable susceptibility pattern including resistance to carbapenems, all beta-lactam agents and fluoroquinolones.
