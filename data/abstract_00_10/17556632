In the last three decades, high rates of resistance to common first-line antimicrobial agents have been reported in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (Typhi), the causative organism of typhoid fever (TF), in many regions of the world, especially in South East Asia. Analysis of Typhi strains isolated from outbreaks and sporadic cases of TF in Son La province, northwest Vietnam, in 2002 revealed that 94.5% (85/90) of the isolates were fully susceptible to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. There was a clear decline in the occurrence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Typhi isolates collected in this province in 2002 (4.4%) compared with the period 1995-1999 in the same province (30.8-100%). By using molecular (IS200 profiling, PstI-ribotyping, XbaI-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and haplotyping) and phage-typing methods, we showed that the Typhi isolates from Son La province in 2002 were genetically related; however, they were unrelated to the previous MDR clones established in Vietnam.
