Antiretroviral combination therapy is the standard of care in the treatment of HIV-infection in the industrialised world. Treatment with antiretroviral drugs provides selective pressure on HIV. Suboptimal anti-HIV treatment increases the risk of resistant mutations developing. Recently, genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing has become available for routine use. So far, few data have been published on the efficacy of this testing and there is no evidence of clinical benefit. The use of genotypic resistance testing should--until further evidence has been provided--be limited to patients with virological failure on a current regimen. Genotypic resistance testing can also be used for epidemiological surveillance.
