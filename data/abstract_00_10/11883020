Perinatal group B streptococcal infection has been the subject of numerous studies and despite guidelines established during the last decade remains a frequent disease with high mortality. The basic aim of the guidelines is to screen for Streptococcus agalactiae during the antepartum period in order to institute antibiotic therapy during delivery. A critical review of the literature highlights the real impact and adverse effect of these guidelines: difficult application (only two-thirds of all maternity units have a protocol and compliance is only 75%), maternal risks of antibiotic therapy (especially the emergence of resistant Gram negative bacteria), fetal risks (accentuation of neonatal sepsis with resistant strains, retarded neonatal infections, frequent use of antibiotics with a broader spectrum, higher frequency of nosocomial sepsis).
