The activities of ravuconazole and four other antifungal agents were tested against a collection of 1,796 clinical yeast isolates, including fluconazole-susceptible and -resistant strains. Ravuconazole was active against the majority of fluconazole-resistant isolates; but for 102 of 562 (18%) resistant isolates, mainly Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, and Cryptococcus neoformans, ravuconazole MICs were > or =1 microg/ml.
