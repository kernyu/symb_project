The review deals with the periodicity of the spread of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains during the last 40 years, the mechanism of their resistance to methicillin and other beta-lactamic antibiotics, the genetic control of methicillin resistance, the genome organization of mec DNA and its possible cause, as well as the organization of epidemiological surveillance on MSRA in hospitals. The problem of changes in the epidemiology of staphylococcal infections due to the appearance of MRSA in the absence of contacts with carriers, treatment with antibiotics or stay in a hospital is discussed. The concern of public health authorities in connection with the emergence of MRSA strains, moderately resistant or resistant to vancomycin, is also discussed. The most promising programs of the MRSA study, as well as the optimum programs introduced in economically developed counties for the control of hospital infections caused by MRSA, are considered.
