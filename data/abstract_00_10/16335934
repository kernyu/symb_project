Novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors encompassing a tertiary alcohol as part of the transition-state mimicking unit have been synthesized. Variation of the P1'-P3' residues and alteration of the tertiary alcohol absolute stereochemistry afforded 10 inhibitors. High potencies for the compounds with (S)-configuration at the carbon carrying the tertiary hydroxyl group were achieved with Ki values down to 2.4 nM. X-ray crystallographic data for a representative compound in complex with HIV-1 protease are presented.
