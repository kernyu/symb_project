Summary Forty (40) HIV positive patients with CD4 cell counts between 100 - 500 cellh/mm3 were recruited from 8 different centres in Nigeria including a research centre and specialist and teaching hospitaLs They were enrolled into an open, non-comparative study of a triple combination regimen containing the Protease Inhibitor (PI), Nelfinavir and two Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTIs), Zakitabine (Hivid) and Zidovudine for a period of 24 weeks. Thirty-one (31) patients completed the study. Nine (9) patients withdrew from the study. Two of these because of Adverse Events (AE), 2 others because they developed tuberculosis and had to withdraw because of rifampicin therapy. The remaining five (5), withdrew voluntarily. Efficacy of the PI containing triple regimen was evaluated using viral load and absolute CD4 changes, weight gain and clinical response during the course of the triaL Twenty-two (22) patients had plasma viral loads measured at the beginning and at the end of the trial (24 weeks). Seventeen (17) out of the 22 patients (77%), experienced a significant reduction in their plasma viral loads (p<0.05 There was 1 log reduction in plasma viral load in 6 patients (25%), 2 log in 4 patients (17%). In 2 patients (8%), plasma viral load was reduced below the level of detection. The viral load increased over the treatment period in five patients (21%). Similarly 22 out of the 26 patients (85%) experienced increase in the level of their CD4 lymphocyte counts at the end of the study. The average CD4 counts of all 26 patients rose from 272.94 +/- 137.71/dl to 414 +/- 243.71/ul over 24 weeks (p<0.05). There was monthly rise of 27 CD4 cells/microl. Four (4) patients (15%) had a fall in their CD4 lymphocyte counts. Twenty (20) out of the 26 patients (77%), who completed the study were observed to have weight gains ranging from 1.5 to 31 kilograms over the 24 week study period. In 4 patients, there was no weight gain during the study period. Two patients (5%) were withdrawn due to adverse events from the viracept combination. One of these was because of life threatening diarrhoea while the other patient had severe peripheral neuropathy and severe weakness in the lower limbs. Eight (8) other patients had diarrhoea but not severe enough to stop them from continuing with the triaL Other adverse events seen include anaemia (1 patient), pancytopenia (1 patient), and transient elevation of serum urea and creatinine (1 patient). None of these adverse events was severe enough to warrant withdrawal from therapy. The study has therefore demonstrated the significant efficacy and tolerability of (Nelfinavir/Zalcitabine/ Zidovudine combination in suppressing viral replication, increasing the CD4 cell counts and improving the quality of life in Nigeria patients with HIV.
