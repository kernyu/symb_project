A 68-year-old diabetic woman suffered from mycotic aneurysm due to Klebsiella pneumoniae over her abdominal aorta; she received surgical intervention, followed by treatment with first-generation cephalosporins for 6 months. She was hospitalized again 11 months later because of another episode of mycotic aneurysm caused by K. pneumoniae on her thoracic aorta. Fingerprinting generated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and infrequent-restriction-site polymerase indicated K. pneumoniae isolates of the identical clonal strain were responsible for these two mycotic-aneurysm episodes. Unfortunately, nosocomial pneumonia developed at the second hospitalization; blood and purposefully sampled feces specimen cultures both grew CTX-M-24-producing K. pneumoniae, which were of the same strain and genetically nonrelated to the K. pneumoniae strain causing mycotic aneurysms earlier. This is the first report on infection due to CTX-M-24-producing K. pneumoniae. It is unclear whether the prolonged use of first-generation cephalosporins in this case selected a strain of enteric organism possessing the ESBL in question, which was capable of passing this ESBL plasmid to the K. pneumoniae strain causing the nosocomial infection. This report suggests that further observation is needed before one can draw a conclusion on the possibility of the selection of ESBL enteric organism by extensive exposure to first-generation cephalosporins.
