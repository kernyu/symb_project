AIM: To evaluate susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori to amoxicillin and clarithromycin in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and non-uremic controls. METHODS: The subjects with dyspeptic complaints were 33 ESRD patients and 46 age- and sex-matched non-uremic controls who exhibited H pylori on antral biopsy specimens. The two groups were age and sex matched. The H pylori strains' pattern of susceptibility to amoxicillin and clarithromycin was investigated with the agar dilution technique. RESULTS: None of the H pylori strains from either group showed resistance to amoxicillin with the agar dilution method. Twelve (36.4%) of the ESRD group strains and 7 (15.2%) of the control group strains showed resistance to clarithromycin, and this difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Resistance to amoxicillin does not appear to be an important problem in H pylori-infected ESRD and non-uremic patients in our region. In contrast, the rates of resistance to clarithromycin are high, particularly in the ESRD population.
