A series of unique 3,3a-dihydropyrano[4,3,2-de]quinazolin-2(1H)-ones and a 2a,5-dihydro-2H-thieno[4,3,2-de]quinazo-line-4(3H)-thione were found to be HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. One of these compounds, as the racemate, possessed an IC90 = 4.6 nM against wild-type virus in a whole cell antiviral assay and had an IC90 = 76 and 897 nM against the clinically significant K103N and K103N/L100I mutant viruses, respectively.
