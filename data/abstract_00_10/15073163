OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to analyse incidence rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from hospitalized children up to 5 years of age with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), including meningitis, in Austria. METHODS: From February 2001-January 2003, nationwide prospective surveillance was conducted that included all paediatric hospitals and clinical microbiological laboratories. All invasive pneumococci isolated were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence rates of IPD per 10 000 population for the age groups <24 months and <60 months were 14.5 (7.7 for meningitis) and 13.7 (6.0 for meningitis), respectively. The case fatality rate was 6% for IPD and 12% for meningitis. Of all IPD cases, 69.6% (73.1% for meningitis) were covered by serotypes and 83.9% (88.5% for meningitis) by cross-protection of vaccine-related serotypes. Intermediate penicillin G susceptibility (MIC 0.12-1 mg/L) was found in 12/56 strains. No penicillin G-resistant strains were found. A total of 19/56 isolates showed decreased susceptibility to macrolide agents (MIC >/= 1 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: The IPD incidence rate was similar, and serotype coverage of the 7-valent conjugated vaccine marginally superior, to Germany. The surprisingly high level of antimicrobial resistance among invasive isolates considerably amplifies the potential impact of a childhood pneumococcal vaccination programme in Austria.
