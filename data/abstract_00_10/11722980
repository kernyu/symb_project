The treatment recommendations for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are evolving rapidly. In the past year, pegylated interferon and STI571 (Gleevec, imatinib mesylate), a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, have become commercially available and non-myeloablative stem cell transplants continue to be refined. Clinicians and patients face a bewildering array of treatment options for CML. In this article Dr. Sawyer reviews the clinical results with STI571 and ongoing investigations into mechanisms of resistance to STI571. Given the newness of STI571, a practical overview on the administration of STI571 is presented by Drs. Druker and Ford, focusing on aspects such as optimal dose, management of common side effects, and potential drug interactions. The most recent data on interferon-based regimens are reviewed by Dr. Baccarani in the third section. In the last section Dr. Goldman presents recent results of allogeneic stem cell transplants, including the reduced intensity conditioning regimens. Lastly, the proposed place of each of these treatments in the management of CML patients is addressed to assist in deciding amongst treatment options for CML patients.
