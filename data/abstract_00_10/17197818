We report the results of the extended follow-up at one year of a randomized trial evaluating the virological efficacy of a salvage therapy combining lopinavir and amprenavir with either 200 or 400 mg/day ritonavir, along with optimized nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, in patients carrying multidrug-resistant isolates. The combination of amprenavir, lopinavir and ritonavir (400 mg/day) is durably potent, yielding a sustained virological response (HIV RNA < 50 copies) in 39% of cases.
