BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: An explosive outbreak of diarrhoeal disease which occurred in the Baishnabghata, Patuli area of Kolkata Municipal Corporation during September 28 to October 12, 2000, was investigated by a team from the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata, to identify the causative agent and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data were collected from domiciliary cases and also from patients attending two medical camps that had been set up for the purpose. Stool and water samples were collected for isolation of diarrhoeagenic pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 710 cases of diarrhoea occurred with an attack rate of 7.1 per cent; majority were adults. All 6 faecal samples and 2 water samples collected, were positive for Vibrio cholerae O139. The strains were uniformly (100%) susceptible to the commonly used drugs for cholera such as tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole and nalidixic acid but resistant (100%) to furazolidone and ampicillin. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: This is the first localised outbreak of V. cholerae O139 in Kolkata since the devastating epidemic in 1992. Extensive chlorination of all water sources resulted in a dramatic decline of the outbreak. The appearance of resistance in V. cholerae O139 to furazolidone is a matter of great concern since this drug is used for the treatment of cholera in children and pregnant women.
