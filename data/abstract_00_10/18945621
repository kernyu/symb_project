Fourteen title compounds, 1-substituted-5-substitutedphenylthio-4-pyrazolaldoxime ester derivatives 4a-4n, were synthesized from the starting material 1-substitutedphenyl-3-methyl-5-substitutedphenylthio-4-pyrazolaldoximes 3 by treatment with acyl chloride. The synthesized compounds were characterized by physical constants, and the structures of the title compounds were further confirmed by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental analysis. The bioassay results showed that title compounds possessed weak to good anti-TMV bioactivity with 4l showing significant enhancement of disease resistance in tobacco leaves with high affinity for TMV CP.
