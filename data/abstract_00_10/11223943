Sequencing of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome revealed an open reading frame (YJR105w) encoding a putative protein highly similar to adenosine kinases from other species. Disruption of this gene (renamed ADO1) affected utilization of S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) as a purine source and resulted in a severe reduction of adenosine kinase activity in crude extracts. Furthermore, knock-out of ADO1 led to adenosine excretion in the medium and resistance to the toxic adenosine analogue cordycepin. From these data we conclude that ADO1 encodes yeast adenosine kinase. We also show that ADO1 does not play a major role in adenine utilization in yeast and we propose that the physiological role of adenosine kinase in S. cerevisiae could primarily be to recycle adenosine produced by the methyl cycle.
