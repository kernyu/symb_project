The selection of antimicrobial agents in the hospital setting is still a largely manual task and, therefore, fraught with the potential for error. This includes the choice of agents, dosage regimens, and monitoring for response and toxicity. The authors describe current and future strategies to use information technology to improve the process of antimicrobial selection and to avoid dosing errors and contraindicated drug combinations. The possible role of decision support in preventing the emergence of resistance is also discussed.
