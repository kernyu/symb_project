A 19-item survey instrument was designed and mailed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America to its membership to determine the media preferred by infectious diseases physicians for continuing medical education on general topics and on antimicrobial resistance. The objective of the survey was to offer the developers of educational programs knowledge on which to base more-effective ways to deliver educational materials to physicians in this specialty.
