During 2005-2006, a total of 865 Enterococcus faecium isolated from patients from eight Greek hospitals were tested for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D). Among them, 250 genetically unrelated strains (28.9%) were found to be intermediate-resistant to Q/D (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 1.5-4 mg/L); all were resistant to dalfopristin (MIC=16-64 mg/L), whilst 69% were resistant to quinupristin, carrying the ermB gene. No strain was found to carry any of the known genes, such as vatE and vatD, involved in Q/D resistance, indicating that a non-transferable undetermined mechanism is responsible for the expression of low-level Q/D resistance. The high percentage of Q/D-intermediate-resistant E. faecium in Greece was not associated with prior consumption of the agent or with the veterinary use of virginiamycin.
