Germination of mutant spores of Bacillus subtilis unable to degrade their cortex is accompanied by excretion of dipicolinic acid and uptake of some core water. However, compared to wild-type germinated spores in which the cortex has been degraded, the germinated mutant spores accumulated less core water, exhibited greatly reduced enzyme activity in the spore core, synthesized neither ATP nor reduced pyridine or flavin nucleotides, and had significantly higher resistance to heat and UV irradiation. We propose that the germinated spores in which the cortex has not been degraded represent an intermediate stage in spore germination, which we term stage I.
