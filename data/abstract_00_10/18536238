Recent clinical study reported that the best choosing of antiretroviral therapy for an individual patients is one that physicians have always tried to practice, making use of whatever knowledge or tools are available to treatment decisions. Individual genetic variations provide scope for a wide range of host-drug interactions that will differentiate therapeutic outcomes within an otherwise homogenous population. Pharmacogenetics looks set to become an increasingly important field to refine the medical tools to personalize antiretroviral treatment. The integration of genetic tests into routine patient management has a great challenge for HIV-guidelines and for clinical care. Pharmacogenetics will increasingly impact all medical disciplines for the candidates to therapy. It was confirmed, that genetic screening enabled to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity reaction.
