Four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were consecutively isolated from synovial fluid and a knee wound of a patient with septic arthritis. Determination of the MIC of vancomycin and population analysis confirmed these isolates as vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). Results of this study also revealed that cell wall thickness and reduced susceptibility to Triton X-100 were characteristic features of VISA.
