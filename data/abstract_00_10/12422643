It was demonstrated that glutoxim combination with second line drugs for tuberculosis treatment (cycloserine + rifabutine, cycloserine + protionamide) provided statistically significant decrease of intracellular mycobacteria growth in the murine lung tissue culture. The decrease rate when compared to the control group was 3-5 times. The investigated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain was isolated from the patient and was multi-drug resistant (MDR). Glutoxim addition to the second line drugs combinations provided also decrease of the MDR bacteria microcolonies growth in the lung tissue culture. Glutoxim combination with second line antituberculosis drugs allowed to keep vitality and functional activity of lung tissue cells.
