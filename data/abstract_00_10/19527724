BACKGROUND & AIMS: The recommended therapy for chronic hepatitis C, pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 24 or 48 weeks, has many known adverse side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of antiviral therapy on male sexual health. METHODS: As part of the Study of Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis C (Virahep-C), 260 men treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin completed self-administered questionnaires concerning sexual desire, sexual function, including erectile and ejaculatory function, and sexual satisfaction before, during, and after treatment. RESULTS: Before therapy, 37% of men reported at least some degree of impairment in sexual desire and 44% reported dissatisfaction with their sexual life, while 26% reported impairment in erectile and 22% in ejaculatory function. During therapy, significant declines were observed in all components of sexual health compared with pretreatment. At the end of therapy (24 or 48 weeks), an estimated 38%-48% of men reported that overall sexual function was worse than before treatment. African American patients reported less impairment in sexual desire and satisfaction than Caucasian American patients during therapy. By 24 weeks after treatment, sexual desire and satisfaction improved and were comparable to baseline levels. However, among men who received 48 weeks of therapy, the estimated percentage of men reporting posttreatment erectile or ejaculatory problems remained higher than baseline, although persistent erectile impairment was limited to Caucasian American patients. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual impairment is common among men with chronic hepatitis C undergoing therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and should be considered as a potential side effect of antiviral therapy.
