Articles published in the last year have changed perceptions of cytomegalovirus. It is now recognized as a rapidly replicating virus which develops resistance frequently during chronic administration of ganciclovir.

New treatments which are safe and potent are urgently needed and should be highly cost-effective when the full clinical impact of this virus is assessed.
