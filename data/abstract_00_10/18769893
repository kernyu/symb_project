Medically inappropriate, ineffective and economically inefficient use of antimicrobials is commonly observed in the health care units throughout the world especially in the developing countries. Antimicrobial stewardship programs attempt to balance the demand for these life-saving drugs with the need to preserve their future efficacy. A comprehensive evidence-based stewardship program should include elements chosen from the recommendations based on local antimicrobials use and resistance problems and on available resources that may differ, depending on the size of the institution or clinical setting. For success of antibiotic stewardship it is essential to increase awareness amongst medical professionals. Discipline in antimicrobial prescribing is most vital in clinical settings. A careful assessment of the benefits of prescribing against the risk of non-prescribing of antibiotics should be considered. It should be an endeavor of every physician to justify antibiotic prescription in case of empirical use. Integration of advanced information technology into antimicrobial stewardship programs holds the potential to both reduce antimicrobial overuse and improve outcomes.
