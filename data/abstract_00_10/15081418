Enterobacter aerogenes develops increased multidrug resistance via a functional alteration of outer-membrane permeability associated with a decrease in porin function. We have sequenced the gene coding the major porin of Enterobacter aerogenes, omp36. The sequence shows a high similarity with the Klebsiella pneumoniae ompK36 gene and is closely related to the enterobacterial OmpC family. Sequence analysis of several Omp36 issued from clinical strains indicated variability in putative cell-surface exposed domains. Interestingly, substitution Gly112Asp was observed in the conserved eyelet L3 region of the porin produced by two strains, C and 3. This substitution is associated with a high general beta-lactam resistance observed in these isolates and with alteration of pore properties previously described in strain 3 porin [Mol. Microbiol. 41 (2001) 189]. This is the first genetic identification of impermeability-mediated resistance to beta-lactams in various clinical E. aerogenes strains.
