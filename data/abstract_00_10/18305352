Cyslabdan, a new potentiator of imipenem activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. K04-0144 by Diaion HP-20 and ODS column chromatographies and preparative HPLC. The structure of cyslabdan was elucidated by spectroscopic analyses including NMR. The compound has a labdane-type diterpene skeleton connecting with an N-acetylcysteine via thioether linkage.
