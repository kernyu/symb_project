Over a 7-month period in 2000-2001, 1213 Haemophilus influenzae, 112 Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 142 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were recovered from adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Patients were from four southern European countries (Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates to 11 antibiotics was determined in a central laboratory. The most active drugs on the basis of MICs were levofloxacin, cefditoren, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime and amoxicillin/clavulanate. MICs > or = 2 mg/l for amoxicillin were found in 19.5, 28.6, and 75.4% of H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates, respectively. Isolates of H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae with reduced susceptibility or that were fully resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin were detected (0.2-1.8%) as well as M. catarrhalis resistant to clarithromycin (0.7%). Regular surveys of resistance patterns for antimicrobial agents are necessary.
