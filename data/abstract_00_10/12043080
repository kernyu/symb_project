We had some good news in the last year: Tenofovir received its FDA approval, a new class of antiretrovirals, the fusion-inhibitors, entered phase III trials and there are some promising agents in the pipeline of the pharmaceutical laboratories. The major issue in the development of new drugs is the antiretroviral activity. One of the "winners" here is TMC-125, a new NNRTI. But people focus also on the side-effects of the HAART, especially on long-term toxicity. One example is Atazanavir, a protease inhibitor which doesn't show any increase in cholesterin or triglycerides. But all the exciting news drugs have to prove their real potential in large phase III trials.
