Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are responsible for infant's persistent secretory diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea and outbreaks. Since isolated all over the world EAEC strains show a low to high level of resistance to antimicrobial agents, the aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamases extended spectrum (ESBL) production in vitro among 55 enteroaggregative E. coli strains isolated from children with diarrhea. Among the 17 antimicrobial agents tested, most of them showed good in vitro activity against EAEC isolates examined, apart from ampicylin and piperacylin (about 30% resistant EAEC strains). Three of 55 examined EAEC isolates were ESBL--producing strains. Because of the presence of ESBL--producing as well as resistant to antimicrobial agents EAEC isolates among enteroaggregative E. coli strains examined, treatment with antibiotics should be undertaken according to antibiogram.
