In order to investigate the effect of rapamycin on the proliferation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, the sensitive cells HL-60 and multidrug-resistant HL-60/VCR cells were chosen as research objects. The proliferation of cells was detected by growth curve method. The flow cytometer was used to analyze cell cycle. The expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) was determined by Western blot. The results demonstrated that there was a significant difference of cell growth inhibition rate between control group and rapamycin group (p < 0.05). The cell growth inhibition rate was dose- and time- dependent (p < 0.05). Flow cytometry detection showed that the cell percentage of G(1) phase in rapamycin group was higher than that in group without rapamycin, and that of S phase was lower. The cell growth inhibition rate in 50 nmol/L and 100 nmol/L rapamycin plus daunorubicin (DNR) group was more than that in DNR alone group (p < 0.05), especially when DNR was added at 24 hours interval after RAP. The expression of Pgp of HL-60/VCR cells was inhibited by rapamycin. It is concluded that the rapamycin can inhibit the proliferation of sensitive HL-60 and multidrug resistant HL-60/VCR cells. It can also increase sensitivity of HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells to DNR, which provides new strategy for the therapy of refractory AML.
