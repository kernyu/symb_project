BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is more difficult to treat than is drug-susceptible TB. To elucidate the optimal therapy for MDR TB, we assessed the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors for patients with MDR TB. METHODS: This study included patients who received an individualized treatment regimen for MDR TB at Samsung Medical Center, a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, Korea, from January 1995 through December 2004. To identify the prognostic factors related to favorable treatment outcomes, univariate comparison and multiple logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: Of 155 patients, 18 (12%) had newly diagnosed MDR TB, 81 (52%) had previously received treatment with first-line drugs, and 56 (36%) had received treatment with second-line drugs. The isolated strains were resistant to a median of 5 drugs. Twenty-seven patients (17%) had extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB at the start of treatment. Outcome assessment revealed that 102 patients (66%) were cured or completed therapy. The treatment success rates did not differ significantly between patients with non-XDR MDR TB and those with XDR TB (66% vs. 67%). Surgical resection was performed more frequently for patients with XDR TB than for those with non-XDR MDR TB (48% vs. 17%). Combined surgical resection, body mass index >/=18.5 (calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters), use of >4 effective drugs, and a negative sputum smear result were independent predictors of a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Early aggressive treatment comprising at least 4 effective drugs and surgical resection, when indicated, may improve the outcome for patients with MDR TB or XDR TB.
