BACKGROUND: This study was designed to determine the incidence of group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization in pregnant women and newborns, and to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance during delivery. METHODS: A total of 300 pregnant women and their newborns were enrolled in this prospective study performed in the maternity ward of Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty and Bakirkoy SSK Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. Samples were collected from pregnant women and their newborns in the delivery room. RESULTS: GBS was isolated from 24 women and the colonization rate was found to be 8%. Two newborns were colonized with GBS. None of the isolates were resistant to penicillin, whereas 20% showed resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin. CONCLUSION: Screening and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of GBS during pregnancy show similar results with other studies performed in different regions of our country.
