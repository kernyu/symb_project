Whole beta-tubulin genes from wild carbendazim(MBC)-sensitive isolate, field MBC-resistant isolate and induced MBC-resistant mutant of Gibberella zeae were cloned and sequenced with 3 pairs of primers. These genes have 1631bp length, including 3 introns, encoding 447 amino acid. The homology of amino acid tubulin gene of G. zeae with that of other common plant pathogenic filamentous fungi is from 95.12% approximately 99.30%. Sequence comparison among MBCs, field MBCR and induced MBCR isolates revealed there was no mutation, even one. So it can be concluded that the mechanism of MBC-resistance to G. zeae is different from other filamentous fungi caused by point mutation at amino acid position 198 or other position of beta-tubulin gene.
