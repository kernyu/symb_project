A total of 50 clinical strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were collected from Kobe University Hospital in 2003. Molecular typing of SCCmec was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the presence of six genes (vraR, vraG, vraA, vraF, fruA, and fruB) associated with vancomycin (VCM) resistance was examined by simple PCR analysis. Out of 50 MRSA strains isolated 47 strains contained Type II SCCmec and the remaining contained Type IV SCCmec. Thirty seven strains contained pUB110 plasmid. VraA was present in 69% of the strains, vraF in 10%, vraG in 53%, and vraR in 16%. Noteworthy, strains without pUB110 contained vraR in relatively higher frequency (31%) compared with strains with pUB110 (11%).
