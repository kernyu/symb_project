The pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerance, and antiviral effects of ganciclovir (Gcv) administered orally were evaluated in 36 children infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV) who were severely immunocompromised by infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In this dose-escalation study, 30 mg/kg of Gcv administered every 8 h produced serum levels similar to the dose (1 g/8 h) effective for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis in adults. In older children, serum Gcv concentrations were similar after the administration of capsules and suspension. All doses (10-50 mg/kg/8 h) studied were safe and, except for the volume of suspension or number of pills, were well tolerated. Oral Gcv was associated with a decrease in the detection of CMV by culture or polymerase chain reaction. CMV disease occurred in 3 children during the study: one developed Gcv resistance, another had harbored resistant virus at study entry, and a third had wild-type CMV
