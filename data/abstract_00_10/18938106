This review summarizes recent investigations into antimalarial drug resistance and chemotherapy, including reports of some of the many exciting talks and posters on this topic that were presented at the third Molecular Approaches to Malaria meeting held in Lorne, Australia, in February 2008 (MAM 2008). After surveying this area of research, we focus on two important questions: what is the molecular contribution of pfcrt to chloroquine resistance, and what is the mechanism of action of artemisinin? We conclude with thoughts about the current state of antimalarial chemotherapy and priorities moving forward.
