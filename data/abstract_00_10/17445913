As an intermediate host of avian and human influenza A viruses (FLUAV) pigs may play a potential role in interspecies virus transmission and reassortment of viral genes including those conferring antiviral drug resistance. Porcine FLUAV isolated in Germany between 1989 and 2001 contains mutations in the M2 gene inducing amantadine resistance. No data exist on neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) susceptibility of these porcine FLUAV. We studied the antiviral activity of NAI against seven selected H3N2 FLUAV isolated from pigs in Germany between 1982 and 1999. All isolates were susceptible towards oseltamivir and zanamivir in neuraminidase enzyme-inhibition assays. Both compounds inhibited virus spreading and reduced the virus yields and plaque size at low concentrations. Higher concentrations were necessary to reduce the plaque number. Two isolates that differed in glycosylation pattern of viral hemagglutinin (HA) showed markedly reduced drug susceptibility in cell culture-based assays.
