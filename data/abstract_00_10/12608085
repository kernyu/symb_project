The paper contains the generalizing results of many-year research related with using various ready-made medication forms (RMF) of human genetic-engineering interferon-alpha 2 and of methods of its administration into the body. Extensive clinical materials were made use of to show convincingly that the most effective therapy for infectious diseases is ensured within a short time period and with a consequent long-term rehabilitation effect by using separate RMFs and methods of application of interferon-alpha 2, when their impact on the lesion focus is monitored by the parameters of the cellular-and-humoral chains of the general and local immunity. It is noteworthy, that a selection of RMF adequate for an actual nosologic form or of an administration method can reduce the medication dose of interferon-alpha 2 (thus, the incidence of complications to the drug goes down), it can also eliminate the influenza-like syndrome and production of autoantibodies related with the intramuscular administration of interferon-alpha 2, besides, it essentially prolongs the presence of interferon-alpha 2 in the body. It is important that the application of interferon-based preparations for infectious diseases can eliminate, in a number of cases, the use of antibiotics and other antibacterial drugs, it enhances the efficacy of antibacterial and antiviral therapy within a comprehensive treatment scheme, it contributes to a higher resistance of normal flora to the action of antibiotic and antibacterial drugs, and, finally, it arrests quicker the manifestations of dysbacterioses of various localizations.
