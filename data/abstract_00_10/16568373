BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that intratumoral expression of catabolizing and anabolizing enzymes for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is important in the response of cancers to 5-FU-based chemotherapy. We investigated the influence of other chemotherapeutic agents or cytokines, which are often administered for enhancing the efficacy of 5-FU, on the tumoral expression of 5-FU-associated enzymes, i.e., dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), thymidylate synthase (TS), orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT), and thymidine phosphorylase (TP). METHODS: Human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29, Caco-2, and DLD-1) were incubated with 5-FU and with 5-FU combined with cisplatin, camptothecin, paclitaxel, mitomycin C, interferon, or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. mRNA expression of 5-FU-associated enzymes was assessed by real-time PCR. Activity of each enzyme and intracellular 5-FU accumulation after incubation with such agents were also evaluated. RESULTS: Each agent had a synergistic effect on the cytotoxicity of 5-FU. All chemotherapeutic agents other than cytokines induced marked alteration of the mRNA expression profile of 5-FU-associated enzymes; depression of DPD, elevation of TS, and slight suppression of OPRT and TP. In accordance with mRNA expression, enzyme activity of DPD was significantly depressed by such agents. Furthermore, although 5-FU itself increased DPD mRNA expression, a mechanism considered to be related to the acquisition of 5-FU resistance, the addition of cisplatin or camptothecin significantly inhibited the 5-FU-induced elevation of DPD. CONCLUSIONS: 5-FU-associated enzymes in colon cancer cells were greatly influenced by various chemotherapeutic agents; in particular, DPD expression was depressed. These results appear important in planning chemotherapy and also in understanding the development of adverse effects of 5-FU.
