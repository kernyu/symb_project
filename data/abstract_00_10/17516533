Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated clinical activity against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV). We analyzed the evolution of viral load and the changes of polymerase and precore/core promoter sequences in lamivudine-resistant virus during ADV therapy. The authors studied 14 patients who had breakthrough hepatitis after lamivudine therapy. Serial sera were obtained prior to adefovir administration and at 3, 6 and 12 months after ADV therapy. Nucleotide sequences of polymerase and the precore/core promoter from the hepatitis B virus were analyzed. The median serum HBV DNA decrease with adefovir treatment was 4.35 log(10) copies/mL at 12 months. Tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) mutants were found in 12 patients among the 14 patients with lamivudine resistance. The YMDD mutant viruses reversed to the wild-type in 6 patients out of the 12 patients after 3-6 months of ADV after discontinuing lamivudine therapy. In the analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the precore/core promoter gene, core promoter mutants in 12 patients were replaced by wild-type virus in three patients (25%), while precore mutants in four patients were replaced by the wild-type in three patients (75%). The results demonstrate the patterns of polymerase and precore/core promoter mutations in lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B viruses and the reversion from the mutant to the wild-type in some patients. In addition, despite several mutations in the polymerase during ADV therapy, ADV effectively suppressed HBV replication without the emergence of resistant viral mutants.
