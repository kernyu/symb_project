Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACT) are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to treat especially multidrug resistant forms of malaria, as currently used medications have become increasingly ineffective. In this chapter, the discovery of artemisinin from Traditional Chinese Medicine and its further development to ACT are reviewed. It is highlighted how the complex supply chain to the naturally occurring endoperoxide artemisinin, required to produce ACT-based drugs, was established; thus addressing the significant therapeutic needs and high demands for the medication.
