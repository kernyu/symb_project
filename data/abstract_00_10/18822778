The effect of alkyloxybenzenes (AHBs) belonging to the class of alkylresorcinols differing in the degree of hydrophobicity--C7-AHB and more hydrophobic Cl12-AHB--on the resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to heat shock and oxidative stress of lethal intensity was studied. Depending on structure and concentration, AHB added 2 h before exposure to stress had either an antistress or stress-potentiating effect on yeast cells in the mid-logarithmic growth phase. C7-AHB at concentrations 0.25-0.5 g/l caused a two- to fivefold increase in the resistance of yeast cells to hydrogen peroxide (30-150 mM), whereas Cl2-AHB reduced it at all concentrations. C7-AHB and Cl2-AHB had a similar effect on yeast subjected to heat shock (45 degrees C, 30 min). It was found that the degree of the protective effect of C7-AHB and potentiating effect of Cl2-AHB depended on the nature of the stressor, being more pronounced in heat shock. The environmental significance of the antistress and stress-potentiating effects of microbial AHBs is discussed.
