The increased risk of heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has prompted the search for safe and effective female-controlled vaginal microbicides. Because endogenous reverse transcription is implicated in augmenting the sexual transmission of HIV-1, potential microbicides should have the inherent ability to optimally inhibit both wild-type and drug-resistant mutant strains of HIV-1. N-[2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylethyl)]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thiourea (PHI-236) is a rationally designed non-nucleoside inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) that was deduced from changes in binding pocket size, shape and residue character that result from clinically observed NNRTI resistance mutations. PHI-236 displayed high-binding affinity (Ludi K(i) = 0.07 microM) for HIV-1 RT and robust anti-HIV activity against the wild type (IC50 = <0.001 microM) as well as primary clinical isolates (IC50 = 0.009-0.04 microM) carrying multiple RT gene mutations associated with NRTI and NNRTI resistance. PHI-236 displayed high-selectivity index against human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells and did not affect human sperm functions. In the humanized severe combined immunodeficient mouse model for HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), pretreatment of HIV-1 (BaL)-infected human monocytes and semen with PHI-236 prevented the systemic infection via the vaginal route. PHI-236 has particular clinical utility as a non-spermicidal microbicide as well as a prophylactic antiviral agent to inactivate cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 in semen before assisted reproductive technology procedures.
