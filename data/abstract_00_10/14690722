A total of 73 strains of Plesiomonas shigelloides isolated from humans (24 strains) animals (21 strains) and aquatic environment (28 strains) were determined for their O:H serotype and susceptibility to 18 anti-microbial substances and to the vibriostatic agent O/129. Of all strains, 86.3% were typeable by the O and 94.5% by the H anti-sera used. The serotype distribution was heterogeneous within a country and between the countries. Of the 57 different serotypes identified, O11:H2 (2 strains), O22:H3 (4 strains), O35:HH11 (2 strains), O52:H3 (2 strains) and O90:H6 (2 strains) were found among isolates from humans and animals (mainly in cats) in Finland and Cuba, and O23:H1a1b (3 strains) among isolates from environmental sources in Slovak Republic and Italy. Most (93-100%) of all strains were susceptible to all anti-microbials tested but resistant (92-96%) to the broad-spectrum penicillins (ampicillin, mezlocillin). No correlation between anti-microbial resistance patterns and serotypes was found.
