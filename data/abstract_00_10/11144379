OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of the utilization of antibiotics in children at the population level on the frequency of penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci (PNSP). DESIGN: Children ages 0 to 6 years with a nasopharyngeal culture of PNSP were registered on place of residency in the 20 municipalities of the former Malmohus County (since 1998 a part of Skane County). Where possible the total number of nasopharyngeal cultures with growth of pneumococci was registered as well. All antibiotic prescriptions for 0- to 6-year-old children were analyzed in the 20 municipalities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Correlation between the utilization of antibiotics and the frequency of PNSP in children at the municipality level. RESULTS: The proportion of PNSP among all isolates of pneumococci from nasopharyngeal cultures varied between 0 and 49.5%. The antibiotic utilization in children varied among the 20 neighboring municipalities from 8.5 to 19.7 defined daily doses per 1000 children per day. The municipalities with high total utilization also had more frequent use of macrolides and broad spectrum antibiotics. The was a significant correlation between antibiotic use and the proportion of PNSP (correlation coefficient, 0.96; P = 0.002), and the correlation coefficients for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillins, macrolides and cephalosporins were significant at the 0.001 level. There was no significant correlation between the use of penicillin V and the frequency of PNSP. CONCLUSIONS. There was a significant correlation between the frequency of PNSP and the utilization of antibiotics in children at the population level.
