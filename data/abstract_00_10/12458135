The distribution of Enterobacter spp. within the population of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary was compared with the outpatient population with regard to molecular epidemiology and antibiotic resistance. Enterobacter spp. from 60 patients and one environmental site were characterised as ITU, non ITU and outpatients' isolates. Thirty-five percent were blood culture isolates. Cefotaxime resistant strains in the hospital were frequent. Cefotaxime (64%) sensitive isolates were inducible for hyperproduction of Bush group 1 beta-lactamase. Isolates were further investigated by PFGE. Isolates (27%) were clonally related and typed in four clusters. Consecutive isolates were studied in selected patients showing minor genomic changes. One environmental isolate from a deep sink at ITU was related to a patient's isolate.
