OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of drug resistance of biofilm escherichia coli. METHODS: The model of escherichia coli biofilm was established with the flat-board method. And the biofilm was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The beta-lactamase activities were quantitated, in escherichia coli, biofilm escherichia coli, biofilm escherichia coli induced by impenem or cefoxitin. RESULTS: The beta-lactamase activity of biofilm escherichia coli was 2.16 times as much as that of escherichia coli planctonically, and the beta-lactamase activities of biofilm escherichia coli induceded by impenem or cefoxitin were 1.30 and 1.05 times as much as those of biofilm escherichia coli, respectively. CONCLUSION: The drug resistance to antibiotics of biofilm escherichia coli was related to the production of beta-lactamase.
