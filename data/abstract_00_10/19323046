Acinetobacter spp is a known nosocomial pathogen causing a wide range of clinical diseases such as pneumonia, wound infection and bloodstream infections (BSI). The clinical outcomes of acinetobacter BSI were determined by a 1:1 case control study involving 58 confirmed cases of acinetobacter BSI who were compared to other gram-negative infections. The crude mortality of acinetobacter BSI was 47.2%, which was significantly greater than other gram-negative BSI (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.10-3.24) but there were no significant differences in attributed mortality between the two groups. We found that patients treated in intensive care units (ICU), who had longer ICU stays, who presented with shock or coagulopathy, had prior exposure to carbapenems, had mechanical ventilation, were on a ventilator for longer periods, had a nasogastric tube, had an arterial catheter or had parenteral nutrition at a significantly greater risk of mortality due to acinetobacter BSI. Patients presenting with septic shock (OR 17.95, 95% CI 3.36-95.84) or having a central venous catheter (OR 12.48, 95% CI 1.09-142.68) were independently at higher risk for mortality. Appropriateness of therapy reduced the mortality attributes of acinetobacter BSI (OR 0.197, 95% CI 0.040-0.967) but did not significantly reduce crude mortality in acinetobacter BSI patients. This study shows the importance of preventing acinetobacter BSI and the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents to reduce mortality.
