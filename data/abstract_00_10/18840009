Intravenous micafungin (Mycamine; Fungard), an echinocandin, inhibits the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an essential cell wall component in many fungi. It is approved in adults (focus of this review) and in neonates and paediatric patients (Pediatric Drugs [in press]) in the EU and elsewhere for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and oesophageal candidiasis, and as prophylactic treatment to prevent Candida infections in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.Intravenous micafungin shows very good activity against clinically relevant isolates of Candida spp. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profile of micafungin permits once-daily treatment and means that it is associated with relatively few drug-drug interactions. However, like all of the echinocandins and all formulations of amphotericin B, micafungin must be given intravenously. In large, well designed clinical trials in adult patients (>or=16 years of age) with invasive candidiasis, intravenous micafungin was shown to be noninferior to intravenous caspofungin or liposomal amphotericin B. In similarly designed trials in adult patients with oesophageal candidiasis, intravenous micafungin was shown to be noninferior to fluconazole or caspofungin treatment. As prophylactic treatment in adult and paediatric patients who had undergone HSCT, micafungin was superior to fluconazole therapy in a large, well designed trial. Micafungin was generally well tolerated by participants in these clinical trials. Furthermore, it was as well tolerated as caspofungin and fluconazole, and better tolerated than liposomal amphotericin B. The position of micafungin relative to newer antifungal therapies, such as anidulafungin, voriconazole and posaconazole, remains to be fully determined. Thus, micafungin is an emerging option for the treatment of adult patients with invasive or oesophageal candidiasis, and as prophylaxis against Candida infections in HSCT recipients.
