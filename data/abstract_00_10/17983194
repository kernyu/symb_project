OBJECTIVES: The emergence of gonococcal isolates with reduced susceptibility or resistance to antimicrobial agents is a significant concern in the whole world. This study is performed to evaluate evolution of antimicrobial resistance patterns of N. gonorrhoeae isolates from north-east Romania. METHODS: We studied antimicrobial resistance in 81 strains of N. gonorrhoeae isolated from Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinic in Iasi. The antimicrobial agents tested were Penicillin, Tetracycline, Ciprofloxacin, Cefixime, Ceftriaxone and Spectinomycin. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: As we expected, resistance to Penicillin, Tetracycline and Ciprofloxacin is high and can't no longer be recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea in our area; Ceftriaxone, Cefixime and Spectinomycin should be considered the antimicrobial of choice. We isolated a strain with modified sensitivity to Cefixime, a fact that we should be worry about.
