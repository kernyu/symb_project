Iseganan HCl is an antimicrobial peptide under development for the prevention of oral mucositis, a severe consequence of some chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens. Several attributes of iseganan make it an optimal candidate for study in this clinical situation where both local and systemic host defenses may be impaired. These include broad spectrum and rapid bactericidal activity, a lack of observed resistance and cross-resistance and stability in biological fluids. Clinical trials of patients receiving stomatotoxic chemotherapy followed by a haematopoietic stem cell transplant show iseganan reduces the occurrence of oral mucositis and ameliorates sequelae such as mouth pain, throat pain and difficulty swallowing. Iseganan is well-tolerated, which is partly attributable to a lack of systemic absorption following topical oral administration. Other promising areas of investigation include topical oral application for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia and nebulisation for treatment of chronic lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. Future studies will expand on the role of iseganan as a novel antimicrobial.
