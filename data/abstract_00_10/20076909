Between August 2006 and February 2007, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a massive outbreak of RGM infections after video laparoscopy was mainly associated to the recently described Mycobacterium massiliense species. All confirmed and probable cases reports described the use of high-level disinfection of medical devices by using 2% glutaraldehyde (2% GA) for 30 min before the surgical procedures. We investigated the susceptibility of the M. massiliense isolates recovered during the outbreak to high-level disinfection after 30 min, 1h, 6h and 10h of exposure to the commercial disinfectants. Reference strains for official mycobactericidal tests such as Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium neoaurum and Mycobacterium smegmatis were included as controls. Although all the reference strains were eliminated in 30 min of exposure to 2% GA, we observed the recovery of all M. massiliense clinical isolates even after 10h of exposure. This study suggests that failures in high-level disinfection and the high tolerance of these M. massiliense clinical strains to the 2% GA were strongly associated to the magnitude of the outbreak.
