Among the 162 Candida tropicalis isolates collected in the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts in 1999, 23 (14.2 %) had fluconazole MICs > or = 64 mg l(-1), and thus fulfilled the definition of resistance. Random amplified polymorphic DNA assay showed that all 23 fluconazole-resistance C. tropicalis isolates collected from different hospitals around Taiwan were closely related. Two distinct pulsotypes associated with fluconazole susceptibility were identified when these 23 resistant isolates, along with 13 susceptible ones, were analysed by PFGE.
