UNLABELLED: Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for 80% of human osteomyelitis. It can invade and persist within osteoblasts. Antibiotic resistant strains of S. aureus make successful treatment of osteomyelitis difficult. NULL HYPOTHESIS: antibiotic sensitivities of S. aureus do not change after exposure to the osteoblast intracellular environment. Human and mouse osteoblast cultures were infected and S. aureus cells were allowed to invade. Following times 0, 12, 24, and 48 h ( +/- the addition of erythromycin, clindamycin, and rifampin at times 0 or 12 h), the osteoblasts were lysed and intracellular bacteria enumerated. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on extracellular and intracellular S. aureus cells. In mouse osteoblasts, administration of bacteriostatic antibiotics at time 0 prevented the increase in intracellular S. aureus. If the antibiotics were delayed 12 h, this did not occur. When rifampin (bactericidal) was introduced at time 0 to human and mouse osteoblasts, there was a significant decrease in number of intracellular S. aureus within osteoblasts compared to control. If rifampin was delayed 12 h, this did not occur. Significant time-dependent S. aureus structural changes were observed after exposure to the osteoblast intracellular environment. These studies demonstrate that once S. aureus is established intracellularly for 12 h, the bacteria are less sensitive to antibiotics capable of eukaryotic cell penetration (statistically significant). These antibiotic sensitivity changes could be due in part to the observed structural changes. This leads to the rejection of our null hypotheses that the antibiotic sensitivities of S. aureus are unaltered by their location.
