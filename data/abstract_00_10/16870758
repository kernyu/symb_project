The in vitro activities of 22 antimicrobial agents, including ceftobiprole, daptomycin, and tigecycline, against 511 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from 112 Belgian hospitals were studied by using the CLSI agar dilution method. Isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis and by PCR detection of determinants of resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins, and tetracyclines. A representative set of isolates with different PFGE genotypes was further characterized by multilocus sequence typing, determination of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type, and multiplex PCR for toxic shock syndrome type 1 (TSST-1) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes. MRSA isolates belonged to nine epidemic MRSA clones, of which sequence type 45 (ST45)-SCCmec IV and ST8-SCCmec IV were predominant, accounting for 49 and 20% of isolates, respectively. The distribution of antimicrobial resistance and TSST-1 genes was strongly linked to clonal types. Ceftobiprole, daptomycin, and tigecycline showed high activity against all isolates of these sporadic and epidemic MRSA clones, as indicated by MIC(90)s of 2 mg/liter, 0.5 mg/liter, and 0.25 mg/liter, respectively. The MIC distribution of daptomycin and tigecycline was not different in isolates with decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides or tetracyclines, respectively. Ceftobiprole MICs were not correlated with oxacillin and cefoxitin MICs. These data indicate excellent activity of the newly developed agents ceftobiprole, daptomycin, and tigecycline against MRSA isolates recently recovered from hospitalized patients in Belgium, supporting their therapeutic potential for nosocomial MRSA infections.
