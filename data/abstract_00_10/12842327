Previous research showed that berberine-containing Berberis species synthesise the substances 5'-methoxyhydnocarpin-D (5'-MHC-D) and pheophorbide a, which have no antimicrobial activity but inhibit the expression of multidrug resistant efflux pumps (MDRs) in Staphylococcus aureus and potentiate the action of berberine. The MDR pumps extrude synthetic and natural antimicrobials from bacterial cells. We searched for these compounds in Berberis aetnensis C. Presl. (Berberidaceae), an endemic plant of the volcano Mount Etna. This work confirms the presence of pheophorbide a and permits us to hypothesise the presence of 5'-MHC-D in leaf extracts. In fact, the activity of ciprofloxacin was improved when two chromatographic fractions isolated from leaf extracts were added. These results are indicative of the presence of MDR pump inhibitors. Moreover, crude extracts were tested on several micro-organisms and showed antimicrobial activity mainly against Gram-positive bacteria and yeasts.
