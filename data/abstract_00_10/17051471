Enterobacteria produce elementary chromosomal enzymes, Beta-lactamases of class A: TEM and SHV (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae). These can give rise to plasmid-coded broad-spectrum Beta-lactamases (ESBL) discovered in 1980 (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae). The first cefotaximase (CTX-M, MEN-1) was reported in Europe in 1990. This enzyme is far more active against cefotaxime than against ceftazidime and aztreonam. Chromosomal hyperpoduction of K1 Beta-lactamase differs from all other ESBLs due its sensitivity to ceftazidime (Klebsiella oxytoca). However, not all enterobacteria are resistant only because of ESBLs, but also as a result of the action of chromosomally or plasmid coded AmpC Beta-lactamase of class C (MIR-1, CMY-1, BIL-1, FOX-1, MOX-1, DHA-1, ACC-1), resistant to Beta-lactamase inhibitors and to cefoxitin (Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Morganelle spp., Serratia spp.). With the loss of outside-membrane porins (OMP) they can become resistant to carbapenem an tibiotics. The 100% resistance of enterobacteria to carbapenems that so far exists in this country is elsewhere in the world compromised by the incidence of carbapenem-hydrolysing plasmid-determined Beta-lactamase of class B (IMP-1, VIM-1) and of class A (KPC-1) in K. pneumoniae, (SME-1) in Serratia marcescens and (IMI-1, NMC-A) in E. clocae. Carbapenemases in enterobacteria are only effective in the presence of impermeability and other resistance mechanisms.
