The Mycobacterium tuberculosis mmpL7 gene, encoding a hypothetical resistance nodulation division transporter, confers a high resistance level to isoniazid when overexpressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis. The resistance level decreased in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitors reserpine and CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone). Energy-dependent efflux of isoniazid from M. smegmatis cells expressing the mmpL7 gene was observed.
