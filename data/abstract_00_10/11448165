We examined the influence on the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway of infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain VR3. Data from reporter gene assays showed that expression of both type I and type II IFN-inducible genes was dramatically suppressed during the early stage of HSV-1 infection (2 to 3 h postinfection). During these periods, phosphorylation levels of janus kinases (JAKs) and STATs did not increase after treatment of HSV-1-infected FL cells with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, although cellular protein levels of the JAKs and the STATs were not significantly changed. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of HSV-1 on phosphorylation of STAT1 was not observed in U937 cells, which show resistance to steady-state accumulation of RNA for HSV-1 immediate-early genes. The phosphorylation of STAT1 in FL cells was not inhibited by infection with a UV-inactivated virus. These results indicate that viral gene expression or viral protein production is necessary for the inhibition of phosphorylation by HSV-1.
