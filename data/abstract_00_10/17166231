A cadmium-resistant bacterium Pseudomonas putida CD2 was isolated from sewage sludge samples. Strain CD2 exhibited high maximal tolerant concentrations (MTC) for a large spectrum of divalent metals. Screening a library obtained using Tn5-B21 insertion mutagenesis resulted in identification of 12 mutants with a substantial decrease in resistance to 3 mM cadmium. The DNA sequences of the contiguous region from the Tn5 insertion sites were determined by inverse PCR. Six genes involved in cadmium resistance were identified. These genes were from three gene clusters: czcCBA1, cadA2R and colRS. The homologs of the first two gene clusters were predicted to be metal efflux systems, whereas the products of colRS, ColR and ColS, were thought to be a two-component signal transduction (TCST) system. In this study, we have demonstrated that ColRS also function in regulating multi-metal resistance using genetic complementation.
