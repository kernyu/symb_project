GacS and GacA proteins form a two component signal transduction system in bacteria. Here, Tn5 transposon gacS and gacA (Gac) mutants of Pseudomonas sp. KL28, an alkylphenol degrader, were isolated by selecting for smooth colonies of strain KL28. The mutants exhibited reduced ability to migrate on a solid surface. This surface motility does not require the action of flagella unlike the well-studied swarming motility of other Pseudomonas sp. The Gac mutants also showed reduced levels of biofilm and pellicle formation in liquid culture. In addition, compared to the wild type KL28 strain, these mutants were more resistant to high concentrations of m-cresol but were more sensitive to H2O2, which are characteristics that they share with an rpoS mutant. These results indicate that the Gac regulatory cascade in strain KL28 positively controls wrinkling morphology, biofilm formation, surface translocation and H2O2 resistance, which are important traits for its capacity to survive in particular niches.
