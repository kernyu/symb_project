The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ultrasonic vibration on the force required to remove prefabricated posts. Ninety-six extracted human canines were divided into eight groups, which were prepared and obturated with gutta-percha and either a eugenol-containing (Roth's 801 Elite) or eugenol-free (AH26) sealer. Titanium #6 Parapost XH posts were cemented with either zinc phosphate or Panavia 21 resin cement. One half of the sample was subjected to ultrasonic vibration for 16 min at the post-dentin interface, whereas the other half received no vibration (controls). Each combination of sealer, cement, and vibration status was subjected to tensile load to failure using an Instron testing machine. Posts cemented in teeth obturated with gutta-percha and AH26 sealer demonstrated significantly greater resistance to dislodgement, compared with teeth obturated with gutta-percha and Roth's 801 Elite sealer. There was no statistical difference in retention of posts cemented with either zinc phosphate or Panavia 21, regardless of the sealer used. Additionally ultrasonic vibration increased post retention for both cements.
