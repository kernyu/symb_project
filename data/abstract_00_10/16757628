We evaluated the incidence of Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae in clinical isolates by phenotypic methods and DNA-DNA hybridization. The pathogenic role of this organism was investigated with the mouse peritonitis/sepsis model. Our results show a low incidence (1/120 pneumococcal isolates) and a potential pathogenic effect for S. pseudopneumoniae.
