Phage endolysin targets the integrate cell wall and attack bonds in the peptidoglycan, resulting in degradation of bacteria. It features two or three domain structures, involving one or two catalytic domains and one binding domain. Endolysin is a promising antibiotic agent against gram-positive bacteria pathogen, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Compared to antibiotics, it is more specific and tested bacteria show no resistance to lysin. Therefore, it's a feasible measure for solving drug resistant problem. Beyond this, it is highly active and rapid lysis efficiency and has synergy effect when used together or with other antibiotics. Antibody against endolysin will not neutralize its activity. So endolysin treatment may be a new approach for preventing and controlling of bacteria pathogen.
