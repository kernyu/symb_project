OBJECTIVES: In order to identify possible drug delivery systems against resistant bone infection, we determined the release of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) human lactoferrin 1-11 (hLF1-11) from commercially available bone substitutes. METHODS: We combined six calcium phosphate cements and six granule-types with 5 mg/g hLF1-11 and measured its availability and release in vitro from cements (7 days) and granules (3 days). The integrity and antimicrobial activity of the hLF1-11 that was released during the first 24 h were measured, using mass spectrometry, and a killing assay on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). RESULTS: Most of the cements showed burst release followed by low-level continuous release, whereas the coated granules showed high burst release for 24 h. After release the peptide was active (in nine of 12 materials) and intact. CONCLUSIONS: Different release profiles may be obtained by choosing the appropriate carrier, which supports the feasibility of biodegradable carriers releasing AMPs against resistant infections.
