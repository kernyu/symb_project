Celgosivir, in development by MIGENIX Inc for the treatment of HCV infection, is an oral prodrug of the natural product castanospermine that inhibits alpha-glucosidase I, an enzyme that plays a critical role in viral maturation by initiating the processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides of viral envelope glycoproteins. Celgosivir is well absorbed in vitro and in vivo, and is rapidly converted to castanospermine. Celgosivir has a novel mechanism of action (ie, host-directed glycosylation), and demonstrates broad antiviral activity in vitro. The agent is not efficient as a monotherapy for the treatment of HCV, but has demonstrated a synergistic effect in combination with the current standard of care, PEGylated IFNalpha2b plus ribavirin, both in vitro and in phase II clinical trials. At the time of publication, a phase II trial was underway to investigate the safety, tolerability and antiviral effect of celgosivir in combination with PEGylated IFNalpha2b plus ribavirin for up to 1 year in patients with chronic HCV infection. Celgosivir may prove to be a valuable component for combination therapy and may help to prevent the apparition of drug resistance. Long-term toxicity studies are necessary to confirm the safety of this novel drug in humans.
