OBJECTIVE: To investigate drug-resistant genes associated with beta-lactams and aminoglycosides in clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: Twenty strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from wound excretion of hospitalized burn patients. The strains resistant to 14 antibiotics were selected for detection of 16 kind of drug-resistant genes (TEM, SHV, OXA-10 cluster, PER, VEB, GES, CARB, CTX-M- I, IMP, VIM, SPM, GIM, DHA, MOX, FOX, oprD2) and 6 kind of aminoglycoside modification genes (aac(3)- I, aac(3)-II, aac(6')-I, aac(6')-II, ant (3")- I , ant(2")- I) in them by PCR. RESULTS: Among the 20 strains resistant to beta-lactam , all of them were TEM and GES positive (100%), oprD2 gene depletion in 5 strains (25%). All other genes were negative. Among aminoglycoside resistant genes, 20 strains were aac (6') - I positive (100%), 7 were ant (2") - I positive (35%), and negative for other stains. CONCLUSION: There were very high existence rates of TEM, GES and aac (6')- I genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from clinical burn patients. The fact that GES-5 gene has also been detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting this organism is highly drug resistant in our burn unit.
