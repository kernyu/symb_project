Otitis media (OM) is the accumulation of fluids in the middle ear, with or without symptoms of inflammation. The infection is caused by dysfunction or obstruction of the eustachian tube and is most commonly diagnosed in children under the age of two. The microbiology of OM differs, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis the most commonly isolated pathogens. The emergence of penicillin-resistant Strep. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-producing strains, Haem. influenzae and Mor. catarrhalis is a major concern and health care costs associated with treatment are substantial, especially in cases of unresponsive treatment as a result of incorrect diagnosis. Alternative treatments such as vaccines and a nasal spray containing alpha-haemolytic streptococci with antimicrobial activity against OM pathogens, have been developed. The rationale behind such treatments is to induce an appropriate immune response against the pathogens and decrease bacterial colonisation in the nasopharynx. Another approach may be treatment with bacteriocins (natural antimicrobial peptides) or bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) produced by lactic acid bacteria. We have recently described an antibacterial peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA and have published on bacteriocins (enterocins) with antibacterial and antiviral activity. This review discusses the condition OM, summarises current methods used to treat the infection, and suggests alternative safe and natural treatments that need to be explored.
