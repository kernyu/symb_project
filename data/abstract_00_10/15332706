The new quinolone moxifloxacin was tested against 86 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis including 13 resistant and 4 multiresistant strains. The antimicrobial susceptibility was tested, in parallel, using two different liquid media, the radiometric Bactec 12B and the Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (Becton Dickinson, USA). All strains but two were susceptible at 0.5 microg/ml of moxifloxacin; for the remaining two strains, both multidrugresistant, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were =2 and >4 microg/ml respectively. Our data confirm the high antitubercular in vitro activity of moxifloxacin.
