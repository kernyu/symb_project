The present study was undertaken to compare the changing trends of antibiograms of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A isolates. A total of 80 isolates of salmonella obtained from blood cultures between 2001-2004 were included in the study. Identification and antibiotic sensitivities of the isolates were performed by using mini API (bio Merieux, France). Sixty isolates were identified as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and 20 were identified as Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A. More than 67% of S.typhi and 80% of S.paratyphi A isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol. Sensitivity of S.typhi isolates to cephalosporins was found to have increased from 2001-2004 while that of S.paratyphi A showed a decline. With increasing resistance to ciprofloxacin and the possibility of re-emergence of sensitivity to chloramphenicol, the policy of empirical treatment of enteric fever needs to be rationalized.
