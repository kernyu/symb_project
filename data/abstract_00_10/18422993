TP73 encodes for two proteins: full-length TAp73 and DeltaNp73, which have little transcriptional activity and exert dominant-negative function towards TP53 and TAp73. We compared TATP73 and DeltaNTP73 expression in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples and normal CD34(+) progenitors. Both forms were more highly expressed in leukaemic cells. Amongst AML blasts, TATP73 was more expressed in AML harbouring the recurrent genetic abnormalities (RGA): PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11, whereas higher DeltaNTP73 expression was detected in non-RGA cases. TP53 expression did not vary according to DeltaNTP73/TATP73 expression ratio. Leukaemic cells with higher DeltaNTP73/TATP73 ratios were significantly more resistant to cytarabine-induced apoptosis.
