The impact of HIV infection on clinical presentation and outcome of tuberculosis (TB) was studied in children hospitalised at the Brooklyn Hospital for Chest Diseases (BCH), Cape Town over the 2-year period January 1998 to December 1999. Clinical data were extracted from a prospectively compiled patient register. Of 261 children with TB, 114 (median age 24 mths) were not HIV-infected and 36 (median age 23 mths) were HIV-infected. The HIV status of 111 children (median age 37 mths) was not determined. Pulmonary TB with or without extrapulmonary TB occurred in 97 (85%) children who were not HIV-infected, 35 (97%) HIV-infected children and 87 (78%) of those not tested (p = 0.025). A tuberculin reaction > or = 15 mm was elicited in ten (31%) of 32 HIV-infected children, 76 (72%) of 106 non-HIV-infected and 62 (71%) of those not tested (p < 0.001). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 116 (49%) of 238 children and drug sensitivity was evaluated in 79. Nine isolates (11%) were resistant to isoniazid (INH) and 11 (14%) to INH and rifampicin (RMP). Two HIV-infected children treated previously in BCH for drug-sensitive TB were re-admitted with INH and RMP resistance. Two (2%) non-HIV-infected children, six (17%) HIV-infected children and one (1%) child with undetermined HIV status died (p < 0.001).
