A robust screen for compound interaction with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has some obvious requirements, such as a cell line expressing P-gp and a probe substrate that is transported solely by P-gp and passive permeability. It is actually difficult to prove that a particular probe substrate interacts only with P-gp in the chosen cell line. Using a confluent monolayer of MDCKII-hMDR1 cells, we have determined the elementary rate constants for the P-gp efflux of amprenavir, digoxin, loperamide, and quinidine. For amprenavir and quinidine, transport was fitted with just P-gp and passive permeability. For digoxin and loperamide, fitting required a basolateral transporter (p < 0.01), which was inhibited by the P-gp inhibitor N-(4-[2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-isoquinolinyl)ethyl]-phenyl)-9,10-dih ydro-5-methoxy-9-oxo-4-acridine carboxamide (GF120918). This means that when digoxin is used as a probe substrate and a compound is shown to inhibit digoxin flux, it could be that the inhibition occurs at the basolateral transporter rather than at P-gp. Digoxin basolateral>apical efflux also required an apical importer (p < 0.05). We propose that amprenavir and quinidine are robust probe substrates for assessing P-gp interactions using the MDCKII-hMDR1 confluent cell monolayer. Usage of another cell line, e.g., LLC-hMDR1 or Caco-2, would require the same kinetic validation to ensure that the probe substrate interacts only with P-gp. Attempts to identify the additional digoxin and loperamide transporters using a wide range of substrates/inhibitors of known epithelial transporters (organic cation transporters, organic anion transporters, organic ion-transporting polypeptide, uric acid transporter, or multidrug resistance-associated protein) failed to inhibit the digoxin or loperamide transport through their basolateral transporter.
