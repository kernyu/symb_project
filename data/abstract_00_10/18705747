Endothelium plays a crucial role in the regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis through the release of vasoactive factors. Besides nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, increasing evidences show that endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF) participate in the control of vasomotor tone through the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels. In humans, the role of EDHF has been demonstrated in various vascular beds including coronary, peripheral, skin and venous vessels. The mechanisms of EDHF-type relaxations identified in humans involved the release by the endothelium of hydrogen peroxide, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), potassium ions and electronical communication through the gap junctions. The role of EETs could be particularly important because, in addition contributing to the maintenance of the basal tone and endothelium-dependent dilation of conduit arteries, these factors share many vascular protective properties of NO. The alteration of which might be involved in the physiopathology of cardiovascular diseases. The evolution of EDHF availability in human pathology is currently under investigation with some results demonstrating an increase in EDHF release to compensate the loss of NO synthesis and to maintain the endothelial vasomotor function whereas others reported a parallel decrease in NO and EDHF-mediated relaxations. Thus, the modulation of EDHF activity emerges as a new pharmacological target and some existing therapies in particular those affecting the renin-angiotensin system have already been shown to improve endothelial function through hyperpolarizing mechanisms. In this context, the development of new specific pharmacological agents especially those increasing EETs availability may help to prevent endothelial dysfunction and therefore enhance cardiovascular protection in patients.
