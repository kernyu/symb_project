Sow milk protects the piglet against infectious diseases through a variety of mechanisms. In this study, the presence of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in this biological fluid was investigated. Milk samples were obtained from 8 sows and a total of 19 rod-shaped isolates were selected for identification and assessment of their probiotic potential. RAPD profiling revealed the existence of 8 different genetic profiles among them. One representative of each profile was selected for further characterization and they were identified as Lactobacillus reuteri, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. paraplantarum, Lb. brevis and Weissella paramesenteroides. Then, their probiotic potential was evaluated through different assays, including survival in conditions simulating those existing in the gastrointestinal tract, production of antimicrobial compounds, adherence to intestinal mucin, production of biogenic amines, degradation of mucin, and pattern of antibiotic sensitivity. Three strains, Lb. reuteri CR20 (a reuterin-producing strain), Lb. salivarius CELA2 (a bacteriocin-producing strain) and Lb. paraplantarum CLB7 displayed the highest probiotic potential.
