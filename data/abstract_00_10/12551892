The Smr family of multidrug transporters consists of small membrane proteins that extrude various drugs in exchange with protons rendering cells resistant to these drugs. Smr proteins identified to date have been found only in Eubacteria. In this work we present the cloning and characterization of an Smr protein from the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum, the first Smr in the archaeal kingdom. The protein, named Hsmr, was identified through sequence similarity to the Smr family, and the DNA sequence was cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system. Hsmr is heterologously expressed in a functional form despite the difference in lipid composition of the membrane and the lower salt in the cell and its environment. Cells harboring the Hsmr plasmid transport ethidium bromide in an uncoupler-sensitive process and gain resistance to ethidium bromide and acriflavine. Hsmr binds tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP(+)) with a relatively low affinity (K(D) approximately 200 nm) at low salt concentration that increases (K(D) approximately 40 nm) upon the addition of 2 m of either NaCl or KCl. The Hsmr protein contains many of the signature sequence elements of the Smr family and also a high content of negative residues in the loops, characteristic of extreme halophiles. Strikingly, Hsmr is composed of over 40% valine and alanine residues. These residues are clustered at certain regions of the protein in domains that are not important for activity, as judged from lack of conservation and from previous studies with other Smr proteins. We suggest that this high content of alanine and valine residues is a reflection of a "natural" alanine and valine scanning necessitated by the high GC content of the gene. This phenomenon reveals significant sequence elements in small multidrug transporters.
