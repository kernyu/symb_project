OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infections after liver transplantation, and to analyze the antibiotic susceptibility to major pathogens. METHODS: A retrospective survey was conducted to 292 patients who underwent liver transplantation in the period of January 2004 and September 2006. With MicroScan Walkaway- 40 Automatic System, the non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infection was analyzed for the identification of pathogens and susceptibility to drugs. RESULTS: Non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli infection was identified in 33. 9% of 292 patients after liver transplantation. A total of 99 non-duplicate strains were isolated. The infection was frequently identified from respiratory tract, biliary tract, blood stream and intra-abdominal cavity. The top 3 pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Those non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were usually resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: The non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli of postoperative infections in liver transplantation recipients are mostly multi-drug resistant. The microbiological surveillance is important for guiding clinical therapy.
