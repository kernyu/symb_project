Nevirapine and other members of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) family of anti-HIV-1 drugs are essential components of antiretroviral treatment regimens. Unfortunately, drug resistance has become an important issue with respect to all therapeutic targets in HIV-1. This paper summarizes current knowledge about the mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV-1 that are responsible for drug resistance and the mechanisms whereby drug resistance develops.
