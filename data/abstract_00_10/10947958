P-Glycoprotein transporters encoded by mdr1 (multidrug resistance) genes mediate extrusion of an array of lipophilic xenobiotics from the cell. In rat liver, mdr transcripts have been shown to be expressed mainly in hepatocytes of the periportal region. Since gradients in oxygen tension (pO(2)) may contribute towards zonated gene expression, the influence of arterial and venous pO(2) on mRNA expression of the mdr1b isoform was examined in primary rat hepatocytes cultured for up to 3 days. Maximal mdr1b mRNA levels (100%) were observed under arterial pO(2) after 72 h, whereas less than half-maximal mRNA levels (40%) were attained under venous pO(2). Accordingly, expression of mdr protein and extrusion of the mdr1 substrate rhodamine 123 were maximal under arterial pO(2) and reduced under venous pO(2). Oxygen-dependent modulation of mdr1b mRNA expression was prevented by actinomycin D, indicating transcriptional regulation. Inhibition of haem synthesis by 25 microM CoCl(2) blocked mdr1b mRNA expression under both oxygen tensions, whereas 80 microM desferrioxamine abolished modulation by O(2). Haem (10 microM) increased mdr1b mRNA levels under arterial and venous pO(2). In hepatocytes treated with 50 microM H(2)O(2), mdr1b mRNA expression was elevated by about 1.6-fold at venous pO(2) and 1.5-fold at arterial pO(2). These results support the conclusion that haem proteins are crucial for modulation of mdr1b mRNA expression by O(2) in hepatocyte cultures and that reactive oxygen species may participate in O(2)-dependent signal transduction. Furthermore, the present study suggests that oxygen might be a critical modulator for zonated secretion of mdr1 substrates into the bile.
