A multidrug resistance gene, cfr, and a phenicol resistance gene, fexA, were detected in a Bacillus strain, BS-01, isolated from swine feces. The cfr gene was carried on a novel 16.5-kb plasmid, designated pBS-01. A complete Tn917 structure, which harbors the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance gene erm(B), was located downstream of the cfr gene. The fexA gene was discovered in the chromosomal DNA of the BS-01 strain and identified in a Tn558 variant.
