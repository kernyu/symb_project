In this study we described the nanocomposites films of specially synthesized inorganic Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles and polyoxocation Al(13) Keggin ions that possess the excellent sensing activities. Film fabrication using layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technique was followed by electrochemical characterization. The assembled multilayer Al(13)/PB films as sensor devices for both the catalytic reduction of H(2)O(2) and detecting the change of relative humidity were also investigated. The sensitivity of the biosensor was 0.886 mA cm(-2)mM(-1), and about two orders of magnitude change in resistance was observed as the relative humidity increasing from 5 to 95%. Both sensors exhibited good reproducibility, wide linear range. The performance and multifunctional abilities of these nanocomposites promise potential applications in biosensors, environmental controlling system and biomedical devices.
