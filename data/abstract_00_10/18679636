Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in critical care medicine and has been shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality. However, ventilator induced lung injury itself is probably only a minor factor predisposing to VAP. In contrast, invasive ventilation using an endotracheal tube is obviously a more important measure. Thus, microaspiration of potentially infectious secretion from the oropharynx into the trachea along the tube has been suggested to be the most critical pathophysiological event in the process of VAP development. Accordingly, non-invasive ventilation provides a decreased risk of VAP. Therefore, all measures aimed at averting microaspiration or shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation are appropriate to prevent VAP. Moreover, oropharyngeal decontamination may be helpful by reducing bacterial colonisation. Effectiveness of therapy depends on early treatment and therefore requires early diagnosis. With this aim combined clinical, radiologic, and microbiological parameters should be taken into account. Adequate antimicrobial therapy in due consideration for individual risk factors and local antibiotic resistance is the most important therapeutic measure.
