The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in children followed at Hacettepe University Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital. Sixty cases with tuberculosis for whom susceptibility testing was available were searched retrospectively. Teh overall drug resistance was 26.7 percent. Resistance to streptomycin (sm) was the most frequent (18.3%), followed by isoniazid (6.7%), rifampicin (6.5%), and ethambutol (4.2%). Strain resistant to more than one drug was present in two cases (3.3%). In summary, excluding SM, both single and multidrug resistance were relatively low in our pediatric patients.
