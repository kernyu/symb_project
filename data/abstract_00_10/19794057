The prevalence of the currently known Acinetobacter species and related trends of antimicrobial resistance in a Dutch university hospital were studied. Between 1999 and 2006, Acinetobacter isolates from clinical samples were collected prospectively. Isolates were analyzed by amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting. For species identification, a profile similarity cutoff level of 50% was used, and for strain identification, a cutoff level of 90% was used. Susceptibility for antimicrobial agents was tested by disk diffusion by following the CLSI guideline. The incidences of Acinetobacter isolates ranged from 1.7 to 3.7 per 10,000 patients per year, without a trend of increase, during the study years. Twenty different species were distinguished. Acinetobacter baumannii (27%) and Acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 3 (26%) were the most prevalent. Other species seen relatively frequently were Acinetobacter lwoffii (11%), Acinetobacter ursingii (4%), Acinetobacter johnsonii (4%), and Acinetobacter junii (3%). One large cluster of A. baumannii, involving 31 patients, and 16 smaller clusters of various species, involving in total 39 patients, with at most 5 patients in 1 cluster, occurred. Overall, 37% of the A. baumannii isolates were fully susceptible to the tested antibiotics. There was a borderline significant (P = 0.059) trend of decreasing susceptibility. A. baumannii was the Acinetobacter species causing the largest burden of multiple-antibiotic resistance and transmissions in the hospital.
