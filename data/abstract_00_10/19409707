This study compared the use of targeted selective treatment (TST) with systematic whole-flock treatments in 38 dairy sheep and goat farms in Greece. Criteria for individual treatments were either parasitological (nematode faecal egg count) or performance-based (body condition score or milk yield). The possible effect of treatment on resistance to benzimidazole anthelmintics was assessed using the Egg Hatch Test. Mean faecal egg counts decreased during the 12-month experimental period in all groups, and were lowest in the TST group treated according to faecal egg count (P<0.05). The number of sheep and goats treated by TST was reduced compared with systematic treatments. Mean thiabendazole-egg death dose(50) (TBZ-ED(50)) values from all groups were similar at the beginning and end of the study (P>0.05), but significant variation in TBZ-ED(50) was noted over the study period in systematically treated goats (P=0.045). Third stage larvae belonging to the genera Teladorsagia, Trichostrongylus and Haemonchus were dominant throughout the experimental period in all flocks. It was concluded that the use of targeted selective treatment reduced the number of anthelmintic treatments to achieve a similar level of parasite control or animal production and may offer a viable option to combine animal production with effective parasite control in Greece.
