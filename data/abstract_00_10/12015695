Linezolid, the first available member of a new antibiotic class, the oxazolidinones, is broadly active against gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains. In this randomized, open-label trial, hospitalized adults with known or suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were treated with linezolid (600 mg twice daily; n=240) or vancomycin (1 g twice daily; n=220) for 7-28 days. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of patients; 93% of these isolates were MRSA. Skin and soft-tissue infection was the most common diagnosis, followed by pneumonia and urinary tract infection. At the test-of-cure visit (15-21 days after the end of therapy), among evaluable patients with MRSA, there was no statistical difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to clinical cure rates (73.2% of patients in the linezolid group and 73.1% in the vancomycin group) or microbiological success rates (58.9% in the linezolid group and 63.2% in the vancomycin group). Both regimens were well tolerated, with similar rates of adverse events.
