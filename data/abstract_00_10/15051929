Clarithromycin has been administered to patients in Japan since 1991. Clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori strains have been on the rise in Japan. We obtained H. pylori isolates between 1989 and 2000 and examined mutations of the 23S rRNA gene, which are closely associated with clarithromycin resistance. Isolates were obtained from 356 patients with H. pylori infection treated at the Hiroshima University. Sixty-one of the patients received clarithromycin-based H. pylori eradication therapy. Mutations of the 23S rRNA gene were examined by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by sequencing analysis. Mutant strains were found in 42 of the 356 patients (11.8%). The prevalence of mutant strains increased from 0 to 20.4% during the 12-year study period. The prevalence increased to more than 10% by 1995 and then to more 20% after 1999. The H. pylori eradication rate was significantly higher in patients with wild-type strains than in patients with mutant strains (72.0 vs. 36.4%, p = 0.024). Our data indicate that clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains have increased rapidly since 1995 and that the effectiveness of clarithromycin-based H. pylori eradication therapies may soon be compromised. Other new therapies may be necessary as first-line treatments in Japan.
