Calli from two cotton cultivars susceptible and resistant to Verticillium wilt, were treated with a crude toxin of Verticillium dahliae (VD-toxin) plus salicylic acid (SA). Cells treated with VD-toxin showed distinct ultrastructural changes. Cells from the susceptible cultivar displayed damage to plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The deleterious effect on cells of the resistant cultivar, with an accumulation of electron-dense precipitate in the vacuoles, was less noticeable. Exogenous SA protected callus cells from VD-toxin. We also report the localization of beta-1,3-glucanase in callus cells with immunofluorescence Labeling. Stronger fluorescence was observed in the extracellular space in resistant than in susceptible cotton; strongest in resistant cotton after 5 days of treatment with VD-toxin plus SA. The findings reported here indicate an important role of exogenous salicylic acid in the induction of resistance to VD-toxin in cotton. Coupled with an increase in beta-1,3-glucanase, cellular integrity is maintained and damage to cell wall and plasma membrane is avoided.
