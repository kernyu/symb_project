Praziquantel became available for the treatment of schistosomiasis and other trematode-inflicted diseases in the 1970s. It was revolutionary because it could be administered orally and had very few unwanted side effects. As a result of marked reductions in the price of praziquantel, the rate at which it is used has accelerated greatly in recent years. For the foreseeable future it will be the mainstay of programs designed to control schistosome-induced morbidity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where schistosomiasis is heavily endemic. There is currently no evidence to suggest that any schistosomes have developed resistance to praziquantel as a result of its widespread use. Nevertheless, while resistance may not pose an obvious or immediate threat to the usefulness of praziquantel, complacency and a failure to monitor developments may have serious consequences in the longer term since it will be the only drug that is readily available for large-scale treatment of schistosomiasis.
