The genus Salmonella is composed of more than 2,400 serotypes, many of which cause enteric diseases in humans and animals. Several Salmonella serotypes are multidrug resistant, and there is evidence of the clonal spread of these strains from animals to humans. Salmonella enterica serotype Newport is one of the serotypes that increasingly present a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Source tracking and antibiotic resistance testing are important considerations for identifying the outbreak strain. The first goal of this study was to examine the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of clinical and environmental Salmonella Newport isolates from various geographic locations and to compare the discriminatory ability of two DNA fingerprinting techniques. The second goal was to determine whether the antibiotic resistance profiles and typing patterns correlated. Thirty Salmonella Newport isolates, including environmental and human clinical strains, were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), ribotyping, and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Eighty percent of the isolates showed total or intermediate resistance to one or more drugs; 75% of the isolates were multidrug resistant. Ribotyping with the EcoRI enzyme and PFGE with the XbaI enzyme each divided the isolates into 14 groups. Cluster analysis based on antibiotic susceptibility patterns generated 23 profiles. The susceptible and resistant isolates were not differentiated on the basis of either of the molecular typing techniques. Hence, no correlation was observed between the antibiotic resistance profiles and the DNA subtyping patterns. In conclusion, ribotyping is as discriminatory as PFGE and, when used in combination with antibiotic resistance profiles, provides a powerful tool for the source tracking of Salmonella Newport.
