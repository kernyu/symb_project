A potential way to improve the results obtained with the standard carboplatin/cisplatin (CDDP)-paclitaxel treatment regimen in advanced ovarian cancer is to incorporate a modulating agent such as lonidamine (LND). In fact, LND has been shown to revert the resistance to cisplatin and to potentiate cisplatin activity experimental models and in clinical studies. 35 consecutive patients with advanced ovarian cancer, not previously treated with chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel at a dose of 135 mg/m(2) intravenously (i.v.) on day 1 (in a 3 h infusion) and cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) iv on day 2 plus LND orally (p.o.) at a dose of 450 mg/die for 6 consecutive days starting two days before chemotherapy, every 3 weeks for six cycles. Complete plus partial responses were observed in 8 (80%) out of the 10 women with measurable disease. In the 25 patients with evaluable disease, only four clinical progressions were observed (16%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 28.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 22.2-34.8) and 46.5 (95% CI 32.4-60.00) months respectively. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was observed in 9 (26%) patients. Alopecia, nausea and vomiting (Grade 3) were observed in 33 (94%) and 5 (14%) patients, respectively. In conclusion, the combination of CDDP/paclitaxel plus LND is active and tolerable in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
