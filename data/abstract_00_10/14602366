Results of antimicrobial sensitivity tests for strains of Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A isolated from patients in ten European countries between 1999 and 2001 have been transferred electronically to the Enter-net surveillance hub. For Typhi between 22 and 29% of isolates were multiresistant (to four drugs or more) with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC 0.25-1.0 mg/l) increasing from 20% in 1999 to 26% in 2001. Nineteen of 169 (11%) strains with decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility were sensitive to nalidixic acid. For Paratyphi A multiple resistance increased from 9% in 1999 to 25% in 2001 and decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility from 6 to 17%. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of treatment failures when fluoroquinolones are used as the first-line drug for infections with Typhi and Paratyphi A, particularly for patients recently returning from areas where drug-resistant strains are endemic.
