We report the development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a patient treated for acute myeloid leukaemia during empirical voriconazole therapy for febrile neutropenia. The patient failed to respond to the institution of salvage combination therapy with amphotericin B and voriconazole, but survived after adjunctive surgical resection.
