The increase in the incidence of fungal infections and the emergence of resistance call for the development of techniques for measuring in vitro antifungal susceptibility that are useful for predicting clinical outcome in patients suffering from these infections. In the past, the lack of standardized testing techniques led to poor intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility. Recently, the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) has developed a reference method for antifungal susceptibility testing, document M27A. This document is a necessary and important step towards the standardization of antifungal susceptibility testing, which has important implications in the analysis of clinical and microbiological data. This article provides a comprehensive review of studies correlating in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing and clinical outcome. In general, it is possible to predict the therapeutic outcome, especially in HIV infected patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis treated with fluconazole. However, in other more heterogeneous groups of patients it is more difficult to correlate the in vitro and in vivo data.
