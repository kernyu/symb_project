PURPOSE: Evaluation of rifampicin-resistance by the line probe assay, for rifampicin-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains which were classified as rifampicin-resistant by the phenotypic drug susceptibility testings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15 clinical isolates from NHO Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center consisting of 6 rifampicin-resistant strains by the line probe assay despite susceptible result by the drug susceptibility testings, and 9 clinical isolates which showed the fluctuating results on repeated drug susceptibility testings. After we conducted 3 drug susceptibility testings and the line probe assay, we have examined the sequence analysis for confirming mutations in the rpoB gene. RESULTS: All strains were determined rifampicin-susceptible or intermediate by the drug susceptibility testings with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) which ranged from 0.25 to 4 microg/ml by BrothMIC MTB-1, whereas these isolates indicated rifampicin-resistance by the line probe assay and revealed mutations in the hot-spot region (69 bp) by the sequence analysis. CONCLUSION: We verified that the line probe assay might be useful for the correct determination of drug susceptibility, especially about the low-level rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis strains.
