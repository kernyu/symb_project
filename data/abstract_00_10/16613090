UNLABELLED: To study prevalence of polyresistance (PR) among the strains of Helicobacter pylori isolated from patients with chronic gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcer and gastric cancer in Georgia. Material and methods. Biopsies of gastric mucosa and resection material were studied in 206patients with gastroduodenal zone diseases for identification of H. pylori (HP) and PR strains of HP. Results. The number of antibiotics involved in development of polyresistant strains varies from 3 to 8. The greatest number of strains (28.57 +/- 1.06%) develop PR to 5 antibiotics, the least--to 8 antibiotics. CONCLUSION: PR prevalence among HP strains is 35.25 +/- 4.05%. PR is most frequently seen to metronidasol and oxacilline, least frequently--to amoxicilline and clarithromycin.
