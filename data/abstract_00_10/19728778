Antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) are described around the world. The present national surveillance study report analyzes more than 6000 Sp strains, isolated from adults across France in 2001 and 2003, from blood cultures (3086 in 2001 and 3164 in 2003), cerebrospinal fluid (respectively, 238 and 240), or middle ear fluid (respectively, 110 and 100). The proportion of isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillin fell significantly between 2001 and 2003 from 46.5% to 43.9%. The proportion of high-level resistant strains to penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC > 1 mg/L), amoxicillin, and cefotaxime (MIC > 2 mg/L) slightly decreased but remained low: 10.6%, 1.2%, and 0.2% in 2003. Resistance to other antibiotics (erythromycin, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol) also decreased. Decrease in prevalence of penicillin-resistant Sp varied according to specimen source. The proportion of penicillin nonsusceptible pneumococci decreased in blood cultures and middle ear fluids between 2001 and 2003 but increased in cerebrospinal fluid (43.4% and 46.5%, respectively). Serotypes covered by the heptavalent vaccine accounted for 42.4% of all isolates recovered in 2001 and 46.1% in 2003. Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Sp decreased in 2003 in France.
