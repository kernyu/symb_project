BACKGROUND: The emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance associated with acquired infections has made the choice of empirical therapy more difficult and expensive, hence the need for continuous research to determine their sensitivity patterns. OBJECTIVES: To identify the common aerobic pathogenic bacteria in post-operative wounds at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) and determine their sensitivity patterns to routine antibiotics used. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) Surgical, Obstetrics and Gynaecology wards. PATIENTS: Sixty three patients chosen by convenient sampling between May and June 2001 were included in the study. A total of eighty four isolates were obtained from these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolation of pathogens and their antibiotic sensitivity determination was conducted in the Department of Medical Microbiology Laboratory, Faculty of Health Sciences, Moi University. The bacteria were cultured on blood agar, MacConkey and Nutrient agar followed by identification using biochemical tests (catalase urease, coagulase, triple sugar iron). Disc diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar was used for sensitivity testing. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus species were the most common pathogenic bacteria isolated from the post-operative wounds. Other organisms included Proteus, Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli. There was a multi-drug resistance pattern observed, with minocyline being the most effective drug against S. aureus. CONCLUSION: There is need for review of policies on prescription practice on the use of existing therapeutics choice to limit the spread of resistance. This will ensure reduced patient stay and cost incurred.
