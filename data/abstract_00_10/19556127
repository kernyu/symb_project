We synthesized a family of 3,5-dichloropyrazin-2(1H)-one derivatives and assessed their in vitro fungicidal activity against Candida albicans. Compounds 11 and 20 were most active against C. albicans and induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species in this pathogen. Using a genome-wide approach in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrated that genes involved in vacuolar functionality and DNA-related functions play an important role in cellular mechanisms underlying the fungicidal activity of these compounds.
