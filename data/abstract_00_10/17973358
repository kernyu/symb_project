Drugs targeted to viral proteins are highly vulnerable to the development of resistant strains. We previously characterized a group of 2-phenylbenzimidazole compounds for their activity against allergy and asthma and more recently established the Golgi as their probable site of action. Herein we describe their activity against the propagation of several virus types through an action on the host cell. The most potent derivatives are the novel 2-phenylimidazopyridines, the lead compound of which is highly effective for blocking the spread of topical herpes infection in an animal model. These agents may provide an alternative antiviral approach, particularly for treating resistant strains.
