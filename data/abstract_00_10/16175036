PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Infection by Staphylococcus aureus in critically ill patients is usually associated with antimicrobial resistance and high mortality. A more effective antibiotic treatment is needed to replace older drugs that have limited efficacy. Novel substances active on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which are already available on the market or are still in development, are discussed in this review, with emphasis on nosocomial infections. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of new antibiotics are on the market (linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin) and there is good evidence regarding their efficacy, especially in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Linezolid is, to date, the best alternative in treating nosocomial pneumonia by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It is cost-effective; resistance levels are still very low but there are some concerns regarding its adverse events. Quinupristin-dalfopristin shows good activity in vitro but its efficacy in patients with pneumonia by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is modest. Daptomycin is not recommended for pulmonary infections because of its reduced penetration in the lung tissue. Under current phase III trials in patients with nosocomial infections are tigecycline, ceftobiprole, and three new glycopeptides, all with particular activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. SUMMARY: For the moment, there are limited and rather expensive therapeutic options for the infections by Staphylococcus aureus in the critically ill. No dramatic superiority of the new drugs in comparison to the standard therapies was observed in most of the clinical trials. Better results on the efficacy of the drugs under investigation are expected.
