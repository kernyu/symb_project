Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus) have emerged as leading pathogens in liver transplant recipients. Liver transplant recipients have also been shown to be uniquely more susceptible to harboring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The frequency of mycelial fungal infections has increased; however, effective prophylaxis and management of these infections remains suboptimal. Emerging reports have highlighted the morbidity due to novel herpesviruses in these patients. Finally, the emergence of ganciclovir resistance in cytomegalovirus has implications relevant for all solid organ transplant recipients.
