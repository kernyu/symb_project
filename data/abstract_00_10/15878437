Invasive aspergillosis (IA) can occur despite prior prophylactic or empiric use of triazoles or amphotericin B (AMB). Although profound immunosuppression may account for breakthrough IA, resistance of Aspergillus to antifungals may also play a role. To examine this question, we measured the minimal inhibitory concentration of 105 Aspergillus isolates recovered from 105 cancer patients (64 with IA, 41 with Aspergillus colonization) to AMB, itraconazole (ITC), and voriconazole (VRC) using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) M38-A microdilution and E-test methods. We also determined the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) of these agents and the minimal effective concentration (MEC) of caspofungin (CAS) using standardized methods. We then collected information regarding pre-exposure to AMB or triazoles (fluconazole, ITC, VRC) within 3 months before Aspergillus isolation. Pre-exposure of cancer patients to AMB or triazoles was associated with increased frequency of non-fumigatus Aspergillus species. Aspergillus isolates recovered from patients who previously received AMB exhibited higher E-test AMB MICs compared with isolates from patients without prior AMB exposure (P = 0.01). In addition, the AMB MICs by E-test were higher in triazole-pre-exposed patients compared with those not exposed to triazoles (P = 0.001). The ITC and VRC MICs by E-test were not affected by prior AMB or triazole exposure. Finally, neither the AMB, ITC, and VRC MICs and MFCs by NCCLS method nor CAS MECs showed such changes. In conclusion, cancer patients with positive Aspergillus cultures who are pre-exposed to AMB or triazoles have high frequency of non-fumigatus Aspergillus species. These Aspergillus isolates were found to be AMB-resistant by the more sensitive E-test method.
