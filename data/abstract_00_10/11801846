OBJECTIVE: To describe the successful treatment of a case of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus meningitis with linezolid. DESIGN: Case report and review of the literature. PATIENTS: The patient is a 35-yr-old man who suffered a cerebellar hemorrhage after embolization of a cerebellar arteriovenous malformation. The patient underwent ventriculostomy drainage and craniectomy. The patient was on broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia including vancomycin. The patient remained febrile and grew vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium from the cerebrospinal fluid. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with intravenous chloramphenicol without success. On postoperative day 16, the patient was begun on intravenous linezolid. MAIN RESULTS: The patient received 4 wks of intravenous linezolid with complete eradication of the meningitis. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous linezolid appears to be a safe and effective therapy for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus meningitis.
