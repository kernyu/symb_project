During the period June 2003-March 2004, 12,579 urine samples were examined employing the Uro-Quick system. Positive samples (1,948) were subsequently Gram-stained and processed by standard procedures for microorganism identification and antibiotic susceptibility determination by the disk diffusion method. Results of this latter test were compared with those obtained employing the new rapid Uro-Quick method. Antibiotics were introduced in vials containing 2 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth, then 0.5 ml of urine or a bacterial suspension in broth were added; a vial without drug was used as control. After 3 and 5 hours of incubation (for Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains respectively) the instrument showed the results. No growth and a growth curve like the control indicated susceptible and resistant strains respectively. Overall 1,590 Gram-negative strains were tested against ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftazidime, fosfomycin, imipenem, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and piperacillin-tazobactam, while 358 Gram-positive bacteria were assessed against ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin, fosfomycin, gentamicin, oxacillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Against the major urinary tract pathogens (Escherichia. coli, enterococci, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp.) agreement between the Uro-Quick system and the disk diffusion test generally was >90% for all antibiotics tested. On the basis of these results the system appears useful not only for bacteriuria screening, but also to rapidly test the antibiotic susceptibility of common uropathogens.
