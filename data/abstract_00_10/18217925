AIMS: To test the effect of bovicin HC5 against vegetative cells and endospores of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris DSMZ 2498 in synthetic media and in acidic mango pulp. METHODS AND RESULTS: Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris was grown in synthetic medium at 40 degrees C and pH 4.0. The effect on vegetative cells was assayed by adding bovicin HC5 to synthetic medium (40-160 AU ml(-1)) or to mango pulp (100 AU ml(-1)) at various pH values and determining the effect on growth (OD(600 nm)) and viable cell number, respectively. The effect of bovicin HC5 on spore germination and thermal sensitivity of A. acidoterrestris was tested in mango pulp (pH 4.0) containing 80 AU ml(-1) of bovicin HC5. Bovicin HC5 was bactericidal against vegetative cells of A. acidoterrestris at different pH values and showed sporicidal activity against endospores of this bacterium. When spores of A. acidoterrestris were heat treated in the presence of bovicin HC5, D-values decreased 77% to 95% compared to untreated controls at temperatures ranging from 80 to 95 degrees C. CONCLUSION: Bovicin HC5 was bactericidal and sporicidal against A. acidoterrestrsi DSMZ 2498. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results indicated that bovicin HC5 has potential to prevent spoilage of acidic fruit juices by thermocidophilic spore-forming bacteria.
