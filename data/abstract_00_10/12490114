OBJECTIVE: To study the resistance mechanism of clinical isolates of Ureaplasma urealyticum resistant to fluoroquinolones. METHODS: Thirteen isolates of Ureaplasma urealyticum resistant to six fluoroquinolones were selected out of 184 clinical isolates and their QRDRs (quinolone resistance-determining region) gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE were amplified by PCR. Sequencing results were compared to those susceptible reference strains and a comparison of deduced amino acid sequences were performed. RESULTS: Sequence comparison revealed a C to A change at 87nt of gyrA QRDR leading to the substitution of Asp95 with glutamic acid and a C to T change at 50nt of parC QRDR leading to the substitution of Ser80 with leucine. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a C to A change at 87nt of gyrA QRDR and a C to T change at 50nt of parC QRDR are associated with fluoroquinolone resistance of Ureaplasma urealyticum.
