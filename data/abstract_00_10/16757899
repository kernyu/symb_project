We investigated for dynamics of Campylobacter clones on 2 different managerial broiler farms. Campylobacter isolates were differentiated by resistance typing and molecular typing methods. On farm I, the same C. jejuni clones resistant to fluoroquinolone and oxytetracycline were isolated after one and half years again and another susceptible clone was invaded. The susceptible clone was isolated again after half year. Broiler flocks on the farm may be repeatedly infected with a few C. jejuni clones. On farm II, new clones including antimicrobial resistant one, were often invaded. The change of predominant C. jejuni clone in each flock on both the farms was observed, in the absence of antimicrobial selective pressure.
