The synthesis of three series of curcumin analogues with mono-carbonyl is described. Their in vitro anti-bacterial activities against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were tested and the effect of substituents on the aryl ring and the space structure of the linking strain were discussed. It was observed that part of the derivatives displayed significant activity when compared with curcumin and most of them exhibited activity against the ampicillin-resisted Enterobacter cloacae. Compounds A12, B09, B13, B14 and C09 show remarkable antibacterial activity in vitro. The result showed that heterocycle or long-chain substituents may enhance the activity of curcumin analogues.
