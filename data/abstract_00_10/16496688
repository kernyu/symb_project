P-dissolving Penicillium oxalicum P8 was isolated previously in this lab which has a considerable ability to dissolve many kinds of inorganic phosphorus and improve crop growth. In order to study rhizosphere colonization of plants by Penicillium oxalicum P8, protoplasts were transformed with a double-marker expression vector of green fluorescent protein and hygromycin B resistance. Some transformants were selected which expressed both the GFP and hygromycin B phosphotransferase and did not show significant morphological or physiological differences as compared to wild-type strain. Southern blot analysis confirmed the heterogeneous genomic integration of the vector DNA into the transformants.
