Drug resistance is an expected consequence of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B because of the high rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, the lack of proof-reading during reverse transcription of the pregenomic RNA and the low efficacy of available therapies in eliminating covalently closed circular HBV DNA. Mutations involving the YMDD motif of the catalytic domain of HBV reverse transcriptase have been reported in patients who have received lamivudine, emtricitabine and telbivudine. Drug-resistant mutations affecting other regions of HBV polymerase have also been reported, but at much lower rates in patients who have received adefovir dipivoxil or entecavir. Antiviral resistance is initially manifested as virological breakthrough infection. In most patients, this is followed by biochemical breakthrough and, in some patients, hepatitis flares and hepatic decompensation. Monitoring drug resistance may improve the management of patients with antiviral-resistant HBV and can guide the selection of salvage therapy. The optimal management of patients with antiviral-resistant HBV continues to evolve. The ideal approach is to prevent antiviral resistance through judicious use of antiviral therapy and the use of more potent antiviral agents, possibly in combination.
