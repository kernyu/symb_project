UNLABELLED: In order to determine bacterial distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of urinary pathogens in a long-term-care-facility (LTCF), urine cultures were examined when clinically indicated. The LTCF consists of 286 beds, housing 931 residents during 32 months, in various wings; independent and frail residents (wing-A), nursing and demented patients (wing-B), and skilled-nursing patients (wing-C). A total of 1,401 positive urine cultures were obtained: E. coli was isolated significantly less often in wing-C than in wing-A (p = 0.02) and wing-B (p = 0.009). There was no significant difference in frequency of other organisms. Susceptibility of organisms decreased significantly from wing-C to wing-B (p < 0.05-0.001), and from wing-B to wing-A (p < 0.05-0.001). Susceptibility rates' decreased significantly over time in wing-B, less in wing-C and not at all in wing-A. IN CONCLUSION: When selecting empiric antibiotic therapy for serious urinary tract infection in a long-term-care resident, one should take into account the microbial environment of the individual patient's department.
