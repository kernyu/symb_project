We investigated a set of cell lines as to their sensitivity to proliferation inhibition, on the one side, and apoptosis induction, on the other, by the core histone deacetylase inhibitors butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA), respectively. The results can be summarized as follows: (i) the investigated cell lines can be classified into three groups of high, medium and low sensitivity to proliferation inhibition by the histone deacetylase inhibitors; (ii) there is no correlation between the sensitivities to proliferation inhibition and the sensitivities to apoptosis induction by the histone deacetylase inhibitors; (iii) a comparison of the relative sensitivities to butyrate versus TSA with regard to proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction, respectively, revealed that besides a good correlation most often encountered, there are also cell lines with conspicuously differing relative sensitivities to the two structurally different histone deacetylase inhibitors.
