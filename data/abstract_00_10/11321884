OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of uro-pathogens. SETTING: Department of Pathalogy, Ziauddin Medical Hospital Laboratory, Karachi. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was done on all the urine samples sent for culture and sensitivity during a seven months period. Two thousand eight hundred and forty four urine samples were received and inoculated in cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient agar (CLED). Positive samples were identified, processed and antibiotic susceptibility was carried out. Data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel 97. RESULTS: E. coli (45.6%) was the leading uropathogen followed by candida spp. (10.5%), enterococcus spp. (10.2%). For E. coli ampicillin, ceftazidime, nitrofurantoin and gentamycin sensitivity was 26%, 20%, 79.5%, 65% respectively. Enterococcus isolates showed 60% resistance to ampicillin. CONCLUSION: The resistant pattern of uro-pathogens causing urinary tract infections to common antimicrobial agents is changing and must be taken into account when selecting treatment strategies. Therefore, antibiotic policy should be made according to local surveillance data.
