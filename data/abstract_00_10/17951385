Tellurite exerts a deleterious effect on a number of small molecules containing sulfur moieties that have a recognized role in cellular oxidative stress. Because cysteine is involved in the biosynthesis of glutathione and other sulfur-containing compounds, we investigated the expression of Geobacillus stearothermophilus V cysteine-related genes cobA, cysK, and iscS and Escherichia coli cysteine regulon genes under conditions that included the addition of K2TeO3 to the culture medium. Results showed that cell tolerance to tellurite correlates with the expression level of the cysteine metabolic genes and that these genes are up-regulated when tellurite is present in the growth medium.
