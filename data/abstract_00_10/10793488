Emetine resistant clones of Entamoeba histolytica strain HM1:IMSS were isolated by using petri dish agar method after mutation with ethyl-methanesulphonate. Two emetine resistant clones were obtained and both were resistant to emetine at a concentration of 24 micrograms/ml of emetine. The 50 per cent inhibitory concentration (IC50) for both emetine sensitive and resistant clones was 5 and 14 micrograms/ml respectively. The colony forming efficiency of E. histolytica strain HM1:IMSS varied from 44 to 54 per cent. This method is useful for isolating clones from different strains of the parasite for molecular and immunological studies.
