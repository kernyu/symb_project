Nitric oxide (NO) is an efficient antimicrobial agent. A role for mycothiol in protecting mycobacteria from nitrosative damage was revealed by showing that a Mycobacterium smegmatis mutant is sensitive to NO. A direct correlation between NO and mycothiol levels confirmed that mycothiol is important for protecting mycobacteria from NO attack.
