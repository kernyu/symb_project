BACKGROUND: Because of the increasing resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole, two of the antibiotics used for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, new therapeutic alternatives are needed. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a randomized, comparative trial of 7 vs. 14-day triple treatment with rabeprazole, ofloxacin and amoxicillin for H. pylori eradication. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present authors studied 76 dyspeptic patients infected with H. pylori diagnosed by both histology and a rapid urease test. Patients were randomized to receive rabeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.), plus ofloxacin (400 mg b.i.d.) and amoxicillin (1000 mg b.i.d.) for 7 days (group 1) vs. 14 days (group 2) and were followed by 6 weeks. Eradication was assessed 4 weeks after completing the course of study treatment by the (14)C-urea breath test. Per protocol and intention-to-treat eradication rates were determined. RESULTS: For the intention to treat analysis, the eradication rate was 62.2% for group 1 and 92.3% for group 2 (p =.004). For the per protocol analysis, eradication rate for group 1 was 63.9% and for group 2 was 97.3% (p =.001). CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with rabeprazole, amoxicillin and ofloxacin by 14 days was efficient for H. pylori eradication and therefore deserves further study. The same regimen prescribed for 7 days had a significantly lower and unacceptable cure rate and should not be used.
