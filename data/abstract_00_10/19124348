Exacerbations may produce permanent impairment in lung function and health status in patients with COPD. Up to 70% of episodes have a bacterial etiology, being of mixed viral infection in some cases. The new, more active antibiotics have demonstrated better eradication of bacteria in the airways and, consequently, prolongation of the time to the next exacerbation. However, the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to the antibiotics currently used warrants novel research into new families of antimicrobials, and the adoption of new strategies such as the prevention of exacerbations, nebulized antibiotic treatment or the use of antibiotics in combination.
