BACKGROUND: Connecticut Valley Hospital, an inpatient tertiary care psychiatric hospital, identified a significant increase in the antimicrobial resistance of E. coli to multiple antibiotics including quinolones. OBJECTIVES: To improve the resistance profile of E. coli by better managing the usage of quinolones at this hospital. METHODS: Education was provided to physicians, nurses and pharmacists regarding antibiotic usage, restriction and prior approval of quinolones. Further education was provided when the program was determined to be effective, and continued for another year. RESULTS: A significant reduction of the prescription of quinolones was demonstrated. The resistance patterns of E. coli to quinolones and other antibiotics stabilized. CONCLUSION: In this psychiatric hospital inpatient population, antimicrobial stewardship proved to be an effective tool in managing antibiotic utilization and stabilizing antimicrobial resistance among E. coli isolates.
