OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the activity of aminocandin, a new echinocandin with broad-spectrum activity against Candida spp., with that of amphotericin B, caspofungin and fluconazole, in an immunocompetent murine model of haematogenously disseminated candidiasis caused by a fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans. METHODS: Mice were infected with a fluconazole-resistant strain of C. albicans and treated with aminocandin 5 and 10 mg/kg intravenously (iv) once and twice weekly, amphotericin B 0.5 mg/kg iv every other day for 5 days, fluconazole 20 mg/kg orally (po) once a day for 5 days and caspofungin 0.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally (ip) once daily for 5 days. RESULTS: Treatment with aminocandin, given iv twice a week, resulted in 100% survival. Further, the tissue fungal burden of the aminocandin group was equivalent to that of amphotericin B (administered every other day) and caspofungin (administered daily). CONCLUSIONS: Aminocandin may be an effective addition to the arsenal of antifungal compounds for the treatment of candidiasis caused by fluconazole-resistant C. albicans.
