The MRSA-Screen (Denka-Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) latex agglutination test was evaluated for its ability to detect PBP 2a from 200 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 84 mecA-positive strains and 116 mecA-negative strains) consisting of 108 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 37 S. saprophyticus, 15 S. haemolyticus, 11 S. hominis, 10 S. capitis, 10 S. warneri, and 3 S. lugdunensis species as well as 6 other species of CoNS. The assay was compared with susceptibility testing with an agar screen plate with oxacillin at 6 microg/ml (OXA6), by oxacillin disk diffusion (DD), by broth microdilution (BMDIL), by the E test, and with Vitek GPS-SV and Vitek GPS-107 susceptibility cards. PCR for the detection of the mecA gene was used as the "gold standard." The sensitivities and specificities for the methods evaluated were as follows: MRSA-Screen, 100 and 100%, respectively; OXA6, 100 and 99%, respectively; DD, 98 and 62%, respectively; BMDIL, 100 and 60%, respectively; E test, 100 and 51%, respectively; Vitek GPS-SV susceptibility card, 98 and 87%, respectively; and Vitek GPS-107 susceptibility card, 100 and 61%, respectively. The MRSA-Screen test accurately and rapidly detected oxacillin resistance in CoNS.
