The aim of this study was to investigate the mutations in gyrA gene at Thr-86 position in fluoroquinolone resistant C. jejuni clinical isolates (2003-2005). The change of Thr to Ile at 86 position is associated with high-level resistance to fluoroquinolone in C. jejuni. Thirty five (58%) of 65 C. jejuni strains were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin using E-test method. PCR-RFLP technique with the RsaI enzyme was used for the identification of mutation in gyrA gene. The primers spanning a part of the fluoroquinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) were designed based on the article of Alonso et al. and the gyrA sequence of C. jejuni (Gen Bank accession number LO4566). One of this primer had mismatch introduced at the second nucleotide from 3' end of the primer what gives an artificial RsaI cleavage site. All of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates contained a single)point mutation in the gyrA gene: the replacement of Thr 86 by Ile. The results showed that PCR-RFLP is a rapid and simple method for the detection of the high-level fluoroquinolone resistance in C. jejuni.
