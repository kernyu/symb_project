ZD0473 is a new generation hindered platinum agent currently undergoing worldwide Phase II clinical studies. The in vitro cytotoxicity of ZD0473 either alone or in combination with the anticancer drugs paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, topotecan and doxorubicin was determined using four human ovarian carcinoma cell lines and by the sulphorhodamine B assay (SRB). The lines included one model of acquired cisplatin resistance and one isogenic pair differing only in their p53 status. Notably, the simultaneous exposure to ZD0473 and paclitaxel for 96 h resulted in synergy (as defined by a median effect analysis) in all four cell lines (i.e. independent of cisplatin resistance and p53 status). In addition, synergy was observed in 3/4 lines and 2/4 lines following concomitant exposure to topotecan or gemcitabine, respectively. Sequencing studies with ZD0473 and paclitaxel revealed that, for three of the four cell lines, the combination of ZD0473 administered for 24 h prior to paclitaxel for 24 h conferred a greater growth inhibitory effect than the reverse sequential combination. This scheduling effect was particularly marked for the acquired cisplatin-resistant A2780CisR cell line; synergy being observed with ZD0473/paclitaxel, but antagonism with paclitaxel/ZD0473. This effect did not appear to be correlated with changes in drug-induced cell cycle checkpoints. These data suggest that ZD0473 may be usefully combined with various cytotoxics in the clinic, including paclitaxel, topotecan and gemcitabine.
