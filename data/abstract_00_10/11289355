We investigated subtype-dependent development of lamivudine resistance in hepatitis B virus (HBV) longitudinally in 26 consecutive patients (13 adw and 13 ayw carriers) during antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Lamivudine resistance developed in seven adw carriers and one ayw carrier. Risk of lamivudine resistance was significantly higher for adw carriers than for ayw carriers (p=0.03). We believe that the adw subtype of HBV is associated with a high risk of lamivudine resistance, which might be linked to simultaneous changes of the HBsAg that occurs with the emergence of resistance.
