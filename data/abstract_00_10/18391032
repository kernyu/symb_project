Linezolid resistance has dominantly been mediated by mutations in 23S rRNA or ribosomal protein L4 genes. Recently, cfr has demonstrated the ability to produce a phenotype of resistance to not only oxazolidinones, but also other antimicrobial classes (phenicols, lincosamides, pleuromutilins, and streptogramin A). We describe the first detection of cfr-mediated linezolid resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis recovered from human infection cases monitored during the 2007 LEADER Program.
