We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against 19,615 clinical strains consecutively collected by numerous centers located across the United States and Canada (2002-2005). Daptomycin was very active against all indicated species (>99% susceptible), with the highest MIC results being 2, 8, 0.5, and 1 microg/mL for staphylococci, enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci, respectively, and no significant loss in potency was observed over the period studied.
