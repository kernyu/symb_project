We report a case of ventriculostomy-related meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE). The patient was successfully treated with administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin by both intravenous and intraventricular routes. A brief review of the literature is provided, which indicates that optimal management with quinupristin/dalfopristin should include daily intraventricular doses of at least 2 mg.
