The role of clinically important multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps in bacterial resistance to various human antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including cathelicidin LL-37, the alpha-defensins human neutrophil peptides (HNPs)-1-3 and HD-5 and the beta-defensins hBD-2 and -3, was investigated. AMP susceptibility testing was performed by killing assays and standard minimal inhibitory concentration assays. AMP susceptibility was determined in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains overexpressing resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type pumps AcrAB and MexAB, respectively, and in their pump-deficient parental strains. Furthermore, the impact of a member of the major facilitator (MF) efflux pump family was investigated in Staphylococcus aureus overexpressing NorA and in wild-type strains. The E. coli AcrAB and P. aeruginosa MexAB RND-type efflux pumps as well as the S. aureus NorA MF efflux pump were unable to confer resistance to AMPs. These findings do not support a critical role of MDR efflux pumps in the tested pathogens as a strategy to increase virulence by circumventing the antimicrobial action of innate defence AMPs.
