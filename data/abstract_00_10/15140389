A SRS search in the GenBank/EMBL databases for entire genes encoding efflux-mediated resistance allocated to a recognized tetracycline determinant revealed the existence of at least 87 genes. DNA-based and protein sequence analyses of representatives from the different efflux-mediated tetracycline determinant groups were performed and allowed us to propose a revision of the current grouping on the basis of our new evolutionary trees. On the other hand, similarity, topology, and hydropathy analyses of some representatives from 12-transmembrane segments (TMS) and 14-TMS proteins lead us to perform meaningful sequence alignments of recognized or putative 12-TMS and 14-TMS proteins truncated to their first 200 amino acids (alpha-domain of the protein). For all aligned truncated proteins, including old and recently discovered tetracycline resistance determinants, significant similarities along this segment were demonstrated and three new conserved motifs identified, reinforcing the hypothesis of a common ancestry for the alpha-domain of all tetracycline-efflux pumps.
