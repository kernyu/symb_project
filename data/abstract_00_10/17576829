A clinical trial of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (39 locations in 19 states) observed that community-associated or community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CO-MRSA) represented 23% of all pathogens at baseline culture and 53% of 190 S. aureus isolates. CO-MRSA strains typically were Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) positive (95%), contained staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type IVa (99%), were USA300 or USA400 clones (92%), and exhibited minimal coresistances (macrolides and/or fluoroquinolones). Clinical results remained identical (89% cures) regardless of the antimicrobial used or CO-MRSA molecular patterns, PVL production, or antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.
