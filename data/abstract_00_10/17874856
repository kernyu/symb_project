Voriconazole has been developed to meet the increasing need for new and useful antifungal agents for the treatment of invasive mycoses. This review describes the spectrum of voriconazole antifungal activity based on data from in vitro studies published during the last three years. This survey demonstrates that voriconazole has a broad antifungal spectrum against the most common fungal pathogens being its action fungistatic for Candida and fungicidal for Aspergillus and other filamentous fungi. Overall, more than 95% of all Candida isolates tested are susceptible to voriconazole and less than 3% are resistant. Similar or even better activity rates have been described for Aspergillus, Cryptococcus and most of yeasts and moulds of medical importance. We also discuss the limitations related to the azole cross-resistance observed in some Candida glabrata isolates, the poor activity of voriconazole against Scedosporium prolificans, its activity against fungal biofilms and the great potential usefulness of combination of voriconazole with other antifungal drugs.
