Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common respiratory tract conditions seen by primary care physicians. Each year approximately 20 million cases of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) occur in the United States. Since diagnosis of ABRS relies on clinical evaluation, treatments are usually empirical and include an antibiotic treatment that covers the common bacteria associated with ABRS infection, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) recommends that antimicrobial therapy for rhinosinusitis should combine high susceptibility, clinical effectiveness, safety, and tolerability. The most efficacious antibiotics for ABRS include the respiratory fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, as well as ceftriaxone and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The use of fluoroquinolones or high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended for patients with mild disease who have had recent antimicrobial therapy or for patients with moderate disease. These drugs are generally well tolerated with mild adverse effects. Resistance to fluoroquinolones in S pneumoniae and H influenzae has remained low in spite of their increased use. Recent studies indicate that short-course, high-dose treatment regimens may reduce total drug use, improve tolerability and adherence, prevent increases in resistance, and increase efficacy. The use of fluoroquinolones or amoxicillin-clavulanate in a short-course, high-dose regimen may represent an exciting new protocol in the treatment of rhinosinusitis.
