Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are abundant molecular chaperones participating in the cytoprotection. The kinetics of synthesis of Hsps closely correlates with the kinetics of development of resistance to cell death. In this study, we analysed the probable involvement of Hsp 27 and Hsp 60 in the protection of cells undergoing apoptosis. Human lymphocytes cultured in the presence of ampicillin or ceftriaxone produced Hsp 60 and Hsp 27, estimated by immunoblotting in a time-dependent manner and the increased levels of Hsp 60 and Hsp 27 correlated with enhanced resistance of the lymphocytes to apoptosis, as determined by flow cytometry. Cultures treated with ampicillin or ceftriaxone also exhibited smaller numbers of apoptotic cells than untreated cultures when exposed to the apoptosis-inducing agent staurosporine (1 mM). In contrast, cloramphenicol induced the production of only small amounts of Hsp 60, and no resistance apoptosis. Further studies are needed to clarify the potential role of Hsp 27 and Hsp 60 in the resistance of human cells to apoptosis and the effects of antibiotics on this phenomenon.
