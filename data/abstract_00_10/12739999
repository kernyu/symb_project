Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most frequent infections in childhood but it is not easy to establish a rational therapeutic approach for a number of reasons, including difficulties in identifying the aetiology, the fact that the most frequent bacterial pathogens become resistant to commonly used antibiotics and the lack of certain information concerning the possible preventive role of conjugate vaccines. This leads paediatricians to treat almost all cases of CAP with antibiotics, often using a combination of different antimicrobial classes. In order to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use and limit the spread of antibiotic resistance, consensus guidelines for the management of CAP in childhood should be developed and used by practitioners in their offices and hospitals.
