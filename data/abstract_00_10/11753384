We have developed technologies that simplify genomic library construction and screening, substantially reducing both the time and the cost associated with traditional library screening methods and facilitating the generation of gene-targeting constructs. By taking advantage of homologous recombination in Escherichia coli, we were able to use as little as 80 bp of total sequence homology to screen for a specific gene from a genomic library in plasmid or phage form. This method, called recombination cloning (REC), takes only a few days instead of the several weeks required for traditional plaque-lift methods. In addition, because every clone in the mouse genomic library we have constructed has a negative selection marker adjacent to the genomic insert, REC screening can generate gene-targeting vectors in one step, from library screening to finished construct. Conditional targeting constructs can be generated easily with minimal additional manipulation.
