Alkylphospholipids, such as the antitumor ether lipid 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methylglycero-3-phosphocholine, modulate cancer cell invasion through changes in the adherens junction E-cadherin complex, a major organizer of epithelia. We wanted to know whether alkylphospholipids would also change tight junctions, molecular complexes that seal cell-to-cell contacts in polarised epithelia. Therefore, human colorectal cancer cell layers T84 were established in two-compartment culture chambers and the functional integrity of tight junctions was evaluated through their transepithelial electrical resistance. Incorporation of alkylphospholipids causes a rapid and reversible decrease of transepithelial electrical resistance. This decrease is due to an increased paracellular permeability and is temperature-independent. Unlike methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, alkyl-phospholipids do not specifically displace lipids from raft-like membrane domains. Nevertheless, alkylphospholipids change the detergent-solubility of zonula occludens-protein and occludin. Our data, together with the literature, indicate that non-toxic doses of alkylphospholipids affect more than one cell-cell adhesion complex, probably through their incorporation into the plasma membrane lipid bilayer.
