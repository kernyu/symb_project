Hospital-acquired vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were first reported in the late 1980s and have since been an increasing problem worldwide. Kuala Lumpur Hospital thus far, to the best of our knowledge has been spared from this pathogen. We describe the first confirmed case of Enterococcus faecium exhibiting the van A phenotype in our hospital, in a patient with chronic renal failure who was successfully treated with linezolid. The microbiology laboratory plays an important role in the identification and detection of VRE.
