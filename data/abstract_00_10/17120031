We report adjunct treatment of (interferon) IFN-alpha2b (Intron-A) in a patient with complete interferon-gamma receptor R1 (IFNGR1) deficiency suffering from disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) resistant to multiple anti-mycobacterial agents. A low dose of IFN-alpha2b (3 x 10(6) units/m(2) three times weekly subcutaneously) successfully attenuated progressive hepatosplenomegaly and abdominal/retroperitoneal/pelvic lymphadenopathy, although the patient continued to be mycobacteremic. This is the first report of a complete IFNGR1 deficiency treated with adjuvant IFN-alpha2b for disseminated MAC infection.
