Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an important nosocomial pathogen in hospitalized patients, particularly those with prior broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. The microorganism mainly infects severely ill, debilitated patients and is most frequent in immunocompromised hosts. A prominent feature of this organism is its resistance to multiple antibiotics including beta-lactam agents, carbapenems and aminoglycosides. Community-acquired infection with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is reported rarely. This is the first report of a child patient diagnosed with septic arthritis due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
