A bacteriological study of external ear canal was performed in 52 hospitalized cancer patients and 42 non hospitalized cancer patients at Shafa hospital, Ahwaz. Study was under taken to find out the normal flora changes in the external ear canals and to observe the prevalence of external otitis among these cancer patients. The control group consisted of 40 non-cancer patients. We observed the following bacteria among hospitalized cancer patients. Staphylococcus Coagulase negative (51.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.9%). Similarly, among non hospitalized cancer patients, Staphylococcus Coagulase negative (45.2%), S. aureus (9.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.7%). Incidence of Staphylococcus Coagulase negative and Streptococci pneumoniae is higher in control group than that in cancer patients. We have concluded that cancer patients probably suffer from external otitis more frequently because of enhanced colonization by S. aureus (P < 0.05). The antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms to various antibiotics was determined by disk diffusion method using Muller Hinton agar. In hospitalized cancer patients Staphylococcus Coagulase negative was 25% and 85% resistant to Vancomycin and Penicillin G and in non hospitalized cancer patients, Staphylococcus Coagulase negative were 45% and 80% resistant to Vancomycin and Penicillin G. S. aureus of both the groups (hospitalized & non hospitalized) were resistant to Penicillin G. Similarly, both the groups were 55% and 50% resistance to Vancomycin.
