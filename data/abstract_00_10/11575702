BMS-232632, an azapeptide HIV protease inhibitor, is in development by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), under license from Novartis, as a potential treatment for HIV/AIDS [248556]. Early preclinical work was carried out by Novartis [248556]. BMS-232632 was developed as part of a series of compounds (as CGP-73547) and evaluated against drug-resistant strains of HIV; the compounds in this series belong to a series of azadipeptide analogs and are bis(L-tert-leucine) derivatives that exhibit good antiviral activity and satisfactory pharmacokinetic profiles [297907]. Novartis subsequently discontinued evaluation of the compound in November 1999 [347827]. Phase II trials had already begun by July 1999 [334335] and BMS expects NDA filing to take place in 2001 [358937]. Use of BMS-232632 in combination with other antiretroviral agents has demonstrated that it may be used in combination with a variety of nucleoside analogs and protease inhibitors [298464]. It is thought to have a genotypic resistance profile that differs from that of other protease inhibitors [302157]. In February 1999, Lehman Brothers predicted the drug had a 30% probability of reaching market, with an estimated first launch date in 2001. The analysts predicted peak sales would occur in 2007, with sales of $500 million in the US and $300 million in the rest of the world at that time [319225].
