112 strains of E coli from 620 urocultures of hospitalized and ambulatory patients where isolated between March-June 2002. Our purpose was to make a comparative study of the susceptibility to antibiotics of 31 strains of E coli isolated in hospital (County Clinical Hospital Nr. 1 Timisoara--Urology Clinic and Intensive Care Unit) and 81 strains collected from ambulatory patients. Identification of germs was performed using the automatic API system, and the susceptibility tests were performed using disc-diffusion and the agar dilution test. By analyzing the extended antibiograms we categorized the germs considering their phenotypes of resistance and remarked a high percentage of E coli strains from hospitalized showing multiple resistance to antibiotics.
