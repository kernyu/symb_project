We describe a case of relapsed paratyphoid fever in which the isolate had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin due to a rare mutation within the gyrA gene. 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning identified deep-seated infection including unsuspected aortitis and highlights the utility of novel imaging techniques to improve our understanding and treatment of this disease.
