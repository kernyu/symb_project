We performed a hypothesis-generating study evaluating the perceived threat of lawsuits among physicians and methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. We found a correlation between the prevalence of methicillin resistance among clinical S. aureus isolates and both antibiotic prescriptions per capita and density of attorneys in countries in Europe and North America. We did not find a correlation between prevalence of methicillin resistance and physician density. Further investigation is warranted to study whether physicians' perceived fear of lawsuits, of which attorney density may be a crude surrogate marker, results in antibiotic prescription practices that contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among virulent pathogens such as S. aureus, with global implications on the ethics of the delivery of quality health care to all members of society.
