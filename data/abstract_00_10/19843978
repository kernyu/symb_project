Integration is a distinctive and essential process in the HIV infection cycle and thus represents an attractive antiviral drug target. Integrase inhibitors combined with other classes of drug might contribute to long-lasting suppression of HIV type-1 (HIV-1) replication for many patients. Of the numerous potential integrase inhibitor leads that have been reported, few have reached clinical trials and only one, raltegravir, has been approved (in late 2007) for the treatment of HIV-1-infected patients. Another integrase inhibitor, elvitegravir, is currently showing promise in Phase III clinical studies. Once-daily administration of elvitegravir has a comparable antiviral activity to twice-daily of raltegravir in HIV-1-infected patients. Here, we highlight the salient features of elvitegravir: its chemical structure compared with representative integrase inhibitors, mechanism of action, in vitro and in vivo activity against HIV and other retroviruses, and the effect of integrase polymorphisms and resistance mutations on its anti-HIV activity.
