We report what we believe to be the second case of a prostatic abscess due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A previously healthy diabetic man presented with dysuria, fatigue, weight loss, a tender prostate, and leukocytosis. Computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large prostatic abscess at the base of the bladder. Blood, urine, and pus obtained by percutaneous aspiration grew MRSA. Percutaneous drainage and prolonged therapy with intravenous vancomycin resulted in cure. Prostatic abscess is most often caused by Gram-negative organisms. Community-acquired MRSA, which usually causes skin and soft tissue infections, may also cause prostatic abscess. The mainstay of treatment of prostatic abscess is drainage, which can be accomplished either percutaneously or transurethrally. Gram stain and culture of the drainage will direct proper antibiotic selection.
