OBJECTIVES: Reports of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to all commonly used antimicrobial agents, including beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, are increasing in hospitals worldwide. The activity of ACHN-490, a next-generation aminoglycoside, was examined against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from hospitals in New York City, an area where multidrug-resistant organisms are endemic. METHODS: Unique patient isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were gathered from 16 hospitals located in New York City in 2009 and underwent susceptibility testing to aminoglycosides and ACHN-490. Subsets of isolates were characterized by PCR for the presence of genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, ribosomal methylases and KPC-type carbapenemases. RESULTS: Although most isolates of E. coli were susceptible to the aminoglycosides, the MIC(90) values of gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin were 32, 8 and 4 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90) of ACHN-490 was 1 mg/L. Multidrug resistance, including resistance to aminoglycosides and the presence of bla(KPC), was much more common in isolates of K. pneumoniae. However, the MIC(90) of ACHN-490 for K. pneumoniae was also 1 mg/L. The MICs of ACHN-490 did not correlate with the presence of commonly recovered aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Bactericidal activity was evident in most isolates at concentrations 4x the MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The novel aminoglycoside ACHN-490 retains activity against most isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. Additional studies examining the roles of efflux systems and outer membrane permeability alterations are recommended in isolates with reduced susceptibility to this agent.
