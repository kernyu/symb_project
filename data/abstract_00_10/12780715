Onychocola canadensis is an uncommon nondermatophyte mould which can occasionally cause onychomycosis, and rarely, tinea manuum. It typically affects elderly individuals, some of whom have been farmers, in temperate climates. We describe a patient with onychomycosis due to this organism. She failed to respond to a 12-week course of terbinafine 250 mg o.d.
