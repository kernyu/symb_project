We transiently transfected pTet-on and pTRE2hyg-luciferase into the mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using lipofectamine, and analyzed its inductive effect by adding serial concentrations of doxycycline (DOX). The results showed that in the transfected group, the luciferase activity of the cells was gradually increased along with the increasing concentration of DOX. While in the non-transfected group, the luciferase activity was not detectable even with DOX treatment. This indicated that the ESCs transfected with Tet-on system could response to DOX very well, and the regulation of target gene expression is dose dependent.
