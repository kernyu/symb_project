The bactericidal activity of biapenem (BIPM), a new carbapenem agent, against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was compared with those of imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), meropenem (MEPM) and ceftazidime (CAZ). The bactericidal activity of BIPM against S. aureus was equal to those of IPM, PAPM and MEPM. Against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, BIPM showed higher bactericidal activity than IPM and PAPM. Against P. aeruginosa, BIPM showed excellent bactericidal activity campared with IPM. The killing speeds of BIPM and IPM were obviously the most rapid among four carbapenems. BIPM showed a strong bactericidal activity against 5 species of bacteria including P. aeruginosa.
