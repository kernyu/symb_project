The worldwide problem of hepatitis B viral infection has been the focus of a large number of investigations. In the last decade advances have been made in the understanding of the viral function as well as strategies to combat the virus. Lamivudine, Hepsera, and interferon-alpha therapies that are currently used in the clinic are not optimal because of the emergence of resistance in the former modality and/or adverse effects. There are several new nucleosides that are under development for treatment of HBV. With the combination of a number of treatment protocols, it should be possible to bring down the viral load to undetectable levels and minimize the risk of generating mutations that confer resistance to the therapeutic agent.
