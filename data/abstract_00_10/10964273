The study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Salmonella enteritidis diarrhoea in an urban area in Zimbabwe. Stool specimens from people of all ages presenting at primary level health centres in Harare were investigated for S. enteritidis and other bacterial and parasitic enteric pathogens. The first 46 S. enteritidis isolates were phage-typed, and all isolates were tested for susceptibility to ampicillin (10 microg), chloramphenicol (30 microg), cotrimoxazole (25 microg), tetracycline (30 microg), gentamicin (10 microg), nalidixic acid (30 microg), ciprofloxacin (5 microg) and ceftriaxone (30 microg). S. enteritidis was isolated in 74 (1.8%) of 4155 stool specimens which represented 30.7% of all Salmonella species isolated. The most common S. enteritidis phage type was 4 (78.3%) followed by 7, 9 and 23 (8.7%, 2.2%, 2.2%, respectively) All S. enteritidis isolates were sensitive to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Less than 10% of the isolates were resistant to the other antimicrobials except ampicillin, to which 13.5% were resistant. One isolate was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and nalidixic acid.
