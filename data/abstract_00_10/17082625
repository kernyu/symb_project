Although it is known that IFN-gamma-secreting T cells are critical for control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, the contribution of IFN-gamma produced by NK cells to host resistance to the pathogen is less well understood. By using T cell-deficient RAG(-/-) mice, we showed that M. tuberculosis stimulates NK cell-dependent IFN-gamma production in naive splenic cultures and in lungs of infected animals. More importantly, common cytokine receptor gamma-chain(-/-)RAG(-/-) animals deficient in NK cells, p40(-/-)RAG(-/-), or anti-IFN-gamma mAb-treated RAG(-/-) mice displayed significantly increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection compared with untreated NK-sufficient RAG(-/-) controls. Studies comparing IL-12 p40- and p35-deficient RAG(-/-) mice indicated that IL-12 plays a more critical role in the induction of IFN-gamma-mediated antimycobacterial effector functions than IL-23 or other p40-containing IL-12 family members. The increased susceptibility of IL-12-deficient or anti-IFN-gamma mAb-treated RAG(-/-) mice was associated not only with elevated bacterial loads, but also with the development of granulocyte-enriched foci in lungs. This tissue response correlated with increased expression of the granulocyte chemotactic chemokines KC and MIP-2 in NK as well as other leukocyte populations. Interestingly, depletion of granulocytes further increased bacterial burdens and exacerbated pulmonary pathology in these animals, revealing a compensatory function for neutrophils in the absence of IFN-gamma. The above observations indicate that NK cell-derived IFN-gamma differentially regulates T-independent resistance and granulocyte function in M. tuberculosis infection and suggest that this response could serve as an important barrier in AIDS patients or other individuals with compromised CD4+ T cell function.
