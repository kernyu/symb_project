The prevalence of the Campylobacter multi-drug efflux pump (CmeABC) was evaluated in Campylobacter isolates recovered from freshly processed turkeys at two Midwestern processing plants. A total of 94 Campylobacter isolates recovered from processed turkeys were examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the presence of the multi-drug efflux pump genes cmeA, cmeB, and cmeC. Results from this study found that 51% of all isolates tested were positive for CmeABC. 46.6% of these positive isolates were from plant A and 55.1% from plant B. Differences were observed in the prevalence of individual genes found among Campylobacter isolates from each plant. Additional analysis found that among the isolates positive for CmeABC, 85.5% were identified as C. jejuni and 14.5% identified as C. coli. There was a relatively high occurrence of the Campylobacter multi-drug efflux pump genes in Campylobacter spp. recovered from processed turkeys, however, the presence of the genes could not be significantly linked to antimicrobial resistance observed in the test strains and suggests that the CmeABC genes are only one factor associated with antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter spp.
