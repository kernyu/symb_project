Reliable data regarding the efficacy of different schemes of triple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in our country, are not available. Patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and non-ulcer dyspepsia or active peptic ulcer disease were randomized in three different groups for therapy with, omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxicillin 1000 mg, twice daily for one week (OCA 1, 40 patients) and the same treatment but for two weeks in a second group (OCA 2, 40 patients). The third group received omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily during one week (OCM, 40 patients). The primary efficacy end point was the eradication of Helicobacter pylori as confirmed by negative urea breath test, 4 weeks after the completion of treatment. Of 120 patients enrolled in the study, 113 met the entry criteria. Of them, 103 completed the treatment. When analyzed by intention to treat, after 4 weeks of finishing the treatment, Helicobacter pylori was eradicated in 92.3% of patients in OCA 1, 89.7% in OCA 2, and 82.8% in OCM. There was no significant difference between the three groups, regarding the eradication efficacy. Side effects were observed more frequently in OCA 2 and OCM groups. Primary resistance to amoxicillin and clarithromycin was not demonstrated, while 20% of cultured strains were resistant to metronidazole. In patients with peptic ulcer disease or non-ulcer dysplasia, triple therapy with omeprazole and two antibiotics is highly effective in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. One week of OCA therapy is as effective as two weeks of OCA or one week of OCM, with less side effects.
