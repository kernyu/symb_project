The Escherichia coli multidrug efflux pump protein AcrB has recently been cocrystallized with various substrates, suggesting that there is a phenylalanine-rich binding site around F178 and F615. We found that F610A was the point mutation that had the most significant impact on substrate MICs, while other targeted mutations, including conversion of phenylalanines 136, 178, 615, 617, and 628 to alanine, had smaller and more variable effects.
