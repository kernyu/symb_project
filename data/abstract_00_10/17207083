The quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene in ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains (n=53) and strains of Neisseria spp. with reduced susceptibility (n=70) was determined by the pyrosequencing method. Results showed that the QRDR of the gyrA gene is an effective molecular indicator of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and presumably in Neisseria meningitidis, but not in all other Neisseria spp. This sequence was not unique for N. gonorrhoeae and seems unsuitable for species verification of N. gonorrhoeae. However, whether it is also possible to use this region for verification depends on the specificity of the primary screening method used.
