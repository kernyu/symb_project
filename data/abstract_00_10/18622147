IL-8 serum levels were measured in a group of 44 patients affected with Chronic Active Hepatitis (CAH) HCV+ at the beginning and end of peg-interferon plus ribavirin combined therapy. IL-8 levels were compared with those measured in a group of healthy controls. The patients were treated for 12 months, and then followed up for 6 months after the end of the therapy. IL-8 serum levels were detected by ELISA at the beginning and end of the therapy, and then at the end of the follow-up. IL-8 serum levels were significantly more elevated (p<0.01) in CAH HCV+ patients than in the healthy controls. Furthermore, IL-8 serum levels in those patients who subsequently showed a sustained virological response to the therapy, declined on treatment and maintained lower levels than in those who did not respond to therapy. Serum IL-8 can be considered and proposed as a non-invasive and predictive marker of response to combined PEG IFN alpha2b + Ribavirin in CAH HCV +.
