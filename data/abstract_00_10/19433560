The prevalence of transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug resistance in Angola in 2001 in 196 untreated patients was investigated. All subtypes were detected, along with unclassifiable and complex recombinant strains. Numerous new polymorphisms were identified in the reverse transcriptase and protease. Two (1.6%) unrelated patients harbored nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant viruses (mutations: M41L, D67N, M184V, L210W, T215Y or T215F, and K103N). Continued surveillance of drug resistance is required for maximization of ART efficacy in Angola.
