Besides their role as commensals on the skin and mucosal surfaces, staphylococci may be involved in a wide variety of diseases in animals. Staphylococcal infections in animals are mainly treated with antimicrobial agents and as a consequence, staphylococci from animal sources have developed and/or acquired resistance to the respective antimicrobial agents. Resistance statistics obtained from national monitoring programmes on staphylococci from cattle and pigs, but also from surveillance studies on staphylococci involved in diseases in dogs are reported and reviewed with regard to their comparability. This review mainly focusses on the genetic basis of antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci of animal origin. Particular attention is paid to resistance to those antimicrobial agents which are most frequently used in veterinary medicine, but also to antimicrobial agents, such as chloramphenicol and mupirocin, which are used in specific cases for the control of staphylococcal infections in pets and companion animals. In addition, plasmids and transposons associated with the respective resistance properties and their ways of spreading between members of the same or different staphylococcal species, but also between staphylococci and other gram-positive bacteria, are described.
