Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading opportunistic pathogen in human infections, and it is renowned for its intrinsic resistance to structurally and functionally unrelated antibiotics. Filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to depart from a normal growth phase and enter a stationary growth phase. As antibiotic concentrations decline below a therapeutic range, filamentous bacteria begin to divide normally, leading to a more rapid regrowth of the bacteria. Furthermore, filamentous bacteria are associated with an increase in endotoxin release. Moreover, the immune system of a patient needs to cope with uncharacteristic filamentous bacteria. Thus, it is biologically and clinically significant to study and understand bacterial filamentation. In this study, we investigate the frequencies, conditions, and characteristics of a filamentous P. aeruginosa at single cell and single chromosome resolutions. Our results show that filamentous cells (elongated rods) contain multiple copies of the cell's chromosome. It appears that the unsuccessful segregation of replicated chromosomes in an individual cell accompanies the formation of undivided filamentous cells. The quantity of chromosomes and the length of the filamentous wild-type cells increase as the chloramphenicol concentration increases to 50 and 250 microg/mL, suggesting that chloramphenicol induces the filamentation. Filamentation in three strains of P. aeruginosa depends on the expression level of efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol. This study also opens up the new possibility of real-time monitoring of modes of actions of antibiotics in live cells with both temporal and spatial resolution.
