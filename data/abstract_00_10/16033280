The oxazolidinones are a new class of synthetic antibacterials effective against a broad range of pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant strains. Linezolid is the first drug from this class to reach the market and has become an important new option for the treatment of serious infections, particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enteroccocus faecium (VRE). In the search for novel oxazolidinones with improved potency and spectrum, we have prepared and evaluated the antibacterial properties of conformationally constrained analogues in which the morpholine ring of linezolid is replaced with various substituted azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl ring systems. Several classes of azabicyclic analogues were identified with activity comparable or superior to that of linezolid. These include analogues bearing hydroxyl, amino, amido, or carboxyl groups on the azabicyclic ring. The azabicyclic acid analogue 50 was 4 times more potent than linezolid against key Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative pathogens (S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and E. faecalis MICs < or = 1 microg/mL; Haemophilus influenzae MIC = 4 microg/mL).
