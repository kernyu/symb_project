We have created a panel of recombinant HIV-1 infectious clones containing common patterns of reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations responsible for resistance to each of the currently available nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and we have submitted the panel to the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Programme. Testing the activity of new antiretroviral compounds against this panel of drug-resistant clones will determine their relative activity against many clinically relevant NRTI-resistant viruses.
