MexJK requires OprM for erythromycin efflux but not for triclosan efflux. Deletion of 15 OprM family outer membrane proteins (OMPs) revealed that only the TolC homolog OpmH functions with MexJK for triclosan efflux. This is the first report of natural utilization of multiple OMPs by a given resistance nodulation cell division transporter/membrane fusion protein pair.
