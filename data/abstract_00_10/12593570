One hundred strains of Enterococci obtained from various clinical specimens over a period of six months were speciated of which 56 were E. faecalis and 44 were E. faecium. Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern showed 90% of them were resistant to penicillin and 20% of them were resistant to vancomycin. Comparative evaluation of Beta-lactamase production by iodometric method and cloverleaf method showed that the latter was cost effective and easy to perform for routine use.
