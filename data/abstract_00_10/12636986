The susceptibility or resistance of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were determined by a method incorporating the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) and compared with results obtained by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards approved standard method (M24-T2). One hundred percent of all isolates demonstrated agreement between the susceptibility and resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol obtained by the two methods, suggesting that the XTT-based method could provide a useful means for the rapid determination of antimycobacterial susceptibility of clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis.
