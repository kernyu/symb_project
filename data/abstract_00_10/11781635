A 45-year-old matched unrelated BMT recipient had sequential mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infections. Five months after BMT, a penile lesion occurred and was cured using acyclovir, as expected from in vitro susceptibility results. The same lesion recurred 1 month later but worsened with acyclovir. The HSV isolate was resistant to acyclovir (IC(50) = 105 microM), and a nucleotide (G) was added to the thymidine kinase gene leading to a premature stop codon. The lesion improved markedly with foscarnet. During this treatment a second HSV infection occurred on the buttocks 2 weeks after the first one and healed completely with acyclovir. This course correlated with in vitro results of the buttock HSV isolate which was foscarnet-resistant (IC(50) = 300 microg/ml) and acyclovir-sensitive. Surprisingly, no mutation gene of the foscarnet-resistant isolate was detected in the DNA polymerase gene. This case shows that an HSV acyclovir-resistant infection may be followed by an acyclovir-sensitive one. Determination of antiviral susceptibility is needed to monitor the treatment of various HSV infections in immunocompromised BMT recipients.
