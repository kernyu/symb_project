BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium sp. is an extremely varied genus which includes little known species and of which only Corynebacterium diphteriae, Corynebacterium urealyticum and Corynebacterium jeikeium are considered indisputable pathogens. Other species, such as C. amycolatum are at present being reconsidered as causative agents in infectious pathologies, partly on account of our greater aquaintance and improved identification techniques for these microorganisms and partly on account of the growing number of immunocompromised patients in whom all their pathogenic capacity is usually able to develope. We present 3 cases of significant bacteremia by C. amycolatum. METHODS: Bacterial isoliations from blood culture were obtained using the Vital Systems. Identification was performed by means of Gran stain, colony morphology, the results of numerous biochemical tests (including the Api Coryne systems), the behaviour of the strains against the vibriostatic agent O/129 and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern obtained with the E-test. RESULTS: The three isolates of C. amycolatum were obtained from patients after a lenghtly hospitalization, multi-instrumentation and who had severe underlying disease. All three presented with concomitant isolates of C. amycolatum from other sites: sputum, wound and catheter respectively, which could explain the origin of the bacteremia. Colony morphology, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, resistance to the vibriostatic agent O/129 and the results of the biochemical test carried out were similar to those previously describe in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: C. amycolatum should be born in mind as a agent responsable for significant and severe pathology in this type of patient. In addition, it as certain specific characteristics which assits in its identification in the normal micr
