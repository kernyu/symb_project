Three nucleotide/nucleoside analogs are currently used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and entecavir. Lamivudine and adefovir are beneficial for oral administration and safety, but only a few of the patients treated experience a sustained response after therapy withdrawal. Entecavir, a cyclopentyl guanosine analog, is a potent inhibitor of chronic hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase, inhibiting both the priming and elongation steps of viral DNA replication. In phase II and phase III clinical trials, entecavir was found to be superior to lamivudine for all primary end points evaluated in both nucleoside-naive and lamivudine-resistant patients as well as being effective in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative nucleoside-naive patients. Only one trial has shown evidence of cases of viral resistance to this drug. The approved dosage in treatment-naive patients is 0.5 mg per day orally, whereas in patients who have failed lamivudine therapy or are known to harbor lamivudine-resistant mutants, the approved dosage is 1.0 mg per day.
