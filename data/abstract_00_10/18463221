In patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, intervention by infectious disease clinical pharmacists on the basis of the results of tests for mecA resulted in a 25.4-h reduction in the time to optimal antimicrobial therapy, from 64.7 +/- 36.8 to 39.3 +/- 15.5 h (P = 0.002), which may result in decreased mortality.
