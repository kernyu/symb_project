Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are plant defense proteins. To date, no spatial distribution of PGIPs and interaction between PGIPs and nitric oxide (NO) in plant were described. Here, we first reported the full-length cDNA sequence of PGIP of Chorispora bungeana (CbPGIP1). Notably, immunofluorescence localization showed that the CbPGIP was evenly distributed in leaves but it was mainly localized in epidermis and vascular bundle in stems and roots. Further studies indicated that CbPGIP had higher abundance in roots than in stems and leaves. Conversely, the bulk PGIP of C. bungeana showed a higher activity in leaves than in stems and roots. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that CbPGIP1 expression was induced by Stemphylium solani, salicylic acid (SA), 4, -4 degrees C and NO. This is a first report attempting to predict if NO can induce the PGIP expression. Taken together, these findings showed that the gene was spatially regulated and NO and SA might take part in CbPGIP1 expression induced by biotic and abiotic stresses. This study highlighted the potential importance of CbPGIP1 and NO in plant resistance.
