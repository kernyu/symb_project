We report a concurrent increase in the number of isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Newport and the rate of multidrug resistance in S. Newport isolates from animal and human populations in Minnesota. Antimicrobial susceptibility and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated heterogeneity of isolates and showed that 1 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis cluster contained most of the multidrug-resistant isolates with a resistance pattern and most class 1 integron isolates, implying the clonal origin of the isolates.
