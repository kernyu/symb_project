Dacron suture loops were demonstrated to be inert, consistent carriers in the presence of peracetic acid-based sterilants, whereas black silk sutures had a variable preparation process and interacted with peracetic acid. In addition, Dacron suture loops provided comparable spore loading to black silk suture loops and an HCI resistance of > or = 2 min. These results indicate that black silk suture loops are not appropriate carriers for assessing peracetic acid-based sterilants, and Dacron loops are an acceptable alternative. This finding is consistent with the Office of Science and Technology Laboratory (Center for Devices and Radiological Health) study which determined that "polyester suture material is a viable alternative to silk for the AOAC sporicidal test for liquid disinfectants."
