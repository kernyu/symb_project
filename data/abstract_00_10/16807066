The development of antimicrobial agents has been a key achievement of modern medicine. However, their overuse has led to an increasing incidence of infections due to antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Quantitative figures on the current economic and health impact of antimicrobial resistance are scant, but it is clearly a growing challenge that requires timely action. That action should be at the educational, ethical, economic and political level. An important first step would be to increase public awareness and willingness to take the necessary measures to curb resistance. Hence, studies are needed that would provide solid, quantitative data on the societal impact of antibiotic resistance. This review discusses the complexity of resistance, identifies its main drivers and proposes measures to contain it on a European scale.
