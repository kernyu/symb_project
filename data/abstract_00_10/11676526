This report describes a case of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in a patient with end stage liver disease in whom Leuconostoc spp. was isolated from blood and ascitic fluid. In common with several previously described patients with cultures positive for Leuconostoc from other body sites, this patient had recently received vancomycin. The antibiotic susceptibilities and mechanism of vancomycin resistance of this Gram-positive bacteria are reviewed.
