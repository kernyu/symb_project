The synthetic peptides Lfpep and kaliocin-1 include the sequences from positions 18 to 40 and 153 to 183 of human lactoferrin, respectively. Lfpep is a cationic peptide with bactericidal and giardicidal effects, whereas kaliocin-1 is a novel bactericidal peptide that corresponds to a highly homologous sequence present in the transferrin family of proteins. Both peptides presented fungicidal activity against Candida spp., including fluconazole- and amphotericin B-resistant clinical isolates. Lfpep exhibited higher antifungal activity (8- to 30-fold) and salt resistance than kaliocin-1. The killing activity of Lfpep was mediated by its permeabilizing activity on Candida albicans cells, whereas kaliocin-1 was unable to disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane, as indicated by its inability to allow permeation of propidium iodide and the small amount of K+ released. The amino acid sequence of kaliocin-1 includes the "multidimensional antimicrobial signature" conserved in disulfide-containing antimicrobial peptides and a striking similarity to brevinin-1Sa, an antimicrobial peptide from frog skin secretions, exhibiting a "Rana box"-like sequence. These features may be of interest in the design of new antifungals.
