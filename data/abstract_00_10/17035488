Isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) are two of the most important antituberculosis drugs, and resistance to both of these drugs can often result in treatment failure and fatal clinical outcome. Resistance to these two first-line drugs is most often attributed to mutations in the katG, inhA, and rpoB genes. Historically, the identification and testing of the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains takes weeks to complete. Rapid detection of resistance using the PCR-based Genotype MTBDR assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) has the potential to significantly shorten the turnaround time from specimen receipt to reporting of results of susceptibility testing. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine (i) the sensitivity and accuracy of the Genotype MTBDR assay for the detection of MTBC strains and (ii) the ability of the assay to detect the presence of INH and RIF resistance-associated mutations in katG and rpoB from samples taken directly from smear-positive clinical specimens. The results were compared with those obtained with the reference BACTEC 460TB system combined with standard DNA sequencing analysis methods for katG, inhA, and rpoB. A total of 92 drug-resistant and 51 pansusceptible smear-positive specimens were included in the study. The Genotype MTBDR assay accurately and rapidly detected MTBC strains in 94.4% of the 143 specimens and showed a sensitivity of 94.4% for katG and 90.9% for rpoB when used directly on smear-positive specimens. The assay correctly identified INH resistance in 48 (84.2%) of the 57 specimens containing strains with resistance to high levels of INH (0.4 microg/ml) and RIF resistance in 25 (96.2%) of the 26 specimens containing RIF-resistant strains.
