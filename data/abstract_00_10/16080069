Tigecycline is a new semisynthetic glycylcycline for the treatment of serious infections. Of the glycylcyclines, tigecycline is the most studied and appears to hold promise as a new antimicrobial agent that can be administered as monotherapy to patients with many types of serious bacterial infections. For patients with serious infections, the initial choice for empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial, and, if the choice is inappropriate, it may have adverse consequences for the patient. Tigecycline has been designed to overcome many existing mechanisms of resistance among bacteria and confers broad antibiotic coverage against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and many species of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Tigecycline has been efficacious and well tolerated in human clinical phase 2 studies, which warranted further evaluation of tigecycline in larger studies for treatment of many indications, including complicated skin and skin-structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and infections of the lower respiratory tract.
