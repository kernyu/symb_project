Hemolysis assays, using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant injury agent and sodium azide as a catalase inhibitor, were performed to evaluate how assay conditions affect the development of lysis resistant erythrocytes. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide should be carefully selected for use in hemolysis assays, as it was found to affect the number of water resistant erythrocytes.
