The API 20 Strep system was used to speciate 46 enterococcal isolates with vancomycin MICs between 16-32 microg/mL. All were identified as Enterococcus faecium. Further testing revealed that 42/46 isolates had been identified incorrectly. Enterococci with low-level vancomycin resistance should not be speciated solely with the API 20 Strep system.
