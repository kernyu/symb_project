Bacterial resistance to various antimicrobial agents is most common in areas with high usage of antibiotics such as in countries where over-the-counter availability promotes usage. In Lebanon, information about bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is limited. In this study, data on the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns have been collected for the last 7 years in addition to the first 6 months of 1996 at the Makassed General Hospital in Lebanon. Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species proved to have high but variable rates of multidrug resistance. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 17% were resistant to methicillin. A high percentage of resistance to penicillin (76-88%) was noted among Streptococcus pneumoniae. These resistance patterns were generally comparable with those of other medical centres.
