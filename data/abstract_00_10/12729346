To determine the rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis in The Gambia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates obtained from 225 patients during a nationwide survey were tested against isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin using the resistance ratio method. Only nine (4%) of the patients had strains that were resistant to one or more drugs. None of the patients with drug-resistant M. tuberculosis had previously been treated for tuberculosis. Drug-resistant tuberculosis is, as yet, not common in The Gambia. Periodic surveys for drug-resistant tuberculosis are recommended to monitor changes that may emerge over time.
