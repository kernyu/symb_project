OBJECTIVE: This study compared the hemodynamic responses elicited by the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), L-S-nitrosocysteine (L-SNC), the non-prostanoid EDRF released by acetylcholine (ACh) and nitric oxide (NO)-donors such as MAHMA NONOate, in conscious spontaneously hypertensive (SH) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. METHODS: The depressor and/or vasodilator responses elicited by intravenous injections of ACh, L-SNC and MAHMA NONOate were determined in adult WKY and SH rats before and after intravenous injection of the NO synthesis inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME), or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. RESULTS: The responses elicited by ACh and L-SNC were smaller in SH than in WKY rats whereas the responses elicited by MAHMA NONOate were augmented in SH rats. The ACh-induced responses were not diminished after injection of L-NAME in WKY or SH rats. Indomethacin did not affect the responses to any of the vasodilator agents in WKY or SH rats. Addition of L-SNC to whole blood or thoracic aortae from SH rats yielded similar amounts of NO to those of WKY rats. CONCLUSIONS: The vasodilator potencies of ACh and L-SNC were diminished whereas that of NO was augmented in SH rats. The loss of potency of L-SNC in SH rats was not obviously due to differences in decomposition to NO or the overactivity of cyclooxygenase factors. This study provides the first evidence that diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilation in SH rats may involve a loss of vasodilator potency of endogenous L-SNC.
