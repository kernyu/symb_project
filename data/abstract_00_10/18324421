A retrospective study was made on 37 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS). At the beginning, all patients were steroid sensitive but received more than one steroid course (median 4). Following several relapses, they became steroid dependent or steroid resistant. Group 1 consisted of 22 children [3 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 19 minimal-change NS (MCNS)] who received cyclophosphamide (CP) orally for 2.5 +/- 0.5 months. Group 2 consisted of 15 children (7 FSGS, 8 MCNS) who received cyclosporine-A (CSA) for 28 +/- 15 months. The level of proteinuria decreased significantly and remained low during the follow-up. The relapse-free period was significantly longer in the CP group (CP 30 +/- 21.5; CSA 26.2 +/- 18 months, p < 0.001). The relapse rate decreased significantly in both groups and remained in this lower level during the follow-up (from 3.4 +/- 2.8 to 0.1 +/- 0.2/year in group 1, and from 3.7 +/- 3.1 to 0.6 +/- 0.8/year in group 2). At the end of the 5-year follow-up, 20/22 patients (90.9%) and 10/15 patients (66.6%) were in remission in groups 1 and 2 respectively, with or without treatment (p < 0.05). In the long term, both CP and CSA is effective second-line therapy following steroid monotherapy in INS patients, but the relapse rate was lower and the relapse free period was significantly longer in the CP-treated group.
