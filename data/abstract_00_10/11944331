A higher rate of glucose oxidation by antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus and gonococcus strains has been established; at the same time the sensitive strains are characterised by more intensive oxidation of pyruvate and acetate as compared with the resistant strains. High rate of lactate accumulation by antibiotic-resistant strains has been marked for the studied staphylococci strains. Antibiotic-resistant strains of gonococci are characterised by more intensive accumulation of acetate as the end product of glucose catabolism. No significant differences were revealed for the stable and sensitive strains of gonococci as to the rate of acetate involving in metabolic processes, but a steady tendency to the increase of acetate consumption intensity is observed.
