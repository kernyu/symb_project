Preexposure of Bifidobacterium longum NCIMB 702259T to cholate caused increased resistance to cholate, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin. The B. longum ctr gene, encoding a cholate efflux transporter, was transformed into the efflux-negative mutant Escherichia coli KAM3, conferring resistance to bile salts and other antimicrobial compounds and causing the efflux of [14C]cholate.
