SETTING: Seoul, Korea, a country with an intermediate tuberculosis (TB) burden and low prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of ofloxacin (OFX) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and to assess whether short-term use of fluoroquinolones (FQNs) induces ofloxacin-resistant M. tuberculosis. DESIGN: The subject cohort consisted of 2788 patients with culture-confirmed TB with drug susceptibility testing data; only four were HIV-positive. The patients were divided into two groups: those who were or were not recently exposed to FQNs. RESULTS: Of the 2788 isolates, the rates of OFX resistance were 1.1% and 8.5% in initially treated and retreated patients, respectively (P < 0.05). Of the 94 OFX-resistant isolates, 83 (88.3%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR). There was no difference in rates of OFX resistance throughout the study period, or between the FQN-exposed (1/39, 2.6%) and control groups (93/2749, 3.4%). The median duration of FQN treatment was 7 days (range 1-47 days). One OFX-resistant isolate in the FQN-exposed group was MDR. CONCLUSION: The rate of OFX-resistant M. tuberculosis was low and stationary throughout the study period in Korea. Most OFX resistance was accompanied by MDR, and the frequency of OFX-resistant M. tuberculosis was low in subjects taking short-term FQNs.
