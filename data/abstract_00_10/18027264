AIMS: To analyse antimicrobial susceptibility and serotypes of group B streptococcus (GBS) bloodstream isolates from different patient groups. METHODS: Susceptibility to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin was measured for 99 bloodstream GBS isolates collected between October 2000 and July 2005. Multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assays were used to identify macrolide resistance genes and capsular serotype for each isolate. Clinical correlation was obtained from chart review. RESULTS: Adult bacteraemia accounted for 84 of 99 (85%) isolates, and were usually associated with underlying diseases such as diabetes, malignancy and renal failure. Overall mortality was 10%. Known macrolide resistance genes [ermB (2), ermA/TR (3) and mefA/E (2)] were detected in seven of eight erythromycin resistance isolates. Four of these isolates expressed MLSB phenotype, two with constitutive (ermB) and two with inducible (ermA/TR) clindamycin resistance. Of four M phenotype isolates, two had mefA/E, one had ermA/TR and one had no detectable macrolide resistance genes. Serotype III was significantly more common in neonatal isolates; serotype V was more common among adult isolates and was associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: mPCR/RLB is a rapid molecular method to identify GBS serotype and macrolide resistance genes. This is the first major study correlating these characteristics with demographic data for invasive isolates.
