The recent worldwide surge in the incidence of fatal pneumonia caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has generated renewed interest in this well-known organism. We describe two cases of fulminant bacteraemic pneumonia due to CA-MRSA at the National University Hospital in Singapore and provide further epidemiological descriptors of this potentially-deadly disease. The first patient was an 83-year-old woman while the second was a 71-year-old man, none of whom had risk factors for hospital-acquired MRSA colonisation. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by this organism. Adequate empirical antimicrobial coverage for this important pathogen should be considered.
