Thalidomide produces a response rate from 32 to 66% of pre-treated myeloma patients with doses ranging from 100 to 800 mg/daily. Common, dose-related side effects are sedation, constipation, polyneuropathy. Increased incidence of thromboembolic events were observed in myeloma patients receiving thalidomide as front-line therapy or in association with chemotherapy. Less common adverse reactions are central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and cutaneous reactions. We describe the update of our experience with low dose thalidomide plus monthly high dose dexamethasone and zolendronate. Most patients were able to tolerate this regimen with few side effects. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) lowering was early observed in patients who subsequently responded.
