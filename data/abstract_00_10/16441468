BACKGROUND: Current 'rescue' therapies provide inadequate Helicobacter pylori eradication rates because of antibiotic resistance. AIM: To test the efficacy of a modified triple regimen combining rifabutin, pantoprazole and amoxicillin as rescue therapy for patients in whom eradication of H. pylori had failed standard clarithromycin-based triple therapy. METHODS: One hundred and thirty patients (mean age 51.7 +/- 14.8 years) who had failed one or more eradication attempts with omeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin were treated for 12 days with rifabutin 150 mg daily, amoxicillin 1 g or 1.5 g t.d.s, and pantoprazole 80 mg t.d.s. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat and per-protocol eradication rates were 90.8/90.8%. Metronidazole or/and clarithromycin resistance had no significant impact on H. pylori eradication rates. A higher overall eradication rate of 96.6% (95% CI: 92.1-101%) was obtained in patients treated with a regimen containing 1.5 g amoxicillin t.d.s compared with 90.7% (95% CI: 82-98.6%) using a regimen with 1 g amoxicillin t.d.s but the difference was not significant. Side-effects reported in 40% of patients were mild. CONCLUSION: A 12-day course of low dose of rifabutin with an increased dose of amoxicillin and pantoprazole is well-tolerated and highly effective against dual-resistant H. pylori infection after failure of triple therapy.
