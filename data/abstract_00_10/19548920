In the present study, the incidence and antimicrobial resistance patterns of the microorganisms that caused bloodstream infections (BSIs) in a medical-surgical intensive care unit during the years 2005-2007 were determined. The mean BSI incidence density was 6.56 per 1000 patient-days. The incidence density increased linearly during the study period (from 3.57 to 9.60 per 1000 patient-days). Staphylococcus aureus was most frequently isolated (47.3%), followed by Enterococcus spp. (10.8%) and Candida spp. (10.1%). There was a high rate of resistance to several of the prescribed antimicrobials among the bacteria isolated from patients with BSIs.
