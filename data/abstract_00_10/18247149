This study compared pharmacokinetic profiles in cattle dosed subcutaneously with two different formulations of enrofloxacin (5% and 10%) at a dose of 5 mg/kg. Plasma concentrations of enrofloxacin and its active metabolite, ciprofloxacin, were determined by a HPLC/u.v. method. The pharmacokinetic parameters of enrofloxacin and its metabolite were similar in both injectable formulations. Enrofloxacin peak plasma concentration (5%: 0.73 +/- 0.32; 10%: 0.60 +/- 0.14 microg/mL) was reached at 1.21 +/- 0.52 and 1.38 +/- 0.52 h to 5 and 10%, respectively. The terminal half-live and area under curve were 2.34 +/- 0.46 and 2.59 +/- 0.46 h, and 3.09 +/- 0.81 and 2.93 +/- 0.58 microg x h/mL, to 5 and 10%, respectively. The AUC/MIC(90) and Cmax/MIC(90) ratios for both formulations exceed the proposed threshold values for optimized efficacy and minimized resistance development whilst treating infections or septicaemia caused by P. multocida and E. coli.
