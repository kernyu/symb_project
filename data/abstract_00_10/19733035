In this study, we investigated the distribution of genes encoding various carbapenemases as well as their association with carbapenem resistance in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter genomic species from Taiwan. A total of 129 imipenem-non-susceptible and 79 imipenem-susceptible isolates were examined, of which 185 (88.9%) were Acinetobacter baumannii. Among the 185 A. baumannii isolates, imipenem non-susceptibility was more common in isolates with ISAba1-bla(OXA-51-like) (72/75; 96%), bla(OXA-58-like) (33/33; 100%) or bla(OXA-24-like) (7/7; 100%) than in isolates with only bla(OXA-51-like) (4/72; 5.6%). A metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) gene was present in two isolates of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii, and bla(OXA-58-like) was also present in these isolates. A total of 18% and 1% of imipenem-non-susceptible isolates of A. baumannii were resistant to tigecycline and colistin, respectively. Among the 23 isolates of non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp., bla(OXA-58-like) and MBL genes were widely disseminated in the imipenem-resistant isolates, and isolates with bla(OXA-58-like) and MBL genes had higher imipenem minimum inhibitory concentrations than those with bla(OXA-58-like) alone. Although the rate of non-susceptibility to colistin was 26.7% among the imipenem-non-susceptible isolates of non-baumanniiAcinetobacter, 93.3% and 100% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and tigecycline, respectively. In conclusion, different isolates of imipenem-non-susceptible A. baumannii and non-baumanniiAcinetobacter contained different carbapenemases and had different antimicrobial susceptibilities.
