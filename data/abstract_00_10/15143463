The association between minor mutations in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease at baseline and development of common primary mutation 90M at virological failure (conferring some resistance to all protease inhibitors [PIs]) was evaluated in 93 previously drug-naive patients experiencing failure of their first PI-based antiretroviral regimens. In logistic regression analysis, the probability of accumulating a new 90M mutation at virological failure was associated with the presence at baseline of minor mutation 36I (naturally occurring in approximately 25% of HIV clade B and in >80% of HIV non-clade-B viruses) (adjusted odds ratio, 13.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.89-95.6]; P=.009) and, possibly, of 10I/V. This suggests a potential role for the presence of 36I at baseline in predicting the appearance of 90M at virological failure.
