The emergence of Staphylococcus aureus strains with intermediate resistance (VISA) and heterogen resistance (hVISA) to vancomycin leads to the occurence of severe therapeutic problems. The aim of this study was to investigate the vancomycin resistance in methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) isolated from clinical samples in Bacteriology Laboratory of Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology Department of Celal Bayar University Faculty of Medicine, Manisa (located in western Anatolia, Turkey). A total of 120 staphyloccoccal strains (92 MRSA and 28 MRCoNS) isolated from different clinical specimens (tracheal aspirate, blood, abscess, wound swabs, sputum, catheter tips, etc) between the period of June 2005 to December 2006 were included to the study. Vancomycin resistance were determined by agar screening method using brain hearth infusion agar plates containing 6 microg/mL vancomycin. Standard E-test and macro E-test methods were performed for 17 (14%) staphylococcal strains (10 MRSA and 7 MRCoNS) which had grown in agar screening plates. Vancomycin and teicoplanin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of those strains were found as 1.5-4 microg/mL and 2-4 microg/mL, respectively, by standard E-test method. In our study, no VISA and hVISA isolates were detected when MIC value of > or =8 microg/mL for vancomycin and teicoplanin, or > or =12 microg/mL for teicoplanin only were accepted as the criteria for hVISA determination. Agar screening method which is preferably used in routine laboratories for practical and economical reasons, lower sensitivity and specificity than E-test. It can be concluded that, since agar screening method is not reliable for the detection of vancomycin resistance, further multi-center studies with the use of standard methods are needed in order to clarify the vancomycin resistance patterns of staphylococci in our country.
