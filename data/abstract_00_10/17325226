We showed that a Candida albicans petite mutant in which oxidative phosphorylation is uncoupled was eightfold more resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole than SC5314 but equally susceptible to ketoconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B. Strain P5 significantly overexpressed MDR1, which likely accounts for the decreased drug susceptibility.
