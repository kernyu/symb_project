Mycobacterium leprae DNA gyrases carrying various mutations, previously described in clinical strains, were investigated for quinolone susceptibility by inhibition of supercoiling and DNA cleavage promotion. We demonstrated that the gyrA mutations leading to G89C or A91V confer fluoroquinolone resistance whereas the gyrB mutation leading to D205N does not.
