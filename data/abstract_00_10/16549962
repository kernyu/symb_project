OBJECTIVE: We compared the immunological and clinical outcomes of lamivudine monotherapy and complete therapy interruption in the treatment of HIV-1-infected patients harbouring lamivudine-resistant virus. METHODS: This 48-week, open-label pilot study randomly assigned HIV-infected patients receiving lamivudine-containing HAART and harbouring the M184V mutation to monotherapy with lamivudine 300 mg once daily (lamivudine group) or the discontinuation of all antiretroviral drugs (TI group). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of immunological or clinical failure; immunological failure was defined as the first report of a CD4 T-cell count less than 350 cells/microl, and clinical failure as the occurrence of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grade B or C event. The data were analysed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: By week 48, 20 of 29 patients in the TI group (69%; 95% CI 51-83%) and 12 of 29 in the lamivudine group (41%; 95% CI 26-59%) had discontinued the study because of immunological or clinical failure, which was significantly delayed in the lamivudine group (P = 0.018). Only patients in the TI group (6/29, 20.7%) experienced grade 3-4 clinical adverse events at least possibly related to HIV-1 (P = 0.02). The mean decline in CD4 cell percentage, viral rebound and recovery of HIV-1 replication capacity were significantly lower in the lamivudine group. The 24-week virological and immunological response after therapy resumption in patients who prematurely discontinued the study was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: In HIV-1-infected patients harbouring a lamivudine-resistant virus, lamivudine monotherapy may lead to a better immunological and clinical outcome than complete therapy interruption.
