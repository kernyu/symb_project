Induction of ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) proteins involved in chloride transport has been proposed as a possible mechanism of the beneficial effects of azithromycin (AZM) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. This study focused on the effects of AZM on mRNA and protein expression of Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 1 (MRP1) and Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 (MDR1) by real-time quantitative PCR, flow cytometry and gene reporter assays in two CF and two isogenic non-CF airway epithelial cell lines. We detected higher levels of MRP1 and lower levels of MDR1 mRNA in CF versus non-CF cells while both proteins were not differentially expressed. After AZM treatment we found modest differences in MRP1 and MDR1 mRNA expression while protein levels were unaffected. The ability of AZM to regulate MRP1 promoter transcriptional activity was excluded by gene reporter assays. Our data do not support the hypothesis of induction of ABC transporters by AZM.
