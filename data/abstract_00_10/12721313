Interpretation of the mupirocin E-test for low-level mupirocin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains has been improved by adding the indicator dye tetrazolium. E-tests were compared with agar dilution methods for assessing mupirocin susceptibility. MICs obtained by the agar dilution method and E-tests showed 89.3% agreement within 2 log(2) dilution criteria. The agreement between MICs increased to 100% in the 1 log(2) dilution definition when the indicator dye tetrazolium was added to the E-test. The use of the E-test with tetrazolium reduction is more accurate for determining mupirocin MICs for S. aureus strains.
