We report a heart transplant recipient with Rhodococcus equi and Cryptococcus neoformans infection. Despite an initially relapsing course and the acquisition of resistance in vivo, the patient responded to 5 months of linezolid and 6 months of fluconazole. This is the 1st R. equi infection to be cured with linezolid in a heart transplant recipient.
