The effectiveness of antibacterial agents against 70 strains of clinically isolated multiple-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) was measured by the micro dilution method. Fifty of all strains (71%) produced metallo-beta-lactamase and the IMP-1 gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The MIC90 (the minimum inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic necessary to inhibit the growth of 90% of bacterial strains) values of biapenem (BIPM), meropenem (MEPM), tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), sulbactam/ cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), cefepime (CFPM), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), pazufloxacin (PZFX), amikacin (AMK) and aztreonam (AZT) were found to be 265, 512, 256, 512, 512, 64, 128, 128 and 128 microg/mL, respectively. The in vitro combination effects of antibacterial agents were examined against 62 strains of MDRP and the synergy or additive effects were evaluated by fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index calculated by the checkerboard method. The combination of AMK and AZT showed synergy effects on 15/59 (25.4%) strains of MDRP. The synergy and additive effects on the MDRP strains were also found by the other antibacterial agents combination such as TAZ/PIPC and AMK, CFPM and AMK, and SBT/CPZ and AZT. These results suggested the necessity of further investigation of clinical usefulness.
