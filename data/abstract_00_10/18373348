The thermostability parameters of three tetracycline antibiotics at high and ultrahigh temperatures (110-140 degrees C) as well as the influence of treatment medium pH and water activity on their thermotolerance have been investigated. The thermal degradation of the three antibiotics followed a first-order reaction kinetic within the 1.5-2 log(10) cycles investigated. A linear relationship was observed between the log of the DT values and the treatment temperature. The temperature dependence of the DT values was similar for the three molecules (z=28+/-2 degrees C). DT values of doxycycline were approximately 1.5 and 3 times higher than those of tetracycline and oxytetracycline, respectively. Changes in the treatment medium pH (7.0-4.0) and water activity (0.99-0.93) scarcely varied the antibiotics' thermal stability. Only when doxycycline was heat-treated at pH 4.0 did its thermal resistance increase by 3 times. The thermostability parameters obtained would allow the effect of different cooking and sterilization procedures to be estimated. Whereas low-temperature-long-time treatments (conventional sterilization) would destroy >98% of the initial concentration of the residues of the three antibiotics, high-temperature-short-time treatments (UHT) would leave unaltered residues in the 50-90% range.
