Background. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the occurrence of Gram-positive microorganisms isolated from patients hospitalized in the Department and Clinic of Rehabilitation at the Rydygier Medical University in Bydgoszcz. Materials and methods. The material analyzed consisted of 533 clinical samples collected from patients hospitalized in 2000-2001. The study included 485 Gram-positive bacterial strains isolated from clinical material. Morphological characteristics provided the basis for the identification of bacteria. The species were identified by using API 20 STREP and API STAPH tests (bioMerieux). The isolates were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk-diffusion method. Results. The most often isolated bacteria were Enterococcus spp. (46,8%) and Staphylococcus spp. (31,5%), followed by Corynebacterium spp. (9,1%) and Streptococcus spp. (6,6%). The most frequently identified Enterococcus species were E. faecalis (92,9%) and E. faecium (7,1%). All the Enterococcus strains were susceptible to glycopeptides. More than 90% of the Enterococus isolates were sensitive to nitrofurantoine, about 44% to high concentrations of gentamycin, 17,9% to ciprofloxacin. During this period, and S. simulans, and 21 strains of S. auerus (46,7%). 92% of all the tested CNS strains (80%) than in the S. aureus isolates (10%). Conclusions. The most frequently observed bacterium was E. faecalis, which showed significant resistance to quinolones and to high level aminoglycosides. The CNS strains showed a high level of resistance to methicilline. All these strains were susceptible to glycopeptides.
