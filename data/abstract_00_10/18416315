Lonidamine (1-[2,4-dichlorophenyl methyl]-1H indazole-3-carboxylic acid), Ind, is an antitumoral drug acting on mitochondria and glucose metabolism. Cell growth and metabolic effects of Ind and drug post-treatment effect were investigated in undifferentiated HT-29 human colonic carcinoma cell line which requires high glucose medium concentration for growth. 0.2 mM Ind significantly decreased cell spreading and growth in monolayer or agar cell culture. After drug treatment cell growth was reestablished to control value within 24 h. Ind modified glycoconjugates and mannose-receptor distribution (analyzed by confocal microscopy), while glucose-glycogen and protein synthesis were not affected, these being the possible reasons for the fast reversible effect.
