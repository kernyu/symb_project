In the study of the microbiocenosis of the distal section of the patients' large intestine Bacillus strains with antilysozyme activity (ALA) were isolated. In B. cereus strain 26 with pronounced expression of antilysozyme factor the plasmid sized approximately 100 kb was detected. The transformation of the isolated plasmid in cells of B. cereus non-plasmid strain IP5832 the localization of genes encoding ALA and resistance to kanamycin was determined. The production of ALA factor in the recombinant clone of B. cereus strain IP5832 corresponded to the clinical isolate of B. cereus 26. The replicon of the detected plasmid could be used for the determination of the coding sequence of the antilysozyme sign of bacilli. Genetic determinants of antilysozyme factors and kanamycin resistance may be used for the construction of vector systems of cloning in bacilli.
