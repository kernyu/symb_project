The in vitro activity of 22 antibiotics (including novobiocin) and beta-lactam/gentamicin combinations was assessed against 11 multidrug-resistant pneumococcal strains. Among orally administered drugs, only telithromycin, levofloxacin, and linezolid were active against all isolates, but their use is not indicated in pediatrics. Novobiocin could be a potential therapeutic alternative.
