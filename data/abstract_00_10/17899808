Conjugative transfer of 20-kb chromosomal fragment carrying genes encoding tetracycline (tet(r)) and lincomycin (lin(r)) resistance in the soil strain Bacillus subtilis 19 is described. Transfer was preceded by this fragment insertion into the large conjugative pl9cat plasmid producing a hybrid plasmid. Insertion frequency was 10(-4)-10(-5). Then genes tet(r) and lin(r) were transferred to the recipient strains. The transfer of chromosomal genes inserted into the plasmid and plasmid gene cat occurred sequentially and resembled sexduction, which represents chromosomal gene transfer by F'- and R' plasmids during conjugation in Escherichia coli and other gram negative bacteria.
