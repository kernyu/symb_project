We studied the sensitivity of the hospital environmental bacterial strains to Surfanios, which is a detergent and disinfectant product for surfaces. This product is used in our establishment since nearly 10 years. This work which relates to 425 bacterial strains proposes to study the possible evolution of the resistance of the bacteria under the pressure of a product biocide used since many years without the change of active ingredient as recommended in pharmaceutical and agroalimentary industry. We developed a micromethod to study the sensitivity of many bacterial strains simultaneously into a 96 wells microplaque. All the Staphylococcus aureus strains (N = 20) and Staphylococcus with coagulase negative (N = 308) as 78 Acinetobacter sp. strains remain very sensitive to Surfanios according to our study. Target dilution, which is the last dilution not allowing the bacterial growth, is much lower than the manufacturer recommended use dilution. For the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains tested, target dilution is equal or higher than the dilution of use. Rather than to propose the rotation or the alternation of the products, we recommend the use of Surfanios for the bionettoyage of dry surfaces which might be contaminated by Staphylococcus sp. or Acinetobacter sp. and the use of another product or Surfanios at a higher concentration, active on Pseudomonas sp. to disinfect wet surfaces which are possible reservoirs for the opportunist bacteria of the hydrous flora.
