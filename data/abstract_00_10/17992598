Since streptozotocin (STZ) exhibits beta-cell toxicity, mediated through diverse mechanisms, multiple toxin resistance can be expected in insulin-secretory cells rendered STZ-resistant. RINm5F, but not all cell lines surviving STZ treatment, possess higher insulin content than native parental cells and additional tolerance against alloxan. To understand the impact of STZ tolerant cell selection on toxin resistance and insulin-secretory function, STZ-resistant BRIN-BD11 cells were generated by iterative acute exposure to 20 mM STZ. These cells, denoted BRINst cells, exhibited resistance to toxic challenges from STZ, H(2)O(2), and ninhydrin. Insulin content and both glucose and arginine-stimulated insulin secretion were significantly enhanced in BRINst cells. The toxin-resistance of BRINst cells was gradually lost during continuous cultivation without STZ challenge. However, enhanced insulin secretory capacity at high passage in BRINst cells persisted. Although total SOD activity was decreased, catalase activity was increased and appeared to be important for the ninhydrin and STZ resistance of BRINst cells. This was associated with reductions of both STZ- and ninhydrin-induced DNA damage, although DNA repair was abolished. Further characterization of cells exhibiting multiple toxin tolerance and an enhanced insulin secretory function could provide useful lessons for understanding of beta-cell survival.
