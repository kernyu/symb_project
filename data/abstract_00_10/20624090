The genus Corynebacterium includes a high number of species that are usually isolated from human skin as saprophytes. However, these microorganisms have also been reported as infectious agents in a broad group of patients and have showed broad-spectrum resistance. We studied the susceptibility profiles against macrolides, clindamycin, and streptogramins of 254 clinical strains belonging to the species Corynebacterium urealyticum (120), Corynebacterium amycolatum (66), Corynebacterium jeikeium (17), Corynebacterium striatum (20), Corynebacterium coyleae (12), Corynebacterium aurimucosum (11), and Corynebacterium afermentans subsp. afermentans (8). The MLS(B) phenotype was detected in 186 strains and was associated with the presence of methylase enzymes codified by the erm(X) gene in 171 strains. The erm(B) gene was only detected in two C. urealyticum strains. Fourteen strains showed macrolide resistance, but they did not carry erm genes. mef genes were not detected despite eight C. amycolatum strains showed the M phenotype. Also, the presence of hydrolytic enzymes codified by ere(B) was evaluated, but all results were negative. Resistance to macrolide in Corynebacterium sp. is mainly due to the presence of erm(X) methylase, although other resistance mechanisms could be involved.
