The Aspergillus fumigatus DeltapmrA (Golgi apparatus Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) P-type ATPase) strain has osmotically suppressible basal growth defects and cationic tolerance associated with increased expression of calcineurin pathway genes. Despite increased beta-glucan and chitin content, it is hypersensitive to cell wall inhibitors but remains virulent, suggesting a role for PmrA in cation homeostasis and cell wall integrity.
