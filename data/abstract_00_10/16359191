The rising prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is a phenomenon observed to different degrees around the world. The present national surveillance study report analyzes a total of 16,756 strains of S. pneumoniae collected across France in 1999. The overall prevalence of S. pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to penicillin was 44%, to amoxicillin 26%, and to cefotaxime 17%. The proportion of high-level resistant strains to penicillin (MIC > 1 mg/L), amoxicillin and cefotaxime (MIC > 2 mg/L) remained low: 12.3%, 1.8%, and 0.4% respectively. Prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was high: 53% to erythromycin, 41.7% to cotrimoxazole, 31.8% to tetracycline, and 24.6% to chloramphenicol. Prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae varied according to subject age and specimen source. It was higher in children (52.7%) than in adults (39.8%) and higher in strains isolated from middle ear fluid (63.6%) than from blood cultures (41.8%) in children. S. pneumoniae resistant to other antibiotics were more common in children than in adults, although figures showed geographical variations. Comparison with a previous study realized in 1997 in the same regions confirms a rising trend in the prevalence of resistant bacteria. Therefore, we conclude that prevalence of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae in 1999 continued to rise in France, although strains with high-level resistance to penicillin remained stable.
