Recombinant human myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) was successfully expressed by an Escherichia coli expression system. After immunization and cell fusion, a mouse hybridoma (3C2) producing MAbs to MxA was established. Hybridoma 3C2 was further characterized using indirect ELISA, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescent staining, and immunoprecipitation. The ELISA results showed that the titer of 3C2 was between 1:6400 and 1:12800 in ascitic fluids. The isotype of the monoclonal antibody was tested to be IgG1kappa. 3C2 can also specifically recognize human MxA protein in various formats by Western blot analysis, immunofluorescent staining, and immunoprecipitation assay. We further demonstrated that 3C2 could be used to detected MxA expression induce by type I interferon in A549 cell line and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Western blot in a dose-dependent manner.
