We investigated the effect of a primary non-lethal infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) on the course and outcome of a secondary infection with the Gram-negative Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium or the Gram-positive Listeria monocytogenes in mice. We found that at each stage of the viral infection the susceptibility of mice to bacterial super-infections changes dramatically and depends also on whether the secondary infection is a Gram-positive or Gram-negative one. The study shows that the outcome of the secondary infection is determined by a delicate balance between the overproduction of and the hypersensitivity to inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma), as well as by the changes in blood leukocytes occurring in mice in the course of viral infection.
