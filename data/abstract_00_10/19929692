Performing admission surveillance cultures is a resource-intensive strategy to identify asymptomatic patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization. We measured VRE prevalence among children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Targeted surveillance captured 94% of VRE-colonized children and may be an effective strategy to identify VRE carriers and facilitate pediatric infection prevention strategies.
