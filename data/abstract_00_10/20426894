An experiment was conducted to assess the mucosal response to low-dose superimposed challenge with Ancylostoma ceylanicum. Hamsters were assigned to five treatment groups (1-5 respectively): naive controls; primary immunizing infection controls; challenge controls; immunized, anthelmintic-treated, challenged group; immunized, superimposed challenge group. Group 4 hamsters were resistant to challenge, whereas most of the challenge inoculum larvae established in Group 5. Villus height and crypt depth measurements were initially markedly divergent between these two groups but over time post-challenge (pc) values for both parameters drew nearer and by day 31 pc they were indistinguishable. The greatest change was experienced by Group 4 which showed increasing inflammation and gut pathology during the challenge infection. Mitotic activity in crypts and mast cell counts in the mucosa were highest in Group 5 on day 10 pc, but there was little to distinguish between Groups 4 and 5 by day 31 pc. Goblet cell, eosinophil and Paneth cell counts were very similar throughout in both groups but, in the case of Paneth cells, they were consistent with a possible role in protective immunity to challenge. Some adult worms survived throughout the period of intense inflammation, emphasizing their tremendous resilience and resistance to mucosal host protective responses.
