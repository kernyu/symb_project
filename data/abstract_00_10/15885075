Clinical observations of non-melanoma skin cancer in immunocompromised patients, such as organ transplant recipients, suggest co-operative effects of human papillomavirus (HPV) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The aim of the present study is to evaluate UV sensitivity and DNA damage formation according to antioxidant status in HPV16-infected keratinocytes. We used SKv cell lines, infected with HPV16 and well characterized for their proliferative and tumorigenic capacities. We showed that SKv cell lines presented various E6* (a truncated form of E6) RNA levels. We demonstrated that the higher oncoprotein RNA expression level was associated with a higher resistance to solar-simulated radiation, more specifically to UVB radiation and to hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, this high resistance was associated with a low oxidative DNA damage formation after UV radiation and was related to high glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase activities. Therefore, the results of our study suggest that E6* levels could modulate the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase pathway providing a mechanism to protect HPV-infected keratinocytes against an environmental oxidative stress, such as UV radiation.
