Newer fluoroquinolones may play an important role in the management of community acquired pneumonia. They retain activity similar to older fluoroquinolones against Gram-negative bacteria and are significantly more active against Gram-positive bacteria, especially pneumococci. They are also active against bacteria causing atypical pneumonia, penicillin-sensitive and -resistant and macrolide-sensitive and -resistant pneumococci and against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing Haemophilus influenzae. They have similar or slightly lower activity than ciprofloxacin against other Gram-negative organisms. They have rapid bactericidal activity and attain good lung tissue levels. Clinical studies show results similar or better than older treatments. Their impact on ecology and resistance remains to be elucidated but data on side effects and toxicity must be carefully evaluated.
