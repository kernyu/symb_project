The pharmacodynamic profile of ertapenem was evaluated in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive and ESBL-negative clinical strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied. MICs ranged from 0.0078 to 0.06 microg/ml with standard inoculum tests. Ertapenem doses were administered once to five times daily to achieve various exposures, reported as the percentage of the dosing interval that the concentration of free ertapenem was in excess of the MIC (%T>MIC(free)). Mean values for the static exposure and 80% maximally effective exposure (ED(80)) were 19% (range, 2 to 38%) and 33% (range, 13 to 65%) T>MIC(free), respectively. Differences in exposure requirements based on the presence of an ESBL resistance mechanism or bacterial species were not evident. In addition, experiments using a 100-fold higher inoculum did not decrease the magnitude of the reduction in bacterial density from baseline achieved compared to lower-inoculum studies. The pharmacodynamic parameter of %T>MIC(free) correlated well with bactericidal activity for all isolates, and the static and ED(80) exposures are consistent with those reported previously for carbapenems.
