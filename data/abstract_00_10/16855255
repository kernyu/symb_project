The largest family of solute transporters (major facilitator superfamily [MFS]) includes proton-motive-force-driven secondary transporters. Several characterized MFS transporters utilize essential acidic residues that play a critical role in the energy-coupling mechanism during transport. Surprisingly, we show here that no single acidic residue plays an irreplaceable role in the Escherichia coli secondary multidrug transporter MdfA.
