In order to investigate the susceptibility of mixed infection of Ureaplasma Urealyticum (UU) and Mycoplasma Hominis (MH) to 7 kinds of antimicrobial agents and comparison with that of UU infection in NGU patients, the in vitro susceptibility was determined by using microdilution method. The positive results were analyzed. The results showed that the sequence of susceptibility to 7 kinds of antimicrobial agents for both UU infection group and UU-MH mixed infection group was almost the same from the highest susceptibility to the lowest accordingly: Josamycin, Doxycycline, Minocycline, Sparfloxacin, Roxithromycin, Ofloxacin and Azithromycin. The total drug resistance rate for UU-MH mixed infection group (97.67%) was significantly higher than that for UU infection group (44.67%, P < 0.01). The highest drug resistance rate in UU group and UU-MH mixed infection group was 31.33% (Ofloxacin) and 90.48% (Azithromycin) respectively. UU-MH mixed infection showed an increased drug resistance and changes of drug resistance spectrum.
