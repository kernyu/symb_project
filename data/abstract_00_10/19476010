The antimicrobial activity of hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of the aerial parts of S. sandrasicus P.H.Davis (Asteraceae), endemic to Sandras mountain (Turkey), were determined. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts on microorganisms including multi-resistant staphylococci were evaluated using the disc diffusion method. The strains of multi-resistant staphylococci and the other standart bacteria were inhibited by some extracts. The volatile organic compouds of S. sandrasicus was determined by Gas Chromatography (GC) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The major compounds of hexane extract were aromadendrene oxide 2 (13.3%), spathulenol (12.5%) and beta-caryophylene (11.8%), respectively.
