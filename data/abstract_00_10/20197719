BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial susceptibility of Legionella spp. has rarely been studied in Korea. Therefore, we aimed to determine the susceptibility of Legionella spp. to various antibiotics. METHODS: We assessed the antimicrobial susceptibility of 66 environmental and clinical Legionella isolates collected between January 2001 and December 2008 from Korea and Japan. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 6 antibiotics, namely, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, gatifloxacin, and gemifloxacin were determined by the broth microdilution method using buffered starch yeast extract broth. RESULTS: The MIC ranges of the 6 antibiotics used against the Legionella isolates were as follows: 0.004-0.062 microg/mL (azithromycin), 0.002-0.5 microg/mL (ciprofloxacin), 0.004-0.5 microg/mL (clarithromycin), 0.12-4 microg/mL (clindamycin), 0.002-0.12 microg/mL (gatifloxacin), and 0.008-1 microg/mL (gemifloxacin). CONCLUSIONS: Legionella spp. isolates from Korea and Japan were most susceptible to gatifloxacin. Azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and gemifloxacin were also effective for treating legionellosis.
