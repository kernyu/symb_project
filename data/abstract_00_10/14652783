The ability of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains to induce a respiratory burst in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) was investigated. Ninety ESBL-producing and 178 non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were serotyped and their ability to induce a respiratory burst in PMNLs tested by monitoring the cells' chemiluminescence (CL) response. The percentage of isolates inducing high levels of CL response (CL>75%) was significantly higher among non-ESBL producers (52%) than among ESBL producers (32.2%) ( P<0.0001; OR=3.396; 95%CI=2.036-5.664). The median CL response was significantly higher among the non-ESBL producers (76.9%) than among the ESBL producers (52.6%) ( P=0.034). The two groups did not differ in their ability to resist intracellular killing by PMNLs ( P>0.05), with strains inducing high levels of CL response having significantly lower survival rates (31.8% vs. 42.4%) than strains inducing low levels of CL response (164% vs. 200%) ( P<0.01). The frequencies of the K2 and the K25 serotypes were significantly higher among ESBL-producing strains (17.8% and 22.2%, respectively) than among the non-ESBL producers (6.2% and 1.7%, respectively) ( P=0.0057 and P<0.0001). Of the 77 Klebsiella K serotypes, 71 were detectable among the non-ESBL producers, but only 24 were detectable among the ESBL producers. ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains might have a greater pathogenic potential by virtue of their ability to escape the phagocytic activity of PMNLs.
