We have established that CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 5mers, of sequence type CGNNN (N = A, G, C or T), rapidly induce apoptosis/cell cycle arrest in human leukaemia lines. The 5'-CpG is obligatory for these effects. Induction of apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells did not require new protein synthesis and was insensitive to the caspase 3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, although the latter abrogated DNA laddering, phosphatidylserine externalization and collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. A subline of MOLT-4 cells, MOLT-4CpGR, was selected for acquired resistance to CpG 5mers. Differences in gene expression between MOLT-4 and MOLT-4CpGR cells were identified following three independent reciprocal cDNA subtractions, consensus selection and virtual cloning through targeted display. Several known genes were implicated in the action of or resistance to CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 5mers. Their protein products listed below immediately suggest cell signalling pathways/processes worthy of further investigation in elucidating the mechanism of CpG 5mer activity: caspase 2, the transcription factors Atf4, Hic, HoxB3 and Rqcd1, the splicing factors Rbmx, Sfrs5 and Sfrs7, the DNA replication factors Mcm5 and Brd4, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, annexin A1, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 and three enzymes involved in protein ubiquitylation, Siah1, Gsa7 and Nin283.
