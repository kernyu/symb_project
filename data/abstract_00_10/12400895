Single-drug prophylaxis is recommended after tuberculin skin test conversion, but not when there is active disease on chest radiograph because resistance develops frequently. Isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis developed in a physician receiving prophylaxis despite "faint left upper lobe soft tissue density" on chest radiograph. Ignoring active disease on chest x-ray renders this strategy counterproductive and cost ineffective.
