Eighteen patients received tigecycline as treatment for infection due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli, including Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase- and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Pretherapy minimum inhibitory concentration values for tigecycline predicted clinical success. Observed evolution of resistance during therapy raises concern about routine use of tigecycline in treatment of such infections when other therapies are available.
