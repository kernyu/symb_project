Fifty-one 1-(cyclopropyl/tert-butyl/4-fluorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-nitro-4-oxo-7-(substitute d secondary amino)-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acids were synthesized and evaluated for antimycobacterial in vitro and in vivo against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB), multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MC2) and also tested for the ability to inhibit the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase from M. smegmatis. Among the synthesized compounds, 1-tert-butyl-1,4-dihydro-7-(4,4-dimethyloxazolidin-3-yl)-6-nitro-4-oxo-1,8-naphth yridine-3-carboxylic acid (10q) was found to be the most active compound in vitro with an MIC of 0.1 microM against MTB and MDR-TB and was 3 and 455 times more potent than isoniazid against MTB and MDR-TB, respectively. In the in vivo animal model 10q decreased the bacterial load in lung and spleen tissues with 2.39 and 3.89-log10protections respectively at the dose of 50 mg/kg body weight.
