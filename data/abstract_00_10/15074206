The data, obtained as a result of the protective systems state (immunity, hemostasis, organism natural resistance) investigation in 20 patients with complicated course of necrotic pancreatitis, are adduced. There was determined, that the lowering of the oxygen dependent and oxygen independent functions of neutrophils, the lysosomic cationic proteins content correlates significantly with course of diseases severity. High concentration in the blood serum of anti-inflammatory cytokines (the leucocytes depression phenomenon) in combination with the oxygen dependent and oxygen independent function of phagocytes depression constitutes the criterion of complicated and unfavourable course of necrotic pancreatitis. Theoretical substantiation of the results is presented.
