To explore the possibility of leukemia cell line of both bcr-abl and mdr-1 positive were cross-resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 and its reversal way, the inhibitory effect of STI571 on K562-n/VCR cells was detected with MTT method and reverse effects of CsA, TAM, IFN-alpha and CsA cominated with IFN-alpha were observed. The results showed that K562-n/VCR cell line expressing bcr-abl and mdr1 positive was resistant to STI571, and could be reversed by 5.18, 1.82 and 1.67-fold respectively, when treated with CsA, TAM, and IFN-alpha. It could be reversed by 34.87-fold with combination of half-dose CsA and IFN-alpha. In conclusion, amplification of mdr1 gene may contribute to drug-resistance of bcr-abl positive leukemic cells against STI571. The reversal agents, CsA, TAM and IFN-alpha show obviously reverse effects on drug-resistance. The combination of half-dose of both CsA and IFN-alpha display stronger effect than the full dose of either.
