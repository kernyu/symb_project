N-pyrazole and N-1,2,4-triazole derivatives of 2,4-dihydroxythiobenzamide prepared from sulfinyl-bis-(2,4-dihydroxythiobenzoyl) and commercially available azole amines were tested for their antimycotic activity. The chemical structure of compounds was confirmed by IR, 1H NMR, MS and elemental analysis. The MIC values against the reference strain Candida albicans ATCC 10231, azole-resistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans and non-Candida albicans species were determined for their potential activity in vitro. The compounds exhibited comparable or higher activity than itraconazole and fluconazole tested under the same experimental conditions. Pyrazoline derivatives showed higher activity than other analogues. The strongest fungistatic activity for N-(2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-5-oxo-5H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2,4-dihydroxythiobenz amide was found with MIC values significantly lower than those for the studied drugs.
