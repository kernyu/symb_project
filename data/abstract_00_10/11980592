Resistance of microbes to commonly used antibiotics became a major concern at the end of the last century. Because Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen in respiratory infections, we conducted microbiological assessment of drug susceptibility patterns among strains collected from two different population groups: 1) adult and pediatric patients (375 isolates) with different infections, and 2) healthy children in day care centers (<5 years old; 350 isolates). High level resistance to penicillin was not identified in either group. Intermediate resistance levels were similar in both groups (adults: 9.9%; children: 9.2%). The Central West region of Brazil tended to have lower susceptibility of S. Pneumoniae from infected adults and children to penicillin (81% vs. 93% in the South and 90% in the Southeast), tetracycline (64% vs. 80% and 76%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (14% vs. 34%). Susceptibility was similar among strains from nasal cultures of healthy children tested in each of 4 regions of Brazil. All isolates were susceptible to cefaclor, cefotaxime and amoxacillin/clavulanate. This study, in two distinct populations, allowed characterization of local microbiological resistance patterns. This data is expected to be of use in guiding empiric therapy in the different regions of Brazil.
