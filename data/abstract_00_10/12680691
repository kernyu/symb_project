Hantaan virus (HTN) is a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Little is known of its pathogenesis or the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to HTN infection. In the present study, DNA microarray technology was used to monitor changes in mRNA levels after HTN infection, to elucidate resistance mechanisms to viral infection by understanding virus-host interactions. We found that several interferon (IFN)-inducible genes were up-regulated in host cells infected with HTN. According to previous available data, IFNs have been reported to be inhibitory, but their mode of action has not been yet clear. In this study, the 2',5'-oligoadenylated synthetase (OAS) and Mx1 genes, not a double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), of the IFN response pathways are associated with antiviral activity during HTN infection. Furthermore, A549 cells treated with IFN-alpha were protected against HTN infection. Taken together, these results confirmed that IFN plays a role in cellular defenses against HTN infection at an early stage of the infection and revealed the resistance mechanism for HTN infection.
