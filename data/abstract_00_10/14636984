To determine which pathogens are responsible for bloodstream infections in Bangui and to which antibiotics these pathogens are resistant, we conducted a prospective study of the bacteria isolated from the blood of febrile patients hospitalized in the department of medicine of the Bangui Community Hospital after the failure of antimalarial treatment. One hundred and thirty-one patients were included in this study. Bacteria were identified in 49 blood cultures (37.4%). Eleven different species were identified. Bacteremia was more frequent in HIV-positive patients than in HIV-negative patients. Salmonella typhimurium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Eighty percent of enterobacteria were resistant to amoxicillin and 85% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were the most efficient antibiotics for the enterobacteria, but chloramphenicol and gentamicin were efficient in most cases. Some strains of S. pneumoniae displayed reduced susceptibility to penicillin G, but all strains were susceptible to erythromycin.
