Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. One important source of this pathogen for nosocomial infections is the nasal carriage of S. aureus among hospital personnel. There are only a few studies investigating the carriage of S. aureus in a community of medical students. Oral and nasal flora of 179 medical students with varying clinical exposures were determined. Oral cultures revealed no nosocomial pathogen and nasal cultures showed an increasing rate of S. aureus carriage with increasing clinical exposure. Methicillin resistance also demonstrated a tendency toward increasing with increasing clinical exposure.
