PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an update on the diagnosis and management of skin, soft-tissue, and osteoarticular infections in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Our understanding of the epidemiology of skin and soft-tissue infections and osteoarticular infections is changing rapidly. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has become a predominant cause of childhood skin and soft-tissue infections. Kingella kingae is also increasingly identified as a cause of osteoarticular infections. Challenges in Staphylococcus aureus treatment and Kingella kingae identification are changing the approach to skin and soft-tissue infections and osteoarticular infections. SUMMARY: Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be considered a cause of skin and soft-tissue infections. Empiric antimicrobial choices should be modified in areas in which there is a more than 10% prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. Decontamination of shared sports equipment should be undertaken to minimize person-to-person spread. No established guideline for eradication of carriage of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus exists. Kingella kingae is a more prevalent cause of osteoarticular infections than previously recognized and can cause outbreaks of invasive infection via person-to-person transmission. Modification of culturing procedures for osteoarticular infections including inoculation of infected joint fluid and bone in blood-culture bottles should be considered.
