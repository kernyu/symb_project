By the 1960s, several reports of bacteria with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics were published. In recent years, the problem of antibiotic resistance has magnified. In the treatment of respiratory tract infections, the development of resistance is of particular concern; 67% of antibiotic use in adults and 87% in children is for the treatment of such infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and is a frequently isolated bacterial species in patients with other respiratory tract infections. Increasing levels of resistance may have important implications in the clinical setting. Physicians need to consider local susceptibility data, in addition to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of compounds, when selecting appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections.
