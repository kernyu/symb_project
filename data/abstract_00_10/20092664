In this case-control study, cases [community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), n=79] and controls [community-associated methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (CA-MSSA), n=36] were defined as a laboratory-confirmed infection in a patient with no previous hospital-associated factors. Skin and soft tissue were the predominant sites of infection, both for cases (67.1%) and controls (55.6%). Most of the cases (79.7%) and controls (77.8%) were aged <30 years. Investigations did not reveal any significant statistical differences in acquiring a CA-MRSA or CA-MSSA infection. The most common shared risk factors included overcrowding, previous antibiotic usage, existing skin conditions, household exposure to someone with a skin condition, scratches/insect bites, and exposure to healthcare workers. Similar risk factors, identified for both CA-MRSA and CA-MSSA infections, suggest standard hygienic measures and proper treatment guidelines would be beneficial in controlling both CA-MRSA and CA-MSSA in remote communities.
