Synercid (quinupristin/dalfopristin), the first semi-synthetic injectable streptogramin, is a promising alternative to glycopeptides against many Gram-positive multiresistant bacteria. Vancomycin is still considered an effective agent for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections but therapeutic failures with glycopeptides have been observed, even for the treatment of infections caused by S. aureus strains sensitive to vancomycin. Synercid, in combination with a glycopeptide, may address this problem without causing significant side effects due to the different toxicity patterns of the 2 antimicrobials. This study reports our experience with the combination of Synercid and vancomycin in 5 patients with severe infection caused by MRSA or methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.
