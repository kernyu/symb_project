The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced morbidity and mortality in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, prolonged treatment with combination regimens can be difficult to sustain because of problems with adherence and toxic effects. Treatment with antiretroviral agents--protease inhibitors in particular--has uncovered a syndrome of abnormal fat redistribution, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, collectively termed lipodystrophy syndrome (SLHIV). Nowadays, no clinical guidelines are available for the prevention or treatment of SLHIV, and its cause have yet to be totally elucidated. This review emphasizes the clinical features and the data from previous studies about the SLHIV taking into account that a better understanding of this syndrome for HIV specialists, cardiologists and endocrinologists is fundamental for the disease control.
