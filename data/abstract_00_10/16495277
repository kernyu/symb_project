Development of in vitro resistance to GW640385, a new human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor, was studied. Variants characterized included one with <4-fold resistance and amino acid substitutions Q58E/A71V (protease) and P452K (Gag) and one with >50-fold resistance and amino acid substitutions L10F/G16E/E21K/A28S/M46I/F53L/A71V (protease) and L449F/P453T (Gag). The A28S substitution substantially reduced replication capacity.
