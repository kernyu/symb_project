Adefovir dipivoxil is an up-to-date drug for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Adefovir dipivoxil is a lipophilic prodrug of adefovir, an analogue of adenosine monophosphate (AMP). It suppresses efficaciously the replication of the hepatitis B virus and of other viruses. After conversion to its active metabolite, it can inhibit both DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase. It is well absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, its bio-availability is approx. 59%, it is distributed to most tissues and eliminated by the kidneys. There are no known clinically significant drug interactions. The recommended dose is 10 mg/day; in patients with renal impairment the dose must be adjusted. Treatment has to continue for at least one year. Compared with lamivudine, adefovir resistance develops more slowly. Virus resistant to lamivudine is sensitive to adefovir and vice versa. The efficacy and safety of this treatment have been verified in four published clinical trials with more than one thousand patients, including patients with decompensated cirrhosis prior to and after liver transplantation. In these patients there was an improvement of several virological, biochemical and clinical markers. The drug is well tolerated. Seen adverse side-effects were gastrointestinal disorders, headache and a mild to moderate increase in serum creatinine. There are no specific contraindications to the therapy, with the exception of hypersensitivity. However, there are only insufficient data on the administration of the drug to pregnant women and to children. Adefovir dipivoxil offers a new treatment possibility for patients presenting a chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus, especially those infected with a lamivudine-resistant virus. Key words: adefovir dipivoxil-chronic hepatitis B-hepatitis B virus-lamivudine.
