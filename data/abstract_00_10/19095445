The synthesis and antibacterial activities of three chemotypes of DNA supercoiling inhibitors based on imidazolo[1,2-a]pyridine and [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine scaffolds that target the ATPase subunits of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (GyrB/ParE) is reported. The most potent scaffold was selected for optimization leading to a series with potent Gram-positive antibacterial activity and a low resistance frequency.
