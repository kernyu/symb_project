Albendazole and metronidazole were compared in 68 patients diagnosed positive for giardiasis. Albendazole 1200 mg, one dose was given to 24 patients, albendazole 400 mg twice a day for 3 days was given to 23 patients, and metronidazole 400 mg 3 times a day for 5 days to 21 patients. Response to therapy was monitored by clinical examination and analysis of fresh faecal samples on days 0, 3, 7 and 10. Response to the single dose of albendazole was 55%, to the divided dose of albendazole 70%, and to metronidazole 84%. The results show that albendazole, originally recommended for helminthic infection, can also be used in patients with mixed protozoal infection or for infections resistant to metronidazole.
