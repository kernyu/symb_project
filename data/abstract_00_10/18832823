BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae is an important human pathogen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The purpose of the present retrospective study is to describe the antibiotic susceptibility to several common antibiotics of 930 consecutive clinical isolates of H. influenzae over the period of 1996-2005 in a tertiary general hospital on the island of Crete, Greece. RESULTS: Overall, 9.5% of the isolates were beta-lactamase producing. Resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate was observed in 11 and 0.6% of the strains, respectively, remaining stable throughout the study period. Resistance to tetracycline increased from 1.6% in 1996 to 38% in 2005, while resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin was <1%. A significant decrease in resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed during the study period. No significant changes in resistance to other antimicrobials were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin-clavulanate and older quinolones remain potent agents against H. influenzae. Constant surveillance ofantibiotic susceptibility of H. influenzae clinical isolates is important in order to guide appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.
