We present an imipenem lysate metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) functional assay. This assay eliminates false-positive results due to the bactericidal effects of EDTA, can be performed with inexpensive reagents available in most laboratories, and is as accurate as the MBL Etest. It is appropriate for both high-accuracy screens and laboratories in developing countries with limited resources.
