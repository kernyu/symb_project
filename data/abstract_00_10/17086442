The efficacy of melatonin, glutathione, serotonin, minocycline, lipoic acid and ascorbic acid in counteracting the toxicity of paraquat in Drosophila melanogaster was examined. Male Oregon wild strain flies were fed for 5 days with control food or food containing the test substance. They were transferred in groups of five to vials containing only filter paper soaked with 20 mM paraquat in 5% sucrose solution. Survival was determined 24 and 48 h later. All the substances assayed increased the survival of D. melanogaster. At equimolar concentrations (0.43 mM) melatonin was more effective than serotonin, lipoic acid and ascorbic acid. However, lower concentrations of glutathione (0.22 mM) and minocycline (0.05 mM) were as efficient as melatonin. The highest survival rate (38.6%) after 48 h of paraquat treatment was found with 2.15 mM of lipoic acid. No synergistic effect of melatonin with glutathione, serotonin, minocycline, lipoic acid and ascorbic acid was detected.
