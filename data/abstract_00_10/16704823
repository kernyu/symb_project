Patients treated in Peru for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were followed-up for a median of 67 months. Among 86 patients considered cured after completion of treatment, 97% remain healthy; 1 patient relapsed. Employment increased from 34% before treatment to 71%. We observed favorable long-term outcomes among MDR-TB patients.
