Sporicidal test results obtained from carriers inoculated with 4 types of defined Bacillus subtilis spore preparations were compared with the standard AOAC sporicidal test using soil extract nutrient broth (SENB) B. subtilis 19659 spores. Recoveries of spores inoculated on penicylinders from B. subtilis clean spores (washed and suspended in water) and B. subtilis 19659 spores inoculated from culture filtrates according to the AOAC method were compared. Spores were exposed to 6 concentrations (0.5-3.0% w/v) of glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for 10 h. Concentrations were established by titrimetry and liquid chromatography. Recoveries of surviving spores were determined for 3 types of clean B. subtilis var. niger preparations, one clean B. subtilis 19659 preparation, and the SENB B. subtilis 19659 filtrates. Spore carriers, inoculated by the standard AOAC protocol, resulted in as much as a 2-log number difference in runs 1-12, but not more than 0.5 log number for each clean spore preparation. The SENB spores varied most in resistance to glutaraldehyde, with no growth in recovery media from 3 different batches of 1, 1.5, and 2% glutaraldehyde. Separate batches of SENB preparations of B. subtilis 19659 were resistant and destroyed by 1.0% glutaraldehyde, with 3.98 and 6.0 log numbers of spores on penicylinders, respectively. Clean spore preparations of B. subtilis 19659 on porcelain penicylinders were more resistant to glutaraldehyde than were SENB spores. Nutrient agar/Mg/Ca and nutrient agar/Mg spore preparations of B. subtilis var. niger showed the most uniform resistance to glutaraldehyde. Spores with calcium added showed increased resistance to glutaraldehyde. B. subtilis 19659 spores from the Columbia broth spore preparation were the most resistant and were recovered after exposure to 3.0% glutaraldehyde.
