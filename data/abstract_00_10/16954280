The performance of a gp41 assay, created using reagents designed for use with the OpenGene DNA Sequencing System, was evaluated using a panel of plasma samples obtained from enfuvirtide-naive and -experienced human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected subjects. Resulting sequence data were highly accurate compared to a "home brew" assay and clonal sequence analysis.
