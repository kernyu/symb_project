With the continuing development of clinical drug resistance among bacteria and the advent of resistance to the recently released agents quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid, the need for new, effective agents to treat multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive infections remains important. This review focuses on agents presently in clinical development for the treatment of serious multidrug-resistant staphylococcal, enterococcal and pneumococcal infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Agents to be discussed that affect the prokaryotic cell wall include the antimethicillin-resistant S. aureus cephalosporins BAL9141 and RWJ-54428, the glycopeptides oritavancin and dalbavancin and the lipopeptide daptomycin. Topoisomerase inhibitors include the fluoroquinolones gemifloxacin, sitafloxacin and garenoxacin. Protein synthesis inhibitors are represented by the ketolides telithromycin and cethromycin, the oxazolidinones and the glycylcycline tigecycline. Although each of these compounds has demonstrated antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, their final regulatory approval will depend on an acceptable clinical safety profile.
