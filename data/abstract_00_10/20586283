The new model of obtaining of ovoid resting forms Mycobacterium smegmatis, which are morphologically different from vegetative (rod-like) cells, was developed. Ovoid forms were characterized by a drastically decreased level of metabolic activity, an increased stability to heat processing and antibiotics action, and also by prolonged (more than 2 months) storage time preserving colony-forming ability. Obtained resting forms of mycobacteria may be used in test-systems for checking efficiency of new medical agents against latent forms of tuberculosis and determination of role of these of those genes in entering rest state.
