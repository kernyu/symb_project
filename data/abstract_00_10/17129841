A survey on clinical isolates from urine samples was conducted and the data obtained were analyzed to determine the most common bacterial causes of urinary tract infection in the Gaza Strip and to evaluate the sensitivity patterns to selected antimicrobials that are commonly used to treat such pathogens. Urine samples were taken for culture from inpatients and outpatients at Al-shifa hospital in Gaza. Urinary tract pathogens were identified and their susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined. Of the 4778 processed urine samples, only 1637 were recorded as positive (34%) and only 1283 were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Escherichia coli was the most frequent uropathogen (42%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (12.2%), Pseudomonas spp. < (10.2%), other Gram-negative bacilli (8%), b hemolytic streptococci (7.6%), Enterococcus spp. (6.9%), other Staphylococcus spp. (including S . saprophyticus) (6.5%), Proteus (4.5%), S. aureus (2.1%). Resistance to antimicrobials was extremely alarming. E. coli resistance to amoxicillin reached 97.9%, to piperacillin 78.3%, to doxycycline 90%, to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 63.9% and to cefaclor 42.2%.
