PURPOSE: Previous studies indicated that ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporters protect against UV-induced apoptosis. We investigated the effect of UVB and X-ray irradiation on the export function of these ABC transporters in primary lymphocytes and various cancer cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used rhodamine accumulation assays in various human malignant cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Cells were irradiated with up to 960 mJ/cm2 and up to 50 Gy of UVB and X-ray, respectively. RESULTS: We demonstrated that UVB as well as X-ray irradiation inhibit the export function of the ABC transporters in a dose-dependent fashion. For PBL, this effect did not correlate with an apoptotic phenotype. In the case of the tumor cell lines, even though the irradiation-induced inhibition of membrane transporters was accompanied by phosphatidylserine exposure, only a minority of cells had lost their mitochondrial membrane potential during the observation period. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inhibition of membrane transporters is not a general feature of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Irradiation inhibits the export function of ABC transporters. Although some of the irradiated cells undergo apoptosis following irradiation, the inhibition is an unique feature accompanying irradiation and not a general hallmark of apoptotic cell death. The inhibition of drug export by irradiation may offer new potential for reverting multidrug resistance of cancer cells.
