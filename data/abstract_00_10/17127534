Antibiotics are enormously important for the humane and efficient production of food animals. These benefits are somewhat offset by the human and animal health antibiotic resistance risks posed by their use in animals. This article provides an overview of what we have learned about antibiotic resistance as an issue in animal agriculture and where that knowledge could lead us in the future. To preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics, more action is needed to ensure their prudent use, particularly in the case of antibiotic growth promoters and antibiotics deemed critically important for human and animal health.
