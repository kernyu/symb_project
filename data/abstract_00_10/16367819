Yeast strains obtained from blood cultures and catheters from intensive care units (ICU) and hospitalised oncology paediatrics were studied. Yeast were the first cause of catheter colonisation (51/627), and the third cause of bloodstream infection (44/6065). In catheter, the most frequent species were Candida albicans (34%), C. parapsilosis (27.7%) and C. tropicalis (15%). In blood, C. albicans (40.8%), C. parapsilosis (26.6%), C. tropicalis (15%). Malassezia furfur and Malassezia sympodialis were isolated from catheters from ICU patients. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, 88.8% to itraconazole and 91.9% to fluconazole. Candida albicans and C. tropicalis strains resistant to fluconazole and itraconazol were detected. These results reveal a change in the predominant role of C. albicans as cause of candidemia in hospitalised children and the emergence of antifungal resistant species. These variations emphasise the importance of performing a permanent surveillance to observe and assess them.
