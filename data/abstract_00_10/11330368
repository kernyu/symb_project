Through a retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 2517 consecutive patients with HIV disease hospitalized since 1991, 13 patients were identified (0.52%), who suffered from a confirmed Enterobacter spp. infection (urinary tract disease in 7 cases, sepsis in 4 patients, and pneumonia in 2 cases). A severe immunodeficiency was recognized in all cases, as expressed by a mean CD4+ lymphocyte count <60 cells/microL, and frequently, a prior diagnosis of AIDS. Bloodstream infection proved linked to a lower mean CD4+ cell count, a more frequent occurrence of leukopenia-neutropenia, and nosocomial origin of the infecting pathogen. Hospital-acquired Enterobacter spp. disease was more frequent than community-acquired, and was significantly associated with leukopenia-neutropenia, and a diagnosis of AIDS. Antibiotic susceptibility assays showed a resistance rate to ampicillin and cephalothin involving >90% of tested strains, and a higher (but varied) sensitivity to other beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and cotrimoxazole. Adequate chemotherapy provided clinical and bacteriological success in all evaluated patients, in the absence of mortality or relapses. Only 34 episodes of HIV-associated Enterobacter spp. infection have been reported to date in 11 different literature studies. Our data point out that also Enterobacter spp. organisms may have an appreciable pathogenic potential in patients with HIV disease, especially in those with a low CD4+ lymphocyte count, leukopenia-neutropenia, who are hospitalized. Despite the unpredictable antibiotic susceptibility profile of these organisms, HIV-related Enterobacter spp. disease may be properly managed through rapid identification and timely and appropriate antimicrobial treatment.
