Standardized susceptibility testing fails to predict in vivo resistance of device-related infections to antimicrobials. We assessed agents and combinations of antimicrobials against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) retrieved from device-associated infections. Isolates were grown planktonically and as biofilms. Biofilm cultures of the organisms were found to be much more resistant to inhibitory and bactericidal effects of single and combination antibiotics than planktonic cultures (P < 0.001). Rifampin was the most common constituent of antibiotic combinations active against staphylococcal biofilms. Other frequently effective antimicrobials were vancomycin and fusidic acid. Susceptibility testing involving biofilm-associated bacteria suggests new options for combination antibiotic therapy.
