Nocardia farcinica is the most clinically significant species within the Nocardia asteroides complex. Differentiation of N. farcinica from other members of N. asteroides complex is important because this species characteristically demonstrates resistance to several extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Traditional phenotypic characterization of this species is time- and labor-intensive and often leads to misidentification in the clinical microbiology laboratory. We previously observed a 409-bp product for all strains of N. farcinica by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis with the primer DKU49. In this investigation, the 409-bp fragment was sequenced and then used to design a specific primer pair, Nf1 (16-mer) and Nf2 (16-mer), complementary to the 409-bp fragment. PCR amplification of genomic DNA from 28 N. farcinica isolates with Nf1 and Nf2 generated a single intense 314-bp fragment. The specificity of the assay with these primers was verified, since there were no PCR amplification products observed from heterologous nocardial species (n = 59) or other related bacterial genera (n = 41). Restriction enzyme digestion using CfoI and direct sequencing of the 314-bp fragment further confirmed the specificity of the assay for N. farcinica. This highly sensitive and specific PCR assay provides a rapid (within 1 day of obtaining DNA) method for identification of this medically important emerging pathogen. Rapid diagnosis of N. farcinica infection may allow for earlier initiation of effective therapy, thus improving patient outcome.
