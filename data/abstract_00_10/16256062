Multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains are an increasing problem in endemic areas and are partly responsible for the worsening malaria situation around the world. New cheap and effective compounds active in combination with available drug in the field are urgently needed. The aim of this work was to explore the potential antiplasmodial effect of flavonoid derivatives on parasites growth in vitro. In vitro antiplasmodial activity of dehydrosilybin and 8-(1;1)-DMA-kaempferide has been evaluated by real time PCR for five P. falciparum strains. Both revealed significative antimalarial activity against the different strains. Since this drug family has been largely used and well-tolerated in humans, flavonoid derivatives could be in the near future associated with already available drugs in order to delay the spread of P. falciparum resistance.
