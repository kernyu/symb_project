The effects of chloramphenicol on microorganism in marine sediment were studied by spiked experiments in this paper. The results showed that high concentrations of chloramphenicol could inhibit the activities of microorganism in sediment, and that the growth of strains Pseudomons and Acinetobacter in sediment that can degrade organic matters were inhibited apparently. Furthermore, the resistance of heterotrophic bacteria in sediment had developed due to the use of antibacterials. Based on the above results potential environmental effects of antibacterials on microorganism in marine sediment were analyzed.
