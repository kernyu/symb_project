Four hundred and thirteen oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria were recovered from six freshwater giant prawn farms with a history of oxytetracycline use. Most oxytetracyclineresistant isolates were Gram-negative bacteria. Six groups of oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria were classified using cluster analysis based on a comparison of levels of oxytetracycline resistance. Complex fingerprint patterns were obtained for 71 isolates studied. In general, the band patterns of isolates from different ponds were very similar, and the data indicated that the isolates were closely related. The exploration for crossresistance found that most of the 71 oxytetracycline-resistant isolates were also resistant to tetracycline and chlortetracycline, but had a relatively low resistance to doxycycline. Many isolates showed higher chlortetracycline resistance than oxytetracycline resistance. Additionally, the oxytetracyclineresistant isolates were examined for the presence of tetracycline resistance (tet) genes. Fifty percent of the isolates carried one of the 14 known tet genes examined. The most common determinants were TetA and TetD. However, TetB, TetC, TetE, TetK, TetL, and TetM were also found with various frequencies.
