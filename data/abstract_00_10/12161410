The Burkholderia cepacia complex is a diverse group of human pathogens that cause life-threatening lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic granulomatous disease, and in patients requiring intensive care. Most previous antimicrobial susceptibility studies of these bacteria were performed before recent major revisions in the taxonomy of these bacteria. We determined the in vitro susceptibility of 65 B. cepacia complex isolates from clinical and environmental sources, representing six genomovars. Although intrinsic resistance is considered to be a common feature of the B. cepacia complex, MICs of individual antimicrobials varied widely and resistance was not exhibited by all members of the group.
