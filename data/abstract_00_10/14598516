The rehabilitative phase should be monitored at outpatient units of a day hospital. To prevent cross MBT infection with drug resistance to essential ATD and to efficiently use expensive reserve drugs, it is necessary to set up specialized inpatient units (wards) for treatment and rooms for outpatient receipt of patients who isolate drug-resistant MBT strains.
