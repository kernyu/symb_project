We have investigated the mechanism of resistance of leukemia cells to Ara-C using an in-house cDNA microarray designed for the analysis of leukemia cells. We produced Ara-C-resistant cells from the CCRF-CEM (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) cell line and compared their gene-expression profile with that of wild-type cells. The adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene was highly up-regulated in Ara-C-resistant cells, while equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and several cell-cycle-related genes were down-regulated. Of all these genes, ENT1 seemed the most likely to be relevant to Ara-C resistance. To investigate the role of ENT1 in Ara-C-resistant cells, we transfected the cells with the gene. ENT1-transfected Ara-C-resistant cells resembled wild-type CCRF-CEM cells more closely than untransfected Ara-C-resistant cells in terms of growth rate, Ara-C-uptake characteristics, and ADA expression levels. The down-regulation of the ENT1 gene is expected to result in nucleotide deficiency in addition to blockage of Ara-C influx. Accordingly, Ara-C-resistant cells showed low growth rates, which were restored by transfection with ENT1. These low growth rates were also correlated with the phosphorylation level of cell-cycle checkpoint kinase 2. In this study we identified down-regulation of ENT1 as the factor responsible for Ara-C resistance, and this knowledge may be used to devise a clinical regimen that will overcome the resistance.
