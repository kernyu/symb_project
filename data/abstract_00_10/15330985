The agar dilution method was used to determine the inhibitory activity of 25 antimicrobial agents against 69 strains of Dichelobacter nodosus and 108 strains of the genus Fusobacterium, all of which were isolated from 90 clinical cases of ovine footrot between October 1998 and November 2000. In the case of the micro-organisms belonging to the genus Fusobacterium, the six beta-lactams studied (benzyl penicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and cephalexine) proved to be, in general, the most effective antimicrobial agents. Chloramphenicol, clindamycin and doxycycline were also quite active against Fusobacterium spp. With regard to the 69 strains of D. nodosus tested, the levels of resistance remain low.
