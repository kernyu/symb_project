Recently, concern has increased regarding the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community. We studied 812 subjects from central Italy to establish the rates of nasal carriage of S. aureus, and antibiotic susceptibility patterns, in the community. The prevalence of S. aureus nasal carriage was 30.5%. Only one subject, with predisposing risk factors for acquisition, was identified as carrier of MRSA (prevalence of 0.12%). The presence of MRSA in the community of our area still appears to be a rare event. Among methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates, a surprisingly high rate (18%) of resistance to rifampin was observed.
