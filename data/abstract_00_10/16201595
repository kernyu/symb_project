Three men, aged 39, 73, and 66 years, respectively, developed an infection with a new strain ofClostridium difficile, ribotype 027.C.difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) occurred in two patients after multiple abdominal surgery and in the third patient one week after autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation. Within a few days, despite antibiotic therapy, all three patients developed severe (pseudomembranous) colitis with sepsis for which admission to the Intensive Care Unit was required. Two patients underwent (sub)total colectomy and received an intensive course of oral and/or rectal vancomycin. In all patients who develop diarrhoea in hospital, especially during or after treatment with antibiotics or chemotherapeutic agents, an infection with C. difficile ribotype 027 should be suspected. Recent outbreaks of this hypervirulent strain of C. difficile have been reported in Canada, the United States, United Kingdom, and The Netherlands. Demonstration of C. difficile toxin in faeces confirms the clinical suspicion of CDAD and ribotyping of the strain may reveal whether the 027 strain is present. For treatment of these 027 infections, vancomycin is preferred to metronidazole. After a severe course of colitis or in case of recurrence a 'tapering and pulse' course ofvancomycin can be prescribed; alternatively, treatment with bovine antibody-enriched whey may be considered. The introduction of this hypervirulent strain has led to reinforcement of the hygienic measures in accordance with the recommendations of the Dutch Working Party on Infection Prevention and a policy to deter the use of fluoroquinolones.
