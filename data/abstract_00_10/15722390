OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the activity of daptomycin tested against numerous species of viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus bovis, which are associated with wound infections, sepsis, cellulitis, endocarditis, abscesses and dental caries. The incidence of penicillin-resistant (non-susceptible) and MLS(B)-resistant strains among viridans group streptococci often varies by species. METHODS: The activity of daptomycin was compared with seven other antimicrobial classes using reference broth microdilution and disc diffusion methods tested against 915 bacteraemic isolates of streptococci (815 viridans group strains; 100 S. bovis). RESULTS: Among all species of viridans group streptococci and S. bovis, 99.9% of isolates were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC values, < or = 0.016-2 mg/L). In contrast, penicillin, erythromycin and tetracycline susceptibility varied widely between species. Erythromycin susceptibility was in the range 48.6-88.7%, penicillin susceptibility in the range 65.5-98.1% and tetracycline in the range 35.0-93.9%. The inter-method agreement between daptomycin and linezolid resistance (comparison agent) disc diffusion and broth microdilution test results was high, each showing near complete susceptibility (99.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin is an active antimicrobial agent that has a usable potency against eight species of viridans group streptococci, as well as S. bovis, with all MIC values at < or =2 mg/L.
