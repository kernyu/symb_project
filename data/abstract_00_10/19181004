UNLABELLED: There has been a steady increase in the number of cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) otorrhea; this is a growing medical concern. For otological surgery in children, octylcyanoacrylate can be an alternative method of closure for surgical incisions. Recent in vitro studies have shown that octylcyanoacrylate is effective as an antimicrobical barrier. To date, there have been only rare reports on the antibacterial effect of octylcyanoacrylate against MRSA. The purpose of this study is to determine the antimicrobial effects of octylcyanoacrylate against the MRSA that was isolated from patients with chronic suppurative otitis media. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical MRSA (n=20) bacteria and methicillin-sensitive SA (MSSA) (n=20) were obtained from patients. The susceptibilities to various antibiotics were determined by disk diffusion method. RESULTS: MSSA was sensitive to octylcyanoacrylate. The antibacterial activity of octylcyanoacrylate was weak against MRSA. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that octylcyanoacrylate has slight antibacterial activity against MRSA.
