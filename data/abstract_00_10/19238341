We review important aspects of bacterial skin diseases in children, most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Borrelia burgdorferi. For early diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in children it is important to be familiar with the variable clinical presentation of erythema migrans and early hematogenic dissemination with multiple erythemata migrantia. Treatment of impetigo in children requires consideration of concomitant diseases, the specific pathogen as well as local resistance patterns. Recently retapamulin has been released as a new antibiotic for topical use in impetigo contagiosa. Perianal streptococcal disease has been underdiagnosed and is an important differential diagnosis of perianal skin disease in children. Diagnosis is made by culturing group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; a 2-week course of oral penicillin represents the treatment of choice.
