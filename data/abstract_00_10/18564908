Yersinia enterocolitica is the most common species causing enteric yersiniosis, which is still the third most frequently reported foodborne gastroenteritis in Europe. Y. enterocolitica generally causes sporadic human infections, and outbreaks are rare. The most important infection source of yersiniosis is believed to be contaminated pork and pork products. Data on the prevalence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica in animals and foodstuffs are very limited and old; thus, more information on the extent and range of the prevalence of this enteropathogen in nonhuman sources is needed. In this work, prevalence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica in different sources in Bavaria is presented. Further, the antimicrobial resistance of human and nonhuman strains is reported. The highest isolation rate of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica (67%) was found in tonsils of slaughter pigs. No pathogenic strains were isolated from cattle, sheep, turkey, and horses. ail-Positive Y. enterocolitica was detected in dogs (5%), cats (3%), and rodents (3%) by real-time PCR. Pathogenic Y. enterocolitica was isolated only from raw pork, especially from edible offal (51%). Surprisingly, 38% of game was contaminated with this pathogen when the samples were studied with PCR. Additionally, some raw pork sausages and one poultry sample were PCR positive. All pathogenic Y. enterocolitica isolates from nonhuman sources were belonging to bioserotype 4/O:3. Antimicrobial resistance of 60 human and 140 porcine strains of bioserotype 4/O:3 was tested by the agar disc diffusion method to 15 different antimicrobial agents. All Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 strains were susceptible to most of the tested antibacterial agents.
