The spread of antibacterial resistance in bacteria that commonly cause childhood community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs), such as acute otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia, and acute pharyngitis, is a major healthcare problem. One of the foremost concerns is the rapid increase in penicillin, macrolide, and multidrug resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. There is also a rising prevalence of macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes in pockets of the United States, and beta-lactamase production in Haemophilus influenzae is widespread. Although data are limited, some evidence suggests that resistance to antibacterials can impair bacteriologic and clinical outcomes in childhood RTIs. Optimizing antibacterial use is important both in the care of individual patients and within strategies to address the wider problem of antibacterial resistance. This involves encouraging judicious antibacterial use (i.e., reducing overuse for viral infection and prophylaxis), and preventing misuse through the wrong choice, dosage, and duration of therapy. Given that initial therapy is usually empiric, antibacterials used to treat community-acquired RTIs in children should ideally have the following properties: an optimal targeted spectrum of activity; high clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against respiratory pathogens, including resistant strains; simple, short-course therapy; and good tolerability and palatability. New antibacterials will continue to have a role in the treatment of RTIs in children, especially where resistance compromises existing therapies.
