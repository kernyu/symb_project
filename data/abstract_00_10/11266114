Hot pepper (Capsicum annuum) plants exhibit a hypersensitive response (HR) against infection by many tobamoviruses. A clone (CaPR-4) encoding a putative pathogenesis-related protein 4 was isolated by differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from resistant pepper plant leaves inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) pathotype P0. The predicted amino acid sequence of CaPR-4 is very similar to those of other plant PR-4s. Southern blot analysis showed that small gene families of PR-4-related sequences were present in the pepper genome. Hot pepper cultivar Bugang, resistant to TMV-P0 and susceptible to TMV-P1.2, induced CaPR-4 expression by pathotype P0 inoculation in inoculated and systemic leaves, but not by pathotype P1.2. Effects of exogenously applied abiotic elicitors upon the CaPR-4 expression were also examined. The expression of the CaPR-4 gene was stimulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ethephon and wounding treatment. However, application of salicylic acid (SA) did not trigger the expression. Evidence is emerging that jasmonic acid and ethylene play key roles in the SA-independent pathways of plant-pathogen interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that the CaPR-4 gene is one of the defense-related genes conferring resistance on pepper plants by the SA-independent pathway and the cross-talk between signaling compounds, jasmonic acid and ethylene could have a great regulatory potential in a plant's defense against TMV.
