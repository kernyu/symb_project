The yycF1(Ts) mutation in Staphylococcus aureus conferred hypersensitivity to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) antibiotics on strains either containing or lacking ermB. The overexpression of the S. aureus Ssa protein restored the yycF1 mutant to wild-type levels of susceptibility. Inactivation of ssa in an unmutagenized strain dramatically reduced ermB-based resistance. Conditional loss of function or expression of ssa in the yycF1 mutant is proposed to result in the observed hypersensitivity to MLS(B) antibiotics.
