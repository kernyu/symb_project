Among 39 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (2.7% overall; Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains) isolated in 2006 and 2007 in India, 15 strains carried bla(NDM-1) and 10 harbored a gene encoding a variant of the carbapenemase OXA-48, named bla(OXA-181). One E. cloacae strain harbored bla(VIM-6), and one K. pneumoniae strain carrying bla(OXA-181) also possessed bla(VIM-5). Multiple pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and clonal dissemination within and among sites were observed. Isolates producing NDM-1 were disseminated in Indian health care facilities as early as 2006.
