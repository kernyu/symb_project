OBJECTIVES: (i)To know the etiology of bacteraemia in children, (ii) To learn the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolates. METHOD: Over the period of thirteen months 4,368 blood samples (for blood culture) were collected from children in the age group of 0 day-14 years, suspected of having fever and sepsis. Blood samples were collected for blood culture from each case. Organisms were isolated and identified by conventional methods. Antibiotic susceptibility for each isolate was determined by using modified Stokes method. RESULT: 1,001 cases (22.9%) were culture positive. Incidence of bacteraemia in neonates was 521(33.94%). Gram negative organisms were the most predominant isolates (88.8%). Commonest was Klebsiella 471 (47.1%) followed by Salmonella sp. 162 (16.2%) and Pseudomonas 80 (8%) whereas in gram positive, Staphylococcus aureus 76 (7.6%) was the most common. Maximum sensitivity was seen by sulbactum/cefaperazone combination-969 (98.2%) by all isolates. Linezolid 97 (99.0%) was the most sensitive drug for gram positive isolates. CONCLUSION: Gram negative multidrug resistant organisms were the main cause of septicemia in all the age groups. Therefore great caution is required in selection of antibiotic therapy.
