A collection of putative ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (119 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (122 isolates) originating from extraintestinal human specimens was screened for qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS-like genes by PCR. Seven K. pneumoniae isolates, which were resistant to ciprofloxacin, were detected as carrying qnrA1-like genes, while one K. pneumoniae and one E. coli isolate were positive for qnrS-like determinant. The latter isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. This is the first study identifying qnr-like genes in our area. Further studies are needed to document the contribution of the plasmid mediated quinolone resistance to the increase in bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones in Romania.
