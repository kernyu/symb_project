Oesophageal candidiasis is an epithelial infection which requires an immune deficiency. C. albicans is commonly the cause, although other species may also be responsible. Resistance to fluconazole, drug of choice for treatment, is an emerging problem. The objectives of the current paper were: to determine the frequency of oesophageal candidiasis in patients submitted to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, analyze risk factors, identify Candida species and determine in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole. During 12 months, 34 patients with oesophageal candidiasis were detected. Out of 1.230 HIV negative and 91 HIV positive patients submitted to upper endoscopy, 11 (0.9%) and 23 (25.3%), respectively, had candidiasis. Risk factors for HIV negative patients were systemic antibiotic therapy in 2, deficient dental cleaning in 2 aged patients, use of proton pump inhibitors in 3, inhaled steroids in 2, malignancy in 1 and oral steroids in 1. The histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed in 48.6% of cases. Cultures were positive in 91.2% C. albicans was prevalent (93.5%), and was associated to other species in 5 cases (16.1%), (3 C. glabrata, 1 C. tropicalis and 1 C. parapsilosis). One case cultured only C. glabrata and 1, only C tropicalis. Out of 31 cultures, 25 were susceptible to fluconazole, 4 dose dependent (1 C. albicans, 3 C. glabrata), and 2 resistant (1 C. albicans, 1 C. glabrata). Frequency of oesophageal candidiasis was low, except for HIV positive patients. The most common etiologic agent was C. albicans, though other Candida species were also found. C. albicans and C. glabrata showed dose dependency and resistance to fluconazole.
