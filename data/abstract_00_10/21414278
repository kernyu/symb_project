OBJECTIVE: A bloodstream infection (BSI) is a life-threatening condition. We studied the causative agents of BSIs and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of blood culture results obtained at MNH from January 2005 to December 2009 was done. Blood culture isolates judged to be clinically significant and antimicrobial susceptibility results of the bacteria were included. The frequencies and proportions of bacteria isolated and antimicrobial susceptibility results were analysed and compared using Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's exact test where applicable, or the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: A total of 13 833 blood cultures were performed. Bacterial pathogens were detected in 1 855 (13.4%), Gram-positive bacteria (1 523; 82.1%) being significantly more prevalent than Gram-negative bacteria (332; 17.9%) (p=0.008). The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (1 250; 67.4%), S. aureus (245; 13.2%), Escherichia coli (131; 7%) and Klebsiella spp. (130; 7.0%). All bacteria isolated showed high resistance to penicillin G (70.6%), tetracycline (63.8%), cefotaxime (62.5%) and ampicillin (62.3%). Moderate to high resistance was seen against chloramphenicol (45.2%), erythromycin (35.0%), ciprofloxacin (29.3%), co-trimoxazole (25.0%) and gentamicin (23.5%). Of S. aureus isolates, 23.3% were resistant to methicillin. CONCLUSIONS: CoNS accounted for two-thirds of the bacterial pathogens isolated. High-level resistance was seen to first-line and inexpensive antimicrobial agents. Routine screening for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production and methicillin resistance among Gram-negative rods and S. aureus from blood cultures should be instituted to monitor spread of multidrug-resistant isolates.
