The frequency of protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) gene mutations was determined in HIV-1 strains from 153 patients entering the CPCRA 046 (GART) study who were failing triple-drug regimens consisting of one protease inhibitor (PI) and two RT inhibitors. Population-based sequence analyses showed that nearly all patients had similar RT gene mutations regardless of prior drug exposure, although the M184V mutation was significantly less prevalent in patients not recently treated with lamivudine. Whilst typical inhibitor-specific ('signature') protease gene mutations were found in patients failing their first PI, these mutations were significantly less likely to be found in patients exposed to two or more PIs. Protease gene mutations associated with multi-PI resistance were more likely to be observed in patients treated with more than one PI. These results suggest sequential treatment with PIs select for a relatively limited number of protease gene mutations that likely originated during early PI therapy. These protease gene mutations and a similarly limited set of RT gene mutations appear to be responsible for treatment failure in antiretroviral therapy.
