The development of resistance has rendered several antibiotics clinically ineffective, and there is an urgent medical need for potent and safe antibacterials with a novel and valid mode of action. To avoid cross-resistance, they should preferably inhibit targets that are not addressed by established antibiotics. In this respect, 6-anilinouracils represent a promising lead structure. They target the Gram-positive DNA polymerase IIIC, a target that is associated with a bactericidal mode of action. Moreover, they have no cross-resistance to marketed antibiotics. This paper describes the synthesis and biological characterization of structurally novel anilinouracils, some of which display potent in vivo efficacy in murine models of bacterial septicemia.
