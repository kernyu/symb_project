This study was conducted to examine biotypes and antifungal susceptibility patterns of oral Candida albicans isolated from HIV-infected patients, HIV-free patients with candidiasis and healthy subjects. All isolates were biotyped using a typing system based on enzyme profiles, carbohydrate assimilation patterns and boric acid resistance. Thirty-eight biotypes were found amongst 218 oral C. albicans isolates. The major biotype found was A1S, which accounted for 32.6% of all isolates, and this biotype was the most common in all groups. There was a greater variety of biotypes of C. albicans in the HIV-infected group than in the other groups; however, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a total of 118 isolates were determined for amphotericin B and for ketoconazole using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) broth macrodilution method and the E-test. When the antifungal susceptibility patterns among the groups were compared, a statistically significant difference was found only with amphotericin B. The median MIC of amphotericin B in the HIV-infected group was higher than in the healthy group (P=0.013, NCCLS method; P=0.002, E-test). However, this difference in sensitivity was not restricted to any sub-type investigated. Our results showed that the biotype patterns of C. albicans isolates that colonize HIV-infected patients are similar to those of HIV-free subjects, and there is no relationship between antifungal susceptibility patterns and the biotypes.
