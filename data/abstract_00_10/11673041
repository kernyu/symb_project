The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in Taiwan is due to the heavy use of antimicrobial agents in both animal husbandry and clinical practice over the past decades. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of linezolid were established for 371 clinical isolates of staphylococci, pneumococci, enterococci and group A streptococci from Taiwan. All isolates tested including those resistant to beta-lactams, erythromycin, vancomycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin were uniformly susceptible to linezolid, with MICs ranging from 0.125 to 2 mg/l. Our data support the observation that there is no cross-resistance between linezolid and other classes of antimicrobial substances.
