OBJECTIVES: Despite extensive functional screening of the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) over the past years, very few novel inhibitors have been reported. We have, therefore, decided to screen with a radically different, non-enzymic, protein-protein interaction assay. Our target is the highly conserved RNAP-sigma interaction that is essential for transcription. METHODS: Small molecule inhibitors of the RNAP-sigma interaction were tested for their activity on transcription and on bacteria. RESULTS: These compounds have antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including multiresistant clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This is, to our knowledge, the first example of a small molecule inhibitor of this interaction.
