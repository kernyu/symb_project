Telithromycin MICs for 13,874 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected in the first 3 years of the global PROTEKT study (1999 to 2003) were studied. There was no change in the distribution of telithromycin MICs over this period, even in countries where telithromycin is in use. The telithromycin MICs for 10 isolates (0.07%) were >/=4 micro g/ml, and these 10 isolates contained erm(B); there was no evidence of reproducible clonal spread between centers.
