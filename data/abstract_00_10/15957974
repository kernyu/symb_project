Voriconazole is a second-generation triazole antifungal agent, structurally derived from fluconazole with an extended spectrum of activity against a wide variety of yeasts and moulds. Developed for the treatment of life-threatening fungal infections, it appears to be an effective therapy option for invasive aspergillosis, fluconazole-resistant candidiasis and refractory or less-common invasive fungal infections. It is available for both oral and intravenous administration and is characterised by an acceptable safety and tolerability spectrum.
