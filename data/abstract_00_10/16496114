In the study presented here, a new chromogenic medium (CPS ID 3; bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was compared to routine media for the isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria recovered from urine specimens, and a cost analysis was performed. Escherichia coli, Proteeae tribe, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus agalactiae grew on the chromogenic medium as typical differentiated colonies and were accurately identified even in mixed cultures. Although the similarity of colors produced by isolates belonging to the Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter (KESC) group prevents differentiation among them, members of KESC were easily identified as coliforms. No substantial difference was observed when comparing the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on colonies selected from reference media versus CPS ID 3. Use of the new medium was associated with a savings of 75% over the conventional methods and the API system. Furthermore, this medium facilitated a remarkable reduction in the laboratory workload and consequently resulted in additional time and cost savings.
