OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of mebendazole and albendazole in the treatment of Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm infections was evaluated in school children in an area with long time exposure for broad spectrum anthelminthic drugs. RESULTS: Mebendazole exhibited cure rates of 90.6% and 83.5%; egg reduction rates of 96.7% and 94.2% against Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm infections respectively. Albendazole showed a cure rate of 83.9% and egg reduction rate of 96.3% against Ascaris lumbricoides and a cure rate of 84.2% and egg reduction rate of 95% against hookworm infection. Albendazole appeared to be more effective against hookworm infection (egg reduction rate of 95% versus 94.2%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Mebendazole and albendazole showed reduced efficacy against Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm infections at the recommended doses. This may be a sign for emergence of drug resistance in this region. Care in routine use of the anthelminthes and continuous drug efficacy surveillance is recommended.
