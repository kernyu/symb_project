Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) exist in dynamic oligomeric complexes and display diverse biological functions ranging from chaperone properties to modulator of apoptosis. So far, the role of stress-dependent phosphorylation of mammalian sHsps for its structure and function has been analyzed by using various phosphorylation site mutants overexpressed in different cell types as well as by non-exclusive inhibitors of the p38 MAPK cascade. Here we investigate the role of phosphorylation of endogenous sHsp in a genetic model lacking the major Hsp25 kinase, the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase MK2. We demonstrate that in MK2-deficient fibroblasts, where no stress-dependent phosphorylation of Hsp25 at Ser86 and no in vitro binding to 14-3-3 was detectable, stress-dependent disaggregation of endogenous Hsp25 complexes is impared and kinetics of arsenite-dependent, H2O2-dependent, and sublethal heat shock-induced insolubilization of Hsp25 is delayed. Similarly, green fluorescent protein-tagged Hsp25 shows retarded subcellular accumulation into stress granules in MK2-deficient cells after arsenite treatment. Decreased insolubilization of Hsp25 in MK2-deficient cells correlates with increased resistance against arsenite, H2O2, and sublethal heat shock treatment and with decreased apoptosis. In contrast, after severe, lethal heat shock MK2-deficient embryonic fibroblasts cells show fast and complete insolubilization of Hsp25 independent of MK2 and no increased stress resistance. Hence, MK2-dependent formation of insoluble stress granules and irreversible cell damage by oxidative stresses and sublethal heat shock correlate and only upon severe, lethal heat shock MK2-independent processes could determine insolubilization of Hsp25 and are more relevant for cellular stress damage.
