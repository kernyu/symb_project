Sodium 7beta-[(R)-2-(N(b)()-o-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl)hydrazino-3-pheny lpropa namido]cephalosporanate (1) is described as a new type of beta-lactam antibiotic, which undergoes light-induced destruction of its beta-lactam moiety and hence becomes biologically inactive. This type of antibiotic holds the promise of self-destruction over a number of hours of exposure to light, so that it would not allow selection of resistance in the environment.
