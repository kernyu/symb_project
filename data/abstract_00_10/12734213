Nineteen oropharyngeal Candida albicans isolates from six children and seven adults living with AIDS at the Russia AIDS Centre, Moscow, from 1990 to 1998 were selected for molecular typing. Two fluconazole-resistant C. albicans genotypes were identified from a child who contracted human immunodeficiency virus infection during the Elista Hospital outbreak in the Kalmyk Republic in 1989. Highly related strains were observed 4 years later in the oral lesions and colonization of two patients and a health care worker. There may be a tendency for persons who are living with AIDS in a long-term care facility and who receive fluconazole therapy for oropharyngeal candidiasis to harbor and spread fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains.
