The efficacy of benzimidazoles and ivermectin was tested in 14 pilot farms in eastern Algeria. Resistance was detected in strongyle nematodes against benzimidazoles (five farms) and ivermectin (one farm). The main genera in the region were resistant: Teladorsagia, Trichostrongylus, Marshallagia and Nematodirus. The evaluations based on FECRT (faecal egg count reduction tests) were not always consistent due to the low-level of infection, and we developed a simplified, repeated treatment strategy to investigate resistance. The results obtained with repeated treatment faecal egg counts match globally those obtained with conventional faecal egg count reduction tests. This simplified, repeated treatment method should be investigated further since it is quicker, and this could make it possible to test larger farm samplings.
