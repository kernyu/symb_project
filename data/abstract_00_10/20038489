The predominant causative agent of urinary tract infections in children and adults is Escherichia coli , but it is necessary to appreciate the importance of other Gram-negative rods, especially in newborns. Antibiotic resistance rates are also different in children and in adult care units due to many factors and therapeutical guidelines.The aim of this retrospective study was to show the local prevalence and resistance patterns of uropathogens in certain clinics of university and present the distribution of uropathogens in different age groups. Therefore, 4833 positive samples were analysed. E. coli was found to be the highest prevalent causative agent in every adult care unit, but some differences in other causative agents could have been detected. Three types of antimicrobial agents showed decreasing susceptibility rates: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxasole, cephalosporins and quinolones; but there were differences in resistance among the 8 investigated inpatient wards.
