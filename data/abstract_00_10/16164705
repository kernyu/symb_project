The emergence of bacterial resistance to commonly used antibiotics is not new. In this review we have tried to cover the ever increasing problems facing the treatment and containment of bacterial skin infections. We have tried to give an overview of the varied mechanisms by which bacteria gain and spread antimicrobial resistance, whilst dealing with the patterns of resistance exhibited by some of the commonly encountered organisms. Where there is evidence, we have formulated an approach on how to tackle antibiotic resistance. Where there is a lack of evidence we have formulated what we perceive to be appropriate guidelines.
