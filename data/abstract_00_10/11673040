The antimicrobial activity of linezolid, a recently developed antibiotic agent active against Gram-positive bacteria, was tested against pathogens from three different collections. (1) Uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients (1990/1991) with complicated and/or hospital-acquired UTIs; Urologic Clinic, Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. (2) Uropathogens from a multi-centre study (1995/1996) comprising 37 urological centres throughout Germany. (3) MRSA isolates of patients and staff (1999/2000) within the Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. Genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of linezolid determined by an agar (Isosensitest) dilution method using a multipoint inoculator and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point ranged for methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n=27) between 2 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (n=35) between 1 and 2 mg/l, for methicillin susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (MSSE) (n=67) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant CNS (MRSE) (n=19) between 0.25 and 2 mg/l, for Enterococcus. faecalis (n=184) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for E. faecium (n=3) 2 mg/l and for Streptococcus spp. (n=4) between 0.25 and 1 mg/l, indicating that all strains were susceptible. According to the in vitro activity, linezolid may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated UTI caused by Gram-positive uropathogens. Thus, linezolid should be evaluated in a clinical study.
