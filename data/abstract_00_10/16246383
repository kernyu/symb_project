During the cholera epidemic of 2002 in and around Hubli, south India, Vibrio cholerae strains resistant to fluoroquinolones were isolated. Among the isolates of V. cholerae non-O1, non-O139 serogroups, 55.9% and 47.1% were resistant to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. However, only 12.5% of the O1 serogroup strains were resistant to both norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Though the O139 serogroup strains were susceptible to these antibiotics, they exhibited multidrug resistance. Emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant V. cholerae that also exhibited multidrug resistance is of great significance in the epidemiology and control of cholera.
