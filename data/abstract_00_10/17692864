We have formed the cholesterol monolayer and multilayer LB films on the self-assembled monolayers of 2-naphthalenethiol (2-NT) and thiophenol (TP) and studied the electrochemical barrier properties of these composite films using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We have also characterized the cholesterol monolayer film using grazing angle FTIR, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Cholesterol has a long hydrophobic steroid chain, which makes it a suitable candidate to assemble on the hydrophobic surfaces. We find that the highly hydrophobic surface formed by the self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of 2-NT and TP act as effective platforms for the fabrication of cholesterol monolayer and multilayer films. The STM studies show that the cholesterol monolayer films on 2-NT form striped patterns with a separation of 1.0 nm between them. The area per cholesterol molecule is observed to be 0.64 nm2 with a tilt angle of about 28.96 degrees from the surface normal. The electrochemical studies show a large increase in charge transfer resistance and lowering of interfacial capacitance due to the formation of the LB film of cholesterol. We have compared the behavior of this system with that of cholesterol monolayer and multilayers formed on the self-assembled monolayer of thiophenol.
