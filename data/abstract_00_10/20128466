The role played by the veterinary profession in protecting animal and public health, along with food safety, is unique. Thus, it is important that veterinarians have the necessary knowledge to be pro-active in responding to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Many current veterinary educational programmes do not attempt to enhance the understanding of undergraduate students of this complex situation. As a first step, a modern veterinary education programme should provide students with a holistic view of the ecology of resistance and clearly describe how antimicrobial resistance emerges. Understanding the relationships between drug use, natural selection and antimicrobial-resistant organisms, as well as gene mobilisation and recombination, and how these contribute to the emergence of resistant organisms are important facets of a modern veterinary education.
