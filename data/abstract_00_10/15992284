Infection in humans with Campylobacter jejuni is commonly associated with exposure to food animal fecal material. In this study, we report on the recovery, potential for virulence and antimicrobial resistance levels of C. jejuni isolated from food and companion animals. Three hundred and seventy-eight fecal samples from food and companion animals and surface swabs from beef carcasses were tested for the presence of C. jejuni. C. jejuni was isolated from 13.8% (11/80) of dogs, 5% (1/20) of goats, 28.3% (17/60) of dairy cattle, 0% (0/65) of range cattle, 73.5% (36/49) of feedlot cattle, and 94.7% (18/19) of beef carcasses. Beef cattle from a single Arizona herd showed a considerable increase in fecal shedding of C. jejuni from pasture to feedlot and over time on the feedlot. Forty-two isolates were tested for susceptibility to four antimicrobial agents, each representing a class of antimicrobial drug approved for use in both humans and animals. None of the isolates were found to be resistant to erythromycin or gentamicin, whereas 2.4% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 28.6% of isolates were resistant to tetracycline. The presence of virulence traits among the 42 isolates was assessed using in vitro macrophage survival and epithelial cell adherence and invasion assays. Of the isolates examined, 17 were able to survive within macrophages through 72 h at viable counts of >/=10(3)/well and 12 were capable of invading epithelial cells at viable counts of >/=10(3)/well. Data from these studies suggests that many of the isolates recovered from the non-poultry animal sources have the capacity to cause disease if transmitted to humans.
