A patient with chronic hepatitis B underwent liver transplantation for end-stage cirrhosis. The donor liver graft had moderate steatosis and fibrosis. He was placed on lamivudine for hepatitis B prophylaxis but developed viral relapse due to emergence of a lamivudine-resistant mutant at week 72 posttransplantation. Results of liver biochemistry were normal liver histology revealed minimal steatosis and inflammation at weeks 151 and 128, respectively. This report illustrates that the use of a steatotic donor liver and the emergence of lamivudine resistance posttransplantation are not necessarily associated with significant graft damage. A marginal donor graft can be considered due to the donor shortage. Lamivudine monoprophylaxis for hepatitis B virus-related liver diseases post liver transplantation can be used in areas where hepatitis B immunoglobulin is not affordable.
