BACKGROUND: Data on the clinical course of infection in patients with transmitted drug-resistant HIV before and after initiation of treatment are scarce. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genotypic resistance was analysed in 504 therapy-naive individuals with a known date of infection. Resistance was predicted using the Stanford algorithm. Clinical parameters for 80 individuals with transmitted drug-resistant HIV and for 424 patients with susceptible virus were analysed. RESULTS: In 16% of the individuals transmitted drug-resistant HIV was found. Detection of drug-resistant HIV was more likely in individuals with acute primary HIV infection [odds ratio (OR)=1.529; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.001; 2.236]. At the time of infection patients with an acute infection with resistant HIV had lower viral loads. CD4 cell counts tended to be higher and the CD4 cell loss more pronounced in the group with resistant HIV. Suppression of the viral load below the detection limit was achieved in 64% of the group with resistant HIV and in 85% of the group with susceptible HIV 6 months after initiation of therapy (P=0.199). The majority of the group with resistant HIV (74%) received at least one compromised drug. CONCLUSION: First-line treatment including drugs with predicted resistance can impair virological success in some patients. Factors influencing the decision to include compromised drugs need to be investigated.
