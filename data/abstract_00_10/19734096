Virulence and drug resistance are traits that pathogens can acquire independently, albeit these traits can influence each other. A recent publication has reported on the co-evolution of virulence and pyrimethamine resistance in malaria parasites. Here, we discuss this finding in the context of the folate biosynthesis pathway and explain how mutational changes in this pathway can affect both parasite replication rates and the development of drug resistance.
