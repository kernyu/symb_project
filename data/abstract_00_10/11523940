A total of 1434 strains of Neisseria meningitidis isolated from cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Australia between 1994 and 1999 were examined by standard methods for susceptibility to antibiotics used for treatment and prophylaxis. The proportion of isolates fully susceptible to penicillin decreased from 45% in 1994 to 26% in 1999 (P<0.001). All the other isolates were less sensitive to penicillin except for two meningococci with a penicillin MIC of 1 mg/l. The geometric mean penicillin MIC increased from 0.045 to 0.065 mg/l from 1994 to 1999. There was no significant difference in the geometric mean penicillin MICs of serogroup B and serogroup C meningococci. Penicillin susceptibility was significantly associated with a poorer outcome. Isolates from survivors of IMD had a higher geometric mean penicillin MIC (0.06 mg/l) than those from fatal cases (0.048 mg/l) (P< 0.001). This suggests that factors other than the decrease in susceptibility to penicillin observed were more relevant to outcome in IMD. All isolates were fully susceptible to ceftriaxone. Rifampicin resistance was infrequent (eight isolates in 6 years) and sporadic. A single isolate had decreased quinolone susceptibility. Despite the significant shift in susceptibility to penicillin recorded, this group of antibiotics remains a suitable treatment for IMD in Australia.
