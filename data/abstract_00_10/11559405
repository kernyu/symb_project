AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity of Xylella fastidiosa isolated from citrus trees affected by Citrus Variegated Chlorosis (CVC). METHODS AND RESULTS: The antibiotic susceptibility by agar disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods was observed for all drug evaluated, except for penicillin-G. Genetic diversity by RAPD analysis revealed three major groups (citrus, coffee and grapevine), being the citrus group more similar with the coffee group than with the grapevine group. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study highlights the possibility to use these antibiotics susceptibility as markers in the development of a cloning vector and penicillin-G could be used as a selective marker for the isolation of X. fastidiosa from citrus plants.
