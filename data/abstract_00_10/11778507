OBJECTIVE: To investigate major risk factors leading to death by noscomial MRSA pulmonary infections. METHOD: The data of hospitalized patients diagnosed as noscomial MRSA pulmonary infections were sorted out and analyzed for recent three years. RESULTS: Case mortality of 64 patients with noscomial MRSA pulmonary infections were 44%. Of these, 18 cases complicated fungi, 11 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Pseudomonas maltophilia and 7 Enterococcus. Case mortality of fungi and Pseudomonas maltophilia were 67% and 61%, respectively. 23 cases had fever, 18 died (case mortality 78%) and 41 had no fever, 10 died (case mortality 24%) (chi 2 = 15.253, P < 0.005). The case mortality with reduction, normal and increase of leukocyte were 80%, 24% and 45%, respectively. The comparison between three groups had obvious significance (chi 2 = 12.554, P < 0.005) and the case mortality of leukocytopenia was higher than that of other two groups (chi 2 = 8.626, P < 0.005). The case mortality of hypoproteinemia was higher than that of the control group (chi 2 = 6.914, P < 0.01). The patients who developed fulminant lesions in liver, kidneys and lungs showed higher mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Case mortality of noscomial pneumonia caused by MRSA is very high. In addition to common causes, underling diseases, leukocytopenia, malnutrition and complex infections are also risk factors of MRSA infection.
