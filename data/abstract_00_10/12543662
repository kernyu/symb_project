To better understand the molecular basis of posaconazole (POS) resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus, resistant laboratory isolates were selected. Spontaneous mutants arose at a frequency of 1 in 10(8) and fell into two susceptibility groups, moderately resistant and highly resistant. Azole resistance in A. fumigatus was previously associated with decreased drug accumulation. We therefore analyzed the mutants for changes in levels of transcripts of genes encoding efflux pumps (mdr1 and mdr2) and/or alterations in accumulation of [(14)C]POS. No changes in either pump expression or drug accumulation were detected. Similarly, there was no change in expression of cyp51A or cyp51B, which encode the presumed target site for POS, cytochrome P450 14alpha-demethylase. DNA sequencing revealed that each resistant isolate carried a single point mutation in residue 54 of cyp51A. Mutations at the same locus were identified in three clinical A. fumigatus isolates exhibiting reduced POS susceptibility but not in susceptible clinical strains. To verify that these mutations were responsible for the resistance phenotype, we introduced them into the chromosome of a POS-susceptible A. fumigatus strain under the control of the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. The transformants exhibited reductions in susceptibility to POS comparable to those exhibited by the original mutants, confirming that point mutations in the cyp51A gene in A. fumigatus can confer reduced susceptibility to POS.
