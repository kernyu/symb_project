A cooperative group of 136 Spanish hospitals identified 1014 isolates of P. aeruginosa in one week. It was estimated that Spanish microbiology laboratories identified 168 P. aeruginosa isolates per 100,000 inhabitants population and year (25 isolates for every 1,000 hospital admissions/year). P. aeruginosa was recovered in 5.3% of all the samples with bacterial isolates. Seventy-five percent of samples containing P. aeruginosa came from the lower respiratory tract, wound exudates, abscesses and urine. The three most common serotypes present in Spain were found to be 0:1, 0:4 and 0:11 and constituted more than 50% of all isolates. The antimicrobials active against more than 85% of all the isolates included: ceftazidime (85.2%), piperacillin-tazobactam (92.8%), imipenem (86.2%), meropenem (92.2%) amikacin (91.4%) and tobramycin (91.2%). The study showed a high rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin (22.7%) and gentamicin (31.1%). Of the 529 patients who underwent clinical follow-up, 25.5% showed P. aeruginosa colonization and the remaining 74.5% had clinical infections. We estimated an incidence rate of 88.4 patients infected with P. aeruginosa per 100,000 inhabitants and year (13.8 cases per 1000 hospital admissions and year). Overall, 42% were community acquired. The overall mortality in this study was 15%, and mortality attributable to P. aeruginosa infections was 5%. After logistical regression analysis, the two independent predictors of mortality were the presence of a rapidly fatal underlying condition and the presence of bacteremia. In Spain, P. aeruginosa is much more than a cause of severe nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients.
