BMS-806 and the related compound, #155, are novel inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry that bind the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein. BMS-806 and #155 block conformational changes in the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins that are induced by binding to the host cell receptor, CD4. We tested a panel of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein mutants and identified several that were resistant to the antiviral effects of BMS-806 and #155. In the CD4-bound conformation of gp120, the amino acid residues implicated in BMS-806 and #155 resistance line the "phenylalanine 43 cavity" and a water-filled channel that extends from this cavity to the inner domain. Structural considerations suggest a model in which BMS-806 and #155 bind gp120 prior to receptor binding and, upon CD4 binding, are accommodated in the Phe-43 cavity and adjacent channel. The integrity of the nearby V1/V2 variable loops and N-linked carbohydrates on the V1/V2 stem indirectly influences sensitivity to the drugs. A putative binding site for BMS-806 and #155 between the gp120 receptor-binding regions and the inner domain, which is thought to interact with the gp41 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, helps to explain the mode of action of these drugs.
