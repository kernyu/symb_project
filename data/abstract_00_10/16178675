The growing threat posed by antibiotic-resistant pathogens is a major challenge for infectious disease practitioners and public health officials. In recent years, the prevalence of resistance among key bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus sp, has increased at an alarming rate. The impact of antimicrobial resistance is manifold and can ultimately lead to treatment failure and increased morbidity and mortality. To control the spread of resistance and subsequent impact, a multifaceted approach is warranted. Awareness and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, prudent use of antibiotics, and compliance with infection control techniques may help contain the emergence and spread of resistant organisms.
