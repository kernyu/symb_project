The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of extracts and flavone derivatives from the rhizome of Kaempferia parviflora on P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated transport in LLC-GA5-COL150, a transfectant cell line of a porcine kidney epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 with human MDR1 cDNA. Ethanol extract obtained from Kaempferia parviflora rhizome significantly increased the accumulation of rhodamine 123 and daunorubicin, P-gp substrates, in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells, but not in LLC-PK1 cells. The aqueous extract also increased the accumulation in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells with lower potency than the ethanol extract. The effects of flavone derivatives isolated from the rhizome of Kaempferia parviflora on P-gp function were examined. Among six flavones tested, 3,5,7,3',4'-pentamethoxyflavone most potently increased the accumulation of rhodamine 123 and daunorubicin in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, 5,7-dimethoxyflavone to lesser degree increased rhodamine 123 accumulation in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells. In contrast, the other four flavone derivatives had no significant effect on the accumulation of rhodamine 123 in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells in a concentration range tested. These results indicate that extracts and flavone derivatives from the rhizome of Kaempferia parviflora can inhibit P-gp function, which may be useful for overcoming P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance and improving the oral bioavailability of anticancer agents.
