To determine the frequency of hemodialysis (HD) catheter related infection, causative microorganisms and predisposing factors contributing to these infections at our center, we conducted a prospective study in 2007 involving 57 (45.6% males) patients in whom a temporary catheter was inserted for HD. The patients were followed for one month to document any episodes of hemodialysis catheter related infection (HCRI). There were 11 (19.3%) patients who developed HCRI proven by blood culture; 5 patients were infected with more than one organism. Staphylococcus Coagulase negative and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) remain the most common pathogens. All the organisms were sensitive to antibiotics administered empirically, however, 3 patients developed multiple resistant S. aureus (MRSA). All the infected patients experienced previous episodes of HCRI, which formed a risk factor in addition to low albumin when compared to the non-infected group (P=0.024 and P= 0.001, respectively). We conclude that the rate of HCRI and the causative organisms found in our study is comparable to previous reports. We still need to adopt measures to minimize the use of temporary vascular accesses by creation of fistulas in a timely fashion.
