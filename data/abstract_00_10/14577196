The goal of our research was an analysis of sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolones (SPX, PEF, UB, LOM, CIP, ENX, OFX, NOR). The sensitivity was tested by disk diffusion method, according to NCCLS standards. 120 strains isolated from hospitalized (76 strains) and outpatient clinic (44 strains) persons were tested. The highest sensitivity of strains was observed to norfloxacin (36.8% and 86.4% of strains, respectively) and ciprofloxacin (30.3% and 81.8%). None of tested microorganisms was sensitive to flumequine. Resistant strains, isolated from sick persons in outpatient clinics were fewer (13.6%) as compared to hospitalized persons (51.3%).
