The main feature of the human-microorganism eco-system forming in the environment of manned space vehicles is the periodic accumulation of the potential for pathogenicity. This process is characterized by the activation of opportunistic pathogens, representatives of which grow in large number within the system, settle in various niches, and demonstrate expansion, intruding into microbiocenoses of open biotopes of humans who, until contamination, have been clean of these microorganisms. Clones (similar to hospital strains) arising out of these populations exhibit the ability to spread "epidemically" within isolated teams.
