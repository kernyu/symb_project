The in vitro susceptibility of a total of 1819 bacterial isolates from canine and 103 isolates from feline otitis externa cases to 13 antimicrobial drugs over a 5-year period was evaluated. Among topically used drugs, 90% of isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to gentamicin was 85%, and to polymyxin B 100%. For isolates other than the Pseudomonas sp., susceptibility was highest to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
