Between October 1991 and December 1998, 19 patients (12 males and 7 females) with refractory (six patients) or recurrent (13 patients) AML were treated with a combination chemotherapy of cytarabine given by continuous infusion over 24-h at a rate of 1 upward arrow g/m2 per day for 5 days along with idarubicin (12 upward arrow mg/m2 per day x 3) and etoposide (150 mg /m(2) per day x 3). Median age of the patients was 28 years (range, 15--61). Seven (37%) of 19 patients achieved complete remission (CR) with median CR duration of 6.7 months (range, 2.5--61.4+). Two patients are surviving for long term (50.1 and 62.6 months). Myelosuppression associated with chemotherapy was severe. Median recovery time to ANC over 500/microl was 28 days (range, 25--59). A significant proportion of patients experienced grade III-VI non-hematologic toxicities including nausea/vomiting (32%), liver function abnormality (32%), and diarrhea (16%). No central nervous system (CNS) toxicity was observed. Our study showed that the administration of cytarabine at a dose of 1 g/m(2) per day by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days along with idarubicin and etoposide was feasible. Further studies are necessary to elucidate optimum dose and schedule of cytarabine in a setting of refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
