OBJECTIVES: To determine what Spanish primary healthcare physicians consider the rates of pneumococcal resistance to be, the type of antimicrobial treatment they would prescribe on suspicion of high resistance and ascertain in which cases of acute bronchitis these physicians would initiate antibiotic treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study was performed with a questionnaire distributed to 1368 physicians on their opinion on the degree of resistance of pneumococci to penicillins and macrolides in Spain. They were also asked which treatment they would recommend in penicillin-resistant pneumococcal infection and to indicate their degree of agreement regarding the use of antibiotics in different clinical situations of acute bronchitis. RESULTS: 843 physicians completed and returned the questionnaire, a response rate of 59.1%. Of the 750 physicians who answered the question concerning pneumococcal resistance, 312 stated resistance to be >30% (41.6%) while only 90 felt it to be <15% (12%). 153 physicians reported resistance to macrolides to be >30% (23%). In cases with suspicion of penicillin-resistant pneumococci, the clinicians stated they would prescribe quinolones (321, 40.3%) and macrolides (251, 31.5%). Of the 784 physicians who answered the questions on bronchitis, 662 preferred antibiotic therapy in acute bronchitis with purulent sputum (84.6%), 610 on uncertain diagnosis (77.8%), 569 in patients with fever over 38 degrees C (72.6%) and 210 on patient request (26.8%). CONCLUSION: Primary healthcare physicians in Spain are more concerned about pneumococcal resistance to penicillins than to macrolides although 35% of the strains isolated are resistant to the latter while only 10% are resistant to aminopenicillins. Furthermore, many physicians believe macrolides to be effective against pneumococcal infections. Despite their lack of efficacy in the treatment of acute bronchitis, many physicians prescribe antibiotics, mainly in cases with purulent expectoration, thus justifying the high consumption of antimicrobial agents in this disease.
