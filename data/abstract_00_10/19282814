In August 2007, the Detroit Department of Health and Wellness Promotion, Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH), and CDC investigated a genotype cluster of eight tuberculosis (TB) cases in U.S.- born patients in the Detroit metropolitan area. The cases had been reported during December 2004-April 2007. The first case was reported in a patient (the index patient) whose drug-susceptible TB subsequently developed multidrug resistance. Seven additional cases were reported in patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes that matched the genotype of the index patient. These included one case of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in a young relative of the index patient and one case in the index patient's parent, who died from TB meningitis. This report describes the investigation and illustrates the importance of ensuring that each case of TB disease is promptly recognized and successfully treated and that all close contacts of TB patients are identified, evaluated, and treated for latent TB infection if indicated.
