Polymorphisms in the isotype I beta-tubulin gene are important genetic determinants of benzimidazole (BZ) resistance in a number of parasitic nematode species including Teladorsagia circumcincta, a major gastrointestinal nematode of sheep. This study investigates the genetic diversity at this locus in a BZ-resistant isolate of T. circumcincta (MTci5) derived from a sheep farm in the United Kingdom (UK) that was open to animal, and therefore parasite, migration. Pyrosequencing was used to determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with BZ resistance. This was followed by a combination of single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and nucleotide sequencing to sample allelic diversity in a 276bp fragment immediately surrounding the isotype I beta-tubulin F200Y mutation. The genetic diversity at this locus was extremely high, with seven different haplotypes found to contain the resistant F200Y polymorphism in this single resistant isolate. Genotyping by SSCP interfaced with pyrosequencing demonstrated that the P200(Y) mutation is also present on multiple haplotypes in two other BZ-resistant T. circumcincta isolates from the UK. This contrasts with much lower levels of haplotype diversity in BZ-resistant alleles present in T. circumcincta isolates from French goat farms that are closed to parasite migration. Taken together with our knowledge of T. circumcincta population genetic structure, these results are most consistent with multiple independent origins of resistance and mixing of alleles due to the large amount of livestock movement in the UK.
