BACKGROUND: Short-course therapy for acute otitis media (AOM) improves adherence and may reduce secondary bacterial resistance. METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective, investigator-blinded study, patients between the ages of 6 months and 6 years with a clinical diagnosis of AOM were randomized to receive cefdinir oral suspension 7 mg/kg q12h for 5 days or azithromycin oral suspension 10 mg/kg once daily on day 1 and 5 mg/kg once daily on days 2 through 5. Clinical response was assessed at the end-of-therapy (EOT) visit (days 7-9) and the follow-up visit (days 20-25). RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-seven patients were enrolled in the study. The treatment groups were similar at baseline with respect to demographic characteristics (mean [SD] age, 3.0 [1.7] years; 55% male), incidence of bilateral AOM (45%), and presenting signs and symptoms. The majority of evaluable children (77%) had previously received conjugated heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) against Streptococcus pneumoniae. At the EOT visit, clinical cure rates were comparable for cefdinir and azithromycin (87% [151/174] and 85% [149/176], respectively; 95% CI, -5.5 to 9.8). In addition, clinical cure rates at the EOT visit in the children who had been vaccinated with PCV7 were comparable between cefdinir and azithromycin (86% vs 83%; 95% CI, -6.5 to 11.8). No significant difference in clinical cure rates was observed at the follow-up visit (76% and 86%; 95% CI, -18.9 to 0.0). Parental satisfaction was similar between treatment groups with regard to ease of use, taste, compliance, health care resource utilization, and missed days of work and day-care. Both antibiotics were well tolerated; diarrhea and abnormal stools were the most common antibiotic-related adverse events (< or = 7% each). CONCLUSIONS: Short courses (5 days) of therapy with cefdinir or azithromycin were comparable in these children with AOM based on clinical end points, parental preferences, and health care utilization.
