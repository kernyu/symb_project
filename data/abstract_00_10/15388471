Peptide nucleic acid-mediated competitive PCR clamping, which can selectively amplify mutant alleles, was developed to detect mutations in four codons (513, 516, 526, and 531) of the rpoB gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. This simple method successfully identified the mutations in all 40 of the M. tuberculosis strains tested.
