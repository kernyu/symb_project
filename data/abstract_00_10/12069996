Ninety-six isolates of Bacillus anthracis recovered in France between 1994 and 2000 were tested for their susceptibilities to 25 different antibiotics. Resistance to penicillin G and amoxicillin was 11.5%. All of the isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole and susceptible to doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, levofloxacin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, clindamycin, imipenem, and rifampin.
