The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and antifungal susceptibility of Candida clinical isolations coming from patients with candidiasis in six health care centers of Caracas, Venezuela metropolitan area. The laboratory reports were retrospectively revised from January 2003 through August 2005. The isolated yeasts identification was carried out by conventional methods and antifungal susceptibility was evaluated by ATB-fungus (bioMerieux, France) and Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). One thousand nine hundred seventy seven (1.977) yeasts were studied and their susceptibility testing were carried out only in 1,414 of them. C. albicans was the most isolated yeast (46.7%) and none-albicans Candida-species represented more than half of the isolations (53.4%). All the isolated yeasts evaluated presented CMIs<1 microg/ml to anfotericina B and showed variable susceptibility percentages to fluconazole (91.5%), itraconazole (80%) and voriconazole (98.6%).
