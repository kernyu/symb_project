Integrons were detected in 59 of 120 (49%) urinary isolates of Enterobacteriaceae by PCR using degenerate primers targeted to conserved regions of class 1, 2, and 3 integrase genes. PCR sequencing analysis of the cassette arrays revealed a predominance of cassettes that confer resistance to the aminoglycosides and trimethoprim.
