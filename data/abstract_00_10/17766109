Structure-based drug design was utilized to identify potent small-molecule inhibitors of proteins within the AraC family of bacterial transcription factors, which control virulence in medically important microbes. These agents represent a novel approach to fight infectious disease and may be less likely to promote resistance development. These compounds lack intrinsic antibacterial activity in vitro and were able to limit a bacterial infection in a mouse model of urinary tract infection.
