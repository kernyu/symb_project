OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the drug resistance on the radioresistance in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. METHODS: Three drug resistant pancreatic cancer cell sublines induced by fluorouracil (5-FU), adriamycin (ADM) and gemcitabine respectively, SW1990/FU, SW1990/ADM and SW1990/Gz, were tested for the cell cycle and radio-sensitivity with flow cytometry and clonogenic assay. RESULTS: Compared with SW1990, the cell cycle assay indicated higher G(0)/G(1) period percentage in SW1990/FU and SW1990/Gz, but the G(2)/M period percentage decreased; SW1990/FU had the same while SW1990/Gz had lower S period percentage. SW1990/ADM almost had a similar cell cycle with SW1990. Clonogenic assay showed both SW1990/FU and SW1990/Gz had greater survival fraction (SF(2)) than SW1990, but SW1990/ADM had seemingly similar SF(2) as SW1990. CONCLUSION: Drug resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines have reduced G(2)/M period percentage and increased radioresistance.
