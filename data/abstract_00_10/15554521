The aim of this pilot study was to identify prevalent non-compliance behaviour in paediatric antibiotic therapy and to investigate the possible role of its social correlates. Patients' parents were surveyed at two paediatric practices in Catania, Italy, using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The two practices were chosen for their location, in two different urban areas, to represent different sets of parents in terms of social status. Anticipated suspension of prescribed antibiotic therapy was the most frequently encountered form of non-compliance, shown by 41.2% of the parents. After partitioning the sample by mothers' occupational status--housewives versus working women--anticipated suspension revealed a positive association with educational level among the former group and a negative one, although not statistically significant, among the latter. Exposition to mass media messages about bacterial antibiotic resistance appeared to be a key intervening variable in interpreting these results, especially among more educated parents. Non-compliance was also associated with perceived characteristics of doctor-parents communication, particularly, with parents' perceived understanding of prescribed therapy.
