The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of systemic colistin therapy in the treatment of nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to study related adverse events. We prospectively studied 78 infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa that were treated with colistin. The sites of infection were pulmonary infection (78.2%), urinary tract infection (7.7%), primary bloodstream infection (11.5%) and meningitis (2.6%). The mean daily dose of colistin was 5.5+/-1.1 MU/day (range 2-9 MU/day) and the mean duration of colistin therapy was 9.3+/-3.8 days (range 5-21 days). A favourable clinical response to colistin occurred in 60 cases (76.9%). Renal failure occurred in only seven cases. We conclude that colistin can be a safe and effective salvage therapeutic option for nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa.
