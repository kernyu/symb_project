The guinea pig model of low-dose pulmonary tuberculosis has been used to study the pathogenesis of infection as well as the mechanisms of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine-induced resistance. We investigated the function of lung cells from naive and BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs after enzymatic digestion of lung tissue with collagenase and DNase I. The total lung digest cells proliferated poorly to purified protein derivative (PPD) but comparatively better to ConA as assessed by [(3)H]-thymidine uptake. However, the non-adherent population obtained after plastic adherence of lung digests showed an enhanced response to concanavalin A (ConA) and PPD. Therefore, proliferation to ConA and PPD of nylon wool-purified T cells co-cultured with peritoneal (PMos), alveolar (AMos) or lung macrophages (LMos) was assessed. Co-cultures of lung T cells and PMos showed maximum proliferation to PPD, whereas proliferation was suppressed significantly by the addition of AMos or LMos. The response of T cells to ConA was unaffected in co-cultures. Incubation of co-cultures with recombinant guinea pig interferon-gamma (rgpIFN-gamma) did not reverse the suppression. In contrast, rgpIFN-gamma-treated plastic adherent LMos that were non-specific esterase-positive were capable of reducing the intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Similarly, total, non-adherent and adherent lung digest cells from BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs showed IFN-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA expression in response to ConA, lipopolysaccharide or PPD by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by release of TNF protein but not IFN. These studies indicate that rgp-IFN-gamma-treated lung tissue macrophages from BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs are defective for inducing antigen-specific proliferation in T cells, but control the intracellular accumulation of virulent M. tuberculosis.
