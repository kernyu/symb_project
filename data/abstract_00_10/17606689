The in vitro activity of telavancin was tested against 620 gram-positive isolates. For staphylococci, MICs at which 50 and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) were both 0.25 microg/ml, irrespective of methicillin resistance. MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml for vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and 1 and 2 microg/ml for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci were inhibited by < or =0.12 microg/ml.
