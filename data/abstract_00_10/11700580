The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease mutation N88S, which is occasionally selected by treatment with nelfinavir or indinavir, confers hypersusceptibility to amprenavir in vitro. The clinical relevance of this observation is unclear. We report a case of N88S developing after virologic failure of both indinavir- and nelfinavir-containing regimens that was managed successfully with a regimen that contained amprenavir.
