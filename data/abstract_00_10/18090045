BACKGROUND: Some HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have been shown to induce insulin resistance in vitro but the degree to which specific PIs affect insulin sensitivity in humans is less well understood. METHODS: In two separate double-blind, randomized, cross-over studies, we assessed the effects of a single dose of ritonavir (800 mg) and amprenavir (1200 mg) on insulin sensitivity (euglycemic hyperglycemic clamp) in healthy normal volunteers. RESULTS: Ritonavir decreased insulin sensitivity (-15%; P = 0.008 versus placebo) and non-oxidative glucose disposal (-30%; P = 0.0004), whereas neither were affected by amprenavir administration. CONCLUSION: Compared to previously performed studies of identical design using single doses of indinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir, a hierarchy of insulin resistance was observed with the greatest effect seen with indinavir followed by ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir, with little effect of amprenavir.
