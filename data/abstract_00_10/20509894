We performed whole genome sequencing of a cidofovir {[(S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxy-propyl) cytosine] [HPMPC]}-resistant (CDV-R) strain of Monkeypoxvirus (MPV). Whole-genome comparison with the wild-type (WT) strain revealed 55 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one tandem-repeat contraction. Over one-third of all identified SNPs were located within genes comprising the poxvirus replication complex, including the DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, mRNA capping methyltransferase, DNA processivity factor, and poly-A polymerase. Four polymorphic sites were found within the DNA polymerase gene. DNA polymerase mutations observed at positions 314 and 684 in MPV were consistent with CDV-R loci previously identified in Vaccinia virus (VACV). These data suggest the mechanism of CDV resistance may be highly conserved across Orthopoxvirus (OPV) species. SNPs were also identified within virulence genes such as the A-type inclusion protein, serine protease inhibitor-like protein SPI-3, Schlafen ATPase and thymidylate kinase, among others. Aberrant chain extension induced by CDV may lead to diverse alterations in gene expression and viral replication that may result in both adaptive and attenuating mutations. Defining the potential contribution of substitutions in the replication complex and RNA processing machinery reported here may yield further insight into CDV resistance and may augment current therapeutic development strategies.
