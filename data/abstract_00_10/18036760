Two isolates of Enterobacter cloacae and 1 isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii showing a multidrug resistance phenotype including resistance to beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones were included in this study. By polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing, the 2 isolates of E. cloacae were found to produce QnrB and the A. baumannii isolate was found to produce QnrA. In addition, the 2 E. cloacae isolates were found to produce CTX-M-15.
