Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common problem that is distressing for patients and costly for the healthcare system. UTIs commonly affect young, sexually active women; the elderly; and patients who have predisposing factors, such as catheterization. Recurrent infections are likely to occur in all these patients groups. Patients who are pregnant or have predisposing factors are at increased risk for complications related to untreated UTIs, such as long-term renal damage. Given these risks and the public health burden associated with the condition, it is important that clinicians have up-to-date information regarding the classification, symptoms, pathogenesis, and empiric treatment of UTIs.
