BACKGROUND: Cyclosporin A (CyA) may induce acute nephrotoxicity. The question has been raised of the possible long-term unfavorable course of CyA-induced lesions. Advantage was taken of a large cohort of diabetic patients treated for several months using moderate CyA dosage to evaluate the long-term evolution of renal function in such patients. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty five recently diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients having received CyA for a mean of 19.9 months were monitored for 13 years, in parallel with 100 similar patients treated with insulin alone. RESULTS: In the CyA-treated group, a transient increase in creatininemia levels occurred during the first 18 months of treatment associated with a transient increase in renal vascular resistance. Both effects disappeared later on: creatininemia levels then remained normal. Inulin and p-aminohippurate (PAH) clearances remained normal throughout follow-up. Neither permanent renal failure nor progressive deterioration of renal function occurred in either group or in individual patients. A 10 to 12% increase in inulin and PAH clearance was elicited by IV amino acid infusion at 7 to 10 years, a finding consistent with a normal renal functional reserve. Patients with moderate kidney lesions on biopsy at 1 year had normal and stable clearance values at 7 to 13 years. The prevalence of arterial hypertension and retinopathy was lower in the CyA-treated group than in the control group, possibly because of the tighter metabolic control obtained in the CyA group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that low-dose CyA treatment combined with thorough monitoring does not result in long-term renal dysfunction.
