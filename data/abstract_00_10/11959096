Transgenic tobacco (Samsun NN) plants transformed with a cDNA clone encoding SNA-I' from Sambucus nigra synthesize, and correctly process and assemble, a fully active type-2 ribosome-inactivating protein. Expression of SNA-I' under the control of the 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter enhances the plant's resistance against infection with tobacco mosaic virus. In contrast to type-1 ribosome-inactivating proteins, the expression of SNA-I' does not affect the growth and fertility of the transgenic plants and is not accompanied by an increased expression of pathogenesis-related proteins indicating that its antiviral activity most probably differs from that of pokeweed antiviral protein.
