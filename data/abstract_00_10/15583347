Ocular yeast infections in diabetics are a therapeutic challenge. Drug resistance and reduced azole susceptibility are major concerns. The case we describe characterizes a Candida albicans strain from a vitrectomy specimen that was susceptible to fluconazole by in vitro testing but recalcitrant to therapy. Molecular studies revealed transient overexpression of CDR1 and ERG11 mRNA in the presence of fluconazole that may have contributed to poor clinical response in this patient.
