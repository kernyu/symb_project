The spoligotyping of 138 M. tuberculosis isolates obtained on the territory of the Samara region made it possible to classify them as belonging to 27 groups. The largest cluster including 94 strains (68.1%) belonged to Peking spoligotype. As shown with the use of the commercial system INNO-LiPA, 78 out of 134 strains (58.2%) had mutations in different sites of gene pro B. The analysis of the markers of resistance to rifampicin in Peking spoligotype revealed that 65 (83.9%) out of 90 such cultures had mutations in gene pro B, i.e. potentially these strains had multiple antimicrobial resistance. This work demonstrated the prevalence of Peking spoligotype in a prison antituberculosis colony (81.6%).
