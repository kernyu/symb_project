Data on changes of etiological structure of the complicated urinary tract infections treated at the Research Institute of Urology and Hospital No. 47 at the 5-year period (1996-2000) are given. It was shown that the most important microorganisms were the following: Enterobacter spp., E. coli, Proteus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis. The correlation between frequency of the microorganisms isolation and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents at different periods was analysed. The results of analysis allowed to elaborate algorithm of etiotropic therapy. Choice of the drug depends on pathogen susceptibility to antibiotics, bacteriuria level and clinical symptoms severity.
