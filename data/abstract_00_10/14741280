A series of 8-heteroarylthiomethyldipyridodiazepinone derivatives were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral profile against wild type virus and the important K103N/Y181C mutant as an indicator for broad activity. 2,6-Dimethylpyridine derivative 16 was found to have a good pharmacokinetic profile in spite of poor metabolic stability in rat liver microsomes.
