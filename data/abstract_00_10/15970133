OBJECTIVE: To detect the prevalence of uropathogens in community-acquired urinary tract infection in our environment, and the degree of sensitivity to antibiotics used as empirical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective longitudinal study on 16,392 consecutive urine cultures collected in the emergency department of Hospital del Mar, between January 1997 and December 2001. Resistance rates were compared through variance analysis. RESULTS: 8,743 urine cultures with significant count were obtained. 6,062 Escherichia coli (69.3%), 517 Proteus mirabilis (5.9%) and 390 Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.5%) were identified. Escherichia coli showed progressive growth rate and significant resistances to most of antibiotics evaluated, especially to quinolones which came close to 30%. Fosfomycin showed the least resistance rate (0.9%) and remained stable along the years studied. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that higher rate of resistance to quinolones does not advise its use as empirical in community-acquired urinary tract infection treatment in our environment. According to our experience, fosfomycin can be an excellent option for cystitis treatment in patients without risk factors, while for the treatment of parenchymatous urinary tract infection, complicated urinary tract infections, and urinary tract infections associated to risk factors, preference could be second or third generation oral cephalosporins, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
