A key event in the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) is the formation of aggregated and protease-resistant prion protein, PrP-res, from a normally soluble, protease-sensitive and glycosylated precursor, PrP-sen. While amino acid sequence similarity between PrP-sen and PrP-res influences both PrP-res formation and cross-species transmission of infectivity, the influence of co- or post-translational modifications to PrP-sen is unknown. Here we report that, if PrP-sen and PrP-res are derived from different species, PrP-sen glycosylation can significantly affect PrP-res formation. Glycosylation affected PrP-res formation by influencing the amount of PrP-sen bound to PrP-res, while the amino acid sequence of PrP-sen influenced the amount of PrP-res generated in the post-binding conversion step. Our results show that in addition to amino acid sequence, co- or post-translational modifications to PrP-sen influence PrP-res formation in vitro. In vivo, these modifications might contribute to the resistance to infection associated with transmission of TSE infectivity across species barriers.
