Nontuberculous mycobacteria are playing an increasingly important role in human disease owing to higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance and immunodeficiency. These organisms cause a variety of cutaneous findings which are often misdiagnosed by the clinician. Compounding this problem is the fact that most mycobacteria require special culture conditions, which if not specifically requested, are frequently not used. Recognition of susceptible patients is imperative and is not limited to the immunocompromised. Successful treatment of mycobacterial infections requires knowledge of currently available and recommended antibiotics followed by tailoring of the antimicrobial regimen after sensitivity testing is performed.
