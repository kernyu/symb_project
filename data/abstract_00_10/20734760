We have reported a bacterial infection in a dog with progressive dysplasia of the hips. Orthopedic surgery was performed. Seven weeks prior to the surgery, the patient was bitten by another dog. The postimplantation wound exuded for four days after the surgery. Microbiological analysis performed by standard identification techniques showed the presence of Staphylococcus intermedius, but an additional molecular analysis indicated S. pseudintermedius. This was followed by an evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of the strain which showed cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doksycycline, erythromycin, and gentamicin resistance. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for selected antibiotics were reported. Resistance for cefoxitin indicates that methicillin resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) strains were present in individual macroorganisms, but they can expand and persist the colonization of other hosts.
