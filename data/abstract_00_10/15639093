Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD2), a small cationic peptide, exhibits a broad range of antimicrobial activity and does not cause microbial resistance. In order to produce hBD2 efficiently, an Escherichia coli cell-free biosynthesis system has been developed as an alternative method. A specific plasmid pIVEX2.4c-trxA-shBD2 was constructed for the cell-free expression of fusion protein (hBD2 linked with His-Tag and Trx-Tag). This allowed enhancement of protein stability and facilitated downstream purification process. Significant amount of target fusion protein was synthesized in the batch-mode bioreactor by optimizing the reaction conditions. About five-fold improvement of productivity (ca. 2.0 mg/ml soluble fusion protein) could be achieved by using a continuous exchange cell-free (CECF) system compared to batch system. One-step affinity chromatographic process was developed to recover high purity fusion protein (95.2%) with overall recovery ratio of about 50%. The fusion protein was cleaved by cyanogens bromide (CNBr), and the mature hBD2 had demonstrated strong inhibition on the growth of E. coli D31 at low concentration.
