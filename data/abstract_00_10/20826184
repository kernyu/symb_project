Influenza virus infects the respiratory system of human and animals causing mild to severe illness which could lead to death. Although vaccines are available, there is still a great need for influenza antiviral drugs to reduce disease progression and virus transmission. Currently two classes (M2 channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors) of FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs are available, but there are great concerns of emergence of viral resistance. Therefore, timely development of new antiviral drugs against influenza viruses is crucial. Plant-derived polyphenols have been studied for antioxidant activity, anti-carcinogenic, and cardio- and neuroprotective actions. Recently, some polyphenols, such as resveratrol and epigallocatechin gallate, showed significant anti-influenza activity in vitro and/or in vivo. Therefore we investigated selected polyphenols for their antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses. Among the polyphenols we tested, isoquercetin inhibited the replication of both influenza A and B viruses at the lowest effective concentration. In a double treatment of isoquercetin and amantadine, synergistic effects were observed on the reduction of viral replication in vitro. The serial passages of virus in the presence of isoquercetin did not lead to the emergence of resistant virus, and the addition of isoquercetin to amantadine or oseltamivir treatment suppressed the emergence of amantadine- or oseltamivir-resistant virus. In a mouse model of influenza virus infection, isoquercetin administered intraperitoneally to mice inoculated with human influenza A virus significantly decreased the virus titers and pathological changes in the lung. Our results suggest that isoquercetin may have the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of influenza virus infection and for the suppression of resistance in combination therapy with existing drugs.
