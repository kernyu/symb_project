The emergence of resistance to antimicrobial agents continues to be a major problem in the nosocomial setting and now in nursing homes and the community as well. Bacteria use a variety of strategies to avoid the inhibitory effects of antibiotic agents and have evolved highly efficient means for the dissemination of resistance traits. Control of antibiotic-resistant pathogens provides a major challenge for both the medical community and society in general. To control the emergence of resistant pathogens, CDC and infection control guidelines must be adhered to, and antibiotics must be used more judiciously.
