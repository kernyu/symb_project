Ischemic preconditioning (IP) triggers protection of the liver from prolonged subsequent ischemia. However, the underlying protective mechanisms are largely unknown. We investigated whether and how IP protects the liver against reperfusion injury caused by Kupffer cell (KC)-derived oxidants. IP before 90 minutes of warm ischemia of rat livers in vivo significantly reduced serum alanine aminotransferase (AST) levels and leukocyte adherence to sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules during reperfusion. This protective effect was mimicked by postischemic intravenous infusion of glutathione (GSH), an antioxidative strategy against KC-derived H(2)O(2). Interestingly, no additional protection was achieved by infusion of GSH to preconditioned animals. These findings and several additional experiments strongly suggest IP mediated antioxidative effects: IP prevented oxidant cell injury in isolated perfused rat livers after selective KC activation by zymosan. Moreover, IP prevented cell injury and pertubations of the intracellular GSH/GSSG redox system caused by direct infusion of H(2)O(2) (0.5 mmol/L). IP-mediated resistance against H(2)O(2) could neither be blocked by the adenosine A2a antagonist DMPX nor mimicked by A2a agonist CGS21680. In contrast, H(2)O(2) resistance was abolished by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) inhibitor SB203580, but induced when p38 MAPK was directly activated by anisomycin. In conclusion, we propose a novel concept of hepatoprotection by IP: protection of liver cells by enhancing their resistance against KC-derived H(2)O(2). Activation of p38 MAPK and preservation of the intracellular GSH/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) redox system, but not adenosine A2a receptor stimulation, seems to be pivotal for the development of H(2)O(2) resistance in preconditioned livers.
