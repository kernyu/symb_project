A 28-year-old female developed multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculous lymphadenitis following a trip to India. She was initially treated with a four-drug regimen of first-line anti-tuberculosis medications, but when sensitivities indicated resistance to isoniazid and rifampin, her regimen was altered to ciprofloxacin (CFX), pyrazinamide (PZA) and ethambutol. She subsequently developed a rash, flu-like symptoms and fever, which progressed to acute hepatic necrosis despite discontinuation of medication. The clinical presentation and subsequent investigations suggested a hypersensitivity reaction, possibly related to the quinolone. The patient subsequently had an orthoptic liver transplant; second-line anti-tuberculosis medications were restarted to which she responded clinically and radiologically. Our findings raise the possibility that the CFX and PZA combination was responsible for the hepatic necrosis. The patient also illustrates that active, even MDR tuberculosis is not a contraindication to hepatic transplant.
