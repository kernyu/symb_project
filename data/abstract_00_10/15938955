OBJECTIVE: To analyze the isolation and the in vitro susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to antibiotics in our burn ward. METHODS: Five hundred and thirty six burn patients admitted to our ward from 1997 to 2003 were enrolled in the study, and the wound excretion, the tips of the venous catheter, the subeschar tissue samples, and the blood samples were collected for bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility test with VITEK-AMS system. RESULTS: The isolation rate of P. aeruginosa from 1997 to 2003 was 24.51%, 23.94%, 21.01%, 40.06%, 36.17%, 46.76% and 55.72%, respectively. The antibiotic effect of the third generation of Cephalosporins against the said bacteria showed a tendency to decline. The susceptibility rate to Cefoperazone, Ceftazidime and Cefotaxime were respectively 71%, 66% and 79% in 1997; 47%, 25%, 39% in 1998; 22%, 16%, 25% in 2002; The third generation cephalosporins had almost lost their antibiotic activity against P. aeruginosa in 2003, with the susceptibility rate to Cefotaxime lowered to 2%. The susceptibility rate to Imipenem from 1997 to 2003 was 76%, 33%, 45%, 11%, 41%, 31%and 4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The isolation rates of P. aeruginosa were steady during the period from 1997 to 1999, and they began to increase in 2000. The bacterial resistance to antibiotics increased gradually in recent years, and the strains of P. aeruginosa had become multi-drug resistant.
