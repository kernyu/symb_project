As part of our efforts to identify potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors that are active against resistant viral strains, structural modification of the azacyclic urea (I) was undertaken by incorporating acyl groups as P(1)' ligands. The extensive SAR study has yielded a series of N-acyl azacyclic ureas (II), which are highly potent against both wild-type and multiple PI-resistant viral strains.
