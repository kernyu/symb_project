Validation of the sensitivity of the SYBR Green I in vitro test against an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based drug sensitivity assay. Our results suggest that the SYBR Green I assay is a fast and inexpensive malaria drug screening assay for laboratory use. However, because of its lack of sensitivity in whole blood samples its usefulness for testing clinical samples may be limited.
