We investigated the prevalence and epidemiology of AmpC plasmidic cephalosporinases in Escherichia coli clinical strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins during a 5-year period at Nantes University Hospital, France (3100 beds). The prevalence and diversity of plasmidic cephalosporinase did not increase during the study period (0.09% of 25 861 E. coli isolates); only CMY-2 producers were detected (and 1 new variant, with a Y-to-C substitution at position 219). CMY-2-producing strains belonged to the 4 main phylogenetic groups and to 11 different sequence types. Three sequence types included more than 1 isolate (ST156, ST46, and ST354).
