Ciprofloxacin resistance among common bacterial pathogen comprising Esch.coli, Staph.aureus and Pseudomonas spp. isolated from different clinical samples of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital during the periods of September, 1999 to March, 2001 and September, 2001 to August, 2002 were recorded. Values of two periods were compared and increased rate of ciprofloxacin resistance were noted in every bacterial species, e.g. 32.0% in Esch.coli, 8.7% in Staph.aureus and 5.1% in Pseudomonas spp. It was suggested to be aware and careful regarding use of ciprofloxacin in clinical practice so as to limit emergence of bacterial strains resistance towards the drug.
