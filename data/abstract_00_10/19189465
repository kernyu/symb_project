Antibiotic resistance of bacterium Proteus mirabilis isolated from inpatients was assessed in 30 medical centres from 15 regions of Russia. The most active antibacterial preparations remained carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem). Between 3rd generation cephalosporins, the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was observed in inhibition-protected preparations (ceftazidime/clavulanate: MIC50 < 0.125 mcg/ml, MIC90 128 mcg/ml; cefoperazone/sulbactam: MIC50 2 mcg/ml, MIC90 64 mcg/ml). Detection of class A beta-lactamases genes (TEM, SHV, CTX) using PCR was performed in 44 strains of P. mirabilis. Genes of these enzymes was detected in 11 (25%) bacterial cultures as well as their different combinations--in 32 (72.7%) isolates of P. mirabilis. The most prevalent (56.8%) was combination of TEM and CTX genes, and in 4 nants of resistance to beta-lactams was detected.
