For intensively pretreated pediatric patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the treatment options available are limited. We report the case of a highly treatment-experienced 12-year-old boy with multidrug-resistant HIV-1, who was successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) including ritonavir-boosted tipranavir oral solution, a novel non-peptic protease inhibitor, and enfuvirtide.
