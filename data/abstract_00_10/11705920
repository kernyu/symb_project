The initial encounter of Leishmania cells and cells from the immune system is fundamentally important in the outcome of infection and determines disease development or resistance. We evaluated the anti-Leishmania amazonensis response of naive volunteers by using an in vitro priming (IVP) system and comparing the responses following in vivo vaccination against the same parasite. In vitro stimulation allowed us to distinguish two groups of individuals, those who produced small amounts of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) (n = 16) (low producers) and those who produced large amounts of this cytokine (n = 16) (high producers). IFN-gamma production was proportional to tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels but did not correlate with IL-5 production. Volunteers who produced small amounts of IFN-gamma in vitro remained low producers 40 days after vaccination, whereas high producers exhibited increased IFN-gamma production. However, 6 months after vaccination, all individuals tested produced similarly high levels of IFN-gamma upon stimulation of their peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Leishmania promastigotes, indicating that low in vitro producers respond slowly in vivo to vaccination. In high IFN-gamma producers there was an increased frequency of activated CD8(+) T cells both in vitro and in vivo compared to the frequency in low producers, and such cells were positive for IFN-gamma as determined by intracellular staining. Such findings suggest that IVP responses can be used to predict the pace of postvaccination responses of test volunteers. Although all vaccinated individuals eventually have a potent anti-Leishmania cell-mediated immunity (CMI) response, a delay in mounting the CMI response may influence resistance against leishmaniasis.
