2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) is an analog of glucose that is effectively taken up by cells competing with normal glucose but cannot be further utilized to produce energy. It was previously reported that 2DG can mimic the beneficial effects of dietary restriction in experimental models of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In the present study, we report that pretreatment with 2DG increases the resistance of neural progenitor cells (NPC) to oxidative insults. 2DG significantly suppressed the proliferation of NPC, and high concentrations of 2DG were toxic to NPC. However, a treatment with a moderate concentration of 2DG protected the NPC against tBHP-induced oxidative stress suggesting that this chemical had hormetic action mimicking dietary restriction. Furthermore, we showed that the protective mechanism of 2DG involved the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase. Our findings demonstrate that 2DG can modulate the cellular responses to oxidative stress and confer cellular resistance in NPC by activating the metabolic regulator.
