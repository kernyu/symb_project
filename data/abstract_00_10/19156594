This guideline updates a prior concensus recommendation of the German Society for Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) from 1996. It was developed by an interdisciplinary cooperation with representatives of the German Society for Microbiology, the Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (GPGE) and the German Society for Rheumatology. The guideline is methodologically based on recommendations of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) for providing a systematic evidence-based consensus guideline of S 3 level and has also implemented grading criteria according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Clinical applicability of study results as well as specifics for Germany in terms of epidemiology, antibiotic resistance status, diagnostics and therapy were taken into account.
