Whether or not a pregnant women should travel to regions where malaria is highly endemic will always be open to question as no prophlaxis can guarantee complete protection in every case. No chemoprophylaxis is 100% effective or entirely without side-effects, particularly for pregnant women whose immune status provides a favourable environment for the emergence of this parasitosis. The advice given will depend on the country and the region, a possible resistance of the parasite to treatment, the season, the length and circumstances of the stay and individual factors. The choice of treatment is very limited as many therapies are contra-indicated in pregnancy; in addition it is extremely important to give a sufficiently clear explanation concerning precautions and prophylaxis as well as of how a possible bout of malaria should be treated, particularly in case of extended stay.
