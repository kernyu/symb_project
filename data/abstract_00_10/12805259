OBJECTIVES: To investigate high-level piperacillin resistance in Veillonella spp. in the absence of beta-lactamase activity. METHODS: Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) competition studies were conducted in Veillonella strains, with piperacillin MICs ranging from 0.5 to >128 mg/L and ampicillin MICs from 0.125 to 4 mg/L. Whole cell lysates were pre-incubated with piperacillin or ampicillin and post-labelled with [3H]benzylpenicillin. RESULTS: PBP competition studies showed that the PBP with greatest affinity for penicillin and ampicillin had a molecular weight of approximately 66 kDa, and exhibited reduced binding of piperacillin in resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: This unusual focusing of different penicillins on one PBP may be the cause of selective mutants resulting from piperacillin MICs > 128 mg/L. In the absence of beta-lactamases, alterations in penicillin-binding were seen to be major contributors to high-level piperacillin resistance development.
