Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTLN), is characterized by higher prevalence in East Asians and South Americans, association with Epstein-Barr virus infection, aggressive nature in most cases, and resistance to conventional treatment strategies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The optimum treatment for this disease has not yet been established. We report a successful treatment experience in a case of ENKTLN, with a combination regimen including interferon-alpha, corticosteroid and narrowband ultraviolet B, which may serve as a promising therapy for this aggressive disease at earlier stages.
