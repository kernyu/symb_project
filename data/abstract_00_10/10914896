BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is a risk factor for implant loss. Late bacterial infection of the peri-implant tissues and loss of alveolar bone in edentulous patients is caused by commensal oral anaerobic bacteria. In partially edentulous patients, Porphyromonas gingivalis and occasionally Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are associated with peri-implantitis lesions. AIMS: To investigate the microbiology of a peri-implantitis case in an edentulous patient. METHODS: Anaerobic culture techniques and selective culture techniques for A. actinomycetemcomitans were used to study the peri-implant microflora at sites with and without bone loss. RESULTS: An anaerobic peri-implant microflora with several putative periodontal pathogens was found at sites with bone loss. Furthermore, a metronidazole-resistant A. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated. The A. actinomycetemcomitans infection did not respond to systemic doxycycline therapy, despite good susceptibility in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The present case of severe A. actinomycetemcomitans-associated peri-implantitis shows the importance of pre-operative infection control. The findings in this case show that remaining teeth affected by periodontitis can be a serious risk factor for peri-implantitis.
