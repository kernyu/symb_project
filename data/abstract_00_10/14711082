Antiretroviral drug exposure has been linked to both antiviral efficacy and the development of toxicity and further research in this area is ongoing and necessary.

TDM, in conjunction with an assessment of the patient's viral resistance in the form of an IQ, needs to be examined and validated in large clinical trials.
