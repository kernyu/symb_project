OBJECTIVE: To obtain primary knowledge of drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in the common pathogenic bacteria in this hospital thereby to bring the situation under control. METHODS: A total of 3 800 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from in-patients from 1997 to 2000, and drug resistance of these strains to ciprofloxacin was examined. RESULTS: During the past 4 years, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were found to be highly resistant to ciprofloxacin with the rates still on the rise from 50%, 25.6% and 40.3% in 1997 to 62.2%, 53.4% and 63.6% respectively in 2000. Over 40% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the percentages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter reached 31.1% to 34.0% in 2000. Among the 189 strains of the pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with sustained infection in our hospital in 2000, over 70% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as having resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The percentages of common pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to ciprofloxacin have been considerably high and tend to increase further. Ciprofloxacin abuse needs to be given appropriate attention.
