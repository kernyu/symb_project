A case of metronidazole- and albendazole-resistant giardiasis in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was successfully treated with nitazoxanide (1.5 g twice a day for 30 days). Animal studies and in vitro assays showed that the isolate was resistant to both metronidazole and albendazole and susceptible to nitazoxanide.
