The transmission of drug-resistant strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is of increasing concern in countries where antiretroviral therapy is widely used and does not spare countries where highly effective antiretroviral therapy has been recently introduced. The global HIV drug resistance surveillance programme will track the drug susceptibility in a rapidly moving epidemic, to provide information necessary to develop effective treatment strategies, to support and complement programmes aimed at increasing HIV therapy availability, and to assist in targeting and complementing drug resistance prevention strategies.
