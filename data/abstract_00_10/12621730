We examined the annual isolation rate, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and coagulase types of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from inpatients in Hokusetsu General Hospital to ascertain the situation of MRSA isolates between 1992 and 2001. The isolation rate of MRSA in S. aureus increased annually from 1992, reaching 65.3% in 2001. The isolation rates of MRSA in the inpatients were 3.2 times greater than those in the outpatients. In the clinical specimens the isolation rate of MRSA from sputum was the highest, i.e., 32.9%. In respect of the coagulase types, type II accounted for 85.7% of the all types. MIC90 values of arbekacin, sulfmethoxazole-trimethoprin, vancomycin, teicopranin and minocycline were 4.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively.
