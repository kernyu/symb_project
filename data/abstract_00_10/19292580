The multi-antimicrobial resistance gene cluster and its derivatives have been detected in Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), which has been identified in the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, phage types DT104, DT12, DT120, and U302, as well as other Salmonella serovars, including Agona, Paratyphi B, Albany, Meleagridis, Newport, Cerro, Derby, Dusseldorf, Infantis, Kiambu, and Emek. We acquired 53 Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 isolates from diarrheal patients in Korea. From these isolates, we identified a novel antimicrobial resistance gene cluster as an additional gene cassette in SGI1 from a multi-antimicrobial resistant isolate. The minimum inhibitory concentration for this isolate against ampicillin and chloramphenicol was two to four times higher than those for other multi-antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 isolates. The new antimicrobial resistance gene cluster detected in this isolate consisted of bla(PSE-1), sul1 Delta, floR, and tetR, in that order. The order of this gene cluster was shuffled as compared to that of the known In104 in SGI1. This report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to identify and describe an additional shuffled antimicrobial resistance gene cluster in SGI1.
