OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the type of aerobic bacteria commonly isolated from peritonsillar abscesses. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study involving 60 patients presenting with peritonsillar abscess treated between 2003 and 2006. SETTING: The patients were treated in a tertiary care, teaching hospital. The records of the patients were reviewed and analysed. RESULTS: Gram-positive organisms were commonly isolated from the abscesses. However, an increasing trend towards Gram-negative bacterial isolates was noted. The antibiogram showed changing patterns of sensitivity, with a resistance to penicillin. CONCLUSION: There is an increasing incidence of Gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing peritonsillar abscess. Appropriate antibiotics for Gram-negative bacteria should be included in the regimen if such bacteria are isolated in culture and sensitivity studies. SIGNIFICANCE: Empirical antibiotics with Gram-negative cover will be appropriate as adjunctive therapy.
