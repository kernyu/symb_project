OBJECTIVES: To establish a multiplex PCR to detect and differentiate the beta-lactamase genes of Haemophilus influenzae. METHODS: A collection of H. influenzae isolates with a range of different beta-lactamase genes were tested in parallel with individual PCRs and the multiplex assay developed in this study. RESULTS: The multiplex method was found to be superior to previous methods and was able to correctly detect and differentiate blaROB-1 and the variants of blaTEM present in the strains tested, including a previously unrecognized variant associated with a 54 bp insertion in the promoter region. CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex PCR will be a useful tool for the surveillance of beta-lactamase genes in H. influenzae.
