One hundred ninety-three Streptococcus agalactiae isolates of neonatal origin and 146 isolates from adult women were analyzed for macrolide resistance and investigated for clonality. Among erythromycin-resistant isolates, serotype V turned out to be the most frequent. Comparative pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed genetic clustering of resistant strains and predominance of a single clone family within an otherwise heterogeneous serotype V population.
