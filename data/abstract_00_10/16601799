The effect of two phenolic compounds vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) and lignin on the development of drug/antibiotic resistance in Salmonella typhimurium was studied. Using the modified Ames test we have shown that vanillin alone has negligible effect on spontaneous mutability to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin resistance. At the tested concentrations vanillin reduces the toxicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO) and reduces the ability of this compound to induce mutations leading to ciprofloxacin but not to gentamicin resistance. Lignin at higher concentrations increases mutagenicity to ciprofloxacin resistance and possess considerable inhibition effect on the spontaneous and 4NQO induced mutability to gentamicin resistance.
