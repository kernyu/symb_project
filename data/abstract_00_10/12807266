The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA)* registers veterinary antibiotic products before they can be supplied, distributed or sold in Australia. Extensive scientific assessment on all new veterinary antibiotic products is undertaken for the APVMA by experts in other government agencies including the Therapeutic Goods Administration (toxicology), the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (occupational health and safety), Environment Australia (environmental hazards) and state departments of agriculture or primary industry (efficacy and safety) as well as APVMA assessments on food residues, trade and manufacturing. The National Health and Medical Research Council Expert Advisory Group on Antimicrobial Resistance provides advice to the APVMA on the potential transfer of antibiotic resistance from the use of antibiotics in animals to humans, and the impact transfer may have on public health. Food Standards Australia New Zealand (previously Australia New Zealand Food Authority) set maximum residue levels for human foods. The APVMA monitors registered product use through compliance activities and an adverse experience reporting program, and reviews registered products as necessary. The import, manufacture, supply and use of veterinary antibiotics are regulated by Commonwealth and State governments in Australia.
