OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that antibiotic therapy may promote recurrence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) stool colonization in patients who have previously had three consecutive negative stool cultures obtained at least 1 week apart. DESIGN: One-year prospective cohort study examining the effect of antibiotic therapy on recurrence and density of VRE stool colonization in patients who have cleared colonization. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to determine whether recurrent VRE strains were the same clone as the previous colonizing strain. SETTING: A Department of Veterans Affairs medical center including an acute care hospital and nursing home. PATIENTS: All patients with at least one stool culture positive for VRE who subsequently had three consecutive negative stool cultures obtained at least 1 week apart. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients who cleared VRE colonization, 13 received antibiotic therapy during the study period. Eight (62%) of the 13 patients who received antibiotics developed recurrent high-density VRE stool colonization (range, 4.9 to 9.1 log10 colony-forming units per gram) during a course of therapy. Five patients had VRE strains available for PFGE analysis; recurrent strains were unrelated to the prior strain in 3 patients, closely related in 1 patient, and indistinguishable in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic therapy may be associated with recurrent high-density VRE stool colonization in many patients who have previously had three consecutive negative stool cultures. These patients should be screened for recurrent stool colonization when antibiotic therapy is administered.
