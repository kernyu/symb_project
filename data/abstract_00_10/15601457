Fifty dermatophyte isolates, recently obtained from clinical materials, belonging to Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. verrucosum, Microsporum canis and Epidermophyton floccosum were examined for their susceptibility to griseofulvin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were obtained using the modified microdilution method. All 100% tested isolates had MIC geometric mean at a concentration between 0.43 and 0.95 microg ml(-1) The MIC(90)s and MIC(50)s were 8 microg ml(-1) and <0.25-1 microg ml(-1) respectively. From all isolates, 12% including three T. verrucosum, one M. canis and two T. mentagrophytes isolates had MIC values out of the standardized range, therefore, they were considered as relatively griseofulvin-resistant. At least some of the isolates tested might be difficult to eradicate in clinical terms with griseofulvin treatment in Isfahan.
