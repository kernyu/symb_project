OBJECTIVE: To use qualitative research to develop a complementary set of job aids to improve adherence to cotrimoxazole for childhood pneumonia and to improve provider-client counseling. DESIGN: Qualitative research on existing knowledge and practices of parents and providers using key informant interviews, focus groups, clinic observation, and home visits. A workshop of local stakeholders produced messages and job aids for health care workers and parents that included counseling cards and posters for providers, and medication envelopes with educational messages for mothers. Draft mock-ups were tested, modified, and re-tested before final production and distribution. SETTING: Boboye District, Niger. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Clinic health care workers, mothers of children with pneumonia, and key informants. RESULTS: A complementary set of counseling tools, or job aids, was designed based on consensus developed during the workshop, leading to greater buy-in and local support. CONCLUSION: Behavior change communication theory and qualitative research can be applied to the design of key messages on adherence to an antibiotic regimen and corresponding job aids for both parents and health care workers. This approach generates enthusiastic support from local participants.
