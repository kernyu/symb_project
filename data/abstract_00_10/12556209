Bacteria have proved themselves able to develop resistance to every antibiotic used clinically. Traditional agents used for treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive species have recently been supplemented with the introduction of linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, several new quinolones and telithromycin. However, resistance to many of these agents has already been reported and, although each currently retains activity against the vast majority of clinical isolates of its target species, their long-term efficacy is uncertain. We must look to develop other compounds to replace and hopefully improve upon existing anti-Gram-positive agents. Daptomycin (a lipopeptide), oritavancin and dalbavancin (both second-generation glycopeptides) and ramoplanin (a glycolipodepsipeptide) are among the agents in advanced stages of development and, at present, many seem likely to proceed to licensing. In addition, it is encouraging that many agents active against novel bacterial targets have been discovered and are in earlier stages of development. In the next two decades, we should be optimistic that a regular flow of new anti-Gram-positive agents will enable us to offset the constant spectre of bacterial resistance.
