Current antiretroviral therapy protocols enable long-term survival of HIV-infected patients, decreasing the risk of infectious complications. Three classes of anti-HIV treatments are available. With longer survival, unusual cardiovascular complications related to iatrogenic biological anomalies (dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance) have appeared among this young population which is exposed to usual risk factors of atherosclerosis. Antiretroviral therapies are suspected to cause these complications, inducing maturity-onset diabetes in 4 to 20% of patients, impaired glucose tolerance in 15 to 60%, hypertriglyceridemia in 15 to 74% depending on the survey, and hypercholesterolemia in 20 to 60%, especially in case of associated lipodystrophia. A lipid battery including total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides, and 12-h fasting blood glucose should be obtained before initiating antiretroviral therapy. Any anomalous finding should be followed carefully with regular surveillance every 3 to 6 months and search for other causes of secondary dyslipidemia. In the event of casual and persisting elevation of LDL-cholesterol levels, a statin treatment can be introduced. For secondary prevention, irrespective of the context, recommendations currently merge with the consensus applying to the general population. These patients require careful surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors and a specific care in addition to treatment of their immunodeficiency.
