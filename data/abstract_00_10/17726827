Induction of expression of the tumor suppressor p53 after interferon treatment has been recently demonstrated (Takaoka et al., 2003), suggesting an antiviral activity of the protein. In addition, a direct correlation between p53 levels and tumor resistance has been addressed by generating mice with an extra copy of p53 ('super p53' mice) (Garcia-Cao et al., 2002). Here, we show that vesicular stomatitis virus replication in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from 'super p53' mice is impaired as a result of apoptosis induction via p53 activation. These findings unequivocally demonstrate an antiviral activity of p53, a process that may contribute to inhibit the spread of the virus in vivo.
