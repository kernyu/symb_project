It has been shown that mutants of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (ECA) resistant to mitomycin C could be characterized by the change of colonies morphology, sensitivity to bacteriocins, and by the change of pathogeneity. It is supposed that mutations responsible for the stability to mitomycin C touch the synthesis of cell membranes components. In some cases MCr-mutations caused cardinal changes--the loss of prototrophy and synthesis of carotinoid pigment. The mutants obtained in this work can be used to study the pathogenic process in Erwinia carotovora. Some of MCr- mutants are the handy indicators of carotovoricins.
