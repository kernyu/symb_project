The current standard of care for treatment of hepatitis C is pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Despite the large number of new oral agents under development, interferon will likely remain the backbone of future therapy. Interferon has unique antiviral and immunomodulatory properties, which have been critical in limiting resistance to protease inhibitors and improving efficacy. Hence, optimizing pharmacokinetics and promoting adherence to interferon dosing regimens will become even more critical as new regimens enter the clinical arena. This review highlights novel interferons under development that may offer therapeutic advantages over the formulations currently available.
