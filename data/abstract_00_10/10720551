Aminoglycoside-resistance mechanisms were characterized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients during a recent clinical trial of inhaled tobramycin. Impermeability, in which bacteria have reduced susceptibility to all aminoglycosides, was the predominant mode of resistance in isolates obtained both before and after 6 months of cyclic treatment with tobramycin or placebo administered by aerosol. Enzymatic resistance mechanisms were found in fewer than 10% of resistant isolates. P. aeruginosa from individual patients could be grouped on the basis of genetic relatedness. When enzymatic resistance was involved, all isolates in a group had elevated tobramycin MICs. When impermeability occurred, MICs of a genotypic group varied from susceptible to resistant. These findings suggest that impermeability resistance occurs in only a fraction of the P. aeruginosa population in lungs of persons with CF and that this form of resistance arises by a process involving multiple small changes in MIC.
