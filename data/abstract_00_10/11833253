Candida vaginitis is one of the most frequent infection of the female genital tract with a high incidence. Approximately 75% of sexually active women suffer at least one episode of Candida vaginitis and 10% of them have recurrent episodes. Pregnancy, diabetes mellitus and antibiotic treatment are the most common predisposing factors, C. albicans is the etiologic agent most frequently found. The widespread reports of fluconazole resistance in Candida species and the selection of non Candida albicans prompted the study of species distribution of vulvovaginal candidiasis and their in vitro susceptibility against current antifungal agents. A total of 314 women with vaginal infection were studied. Yeasts were isolated from 104 patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. The following species were identified: C. albicans 87.5%, C. glabrata 8.6% and 3.9% included C. krusei, C. famata, C. tropicalis and S. cerevisiae. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for nystatin, isoconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole, using a broth microdilution method based on NCCLS procedure. Although most of the isolates were C. albicans, the high percentage of C. glabrata recovered suggests the need to identify the yeasts isolated. Fluconazole resistant C. albicans were isolated in 13.46% of the cases. Thus, further studies are required to correlate the possible role of these strains in recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.
