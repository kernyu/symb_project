Amodiaquine/artesunate and artemether/lumefantrine are currently implemented as antimalarial drugs in Africa. In this study, we assessed Plasmodium falciparum pfmdr1 alleles suggesting reduced sensitivity to amodiaquine/artesunate (86Y-184Y-1246Y) and artemether/lumefantrine (184F and 86N-184F-1246D) in 111 African isolates imported to Germany between 1997 and 2005. pfmdr1 86Y-184Y-1246Y occurred less frequently in West African isolates (2.5%) than in East African parasites (45.8%) (P<0.001) and less frequently in infections contracted in countries currently implementing amodiaquine/artesunate (5.7%) compared with countries with an artemether/lumefantrine policy (20.8%) (P=0.03). pfmdr1 184F showed an opposite pattern. pfmdr1 alleles reveal significant differences between West and East Africa, supporting the current implementation of first-line antimalarials.
