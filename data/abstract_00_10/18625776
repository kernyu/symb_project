Clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were tested for a correlation between tigecycline MIC and expression of ramA by using real-time PCR. At MICs of 4 and 8 microg/ml, the expression of ramA was statistically significantly different from MICs of 2 microg/ml or less, supporting the tigecycline susceptibility breakpoint of <or=2 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae.
