Clostridium innocuum is an unusual cause of infections in humans. This report describes the first published case of C. innocuum bacteremia in a patient with AIDS and provides a review of the literature. The case suggests that recent C. difficile infection may be a risk factor for the subsequent development of C. innocuum bacteremia among immunosuppressed persons. Because of their intrinsic resistance to several common antibiotics, including vancomycin, C. innocuum infections are important to recognize.
