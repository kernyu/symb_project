Each year at least 30 000 Western travellers acquire malaria and approximately 1-4% of those who acquire Plasmodium falciparum malaria will die as a result of infection. Almost all cases and fatalities are preventable with the use of measures to reduce mosquito bites and appropriate chemoprophylaxis for those at high risk of infection. There are currently a limited number of licensed drugs available to prevent malaria in travellers. New effective and well tolerated agents are urgently needed because of increasing resistance to antimalarials such as chloroquine and proguanil, and real and perceived intolerance to standard drugs such as mefloquine. A newly licensed antimalarial (atovaquone plus proguanil; Malarone) compares favourably with other drug options, although some prescribers may be unfamiliar with the specific advantages and disadvantages of this antimalarial. This article reviews recent clinical experience and randomised controlled trial data in order to address frequently asked questions about this new combination drug.
