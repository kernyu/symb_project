An investigation of infectious intestinal disease in England included examination of feces for Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). Using DNA probe hybridization 27 VTEC strains were identified, 12 were from cases, and of these three belonged to serogroup O157. The remaining 15 strains were isolated from controls. The strains were confirmed biochemically as E. coli, they were serotyped and characterized according to their toxin production, the presence of sequences encoding intimin (eae) and enterohemolysin was determined and resistance to antimicrobial agents was determined. Six of the nine cases with non-O157 VTEC were less than 16 years old, only two of the 15 controls were under 16. Infection with more than one micro-organism was also considered.
