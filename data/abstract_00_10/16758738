THE AIM: To estimate the incidence of MRSA strains in hospitalized children, the analysis of antibiotic treatment necessity and its effectiveness. RESULTS: In 54 cases biological material obtained from hospitalized children revealed the culture of S. aureus, 22% of them were MRSA strains. Micro-organisms were cultured from throat swabs, faeces, purulent skin lesions, blood, cerebrospinal fluid. Antibiotic treatment was applied in 3 cases. Vancomycin (Edicin) was used as the first-choice option. Symptoms of drug intolerance was observed in all three cases after the first or the second dose, must have been immediately withdrawn. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA strains are common in children population, they are not only nosocomial strains. Infections caused by S. aureus MRSA may result in life-threatening diseases. The generic formula of Vancomycin, that is used in Poland may cause serious side effects, which restricts narrow range of therapeutic options to eradicate MRSA strains.
