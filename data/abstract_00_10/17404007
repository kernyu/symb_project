The influence of qnrA1 on the development of quinolone resistance in Enterobacteriaceae was evaluated by using the mutant prevention concentration parameter. The expression of qnrA1 considerably increased the mutant prevention concentration compared to strains without this gene. In the presence of qnrA1, mutations in gyrA and parC genes were easily selected to produce high levels of quinolone resistance.
