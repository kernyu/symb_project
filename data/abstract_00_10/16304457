The International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) Drug Resistance Mutations Group is marking 5 years as an independent volunteer panel of experts focused on identifying key HIV-1 drug resistance mutations. The goal of the effort is to quickly deliver accurate and unbiased information on these mutations to HIV clinical practitioners. The October/November 2005 version of the IAS-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Figures replaces the version published in this journal in March/April 2005. The IAS-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Figures are designed for use in identifying mutations associated with viral resistance to antiretroviral drugs and in making therapeutic decisions. Care should be taken when using this list of mutations for surveillance or epidemiologic studies of transmission of drug-resistant virus. A number of amino acid substitutions, particularly minor mutations, represent polymorphisms that in isolation may not reflect prior drug selective pressure or reduced drug susceptibility.
