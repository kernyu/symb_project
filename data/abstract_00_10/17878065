Septicemia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae was associated with high mortality in Tanzanian children. Conjugation experiments on the SHV-12-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed that ESBL-encoding genes were transferred on large plasmids together with genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, resistance to ceftazidime, gentamicin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol.
