Variety of traits important in diagnostics and epidemiology of pathogenic microorganisms may change due to antibiotics. Movement ability, that is characteristic for every serovar except from Salmonella Gallinarum-Pullorum, is important to salmonellas. In own experiments using semi-fluid MSRV medium, it was found that a decrease in salmonella sensibility to selected antibiotics and chemiotherapeutics due to passage might lead to weakening of its movement ability. Movement ability of all strains (S. Enteritidis, S. Dublin, S. Typhimurium) after passage with amoxycillin, neomycin, colistin and enrofloxacin became weakened as compared to results achieved before passage. The strongest inhibition of movement ability was most often observed in strains after passage on medium with colistin. It seems to be associated with the action mechanism of the antibiotic. Colistin injuries cellular membranes, where flagella (active motoric organ of Salmonella) are anchored. Appearance of drug-resistance as a result of passage at the presence of antibiotics may cause variability of biochemical properties of Salmonella rods and leads to weakening of movement ability of ciliated Salmonella.
