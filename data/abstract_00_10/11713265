We used retrovirus insertion-mediated random mutagenesis to generate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-resistant lines from L929 cells. Using this approach, we discovered that the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4 (PMCA4) is required for TNF-induced cell death in L929 cells. Under basal conditions, PMCA4-deficient (PMCA(mut)) cells have a normal phenotype. However, stimulation with TNF induces an abnormal increase in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). The substantially elevated [Ca(2+)](i) caused resistance to TNF-induced cell death. We found that an increase in the total volume of acidic compartments (VAC), mainly constituted by lysosomes, is a common event in cell death caused by a variety of agonists. The increased [Ca(2+)](i) in PMCA(mut) cells promoted lysosome exocytosis, which, at least in part, accounted for the inhibition of TNF-induced increase in VAC and cell death. Promoting lysosome exocytosis by calcium inhibited TNF-induced cell death in wild-type L929 cells, while inhibition of lysosome exocytosis or increase of VAC by sucrose restored the sensitivity of PMCA(mut) cells to TNF-induced cell death. Thus, increase of the volume of acidic compartment is a part of the cell death process, and the antideath effect of calcium is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of the TNF-induced increase in VAC.
