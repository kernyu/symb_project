The antimicrobial resistances to antibiotics are a worldwide public health issue. Today's successful treatments of infections are threatened. If the antimicrobial resistances to antibiotics are not controlled, morbidity, mortality and health care costs would increase. The main reason for the increasing number of these resistances is the wrong use of antibiotics by: health professional prescriptors (physicians, dentists, veterinary surgeons), dispensers (pharmacists), patients (self-prescription, non-fulfillment of treatments) and health care authorities (lack of policy and ineffective management of the rational use of antibiotics). There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but none is definitive by itself. It is required to assume the coexistence with microorganisms instead of trying to exterminate them.
