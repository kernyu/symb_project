A total of 90 samples of infant formula (IF) were collected from the lactary of a teaching hospital, during a 4-month period from July to August 1999. The sanitary conditions of the formulas were analyzed, and a physiological characterization of Gram-negative bacillus isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed. Colony counts were considered to be unacceptable for the majority of the IF samples and the contamination rates were related to inadequate handling. Coliforms (35 degrees C and 45 degrees C growth) were detected in most of the IF tested. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Cedacea davisae, Klebsiella planticola and Enterobacter cloacae were the isolates most commonly identified. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed significant resistance rates, particularly to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, cephalotin or ampicillin. One extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae strain was also recovered.
