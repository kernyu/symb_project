Approximately three-quarters of all women will experience an episode of vulvovaginal candidosis at least once in their life and 5-10% of them will have more than one attack. Women suffering from three to four attacks within 12 months will be diagnosed with recurrent vulvovaginal candidosis (RVVC). This review covers the large number of proposed aetiological factors for RVVC. The diagnosis of the condition made by conventional means by health providers is often false and is also often misdiagnosed by the affected woman herself. The review covers various methods of diagnosing RVVC and the current knowledge on potential pathogenetic mechanisms proposed for genital candida infections. Treatment of RVVC, including local and systemic antimicrobial therapy and behaviour modification to decrease the risk of recurrences, are discussed. Recent knowledge on drug resistance in candida is also included.
