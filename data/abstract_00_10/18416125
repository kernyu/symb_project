The analyze selected fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms of clinical E. faecalis strains was presented. In the second part of the study of genetic polymorphisms and mutations in the QRDRs of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes were analyzed. The MSSCP technique and DNA sequencing were used. The activity (MICs) of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined against 180 tested strains. The MSSCP method allows rapid screening of the genetic polymorphisms analyze of gyrA, gyrB, parC i parE genes. The amino acid substitutions of GyrA, GyrB and ParC were observed. The results indicate that mutations present among clinical E. faecalis strains associated with high level resistance to fluoroquinolons.
