Results from global mRNA expression profiling have revealed that plants express similar sets of defense mechanisms in response to different pathogens. Resistance is regulated by shifts in the balance among defense mechanisms, and by quantitative and/or kinetic enhancements that make the defense response more effective. The signaling mechanism that controls the activation of defenses consists of a highly interconnected network. Careful combination of recently developed technologies promises to deepen our understanding of the behavior of this complex signaling network.
