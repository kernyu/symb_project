C. amycolatum strains belongs to opportunistic bacteria considered as etiological factors of hospital infections. It's usually handled as a human natural flora, so antibiotic sensitivity is not checked. There's a few reports relative to antibiotic sensitivity of C. amycolatum in the world literature. So, we decided to examine antibiotic sensitivity of isolated strains. The 70 of C. amycolatum strains isolated from clinical samples from patients hospitalised at Samodzielny Publiczny Szpital Kliniczny in Bydgoszcz were analysed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the strains was performed by means of a disk diffusion method. 28.6% of analysed strains were susceptible to penicillin and 38.6% to ampicillin. Susceptibility to another 16 antibiotics was from 40.0% for ceftazidime to 64.3% for ceftriaxone. Penicillinase was not produced by analysed strains. We stated higher percentage of strains susceptible to combinations of penicillin with inhibitors than to penicillin and ampicillin. The most strains were susceptible to quinupristin-dealfopristin, linezolid and glycopeptide antibiotics but resistance to mupirocin. 35.7% analysed strains were multiresistance; there were resistance to beta-lactams (approximately 100%), lincosamides (96.0%), macrolides (92.0%) and quinolones (92.0%). Multiresistant strains were the most frequently isolated from wound swabs (60.0%) and mainly came from patients treated at the departments of general surgery (28.0%) and vascular surgery (16.0%).
