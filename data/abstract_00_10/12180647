Resistance to anti-HIV protease drugs is a major problem in the design of AIDS drugs with long-term efficacy. To identify structural features associated with a certain resistance profile, the inhibitory properties of a series of symmetric and asymmetric cyclic sulfamide, cyclic urea and linear transition-state analogue inhibitors of HIV-1 protease were investigated using wild-type and mutant enzyme. To allow a detailed structure-inhibition analysis, enzyme with single, double, triple and quadruple combinations of G48V, V82A, 184V and L90M substitutions was used. Kinetic analysis of the mutants revealed that catalytic efficiency was 1-30% of that for the wild-type enzyme, a consequence of reduced kcat in all cases and an increased KM for all mutants except for the G48V enzyme. The overall structure-inhibitory profiles of the cyclic compounds were similar, and the inhibition of the V82A, 184V and G48V/L90M mutants were less efficient than of the wild-type enzyme. The greatest increase in Ki was generally observed for the 184V mutant and least for the G48V/L90M mutant, and additional combinations of mutations did not result in improved inhibition profiles for the cyclic compounds. An extended analysis of additional mutants, and including a set of linear compounds, showed that the profile was unique for each compound, and did not reveal any general structural features associated with a certain inhibition profile. The effects of structural modifications in the inhibitors, or of mutations, were not additive and they differed depending on their context. The results demonstrate the difficulties in predicting resistance, even for closely related compounds, and designing compounds with improved resistance profiles.
