The macrolide antibiotic concanamycin is a potent and specific inhibitor of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), binding to the V(0) membrane domain of this eukaryotic acid pump. Although binding is known to involve the 16 kDa proteolipid subunit, contributions from other V(0) subunits are possible that could account for the apparently different inhibitor sensitivities of pump isoforms in vertebrate cells. In this study, we used a fluorescence quenching assay to directly examine the roles of V(0) subunits in inhibitor binding. Pyrene-labeled V(0) domains were affinity purified from Saccharomyces vacuolar membranes, and the 16 kDa proteolipid was subsequently extracted into chloroform and methanol and purified by size exclusion chromatography. Fluorescence from the isolated proteins was strongly quenched by nanomolar concentrations of both concanamycin and an indolyl pentadieneamide compound, indicating high-affinity binding of both natural macrolide and synthetic inhibitors. Competition studies showed that these inhibitors bind to overlapping sites on the proteolipid. Significantly, the 16 kDa proteolipid in isolation was able to bind inhibitors as strongly as V(0) did. In contrast, proteolipids carrying mutations that confer resistance to both inhibitors showed no binding. We conclude that the extracted 16 kDa proteolipid retains sufficient fold to form a high-affinity inhibitor binding site for both natural and synthetic V-ATPase inhibitors and that the proteolipid contains the major proportion of the structural determinants for inhibitor binding. The role of membrane domain subunit a in concanamycin binding and therefore in defining the inhibitor binding properties of tissue-specific V-ATPases is critically re-assessed in light of these data.
