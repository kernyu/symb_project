OBJECTIVE: To obtain the main responsible organisms, its sensitivity and resistances to antibiotics in tonsillitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have studied the post-surgical tonsils, carrying out a microbiologic study, its culture and sensitivity. RESULTS: The most frequent isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (29.3%), followed by Streptococcus pyogenes (23.4%), and Haemophilus influenzae (12.1%). The highest resistances were for the S. aureus (penicillin 91%, erythromycin 18% and 5% to the rest of the beta-lactams), followed by H. influenzae (50% clarithromycin, 30% amoxyciIlin and 2% cephalosporins) and S. pyogenes (28% erytromycin, 10% clindamycin and 3% penicillin). CONCLUSIONS: We noticed the minimal resistance found to cephalosporins, and for this reason they appear to be the safest option, except in children under five years old, in which amoxicillin is still the first line treatment, because the causative agent is S. pyogenes, sensitive to that antibiotic.
