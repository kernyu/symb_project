Multidrug resistance and extensive drug resistance in treating tuberculosis patients is worrisome for the medical personnel. Mechanism of drug resistance and genetic probes are of great academic interest. Causes of drug resistance can be grouped as: Biological factors, patient factors, disease factors and iatrogenic factors. Types of drug resistance are primary, acquired, initial, transitional and natural. Diagnosis of drug resistant tuberculosis is very important. Mismanagement of multidrug resistant tuberculosis can lead to extensive drug resistant tuberculosis. Stop TB Strategy and WHO Global Task Force have taken keen interest and laid guidelines and options for National TB Control Programme to help countries to combat drug-resistant tuberculosis.
