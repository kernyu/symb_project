Two strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, producing VIM-1 were isolated for the first time in Spain. In both strains, bla(VIM-1) was found to be carried on a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron. The bla(VIM-1)-containing integron was located on a transferable plasmid.
