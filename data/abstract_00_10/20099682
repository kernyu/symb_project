The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum is generally high. Study of this diversity is useful to differentiate the strains present in an individual before and after malaria treatment or to check if several individuals have been infected by the same parasites. Interpretation of the in vivo test recommended by the WHO to evaluate antimalarial drug efficacy requires distinguishing recrudescence from new infection when recurrent parasitemia suggests the possibility of therapeutic failure and antimalaria resistance. For this purpose, molecular biology techniques such as nested-PCRs are becoming increasingly available and can now be used in most endemic areas. An effort has been made to standardize P. falciparum genotyping carried out to distinguish recrudescence from new infection. Standardization has focused not only on genotyping methods but also on interpretation criteria. Compliance with these recommendations should improve the quality of clinical research and allow comparison of data from different centers.
