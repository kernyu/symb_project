A 28-year-old female developed infective endocarditis in the tricuspid valve and multiple lung abscesses due to septic pulmonary emboli early after intensive therapy for ulcerative colitis. The pathogen was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Usual antibiotic agents and linezolid were administered. Three weeks later, she fell into cardiopulmonary arrest due to further pulmonary emboli and required mechanical circulatory assist. Fatal brain damage was suggested at first. Two days later, she fully regained consciousness and underwent tricuspid valve replacement using mechanical valve and extirpation of septic pulmonary embolus. Mechanical circulatory assist was discontinued on the next day. After strenuous administration of linezolid and other drugs for 9 weeks, she was discharged from hospital on foot. We believe that early surgical intervention should be considered in patients with infective endocarditis in the right heart and subsequent septic pulmonary emboli. Linezolid was very useful in this patient.
