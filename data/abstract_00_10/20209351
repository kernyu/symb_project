Thirty-seven isolates from 10 HIV-negative and 26 HIV-positive patients in Mato Grosso were evaluated. Direct examination, culturing and chemotyping of species were performed. Ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole and amphotericin B were evaluated. Thirty-seven yeasts of Cryptococcus spp were identified, of which 26 were from HIV-positive patients (25 Cryptococcus neoformans and one Cryptococcus gattii) and 10 from HIV-negative patients (five Cryptococcus neoformans and five Cryptococcus gattii). The Cryptococcus neoformans clinical isolates from HIV-positive patients showed resistance (8% and 8.7%) and dose-dependent susceptibility (20% and 17.4%) to fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. Among the Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from HIV-negative patients, there was dose-dependent susceptibility (40%) to fluconazole. Cryptococcus gattii isolates from HIV-negative patients were shown to be susceptible to all antifungal agents, except for one isolate of Cryptococcus gattii that showed dose-dependent susceptibility to fluconazole (20%). The Cryptococcus gattii isolate from an HIV-positive patient showed resistance to fluconazole (MIC > or = 256 (1/4)g/ml) and itraconazole (MIC = 3 (1/4)microg/ml).
