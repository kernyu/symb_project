OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of triple- and quadruple-resistant Helicobacter pylori isolated in Germany, to characterize those isolates molecular genetically and to identify risk factors for the development of multiresistance. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility to metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin and rifampicin in 1118 clinical isolates obtained between July 2006 and December 2007 was tested by the Etest method. For patients harbouring triple- or quadruple-resistant strains (n = 169), data on prior eradication therapies and underlying diseases were collected and evaluated. A select number of quadruple- and triple-resistant strains were examined for resistance-mediating mutations in their 23S rRNA, 16S rRNA, gyrA and rpoB genes, respectively. RESULTS: From 1118 clinical isolates, 13.4% (n = 150) showed phenotypic resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin and quinolones and 0.9% (n = 10) to metronidazole, clarithromycin and rifampicin; one isolate exhibited resistance to clarithromycin, quinolones and rifampicin. In eight isolates (0.7%), we detected phenotypic quadruple resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin, quinolones and rifampicin or tetracycline. Triple- and quadruple-resistant strains harboured resistance-associated mutations in their 23S rRNA, 16S rRNA, gyrA or rpoB genes and were nearly exclusively isolated from patients who had already been unsuccessfully treated on multiple occasions. CONCLUSIONS: We show that more than 15% of H. pylori strains isolated from routine samples in the German National Reference Centre are resistant to three or more antimicrobials and identified prior unsuccessful eradication therapies as a key factor for the development of multiresistance. Our data emphasize the need for further comprehensive surveillance studies monitoring the role of treatment regimens in antimicrobial resistance in H. pylori.
