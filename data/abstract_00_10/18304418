Effectiveness and mechanism of action of andrographolide on the recovery of Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility to antibiotics was investigated. In the presence of andrographolide, the Mueller-Hinton broth dilution method measured minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ceftazidine, cefpirome, chloramphenicol, L-ofloxacin, kanamycin, imipenem and meropenem. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine mexB mRNA expressions in P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain and MexAB-OprM overexpressing strain. Relative mexB mRNA expression was detected in both strains incubated for 3 and 9 h. When andrographolide-treated groups were compared with controls, the MIC of ceftazidine, cefpirome, L-ofloxacin and meropenem for both strains decreased, and the relative mexB mRNA expression was significantly lower, although between andrographolide groups there were no significant differences. Compared with the inactivated quorum-sensing system, relative amounts of mexB mRNA in the PAO1 strain and MexAB-OprM overexpressing strain in the activated quorum-sensing system increased 10- and 30-fold, respectively. Andrographolide recovered P. aeruginosa susceptibility to antibiotics and reduced the MexAB-OprM efflux pump expression level.
