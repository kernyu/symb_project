Clindamycin 1%/benzoyl peroxide 5% (BenzaClin) is a combination gel indicated for use twice daily, or as directed by a physician, for the topical treatment of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris. In well designed clinical trials in patients with mild to moderately severe acne, the efficacy of once- or twice-daily clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide in the reduction of inflammatory lesion counts was greater than that of benzoyl peroxide alone, clindamycin alone, or tretinoin plus clindamycin, and not significantly different from that of erythromycin/benzoyl peroxide. In the reduction of noninflammatory lesion counts, the efficacy of once- or twice-daily clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide was greater than that of clindamycin alone, but not significantly different to that observed with benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin plus clindamycin, or erythromycin/benzoyl peroxide. Clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide has a fairly rapid onset of action, with acne improvement usually recorded within 2-4 weeks. Despite widespread use, bacterial resistance is not associated with clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide. The product is generally well tolerated, and the main treatment-related adverse events in clinical trials were application-site dryness, irritation, peeling, and erythema. Thus, clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide is an effective and well tolerated option for the management of mild to moderately severe acne.
