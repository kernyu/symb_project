The synthesis and antiviral evaluation of unsymmetrical indolocarbazole derivatives of Arcyriaflavin A, substituted with a range of alkyl groups at the indole nitrogen, is described. Structure-activity relationships in this series against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication in cell culture are reported. Compound 4b was identified as potent inhibitor of HCMV (IC(50)=19 nM), which retained activity against a range of HCMV strains including ganciclovir resistant isolates.
