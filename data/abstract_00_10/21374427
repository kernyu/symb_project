The ability to share genetic information with other bacteria represents one of the most important adaptive mechanisms available to bacteria pathogenic for humans. The exchange of many different types of genetic information appears to occur frequently and exchange of determinants responsible for antimicrobial resistance is the best studied, since the movements of resistance determinants are easy to follow and the clinical importance of resistance dissemination is so great. The most common vehicles by which bacteria exchange resistance determinants are plasmids and transposons.
