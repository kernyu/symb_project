Eleven Dichanthium annulatum (Forssk) plants were regenerated from embryogenic callus co-transformed with two plasmids encoding either the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph) or the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene (uidA). Analysis of these putative transformants showed that three plants were transformed with the hph gene, showed the presence of the hph transcript and expressed hygromycin resistance after transfer to soil. Two of these also contained the uidA gene but did not express GUS and were shown to be the same transformation event. All three of the transformants set seed. Hygromycin resistance varied from 68-100% in the progeny of the three transformants. Transgene transmission appeared to have been mainly through apomixis.
