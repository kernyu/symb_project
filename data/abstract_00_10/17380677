OBJECTIVE: To develop an oligonucleotide microarray-based method for the simultaneous detection of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection, virulence-associated genotypes, and drug resistance. METHODS: Hp was classified into cagA + and cagA- genotypes based on its virulence. Clarithromycin-resistance of Hp was identified by existence of point mutations in 23S rRNA. We constructed an oligonucleotide microarray chip to simultaneously diagnose Hp infection and detect its virulence-associated genotypes and mutations associated with clarithromycin-resistance. The diagnostic accuracy of the constructed microarray was tested with templates of wild type and mutated type. RESULTS: The oligonucleotide chip accurately detected cagA + and cagA- genotypes of Hp, as well as four common point mutations in 23S rRNA related to clarithromycin-resistance. CONCLUSION: Oligonucleotide microarray chip can be used to diagnose Hp infection and test its virulence-associated genotypes and drug resistance simultaneously.
