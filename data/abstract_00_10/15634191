Previously, we have reported that overexpression of IHPK2 (inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2) sensitized NIH-OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma cell lines to the growth-suppressive and apoptotic effects of IFN-beta (interferon-beta) treatment and gamma-irradiation. In the present study, we demonstrate that Apo2L/TRAIL (Apo2L/tumour-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a critical mediator of IFN-induced apoptosis in these cells. Compared with IFN-alpha2, IFN-beta is a more potent inducer of Apo2L/TRAIL and IHPK2 activity. Overexpression of IHPK2 converts IFN-alpha2-resistant cells into cells that readily undergo apoptosis in response to IFN-alpha2. In untreated cells transfected with IHPK2-eGFP (where eGFP stands for enhanced green fluorescent protein), the fusion protein is localized to the cytoplasm and perinuclear region. After treatment with IFN-beta, IHPK2-eGFP translocated to the nucleus. In cells transfected with mutant IHPK2-NLS-eGFP (where NLS stands for nuclear localization sequence), containing point mutations in the NLS, the fusion protein remained trapped in the cytoplasm, even after IFN-beta treatment. Cells expressing mutant NLS mutation were more resistant to IFN-beta. The IC50 value of IHPK2-expressing cells was 2-3-fold lower than vector control. The IC50 value of NLS-mutant-expressing cells was 3-fold higher than vector control. Blocking antibodies to Apo2L/TRAIL or transfection with a dominant negative Apo2L/TRAIL receptor (DR5Delta) inhibited the antiproliferative effects of IFN-beta. Thus overexpression of IHPK2 enhanced apoptotic effects of IFN-beta, and expression of the NLS mutant conferred resistance to IFN-beta. Apo2L/TRAIL expression and nuclear localization of IHPK2 are both required for the induction of apoptosis by IFN-beta in ovarian carcinoma.
