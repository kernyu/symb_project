We carried out a community-based survey in order to emphasize the importance of therapeutic appropriateness of antibiotic prescription by local physicians and the close connection between pharmacotherapy and pharmacoeconomics. Twenty general practitioners belonging to the local sanitary firm of Paola (CS, Italy) provided information, including their prescription, regarding 64 patients, both male and female, presenting clinical symptoms of uncomplicated acute cystitis. The data collected were compared with those of a previous trial performed in the same setting and documenting the effectiveness and advantages associated with the use of amoxicillin against community-acquired uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI). By comparing the prescriptive behaviour of physicians between the first and the present survey, we detected a significant increase in the use of amoxicillin (from 0 to 26.56%), paralleled by a decrease in prescribing aminoglycosides (from 18.18 to 1.56%). In addition, this resulted in a significant reduction in the costs of treatment (from 23.06 to 12.75 euros). Therefore, given the vast consensus concerning the adoption of empirical treatment for the eradication of UTI, the present survey underlines the crucial role of local antibiotic resistance monitoring in order to optimize the use of these drugs. Moreover, we have also observed a significant reduction in treatment costs associated with an appropriate and effective treatment of UTI.
