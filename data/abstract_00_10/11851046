Soft tissue infections are common. The clinical spectrum includes infections of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and of deeper structures such as fascia and muscles. The pathogenesis of these infections is quite variable. Introduction of microorganisms through skin breaks or through trauma of other soft tissue is usually at the origin of such infections. Staphylococci, especially S. aureus, as well as streptococci, mainly group A streptococci cause most soft tissue infections. In immunocompromised patients or in particuluar circumstances gram-negative bacteria may also be found to cause such infections. Occasionally, infections are polymicrobial. Given the predominance of gram-positive cocci, betalactam antibiotics with good antistaphylococcal activity are the drugs of choice for empiric treatment. Penicillins or cephalosporins that are stable against penicillinase should be chosen, since many staphylococci produce penicillinase. Over the course of the last 40 years staphylococci first became resistant against penicillin, and later developed resistance against methicillin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is now a significant problem worldwide. There continue to be major differences in the prevalence of MRSA between geographic regions. In areas with a high prevalence of methicillin resistance among S. aureus, empiric treatment of life-threatening soft tissue infections should include treatment with a glycopeptide (i.e. vancomycin or teicoplanin). New antibiotics such as oxazolidinones (i.e. linezolid) or quinupristin/dalfopristin are interesting alternatives to the glycopeptides in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
