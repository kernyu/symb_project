Androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer is often effective, but not curative. Molecular pathways mediating the therapeutic response and those contributing to the subsequent hormone-refractory cell growth remain poorly understood. Here, cDNA microarray analysis of human CWR22 prostate cancer xenografts during the course of androgen deprivation therapy revealed distinct global gene expression profiles in primary, regressing and recurrent tumors. Elucidation of the genes involved in the transition between these states implicated specific molecular mechanisms in therapy failure and tumor progression. First, we identified a set of androgen-responsive genes whose expression decreased during the therapy response, but was then systematically restored in the recurrent tumors. In addition, altered expression of genes that encode known targets of rapamycin or that converge on the PI3K/AKT/FRAP pathway was observed in the recurrent tumors. Further suggestion for the involvement of these genes in hormone-refractory prostate cancer came from the observation that cells established from the recurrent xenografts were strongly inhibited in vitro by rapamycin. The results of this functional genomic analysis suggest that the combined effect of re-expression of androgen-responsive genes as well as the activation of rapamycin-sensitive signaling may drive prostate cancer progression, and contribute to the failure of androgen-deprivation therapy.
