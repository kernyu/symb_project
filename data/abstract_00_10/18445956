A total of 23 clinical isolates (15 Escherichia coli and 8 Klebsiella pneumoniae), resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime recovered during 2002 and 2003, were investigated for production of CTX-M extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) by phenotypic and molecular methods. The presence of ESBL was tested by NCCLS phenotypic confirmatory test using cephalosporin/clavulanate combination discs and E-test ESBL strips. Determination of MIC of cefotaxime and ceftazidime was done with and without the presence of clavulanic acid by agar dilution technique. Polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of CTX-M type ESBLs in 19 isolates. Further sequencing resulted in identification of CTX-M-15 ESBLs. This is the first report identifying CTX-M type ESBL from clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae from a tertiary care hospital in south India.
