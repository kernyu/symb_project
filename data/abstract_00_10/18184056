Little information is available on antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from animals and animal products in Iceland. The objective of this study was to analyze serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella spp. isolated from healthy chickens and pigs in Iceland during 2001-2005. A total of 163 Salmonella strains, isolated in the national Salmonella surveillance program, were available for study. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a microbroth dilution method (VetMIC) and resistant strains were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and phage typing. The most commonly isolated serotypes were Salmonella Infantis (61%) and S. Typhimurium (33%); other serotypes were less prevalent. The overall prevalence of resistance was 13.6% in chickens and 12.8% in pigs. Twenty one isolates (12.8%) were resistant to one or more antimicrobials, 19 S. Typhimurium strains, one S. Infantis strain, and one S. Worthington strain. Sixteen out of the 19 resistant S. Typhimurium strains were multiresistant (to > or =3 antimicrobial agents), and, of these, 15 had identical or closely related PFGE patterns (previously phage typed as DT104). The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella spp. in pigs and poultry in Iceland is low; however, we found a multiresistant S. Typhimurium clone that causes concern. Continuous resistance surveillance is important, and further research on the source of resistant clones and possible transmission to humans is needed.
