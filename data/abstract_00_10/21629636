Bacterial and fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among neutropenic patients. The choice of empiric antimicrobial regimen is based on susceptibility pattern of locally prevalent pathogens. From 64 febrile neutropenic patients with clinical sepsis, blood and other appropriate clinical specimens were processed to determine bacterial and fungal spectrum and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Risk factors for developing sepsis were determined by case-control study. 68 organisms were recovered. Fifteen (22.05%) were Gram-positive cocci with predominance of methicillin Sensitive S. aureus (10.29%), 47 (69.11%) were Gram-negative rods with predominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae (30.88%) and four were Non albicans Candida. 81% and 60% of Klebsiella and E. coli were ESBL producers. All species of Candida were sensitive to amphoterecin B and voriconazole. Duration and extent of neutropenia, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, altered mucosal barriers and presence of central venous lines were statistically significant risk factors for developing sepsis. Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant isolates. The choice of therapy in neutropenic patients should be formulated based on local spectrum of microbes and local and regional resistance patterns.
