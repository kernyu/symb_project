The presented paper discusses the experience with exogenous nitric oxide (NO) and argon plasma coagulation (APC) used at cavernotomy in 31 patients with multidrug-resistant fibrocavernous pulmonary tuberculosis. Supplementary treatments depending in infectious risk factors were comprehensively evaluated. The application of APC and NO significantly improved the results of open cavern sanitation, as evidenced by the bacterial excretion index, and doubled the immediate efficiency of surgical treatment.
