The chance of incidence of XDR TB is on the rise due to improper use of second line anti-tubercular drugs. XDR-TB is very difficult to treat successfully and is often referred to as "virtually untreatable form of TB". We herein report a case of XDR TB confirmed by bacteriological examination in a WHO recognised laboratory who after 12 months of regular treatment improved both clinically and radiologically with sputum smear conversion. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous report of any similar case in literature.
