Here we report that deletion of SOD1, the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is sensitive to cell wall-perturbing agents, such as Calcofluor white and Congo red. The sensitivity was restored by retransformation with wild type SOD1 or the addition of N-acetylcysteine or reduced glutathione to the medium. Additionally, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species was observed in sod1Delta mutant in the presence of Calcofluor white or Congo red. Cell wall analysis indicated an increase of cell wall chitin and cell wall thickness in sod1Delta mutant compared to wild type. These results indicate a novel direct connection between antioxidative functions and cell wall homeostasis.
