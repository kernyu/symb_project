PURPOSE: Bacteriological examinations at hospitalization were monitored to identify carriers of pathogenic bacteria and prevent the outbreak of nosocomial and postoperative infections. METHODS: In 557 patients, bacteriological examinations were performed within 48 hours after hospitalization. All people were instructed to wash their hands before and after treating carriers of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). The disposal of stool and urine of carriers was segregated instead of administration of sensitive antibiotics. RESULTS: The 1176 samples comprised 557 throat swabs, 532 stool samples, and 87 other samples. At hospitalization, 9.2% of the patients were carriers of MRSA; 22.3% of the patients were carriers of MRSA, MRSE, PA, and/or other pathogenic bacteria. This percentage increased to 29.3% in 352 patients with a history of hospitalization, and 35.2% in 244 patients who were hospitalized within 1 year after previous hospitalization. Nosocomial and postoperative infections did not occur during the study period. CONCLUSION: Many patients were detected as carriers of pathogenic bacteria at hospitalization. A history of hospitalization was found to be a risk factor for carrying pathogenic bacteria; hospitalization within 1 year after previous hospitalization was a high-risk factor.
