Incomplete killing was observed for caspofungin against Candida glabrata, which was associated with increased SLT2 expression and elevated chitin content. In contrast, fungicidal activity and no chitin increase were observed in an isogenic Delta slt2 strain, suggesting a role for SLT2 and chitin production in the response of C. glabrata to caspofungin.
