Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important pathogen, both in-hospital and in the community. Although there are several guidelines with recommendations for the control of this microorganism, the measures proposed are not uniformly implemented in Spanish hospitals. The objective of this document is to provide evidence-based recommendations that are applicable to Spanish hospitals, with the aim of reducing transmission of MRSA in our health care centers. The recommendations are divided into the following groups: surveillance, active detection of colonization in patients and health care workers, control measures for colonized or infected patients, decolonization therapy, environmental cleaning and disinfection, antimicrobial consumption, measures for non-hospitalized patients, and others. The main measures recommended include appropriate surveillance, hand hygiene, and implementation of active surveillance, contact precautions, and environmental cleaning.
