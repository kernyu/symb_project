The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of eight antimicrobial agents was determined by the agar dilution method for 80 isolates of Clostridium difficile from neonatal pigs with enteritis. MICs(50) for erythromycin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were relatively low (0.25-0.50 microg/mL), but MICs(90) (64 or > or =256 microg/mL) suggest in vivo resistance of a proportion of isolates. Susceptibility to tetracycline varied widely, with MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 8 and 32 microg/mL, respectively. The MICs(90) for tiamulin (8 microg/mL) and virginiamycin (16 microg/mL) suggest moderate susceptibility. Bacitracin and ceftiofur (MICs(90) > or =256 microg/mL) have little activity against C. difficile. Tiamulin and virginiamycin may decrease fecal shedding of C. difficile by sows, and erythromycin, tetracycline, and tylosin may be useful for treatment of infected piglets.
