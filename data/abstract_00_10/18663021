Screening of the PA14 genomic transposon mutant library for resistance to ceftazidime, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin led to the discovery of several mutants that appeared in more than one screen. Testing of the frequency of mutation to ciprofloxacin resistance revealed previously known mutator genes, including mutS and mutL, as well as mutators that have not yet been described for P. aeruginosa, including PA3958 and RadA (PA4609).
