Seventeen multiple-antibiotic-resistant nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strains of human, animal, and food origins showed a wide variety of antibiotic resistance genes, many of them carried by class 1 and class 2 integrons. Amino acid changes in MarR and mutations in marO were identified for 15 and 14 E. coli strains, respectively.
