There are reports of increased antibiotic resistance rates in Helicobacter pylori strains around the world. The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility patterns in H. pylori strains isolated in Monterrey, Mexico. We studied 62 strains isolated from the same number of symptomatic adult patients. Metronidazole (Mtz), clarithromycin (Cla), amoxicillin (Amx) and tetracycline (Tet) were tested by the E-test method. We observed that 37.1% of the strains were resistant to Mtz (MIC > or = 8 mg/L), and 8.1% to Cla (MIC > or = 8 mg/L), but we did not observe resistance to Amx (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) or Tet (MIC > or = 4 mg/L). In northeastern Mexico, the percentage of resistant strains was similar to that observed in developed countries. These results confirm that it is necessary to evaluate the susceptibility patterns of H. pylori strains by geographic area.
