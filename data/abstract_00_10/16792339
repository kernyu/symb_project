Clinically significant pulmonary disease caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) usually occurs upon pre-existing lung diseases or immune-deficiency. In 1992, a particular presentation of pulmonary MAC, occuring in otherwise healthy middle-aged women, was described with pulmonary consolidations localized in lingula and middle lobe. For this specific, rare condition, the term Lady Windermere syndrome was introduced. We report a particular case of this syndrome, in which an otherwise healthy individual developed clinically significant disease upon MAC (subtype: Mycobacterium avium) infection of the right middle lobe and lingula of the lung. The patient did not have the classical risk factors for developing this syndrome (e.g. habitual cough suppression, long and narrow bronchi) indicating their modest contribution in the pathogenesis. In our case, guideline based therapy was found to be inadequate because of multi-drug resistance, so an alternative treatment regime was given with good clinical result.
