Of 233 erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates collected in Belgium in 1999-2000, 89.7% carried the erm(B) gene, 6% the mef(A) gene, and 3.5%erm(B) plus mef(A). Two isolates contained neither erm(B) nor mef(A); one contained an erm(A) subclass erm(TR) gene, while the other contained an A2058G mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Of 209 erm(B)-positive isolates, 191 had clindamycin MICs > 16 mg/L and 18 had MICs < or = 16 mg/L. Mef(A)-positive isolates all displayed the M resistance phenotype. Telithromycin remained active against erythromycin-resistant isolates, with the highest telithromycin MIC50 being found in mef(A)-positive isolates. No difference in the prevalence of different resistance mechanisms was observed compared to isolates collected in 1995-1997.
