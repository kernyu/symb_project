This study was conducted to compare the caries preventive efficacy of Fluoritop - SR; the first fluoride varnish manufactured in India with Fluor Protector and Bifluorid 12, the two commercially available fluoride varnishes which have to be imported from other countries and are cost prohibitive. The demineralization inhibitory effects and the antibacterial effects on Streptococcus mutans were studied (in vitro). Calcium and Phosphorus dissolutions were estimated as a measure of the demineralization inhibitory effect. Antibiotic sensitivity tests using the serial tube dilution method and disk diffusion method were used to evaluate the antibacterial effects of the fluoride varnishes. Of the three varnishes, Fluor Protector was seen to exhibit the highest demineralization inhibitory effect, while Fluoritop-SR was found to be comparable to Bifluorid 12 in its caries protective effects.
