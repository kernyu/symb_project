Drug acquisition cost is an important component in the analysis of economic and clinical outcomes in the treatment of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). However, bacterial resistance has emerged as a crucial variable that must also be considered. Drug-resistant infections result in more expensive drug therapy, longer hospital stays, and increased mortality. The high prevalence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as well as the continuing growth in resistant pathogens, make RTIs an appropriate model for studying methods of cost-containment without sacrificing clinical outcome. The University of Kentucky Medical Center has developed a uniform CAP treatment pathway to minimize costs and maximize outcomes. First-line therapy in this model is doxycycline monotherapy, high-dose amoxicillin plus azithromycin, or levofloxacin monotherapy. One major future concern in selecting antibacterial agents for CAP is the spread of macrolide- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
