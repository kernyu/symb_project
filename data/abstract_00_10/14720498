Motile Enterococci are rare causes of enterococcal bacteremia, usually in immunocompromised patients. We describe a case of polymicrobial bacteremia, including Enterococcus casseliflavus, Escherichia coli, and Morganella morganii, in an 80-year old woman, shortly after a liver biopsy performed to exclude cholangiocarcinoma. We further discuss the unique genetic characteristics and the clinical significance of such isolates, such as their intrinsic resistance to vancomycin, and the low virulence exhibited clinically. Further workup on the mechanisms of motile Enterococci resistance to vancomycin could probably yield useful information in achieving new ways of facing resistance attributed to the more usual, and malignant Enterococci.
