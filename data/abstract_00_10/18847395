Tigecycline is a glycylcycline antibacterial agent derived from minocycline with a broad spectrum of activity. Like tetracycline agents, it inhibits bacterial protein synthesis but is able to bind to target sites with higher affinity and overcome tetracycline-resistance mechanisms due to structural modifications. The safety and efficacy of tigecycline has been demonstrated in clinical trials for complicated intra-abdominal and complicated skin and skin-structure infections. It has received approval for these indications in several countries, including the USA in 2005, and European Union in 2006. Aside from approved indications and in vitro data, growing clinical experience suggests a potential role for tigecycline in the management of multi-drug resistant infections due to drug-resistant pathogens. Further study is necessary to determine the ultimate role of tigecycline in treating these types of infections.
