Typhoid fever is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients especially in developing country. Therapy with conventional drugs is associated with increasing resistance, non-compliance to therapy and toxicity. Oral fluoroquinolones have been shown to be effective compared to parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins in the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid. However, there is no data available regarding the use of levofloxacin in the treatment of typhoid fever in spite of the susceptibility of Salmonella species to levofloxacin. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral levofloxacin 750 mg once daily in the treatment of typhoid fever. Results indicated that levofloxacin 750 mg administered orally once daily was an effective, safe, well-tolerated and cost-effective option in the treatment of typhoid fever in adult Indian males and non-pregnant females.
