A rare case of Prototheca wickerhamii meningitis is reported in a patient without any underlying immunodeficient condition. Wet-mount microscopy and culture of cerebral spinal fluid specimens, along with temperature resistance, cycloheximide tolerance, carbohydrates assimilation, including API 20C AUX tests of the isolated etiologic agent were performed. In addition, transmission and scanning electron microscopy studies and in vitro antifungal susceptibility tests were conducted. Through the combination of these investigations, the isolate was identified as P. wickerhamii and the patient was successfully treated with intravenous amphotericin B and itraconazole. This is the first detailed report of meningitis caused by P. wickerhamii in China.
