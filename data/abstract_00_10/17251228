Alveolar epithelial cell injury and recovery are important in the pathogenesis of oxidant-induced lung damage. The alveolar cell line A549 was used to study responses of proliferating and quiescent cells in culture to time- and dose-dependent hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) challenges. Recovery was monitored after 24 h of incubation in fresh medium with 10% serum. The adherent cells were counted and the resistance and recovery of the attached cells was assessed by appearance, by measuring the number of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells using fluorescent-activated cell sorting, and by determining the intracellular free thiol content. A549 cells recovered from a 1-h challenge with up to 1 mM H(2)O(2) but could not sustain a more prolonged challenge (6 or 24 h) with 0.5 mM or 1.0 mM H(2)O(2). These more severe conditions resulted in: loss of cells by detachment from the plate surface; reduced numbers of viable cells primarily due to necrosis; and a strong reduction of the intracellular free thiol content. Quiescent cells proved to be more sensitive to oxidative stress than proliferating cells. Intracellular free thiol levels apparently play a decisive role in cell survival, preferentially protecting proliferating cells.
