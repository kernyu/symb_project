Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha is implicated in the relationship between obesity and insulin resistance/ type 2 diabetes. In an effort to understand this association better we (i) profiled gene expression patterns of TNF, TNFR1 and TNFR2 and (ii) investigated the effects of TNF on glucose uptake in isolated adipocytes and adipose tissue explants from omental and subcutaneous depots from lean, overweight and obese individuals. TNF expression correlated with expression of TNFR2, but not TNFR1, and TNF and TNFR2 expression increased in obesity. TNFR1 expression was higher in omental than in subcutaneous adipocytes. Expression levels of TNF or either receptor did not differ between adipocytes from individuals with central and peripheral obesity. TNF only suppressed glucose uptake in insulin-stimulated subcutaneous tissue and this suppression was only observed in tissue from lean subjects. These data support a relationship between the TNF system and body mass index (BMI), but not fat distribution, and suggest depot specificity of the TNF effect on glucose uptake. Furthermore, adipose tissue from obese subjects already appears insulin 'resistant' and this may be a result of the increased TNF levels.
