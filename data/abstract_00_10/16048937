Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteases are considered important virulence factors which damage host tissues and interfere with host antibacterial defense mechanisms. P. aeruginosa biofilm cells are not completely killed by antibacterials, and therefore this study addresses the question whether ciprofloxacin attenuates the virulence of biofilm communities by abolishing their secretion of proteases. The surviving cells of the colony biofilms studied, despite their cyclical exposure to four doses of ciprofloxacin at bactericidal concentrations (one dose a day), still secreted active proteases to the environment surrounding the biofilms. The biofilm cells secreted elastase B (LasB) over the duration of the experiments as confirmed by Western immunoblot analysis. The colony biofilms did not secrete LasA-a protease with staphylolytic activity. The same profiles on zymogram gels with gelatin were observed for the proteases secreted by both ciprofloxacin-exposed and unexposed (control) biofilms. Total proteolytic activities of the colony biofilms studied were significantly reduced after exposure to ciprofloxacin at bactericidal concentrations-after 96 h of exposure they dropped to 38% for the strain intermediate resistant to ciprofloxacin and to 65% for the strain highly resistant to the antibiotic, relative to the control biofilms. The surviving cells of the colony biofilms after their release into a fresh medium displayed transient increased resistance to ciprofloxacin compared to their planktonic counterparts.
