The changes in susceptibilities of Bacteroides fragilis group strains isolated in our hospital from 1997 to 2006 were studied. A total of 1,343 clinical strains were included. The study showed differences in the resistance rates in the different species of the group. Increasing resistance to clindamycin and moxifloxacin was observed. Susceptibility to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole remained unchanged.
