A series of N1-arylidene-N2-quinolyl- and N2-acrydinylhydrazones were synthesized and tested for their antimalarial properties. These compounds showed remarkable anti-plasmodial activity in vitro especially against chloroquine-resistant strains. Their potent biological activity makes them promising lead structures for the development of new antimalarial drugs.
