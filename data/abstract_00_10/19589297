Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an effective strategy for preventing disease progression of HIV infection, particularly when patients adhere closely to the treatment regimen. However, ART medications can cause side effects, including metabolic complications that can impact patients' adherence levels. Selected chronic complications associated with ART include lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and bone disorders such as osteopenia/osteoporosis. In this article, we review the effects of these metabolic complications on ART adherence and approaches to prevent or reverse them.
