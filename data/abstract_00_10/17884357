In response to a review titled 'Withdrawal of growth-promoting antibiotics in Europe and its effects in relation to human health', published in this Journal by Ian Phillips, we hereby comment on the review. Phillips makes use of data from the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and Research Programme (DANMAP) reports and studies on Campylobacter and enterococci. Unfortunately, we find these data frequently misinterpreted by Phillips, leading to false conclusions such as inferences that the ban of antibiotic growth promoters should cause an increased prevalence of resistant enterococci and Campylobacter.
