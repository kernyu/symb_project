We describe an activity-independent method for the selection of thermostable mutants of any protein. It is based on a fusion construct comprising the protein of interest and a thermostable antibiotic resistance reporter, in such a way that thermostable mutants provide increased resistance in a thermophile. We isolated thermostable mutants of three human interferons and of two enzymes to demonstrate the applicability of the system.
