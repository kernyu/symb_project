Continued emergence of antimicrobial resistances among gram-positive pathogens requires further development of compounds with novel modes of action. The peptide deformylase inhibitor NVP PDF-713 was tested against 1,837 recent strains of Gram-positive organisms. All NVP PDF-713 MICs were at < or = 4microg/mL except for 6 enterococci (0.3% of strains overall). NVP PDF-713 MIC(90) results were: Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci and Streptococcus bovis at 1 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria spp. at 2 microg/mL; and the enterococci at 4 microg/mL. NVP PDF-713 appears to be a promising new agent worthy of continued in vivo development.
