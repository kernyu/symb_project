The mycobactericidal and tuberculocidal activities of Korsolex AF against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-Mycobacterium intracellulare (MAI), Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium chelonae were determined using quantitative suspension and carrier tests. The effects of organic load and hard water were also considered. A clinical isolate of MAI was the most resistant of the four test organisms. A 2% solution had good mycobactericidal and tuberculocidal activities after 30 min of exposure. Although further evaluation using European standard tests is necessary, we conclude that Korsolex AF appears to be a promising product for the disinfection of hospital instruments contaminated with mycobacteria.
