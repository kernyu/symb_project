OBJECTIVE: To analyze the mechanisms of macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae from children in Beijing. METHODS: The MICs of penicillin and erythromycin were determined by the E-test methods for 200 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected from 2002 to 2003 at Beijing Children's Hospital. MICs of azithrhomycin, clarithromycin, acetylspiramycin and clindamycin for 147 erythromycin-resistant isolates were detected by the agar dilution methods. For phenotyping, macrolide resistance induction tests were used in erythromycin-resistant isolates. PCR was used to determine the presence of the erythromycin-resistant genes. RESULTS: Of 200 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 89.5% were resistant to erythromycin. In 147 erythromycin-resistant isolates, resistance rates were as follows: azithromycin, 100%; clarithromycin, 100%; acetylspiramycin, 95.2%; and clindamycin, 95.9%. The most common macrolide resistance phenotype was the cMIS phenotype (95.9%), 1.4% had the iMLS phenotype and 2.7% the M phenotype. Erythromycin-resistant isolates were characterized for the underlying resistance genotype, with 79.6% having the ermB genotypes, 17.7% having both ermB and mefA, 2.7% having the mefA, and none having neither ermB nor mefA genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of carriage of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae by children were high in Beijing during 2002 - 2003. cMLS was the most prevalent phenotype among erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, and ribosomal modification (ermB gene coded) was the main resistance mechanism against macrolides in Beijing region.
