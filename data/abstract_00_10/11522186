New antiretroviral drugs with activity against strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with non-B subtypes and with resistance to current antiretroviral drugs are needed. The activity of two nucleotide analogs, tenofovir and adefovir (PMPA and PMEA, respectively), against non-B subtypes and nucleoside-resistant primary HIV-1 isolates was assessed. Tenofovir and adefovir were fully active against a panel of subtypes A, C, D, E, F, G, and group O primary HIV-1 isolates as compared with their respective activity against subtype B isolates. Moreover, the susceptibility of a panel of 10 primary HIV-1 isolates with >10-fold mean resistance to zidovudine, lamivudine, and abacavir was within 2.2-fold of wild-type tenofovir susceptibility for each isolate. An oral prodrug of tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF), is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. These in vitro susceptibility results suggest that tenofovir DF may be active in vivo against HIV-1 with nucleoside resistance as well as against HIV-1 with non-B subtypes.
