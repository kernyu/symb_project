Using liposome systems, we found that gallates with short alkyl chains were located in the external medium and those with longer alkyl chains were located in the surface region of lipid bilayer. Combinations of these gallates remarkably reduced oxacillin MICs against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to below the antibiotic breakpoint (< or = 2 microg/ml).
