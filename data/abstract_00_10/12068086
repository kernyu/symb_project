Two clonal nerve-like cell lines derived from HT22 and PC12 have been selected for resistance to glutamate toxicity and amyloid toxicity, respectively. In the following experiments it was asked if these cell lines show cross-resistance toward amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and glutamate as well as toward a variety of additional neurotoxins. Conversely, it was determined if inhibitors of oxytosis, a well-defined oxidative stress pathway, also protect cells from the neurotoxins. It is shown that both glutamate and amyloid resistant cells are cross resistant to most of the other toxins or toxic conditions, while inhibitors of oxytosis protect from glutathione and cystine depletion and H2O2 toxicity, but not from the toxic effects of nitric oxide, rotenone, arsenite or cisplatin. It is concluded that while there is a great deal of cross-resistance to neurotoxins, the components of the cell death pathway which has been defined for oxytosis are not used by many of the neurotoxins.
