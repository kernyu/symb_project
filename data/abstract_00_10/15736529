Visceral leishmaniases (VL), with spreading epidemics in India and Sudan, and sporadic cases in mediterranean basin, show clinical, therapeutical and public health aspects varying according to the geographic context. Co-infection of VL with the human immunodeficiency virus emerged in southwestern Europe and could occur in a next future in India, in Sudan, in Ethiopia or in Brazil. Today, lipid formulations of amphotericin B should be the first line drugs in Mediterranean basin. Elsewhere, pentavalent antimonials remain the cornerstone of treatment in non resistant areas, conventional amphotericin B or miltefosine being an alternative in areas of resistance to antimony.
