The susceptibility testing of disinfectants against Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains from broilers and pigs was investigated. The filtration method European standard EN 1040 was adapted to Campylobacter cultures and validated with reference strains. Two disinfectants were tested: 1% benzalkonium chloride active matter, as quaternary ammonium compound, and 0.63% sodium hypochlorite as chlorine-releasing agent. Both disinfectants were effective against the 34 Campylobacter strains tested after 5 min exposure under in vitro conditions. No link between resistance to disinfectants and antibiotics could be observed.
