PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify and evaluate molecular targets for the development of a novel combination chemotherapy to treat refractory and recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Lymphoma samples from 38 cases of primary and recurrent DLBCL were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR of the RPS6KB1 and CDC2 genes, and immunohistochemistry for their gene products p70S6K/p85S6K and cdc2/cdk1. The Farage, Karpas422, Pfeiffer, and Toledo DLBCL cell lines were subsequently treated with rapamycin and UCN-01 alone or in combination. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were analyzed after the drug treatment. In addition, the levels of several key protein kinases involved in the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were analyzed in the presence and absence of the drugs. RESULTS: Amplification of the RPS6KB1 and CDC2 genes was found in both primary and recurrent DLBCL. Moreover, the vast majority of these lymphomas (approximately 94%) were strongly positive for phospho-p70S6K and cdc2/cdk1 proteins. The combination of rapamycin and UCN-01 synergistically inhibited the DLBCL cell proliferation by inducing G1 arrest as well as apoptosis by suppressing the phosphorylation of p70S6K/p85S6K and CDC2 expression. CONCLUSION: RPS6KB1 and CDC2 overexpression is common in DLBCL. Simultaneously targeting the RPS6KB1 and CDC2 products phospho-p70S6K/p85S6K and cdc2/cdk1 is very effective in inhibiting DLBCL proliferation and overcoming drug resistance. This work suggests that multilevel inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and double-block of cell cycle progression are effective strategies for DLBCL therapy.
