Telithromycin-nonsusceptible pneumococcal clinical isolates (n = 17) were analyzed for their antimicrobial susceptibility, macrolide resistance mechanisms, and genetic relatedness. All strains showed the erm(B) genotype and showed a wide range of combinations of macrolide resistance mechanisms. The predominant clone (n = 7) was serotype 14, sequence type 143.
