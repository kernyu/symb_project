Haemonchosis, with its very wide distribution, has become a very important production constraint in sheep farms in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions worldwide. Various intrinsic and extrinsic factors determine the survival of Haemonchus contortus and hence the development of the disease in the animal. In general, control of gastrointestinal nematode infestation in sheep relies heavily on anthelmintic treatments. However, the indiscriminate use of these drugs has led to the widespread emergence of drug resistant strains of parasites, that has necessitated the development and use of various parasite control methods such as grazing management, biological agents and vaccines and the selection of resistant breeds of animals, with or without moderate use of anthelmintics. The ultimate goal of such control programs is to enhance productivity, while minimising risks regarding drug resistance and consumer and environmental concerns. This review attempts to highlight the different methods employed in the control of haemonchosis in sheep and the practical limitations associated with both control programs and the internal and external factors associated with the parasite and its microenvironment.
