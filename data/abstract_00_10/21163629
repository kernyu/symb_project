In this study, demethylfruticuline A (dfA) and fruticuline A (fA), two quinones representing the major diterpenoid components of the exudate produced by the aerial parts of Salvia corrugata, were assessed for their ability to modify surface characteristics, such as hydrophobicity, and to inhibit synthesis of biofilm in vitro by multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. Five strains of S. aureus (three meticillin-resistant and two meticillin-susceptible), five strains of S. epidermidis (four meticillin-resistant and one meticillin-susceptible) and eight vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, all recently isolated from clinical specimens and capable of slime production, were studied. fA decrease by at least two-fold the hydrophobic properties of the S. aureus cell membrane but did not affect S. epidermidis or E. faecalis. Biofilm formation on polystyrene plates was quantified spectrophotometrically by established methodologies. Inhibition of biofilm formation was also confirmed by the Congo red agar plate assay. dfA and fA were more effective against S. aureus strains (>70% effect at subinhibitory concentrations) than against S. epidermidis in inhibiting slime synthesis. Against E. faecalis, dfA at subinhibitory concentration induced an inhibition of biofilm production of ca. 60%; fA was less active and more strain-dependent. Moreover, the two compounds were shown to possess chelating activity on divalent and trivalent metal cations. Interactions of fA and dfA with bacteria could be very complex, possibly being species-specific, and could depend not only on inhibition of exopolysaccharide synthesis but also on their chelating activity and on changes in the microorganism's surface, including cell hydrophobicity.
