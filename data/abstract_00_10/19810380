Gram-negative bacteria are responsible in an important way in hospital-associated infections and their reported resistance to multiple antimicrobials is a matter of grave concern. In this study, Gram-negative bacteria isolated from clinical samples of postoperative infected patients were identified and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns determined. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria was 9.45% and the highest prevalence was seen in GI surgery department. Escherichia coli and klebsiella were the most common bacterial isolates. Amongst the 14 antibiotics tested, the percentage sensitivity against the multidrug-resistant Gram-negative isolates was highest for amikacin, meropenem, piperacillin + tazobactam and cefoperazone + sulbactam.
