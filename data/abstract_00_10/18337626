The malignant helper T cells of mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, are capable of transforming into large cerebriform cells. Large cell transformation usually renders the disease more resistant to treatment and prone to relapse. Currently investigated treatment modalities for transformed mycosis fungoides are few and include phototherapy, chemotherapy, biologic response modification, targeted molecular therapy and combinations thereof. A tolerable and reliable modality has yet to be identified. Gemcitabine, a novel purine analogue, is gaining recognition as a potent agent for advanced nontransformed cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Here we present a brief review of the literature with 3 illustrative cases that additionally reveal gemcitabine monotherapy to be a practical, safe and efficacious option for mycosis fungoides that has undergone large cell transformation.
