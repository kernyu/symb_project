Pharmacogenomics, the study of the influence of genetic factors on drug action, is increasingly important for predicting pharmacokinetics profiles and/or adverse reactions to drugs. Drug transporters, as well as drug metabolism play pivotal roles in determining the pharmacokinetic profiles of drugs and their overall pharmacological effects. There is an increasing number of reports addressing genetic polymorphisms of drug transporters. However, information regarding the functional impact of genetic polymorphisms in drug transporter genes is still limited. Detailed functional analysis in vitro may provide clear insight into the biochemical and therapeutic significance of genetic polymorphisms. This review addresses functional aspects of the genetic polymorphisms of human ATP-binding cassette transporters, ABCB1 and ABCG2, which are critically involved in the pharmacokinetics of drugs.
