BACKGROUND: We report on two endemic outbreaks of VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci, vanA type Enterococcus faecium) on a hematological oncology ward in a university hospital and a new strategic concept to fight against spread of VRE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During management of the outbreak, a total of 1,124 patients and 1,700 specimens were investigated from June 1999 to December 2001. Protective measures were instituted. Intensive prophylactic infection control was practiced until December 2003. RESULTS: Of the 1,124 patients, 44 were VRE-positive. From 1,700 environment specimens, 110 VRE isolates were obtained from the inanimate environment, 5 from the living environment. Molecular biological typing identified 5 different clones which had spread on the ward in different locations. CONCLUSION: The study shows the need for prophylactic microbiological screening investigations in the risk group of hematological oncology patients and consistent implementation of protective hygiene measures to prevent the spread of multiresistant infectious pathogens on risk wards. It is also shown that intervention can to control such an endemic outbreak.
