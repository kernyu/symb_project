Nineteen new sesterterpenoids and eight known compounds were isolated from the sponge Sarcotragus sp. collected from Soheuksan Island, Korea. The structures of these compounds were determined to be linear sesterterpenoids containing furan or related oxygenated functionalities on the basis of combined chemical and spectroscopic analyses. In addition, the configurations of several previously undetermined compounds were assigned. Several compounds exhibited moderate to major antibacterial activity (compounds 1- 3, 17, 18) and cytotoxicity ( 3, 11, 12) against the K562 cell line and inhibitory activity against isocitrate lyase ( 6, 13).
