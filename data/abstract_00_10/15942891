OBJECTIVE: In the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Network for Prevention Trials (HIVNET) 012 trial in Uganda, 6-8 weeks after single-dose nevirapine (SD-NVP), NVP resistance mutations were detected at a higher rate in women with HIV-1 subtype D than in women with subtype A. Here, we evaluate the rate of NVP resistance mutations in women with subtype C. METHODS: NVP resistance mutations were detected using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System. RESULTS: The portion of women with any NVP resistance mutation was higher in those with subtype C (45/65 [69.2%] in the NVP and zidovudine trial, Malawi) than in those in the HIVNET 012 trial with either subtype A (28/144 [19.4%]; P<.0001) or subtype D (35/97 [36.1%]; P<.0001). In a multivariate model, subtype (C vs. A: odds ratio [OR], 8.73 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.29-17.76]; C vs. D: OR, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.65-6.93]) and viral load at delivery (OR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.62-3.40]) independently predicted NVP resistance mutations, but maternal age, parity, and time between SD-NVP and the 6-8-week visit did not. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of NVP resistance mutations after SD-NVP was significantly higher in women with HIV-1 subtype C than in women with subtype A or D. Studies are needed to assess the clinical significance of this finding.
