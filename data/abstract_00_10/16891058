The vancomycin stress induced transcriptome of the methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strain Newman was determined by microarray analysis. Subsets of the induced ORFs corresponded to those previously reported to be induced by vancomycin in the methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains N315 and JH1, and/or by other cell wall active antibiotics in RN450; while other ORFs appeared to be induced strain specifically in Newman. Northern analyses showed that the induction pathway for several of the ORFs appeared to be altered in a number of clinical NARSA isolates. Induction was found to be dependent on inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics.
