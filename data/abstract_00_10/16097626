Since the introduction of rifampicin, it has been believed that pulmonary tuberculosis can be cured with medication alone. However, if tubercle bacilli are resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, the success rate of medical treatment falls considerably. These bacilli are defined as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and have been of great concern. To improve the outcome of chemotherapy in patients with MDR-TB, adjuvant resectional surgery has been advocated. Currently the most common indication for pulmonary resection in patients with tuberculosis is MDR-TB. Pulmonary resection for MDR-TB achieves a high cure rate with low morbidity and mortality. The majority of the MDR-TB patients in the previously reported surgical series were middle-aged, and pulmonary resection for MDR-TB has not been performed on the octogenarians. The oldest patient in our series was 65 years old. Nevertheless, pulmonary resection is worth considering for an octogenarian infected with MRD-TB because pulmonary resection achieves a high success rate with low morbidity and mortality.
