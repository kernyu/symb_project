OBJECTIVES: Biocides and dyes are commonly employed in hospital and laboratory settings. We investigated the biocide susceptibilities of a rapidly emerging pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii, and the underlying molecular mechanisms, with a primary focus on resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) efflux systems. METHODS: Biocide susceptibilities, efflux and in vitro inactivation profiles were monitored in the presence/absence of efflux pump inhibitors. The RND transporters encoded by adeB and adeJ were detected by PCR; null mutants were constructed in the native host. Expression of adeB and adeJ in clinical isolates was assayed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Susceptibility testing and phenotypic assays demonstrated the role of active efflux in mediating decreased susceptibility to biocides. Inactivation of either the adeB or adeJ transporter gene led to increased susceptibility to biocides. RT-PCR analysis exhibited increased adeB and adeJ expression in clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating the role of efflux pumps in mediating decreased susceptibility to disinfectants and other chemical substrates in A. baumannii.
