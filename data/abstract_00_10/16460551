The prevalence and associated factors of nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation were investigated among patients in geriatric hospitals in Korea. S. aureus was isolated from 317 (50.2%) of 632 patients. The nasal MRSA colonisation prevalence was 36.1%. In bivariate analysis, stay in an intensive care unit, decreased functional status, recent use of antibiotics, use of urinary catheters and the existence of skin breaks were associated with nasal MRSA colonisation (p < 0.05). Of these factors, only decreased functional status and recent use of systemic antibiotics were associated independently with nasal MRSA colonisation following logistic regression analysis.
