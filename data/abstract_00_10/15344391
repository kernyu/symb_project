Extended spectrum beta lactamase genes were detected by the PCR in 87.6% of 231 Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated in medical institutions of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tomsk and Nazran that showed a decrease in their susceptibility to 3rd generation cephalosporins. Alone or in various combinations TEM type beta lactamases were detected in 43.3% of the isolates, 46.8 and 51.2% of the isolates produced SHV type and CTX type beta lactamases respectively. Combinations of 2 and 3 different determinants were detected in 40 and 14% of the isolates respectively. Production of class C beta lactamases was suspected in 28% of the isolates by their resistance to cefoxitin. The gene of ACT type beta lactamase was detected in 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae and the gene of CMY type beta lactamase was detected in 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. By the NCCLS 100% of the isolates was susceptible to meropenem, 14% was susceptible to cefotaxime, 64% was susceptible to cefepime, 81% was susceptible to cefoperazone/sulbactam, 47% was susceptible to gentamicin, 57% was susceptible to amikacin and 36% was susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
