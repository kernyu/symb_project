The mutations that are responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance in the gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and serovar Paratyphi A were investigated. The sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene in clinical isolates which showed decreased susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones had a single mutation at either the Ser-83 or the Asp-87 codon, and no mutations were found in the gyrB, parC, and parE genes.
