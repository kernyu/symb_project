Acinetobacter baumannii are non-fermentative, Gram-negative bacilli that cause a large number of nosocomial infections worldwide. They are characterized by frequent multiresistance due to multiple mechanisms. As a consequence, infections caused by strains exhibiting resistance to carbapenems and, sometimes, polymyxins, are regularly observed. Sulbactam, colistin and combinations of different antimicrobials have been reported as new therapeutic approaches for infections caused by resistant A baumannii strains. This review focuses on current and potential new drugs, such as rifampin, tigecycline, antimicrobial peptides, efflux pump resistant and inhibitor drugs, and enzyme inhibitors.
