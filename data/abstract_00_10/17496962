Little data exist on the mechanism and stability of transformation in Phytophthora parasitica, a major oomycete parasite of plants. Here, we studied the stability of drug-resistant protoplast transformants by analyzing single-zoospore derivatives. We show that the transgenic sequences are not stably integrated into the chromosomes, resulting in the loss of drug resistance in single-zoospore derivatives. However, in strains where the P. parasitica gene encoding the CBEL elicitor was silenced by transformation with sense or antisense constructs, silencing is not reversed when the transgenic sequences are lost. This suggests that instability of P. parasitica transformants is not an obstacle for loss-of-function studies in this organism.
