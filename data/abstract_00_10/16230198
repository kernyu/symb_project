We present a case of recurrent infection (infective spondilitis, psoas abscess, and bacteraemia) caused by a single strain of cefotaxime- and ciprofloxacin-resistant and bla(CMY-2)-containing Salmonella enterica serotype choleraesuis during a 4-month period in a patient with uremia. The patient was successfully treated with imipenem for 7 weeks. Our observation indicates that a carbapenem might be considered as a drug of choice for the treatment of infections caused by this emerging multi-resistant pathogen.
