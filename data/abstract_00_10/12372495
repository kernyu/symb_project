An efficient and practical method was established for solid-phase parallel synthesis of the peptide-bearing carboxamide derivatives of chloroorienticin B, and over 80 compounds were synthesized simultaneously. Among the derivatives prepared, compounds having both tryptophan and tyrosine residues (1-3) were found to possess potent antibacterial activity against VRE.
