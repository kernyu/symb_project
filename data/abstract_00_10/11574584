The Vitek automated susceptibility testing system with a modified gram-positive susceptibility (GPS) 106 card (bioMerieux Vitek, Inc., Hazelwood. Mo.) and a rapid slide latex agglutination test (MRSA-Screen test; Denka Seiken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were evaluated for their abilities to detect oxacillin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). The reference broth microdilution method and the detection of the mecA gene by PCR ("gold standard" reference result) were used to compare the results obtained with the commercial products. A total of 123 clinical isolates consisting of eight species were selected from U.S. surveillance collections. Among the mecA-positive isolates (95 strains), 30 isolates were initially negative on the MRSA-Screen test read at 3 min. When the agglutination reaction was extended for 10 min, 26 of the 30 isolates became positive. For a different four isolates, the oxacillin MIC was < or =0.25 microg/ml on the Vitek GPS 106 card. Among the mecA-negative isolates (28 strains), for two Staphylococcus warneri, two S. lugdunensis, and two S. saprophyticus strains MICs were > or =0.5 microg/ml by the reference broth microdilution method. Four of these isolates were also categorized as resistant with the Vitek GPS 106 card and two isolates were positive by the MRSA-Screen test. Overall, the MRSA-Screen test, GPS 106 card, and reference broth microdilution method had sensitivities of 95.7 (result at 10 min), 95.7, and 100%, respectively, and specificities of 92.8, 85.7, and 78.5%, respectively. Although the MRSA-Screen test required a slight procedural modification, both commercial methods achieved a sensitivity and specificity at detecting oxacillin resistance in CoNS at a level that was acceptable for clinical laboratory use.
