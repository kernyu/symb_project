The antimicrobial potentiality of the methanolic extract of Phyllanthus amarus (Family: Euphorbiaceae) was studied against some drug resistant pathogenic bacterial strains by disc diffusion and agar dilution method. The extract showed significant concentration-dependent antibacterial activity particularly against gram-negative microbes. The study illustrated the claim of the usefulness of the plant in dysenteric and diarrheal infections and also suggested its use in fever. The antibacterial action was mainly due to the isolated phyllanthin.
