Interferons (IFN) induce an antiviral state against Hantaan virus (HTNV) but the mechanisms responsible for inhibition are unclear. The IFN-inducible MxA is discussed to be important for control of infections with hantaviruses. To characterize the role of endogenous MxA, the inhibition of HTNV induced by type I and type II IFNs was compared in Vero and A549 cells. IFNalpha and IFNgamma reduced production of infectious virions, viral RNA, and nucleocapsid protein with the same efficiency, although expression of MxA protein was detectable only in IFNalpha-treated A549 cells. Furthermore, knock down of MxA expression did not impair IFNalpha-induced inhibition. Thus, inhibition of HTNV induced by type I and type II IFNs did not dependent on expression of endogenous MxA. Taken together, these data suggest that MxA endogenously expressed in response to type I or type II IFNs does not play a pivotal role for the antiviral state against HTNV and that there is more than one mechanism by which cellular defences block hantavirus replication.
