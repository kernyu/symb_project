Substantiated in the paper is urgency of development of pathogenetically adequate immunotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of HIV-infection, that is supposed to have good prospects. Consideration is given to experimental and clinical-and-immunological findings concerning effects of different immunomoderivative drug preparations and of their synthetic analogues on the trigger mechanisms, with sequelae of their development in the cytokin-chemokin system outlined. A possibility is shown based on principle of our using with an immunotherapeutic purpose some cytokins, soluble receptors, antibodies to cytokins and receptors, those antibodies and ligands combined with toxins, chemical compounds affecting the synthesis of cytokin and other biologically active substances as well. Unspecific active immunotherapy is regarded as a good supplement to antiretroviral therapy preventing development of resistance to drugs.
