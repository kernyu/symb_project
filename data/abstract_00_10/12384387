Using PCR, we screened 105 isolates of poultry-associated Campylobacter jejuni for the presence of class 1 integrons. Of those isolates, 21% (22 of 105) possessed the integrase gene, but only 5 isolates produced an amplicon in a 5'-3' conserved sequence PCR directed toward amplification of the resistance cassettes. DNA sequencing demonstrated that all five isolates possessed the aminoglycoside resistance gene, aacA4.
