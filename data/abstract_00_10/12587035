The viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages or phages) were first isolated about 90 years ago. Phages have been fundamental tools in the development of molecular biology. Phages were early hypothesized as therapeutic agents for combatting pathogenic bacteria. However, the discovery and successful use of antibiotics to treat infectious diseases hindered this aim. the development of bacterial resistance to most available drugs has recently led researchers to test the possibilities of using phages as therapeutic agents. We review here recent achievements in this field, taking into consideration former bias in handling phages as well as previous achievements carried out in Eastern Europe where bacteriophages have been employed for decades as an alternative to antibiotics.
