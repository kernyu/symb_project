Advances in our understanding of autoimmunity and tumour immunity have led to improvements in immunotherapy for these diseases. Ironically, effective tumour immunity requires the induction of the same responses that underlie autoimmunity, whereas autoimmunity is driven by dysregulation of the same mechanisms that are involved in host defence and immune surveillance. Therefore, as we manipulate the immune system to treat cancer or autoimmunity, we inevitably unbalance the vital mechanisms that regulate self tolerance and antimicrobial resistance. This Science and Society article aims to dissect the conundrum that is inherent to the concept of immunotherapy and highlights the need for new and more specific therapeutic approaches.
