A total of 486 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were collected in 2003 and 2004 in Germany and revealed the following resistance rates: penicillin G (7.2%) and erythromycin A (18.9%). Telithromycin exhibited good in vitro activity (MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited, 0.125 microg/ml). However, one erm(B)-positive isolate was found to be telithromycin resistant (MIC, 8 microg/ml).
