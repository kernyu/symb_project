BACKGROUND: Due to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, several infectious diseases are no longer treatable with standard drugs, and in many cases there are no adequate therapeutic options. Even though the situation in the Nordic countries is considerably better than in large parts of the world, we must also contribute to fight this development. In addition to continuing the prudent use of antibiotics, it is important to strengthen certain infection control strategies. WHO has stated that antibiotic resistance is a global health problem. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The article is based on personal experience from infection control and infectious diseases, and impressions from discussions in National and Nordic forums during the last years. We have also reviewed literature retrieved from non-systematic database searches. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: The introduction of pneumococcal vaccine in the Norwegian Childhood Vaccination Programme will probably contribute to both reducing the use of antibiotics, and preventing the spread of pneumococci that are resistant to antibiotics. Increased influenza vaccination uptake, standard barrier precautions (hand hygiene etc.) against infections in health care institutions, isolation and surveillance of resistant bacteria are among the most important infection control measures that should be strengthened if we are to succeed.
