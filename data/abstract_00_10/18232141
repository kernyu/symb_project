BACKGROUND: A significant part of nosocomial infections are caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Nosocomial MRSA are known to be multidrug resistant and thus difficult to treat. METHODS: A 2 year study was conducted between January 2001 and December 2002 at Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, Hubli to assess the prevalence of MRSA and its antibiotic susceptibility pattern in various wards. RESULTS: S. aureus was isolated from 714 patients, 283 (37.53%) of which exhibited methicillin resistance. Although these MRSA were multidrug resistant in all the wards, the problem was more severe in NICU and orthopedic wards. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the need for effective implementation of infection control measures in the hospital. There is a need for the judicious use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital and outside as their indiscriminate use can exert pressure in selecting out MRSA and other multidrug resistant organisms.
