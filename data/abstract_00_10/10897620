T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome (NS). The aim of the study was to determine whether the activity of T-helper-1 (Th1) and T-helper-2 (Th2) cells are predictive for steroid sensitivity in children with primary NS. These parameters were assessed at the onset of disease, before initiation of steroid therapy. Two groups of NS children were retrospectively formed according to steroid sensitivity(SS) or resistance(SR). Activity of Th1 and Th2 cells was defined by the production of IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-4, IL-10 (ELISA), respectively, in the supernatants of the culture of CD4+ T cell cultures activated with autologous monocytes presenting tetanus toxoid (TT). Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were determined using double or triple colour flow cytometry. In SS children with NS we found the cytokine synthesis indicating the predominance of Th2 activity. We conclude that prior to treatment the Th1 and Th2 cell activity provides a useful tool to evaluate the probability of steroid sensitivity in patients with primary NS.
