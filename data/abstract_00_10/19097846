OBJECTIVES: To study the assessment of hygiene practices in anaesthesia in Lorraine between 1998 and 2007, after recommendations from the French Society of Anaesthesia and Reanimation (SFAR) in December 1997, and different local actions. STUDY DESIGN: Two surveys performed at a nine-year interval in Lorraine hospitals. POPULATION AND METHOD: Questionnaires about risk infection management and hygiene practices were sent by post to all anaesthetists, nurse anaesthetists and recovery room nurses in 1998 (n=279) and in 2007 (n=259). RESULTS: Between the two surveys multidrug-resistant bacteria signalling, movements of the staff in operating rooms, septic isolation protocol and management of single-use disposable anaesthesia material have been improved (p<0.05). Central venous catheters are less performed in recovery rooms and rings wearing decreased by 16% (p<0.05). Wearing of nonsterile gloves for peripheral venous catheter and intubation is not generalized (p<0.05). About half of the hospitals have cleanup procedures of anaesthesia furniture. Washing of hands by anaesthesia staff is not sometimes respected but it's more frequent for medicine preparation and between two operations. A good skin disinfection (cleaning - rinsing - drying - antiseptic) is more recurrent in 2007 (61.4%) than in 1998 (41.9%) for arterial catheter. Wearing of glasses for intubation is each times rare, about 15%. CONCLUSION: Hygiene practices in anaesthesia in Lorraine have been improved between the two surveys by recommendations from the Sfar and the work of the Antenne Regional de Lorraine (audits, manuals, formations). Promising progress has been made but some points must still be worked on.
