This study characterizes methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates recovered from nasal cultures of noninstitutionalized individuals in the United States obtained in 2001 to 2004 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Every tenth MSSA isolate and all MRSA isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), screened for multiple toxin genes, and tested for susceptibility to 14 antimicrobial agents. USA200, USA600, and USA900 were the predominant PFGE types among MSSA isolates in both the 2001 to 2002 and the 2003 to 2004 time periods, although they accounted for only 51.3% of 316 MSSA isolates typed in 2001 and 2002 and only 43.4% of 237 MSSA isolates typed in 2003 and 2004. In contrast, USA100, USA800, and USA700 accounted for 80.0% of the 75 MRSA isolates typed in 2001 and 2002, while USA100, USA800, and USA300 accounted for 78.4% of 134 MRSA isolates typed in 2003 and 2004. The proportion of MRSA isolates that were USA300 increased significantly from the first to the second time period (P = 0.03). Most USA200 isolates (both MSSA and MRSA) carried the gene for toxic shock syndrome toxin; however, carriage of the genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin, while common among MRSA of PFGE type USA300, was rare among MSSA USA300 in both time periods. Most MSSA isolates remained susceptible to all antimicrobial agents except erythromycin (79.1 and 76.0% susceptibilities in the 2001 to 2002 and the 2003 to 2004 periods, respectively). In contrast, the proportions of MRSA isolates that were susceptible to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and erythromycin were lower in 2003 and 2004 than in 2001 and 2002, although none of these differences was statistically significant.
