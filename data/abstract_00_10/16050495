The results of 3-year observation on emergence of H. influenzae antibiotic resistant strains in Moscow are summarized. The study included 566 strains isolated from patients in 2002-2004. The susceptibility was determined by the 2-fold microdilution method on the Haemophilus test medium. The percentage of the resistant strains isolated in 2002, 2003 and 2004 was the following: ampicillin --4.9, 3.2 and 3.6%, tetracycline--3.3, 3.2 and 1.8% and co-trimoxazole--10.9, 20.9 and 20% respectively. The strains isolated in 2003 and 2004 were resistant to azithromycin in 0.6 and 1.8% of the isolates and to clarithromycin in 1.3 and 3.2% of the isolates respectively. Five isolates differed by the minimum resistance to ampicillin whereas producing no beta-lactamase (BLNAR strains). The drugs of choice for the treatment of respiratory tract infections mainly due to H. influenzae, i.e. acute otitis and sinusitis, chronic bronchitis exacerbation and sometimes pneumonia remain betalactam antibiotics. From the microbiological viewpoint the inhibitor-protected aminopenicillins, cefuroxime and cefotaxime have no significant advantages vs. amoxycillin. The use of cotrimoxazole and chloramphenicol should be considered inexpedient.
