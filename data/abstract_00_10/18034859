Susceptibility to erythromycin and clindamycin was determined in 860 consecutive clinical isolates of beta-haemolytic streptococci belonging to groups A (GAS, n = 134), B (GBS, n = 689), C (GCS, n = 19) and G (GGS, n = 18). Erythromycin resistance was 26.1% in GAS, 15.7% in GBS, 5.3% in GCS and 33.3% in GGS. The highest rate of clindamycin resistance (33.3%) was in GGS, followed by GBS (15.8%), GCS (15.8%) and GAS (5.2%). The M phenotype was predominant in GAS (80%), the constitutive MLS(B) phenotype was predominant in GBS (75%), and all GGS isolates showed the inducible MLS(B) phenotype. The uncommon erythromycin-susceptible and clindamycin-resistant phenotype was found in four GBS and two GCS isolates.
