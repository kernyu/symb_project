We studied 14 patients acutely infected with wild-type HIV, who underwent supervised treatment interruptions after initial antiretroviral treatment including lamivudine. Lamivudine resistance mutations emerged for the first time during supervised treatment interruptions in one patient. Resistance should be monitored in supervised treatment interruptions trials, because mutations may first be detected only after therapy is interrupted.
