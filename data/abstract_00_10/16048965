Minimal inhibitory and minimal fungicidal concentrations of caspofungin were determined for 48 Candida inconspicua isolates. By using CLSI (formerly NCCLS) methodology with the partial inhibition endpoint criterion, caspofungin exhibited a good fungicidal effect against C. inconspicua (the MIC(90) was 0.25 microg/ml and the minimum fungicidal concentration [MFC] was 0.5 microg/ml after 24 h). Total inhibition yielded falsely elevated MICs, exceeding even the respective MFCs.
