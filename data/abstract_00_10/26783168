The antimicrobial spectra of previously published bacteriocin E 50-52 (39 a.a.; 3,932 Da; pI = 8.5) and bacteriocin B 602 (29 a.a.; 3,864 Da; pI = 7.2) were determined. Named peptides were related to class IIa (pediocin-like) bacteriocins. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of bacteriocins have been determined for bacterial isolates that were causative agents of nosocomial infections collected from Russian hospitals in 2003-2007, namely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 10); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11); Citrobacter freundii (n = 8); Escherichia coli (n = 9); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10); Proteus spp. (n = 6); and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 10). The majority of these tested isolates have been shown to be multidrug resistant and carry genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance that were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The MICs of bacteriocin B 602 ranged from </=0.025-1.56 mug/ml, and for bacteriocin E 50-52 from 0.05 to 6.25 mug/ml for all of 64 bacterial clinical isolates tested. Interestingly, the bacteriocins studied demonstrate activity on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteriocins E 50-52 and B 602 show good activity against nosocomial bacterial agents resistant to many classes of modern antibacterials used in clinical practice. These bacteriocins should be examined as an alternative in treating infections caused by such agents.
