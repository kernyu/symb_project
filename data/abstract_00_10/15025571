An attempt was made to determine whether amino acid variation at position 631 in the chicken Mx protein definitely influences antiviral specificity, using an artificial mutation technique by which a single amino acid was reciprocally substituted between Ser (AGT) and Asn (AAT) at position 631 of the negative and positive chicken Mx, respectively. Using permanently transfected 3T3 cell lines, the antiviral potential of chicken Mx against vesicular stomatitis virus infection was analysed. The results indicated that the phenotype of antiviral activity depends on the amino acid difference at position 631; that is, the genotype coding Asn at position 631 corresponds to the positive antiviral phenotype, and the genotype coding Ser corresponds to the negative phenotype. The present study has confirmed that the antiviral specificity of chicken Mx protein is determined by an amino acid substitution at the carboxy terminus.
