Substitution of the t-butylcarboxamide substituent in analogues of the HIV protease inhibitor (PI) Indinavir with a trifluoroethylamide moiety confers greater potency against both the wild-type (NL4-3) virus and PI-resistant HIV. The trifluoroethyl substituent also affords a slower clearance rate in vivo (dogs); however, this may be due to more potent inhibition of at least two P450 isoforms.
