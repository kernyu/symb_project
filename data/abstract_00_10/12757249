Several aspects of emerging pediatric cutaneous infections are of importance to the clinician. New manifestations of parvovirus infection should be recognized promptly, especially because transmission to susceptible populations might lead to serious complications. In the immunocompromised pediatric population, the outcome of cutaneous mold infections can be improved with prompt recognition and initiation of treatment. The incidence of community-acquired MRSA infections in pediatrics is becoming more than a regional concern, and this coincides with the issue of limited antibiotic susceptibility for MRSA as well as other infections. New antibiotics such as linezolid are emerging as potential treatments for drug-resistant pathogens. An older group of antibiotics, the fluoroquinolones, appear to be well tolerated in children and should not be withheld from this population when the benefits of treatment out-weigh the risks.
