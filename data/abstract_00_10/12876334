In 1996 the International AIDS Society-USA convened an international panel of experts in HIV drug resistance and clinical management to develop guidelines for the clinical use and limitations of resistance testing. Since then the International AIDS Society-USA Resistance Testing Guidelines Panel has developed and regularly published its recommendations. The latest panel recommendations appear in the July 1 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases. We periodically pose questions to the panel relating to clinical elements of resistance testing that have been collected from HIV practitioners across the nation. We are happy to feature the latest edition in this issue of Topics in HIV Medicine. It is our hope that addressing these issues will help guide your treatment strategy decisions regarding resistance testing.
