A total of 18,639 clinical isolates in 19 species collected from 77 centers during 2004 in Japan were tested for their susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and other selected antibiotics. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae showed a high susceptible rate against FQs. The isolation rate of beta lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was approximately three times as large as those of western countries. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae were also susceptible to FQs. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli against FQs has however been rapidly increasing so far as we surveyed since 1994. The FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed approximately 90% except for 36%. of sitafloxacin while FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was around 5%. The FQs-resistant rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was also higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), however, it was lower than that of MRSA. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, 32-34% from UTI and 15-19% of from RTI was resistant to FQs. Acinetobacter spp. showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Although FQs-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae have not been increased in western countries, it is remarkably high in Japan. In this survey, isolates of approximately 85% was resistant to FQs.
