The results of the statistical treatment of data on the analyses of 766 children, the residents of Moscow, for dysbacteriosis are presented; of these children, 34 were aged up to 1 month and 732, from 1 month to 1 year. This study revealed that in the fist year of life in children with dysbacteriosis the dominating bacterial species were S. aureus, bacteria of the genus Klebsiella and fungi of the genus Candida. From the intestine of children aged up to 1 month S. aureus and Klebsiella were isolated more often than from children aged up to 1 year. The results of the study of antibioticograms demonstrated that 21.6% of S. aureus strains and 74.4% of Klebsiella strains were multiresistant to antibiotics. Taking into account the fact that multiresistance to antibiotics was characteristic of hospital strains, the suggestion was made that the isolated strains were of hospital origin and such strains could colonize the intestine of children in maternity hospitals.
