The efficacy of PK-Merz medication has been studied in 17 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), who have developed a resistance to levodopa as a result of a long-term treatment. The efficacy was evaluated according to clinical symptoms (UPDRS) and electromyography (EMG) indices. The summary motor score measured by UPDRS estimated as 49-79 (58.1 +/- 3.2) one hour after a single levodopa/carbidopa intake, decreased to 36-65 (45.2 +/- 2.9, p < 0.05) after levodopa/carbidopa combination with i.v. PK-Merz infusion. The biceps and triceps resting EMG amplitude and values of its variance also decreased significantly (p < 0.01). The percentage of the registered burst muscle discharges of 4-7 Hz frequency reduced from 32 to 13%. Under functional stress, the reflex antagonist muscle co-activation decreased in the majority of the patients. Selective correlations were found between the EMG indices and some UPDRS PD symptom scores. PK-Merz improves both motor functions and muscle coordination in PD.
