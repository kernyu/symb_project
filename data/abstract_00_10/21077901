Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is important for the activation of plant resistance to environmental stresses, and ion homeostasis is the physiological foundation for living cells. In this study, we investigated G6PDH roles in modulating ion homeostasis under salt stress in Carex moorcroftii callus. G6PDH activity increased to its maximum in 100 mM NaCl treatment and decreased with further increased NaCl concentrations. K+/Na+ ratio in 100 mM NaCl treatment did not exhibit significant difference compared with the control; however, in 300 mM NaCl treatment, it decreased. Low-concentration NaCl (100 mM) stimulated plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase and NADPH oxidase activities as well as Na+/H+ antiporter protein expression, whereas high-concentration NaCl (300 mM) decreased their activity and expression. When G6PDH activity and expression were reduced by glycerol treatments, PM H+-ATPase and NADPH oxidase activities, Na+/H+ antiporter protein level and K+/Na+ ratio dramatically decreased. Simultaneously, NaCl-induced hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulation was abolished. Exogenous application of H(2)O(2) increased G6PDH, PM H+-ATPase and NADPH oxidase activities, Na+/H+ antiporter protein expression and K+/Na+ ratio in the control and glycerol treatments. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, which counteracted NaCl-induced H(2)O(2) accumulation, decreased G6PDH, PM H+-ATPase and NADPH oxidase activities, Na+/H+ antiporter protein level and K+/Na+ ratio. Western blot result showed that G6PDH expression was stimulated by NaCl and H(2)O(2), and blocked by DPI. Taken together, G6PDH is involved in H(2)O(2) accumulation under salt stress. H(2)O(2), as a signal, upregulated PM H+-ATPase activity and Na+/H+ antiporter protein level, which subsequently resulted in the enhanced K+/Na+ ratio. G6PDH played a central role in the process.
