The in vitro activity of telavancin was tested against 743 predominantly antimicrobial-resistant, gram-positive isolates. Telavancin was highly active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC(90), 0.5 to 1 microg/ml), streptococci (all MICs, < or =0.12 microg/ml), and VanB-type enterococci (all MICs, < or =2 microg/ml). Time-kill studies demonstrated the potent bactericidal activity of telavancin.
