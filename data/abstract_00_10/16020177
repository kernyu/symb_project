Carbon disulfide exerted adverse effects on the structure or hemodynamics of the cardiovascular system, and whether ethanol exposure modifies the cardiovascular effect of carbon disulfide, was examined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the study. Animals in the control and ethanol groups drank water containing 5% sugar, or 10% ethanol in addition to 5% sugar, respectively, for 14 wk. Sepatare animals inhaled 700 mg/m3 of carbon disulfide for 6 h daily. Carbon disulfide treatment did not affect the food and fluid consumption of the animals, while this gas decreased body mass gain. CS2 increased arterial blood pressure and cardiac index, decreased their cardiac output, the fraction of the cardiac output, and blood flow for the kidneys and the lungs, and increased the relative heart, liver, and kidneys mass and the vascular resistance of the brain, lungs, and kidneys. Ethanol decreased the food and fluid consumption and body mass gain of the animals, the fraction of the cardiac output for the kidneys, and the vascular resistance of the liver, while it increased the blood flow of the brain and liver. Simultaneous administration of carbon disulfide and ethanol decreased the heart rate and increased the QRS duration. Significant interaction was found between the effect in case of heart rate, PQ distance, and QRS duration; carbon disulfide significantly increased the minimal-moderate effect of ethanol on all three parameters. With histological examinations no pathologic alterations were found in the organs studied. It was concluded that the early hemodynamic changes produced by carbon disulfide may play a significant role in the pathomechanism of the effects of the substance (hypertension, damage to the myocardium and kidneys). On the other hand, a potentiating interaction of carbon disulfide was expected with the effects of ethanol, at the administered concentration and dose in the study.
