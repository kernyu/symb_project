In vitro susceptibility testing of 2,797 group A streptococcus (GAS) isolates demonstrated that telithromycin was fully active against all macrolide-susceptible strains and among 80 of 115 macrolide-resistant GAS expressing the M phenotype. Telithromycin resistance was identified in 2 of 45 strains expressing the inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B phenotype and four of nine isolates expressing the constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance phenotype.
