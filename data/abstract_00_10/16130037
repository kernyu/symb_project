Although voriconazole shows an advantageous microbiological and pharmacological profile with respect to amphotericin B and other antifungals, the cumulative experience with the use of voriconazole in patients intolerant to other antifungals or with refractory invasive fungal infections is still limited. We performed a retrospective analysis of the charts of 48 patients in 26 Spanish hospitals who were diagnosed with invasive fungal infections due to filamentous fungi or yeasts and had received voriconazole (between 1999 and 2002) as part of a compassionate use program for a mean of 59.2 days (range 1-748 days). The favorable response rate in patients with invasive, refractory aspergillosis who were treated exclusively with voriconazole was 8/12 (66%). This response rate increased to 10/12 (83%) when two other cases treated with a combination of voriconazole plus caspofungin were included. In patients with invasive candidiasis the response rate was 66% (6/9). A favorable response was achieved in 12/17 (70%) patients with invasive fungal infections due to other difficult to treat fungi (Scedosporium spp., Fusarium spp., Blastoschizomyces spp.). The tolerability and safety profile of voriconazole was good; only four patients required discontinuation of treatment due to side effects. Voriconazole is a well-tolerated, effective antifungal for the treatment of patients with refractory invasive fungal infections due to Aspergillus spp., Candida spp. and fungi resistant or refractory to other treatments.
