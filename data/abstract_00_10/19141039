AIMS: We report extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) from Phoma glomerata and its efficacy against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria exhibiting resistance to various antibiotics showed remarkable sensitivity, when used in combination of antibiotics and Ag-NPs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biosynthesis of Ag-NPs was carried out by challenging the fungal cell filtrate with 1 mmol l(-1) silver nitrate. The Ag-NPs were characterized with the help of UV-Visible spectrophotometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was carried out to detect the size of Ag-NPs. Evaluation of the combined effect(s) was studied by disc diffusion method against E. coli, Staph. aureus and Ps. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The biosynthesis route seems to be eco-friendly and easy to scale up the process. Thus, these Ag-NPs may prove as a better candidate for drugs and can potentially eliminate the problem of chemical agents because of their biogenic nature. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The bacterial resistance against antibiotics has been increasing with alarming rate. To overcome this problem, there is a pressing need to develop bactericidal agents. Ag-NPs may prove to be an answer to drug-resistant bacteria.
