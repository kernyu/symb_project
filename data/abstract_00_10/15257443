Lactic acid was added to batch very high gravity (VHG) fermentations and to continuous VHG fermentations equilibrated to steady state with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A 53% reduction in colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1) of S. cerevisiae was observed in continuous fermentation at an undissociated lactic acid concentration of 3.44% w/v; and greater than 99.9% reduction was evident at 5.35% w/v lactic acid. The differences in yeast cell number in these fermentations were not due to pH, since batch fermentations over a pH range of 2.5-5.0 did not lead to changes in growth rate. Similar fermentations performed in batch showed that growth inhibition with added lactic acid was nearly identical. This indicates that the apparent high resistance of S. cerevisiae to lactic acid in continuous VHG fermentations is not a function of culture mode. Although the total amount of ethanol decreased from 48.7 g l(-1) to 14.5 g l(-1) when 4.74% w/v undissociated lactic acid was added, the specific ethanol productivity increased ca. 3.2-fold (from 7.42 x 10(-7) g to 24.0 x 10(-7) g ethanol CFU(-1) h(-1)), which indicated that lactic acid stress improved the ethanol production of each surviving cell. In multistage continuous fermentations, lactic acid was not responsible for the 83% (CFU ml(-1)) reduction in viable S. cerevisiae yeasts when Lactobacillus paracasei was introduced to the system at a controlled pH of 6.0. The competition for trace nutrients in those fermentations and not lactic acid produced by L. paracasei likely caused the yeast inhibition.
