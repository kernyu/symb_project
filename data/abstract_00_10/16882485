Equine urinary tract infection (UTI) most commonly occurs as a sequela to structural or functional inhibition of normal urine flow. Although it is an infrequent diagnosis in equids, the incidence of UTI in human beings is high and has inspired great investigative effort. The resultant findings with potentially broad application as well as current equine studies are reviewed here. Recent developments in the understanding of host-agent interactions and renal defense mechanisms, emerging antimicrobial resistance, and novel therapeutic alternatives to prophylactic antibiotic use are emphasized.
