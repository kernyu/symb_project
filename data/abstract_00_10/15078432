The present investigation was conducted to identify Candida dubliniensis, from respiratory specimens, recovered from HIV-negative patients. Over a 7-month period, 75 germ tube and chlamydospore-positive yeasts were screened for C. dubliniensis, using a variety of phenotypic characteristics. Their identification was based on sugar assimilation reactions using API 20 C Aux. A total of seven (9%) isolates recovered from sputum, bronchial lavage and nasopharyngeal aspirate were identified as C. dubliniensis. All the isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B. One isolate each showed resistance to fluconazole and ketoconazole, and two were resistant to itraconazole. A significantly high percentage (43%) of C. dubliniensis showed resistance to flucytosine.
