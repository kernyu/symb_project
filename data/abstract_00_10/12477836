Entry and fusion of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPF3) require the interaction of the viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein with its sialic acid receptor. 4-GU-DANA, a potent inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase, inhibits not only HPF3 neuraminidase but also the receptor binding activity of HPF3 HN and thus its ability to promote attachment and fusion. We previously generated a 4-GU-DANA-resistant HPF3 virus variant (ZM1) with a markedly fusogenic plaque morphology that harbored two HN gene mutations resulting in amino acid alterations. The present study using cells that express the individual mutations of ZM1 HN shows that one of these mutations is responsible for the increases in receptor binding and neuraminidase activities as well as the diminished sensitivity of both activities to the inhibitory effect of 4-GU-DANA. To examine the hypothesis that increased receptor binding avidity underlies 4-GU-DANA resistance, parallel studies were carried out on the high-affinity HN variant virus C22 and cells expressing the C22 variant HN. This variant also exhibited reduced sensitivity to 4-GU-DANA in terms of receptor binding and infectivity but without concomitant changes in the neuraminidase activity of HN. Another high-affinity HN variant, C0, was not resistant in terms of infectivity; however, a small increase in the receptor binding activity of C0 HN and a partial resistance of this activity to 4-GU-DANA were revealed by sensitive methods that we developed. In each virus variant, one mutation in HN accounted for both increased receptor binding avidity and 4-GU-DANA resistance; the higher affinity for the receptor overcomes the inhibitory effect of 4-GU-DANA. Thus, in contrast to influenza viruses for which 4-GU-DANA escape variants include hemagglutinin mutants with decreased receptor binding avidity that promotes virion release, for HPF3, HN mutants with increased receptor binding avidity are those that can escape the growth inhibitory effect of 4-GU-DANA.
