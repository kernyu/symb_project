OBJECTIVES: The occurrence of lamivudine resistance is often associated with the clinical breakthrough, which is characterised by the reappearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in serum and the elevation of aminotransferases. We evaluated the efficacy of alpha interferon for clinical breakthrough in patients receiving lamivudine therapy. PATIENTS: Six chronic hepatitis B patients receiving lamivudine were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Under lamivudine therapy, clinical breakthroughs occurred in between fifteenth and thirty-fourth month of lamivudine therapy. HBV DNA reappeared, and alanine aminotransferase was elevated. Genotypic analysis showed M552V, M552I and L528M mutations. After determining the clinical breakthrough, standard alpha interferon-2b was given for 6 months. Lamivudine was also maintained. In only one patient, HBV DNA became negative by polymerase chain reaction, and serum alanine transaminase level was normal at the end of therapy. CONCLUSION: Alpha interferon added to lamivudine is generally ineffective in the treatment of lamivudine resistance.
