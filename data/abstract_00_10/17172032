The function of NS4B is incompletely understood. The aim of the study is to understand the influence of NS4B on anti-viral response. After cell line stably expressing NS4B established, the influence of IFN-alpha of different concentration on VSV was studied using plaque assay; cell expression profiling caused by NS4B was studied using DNA microarray, and the IFNGR1 fluorescence intensity was analyzed. Our data showed that HCV-NS4B could suppress immuno-associated gene expression, in particular, IFN-gamma receptor signal transduction-related genes. Taken together, NS4B could play some roles in HCV resistance to IFN therapy.
