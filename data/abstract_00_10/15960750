AIM: To compare the incidence of antimicrobial resistance among Salmonella serotypes isolated in a pig slaughterhouse in Zaragoza (Spain) during 1993 and 2001. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 168 isolates representing 10 serotypes were examined by disc diffusion method using 17 antibiotics. Data showed that the majority of the strains were resistant to streptomycin (97%), sulfadiazine (93.4%) and tetracycline (83.3%). A large proportion of the collection was multidrug resistant (MDR, resistance to four or more antibiotics) with a greater incidence in 2001. The findings imply an increasing incidence of MDR amongst S. Typhimurium, and all S. Typhimurium-definitive phage type (DT) 104 isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamide and tetracycline (R-ACSSuT). This resistance phenotype had spread among other phage and serotypes. Salmonella Ohio was also a MDR serotype and this is not a serotype normally associated with drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of the strains were MDR and this showed that pork products could be a potential vehicle of MDR Salmonella food-borne infections. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings may have significant public health consequences and could contribute to the development of useful practices aimed at limiting the transmission of MDR Salmonella serotypes through the food chain.
