The Korean Association of Urogenital Tract Infection and Inflammation (KAUTII) conducted a multicentre, retrospective analysis of acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) to document clinical features, management, microbiology and the course of disease. The clinical records of 473 cases compatible with a confirmed diagnosis of ABP from 16 urological centres between 2001 and 2005 were reviewed. Susceptibility of the organisms causing ABP, including Escherichia coli, to ciprofloxacin was shown to be very low, fuelling debate as to the efficacy of ciprofloxacin against uropathogens in Korea. When subcategorised according to history of prior manipulation of the lower urinary tract, there were distinct differences between ABP patients with or without a history of prior manipulation with regard to overall clinical and microbiological features. The difference in the distribution of pathogens between the two groups as well as the difference in susceptibility between E. coli and other pathogens should influence empirical antibiotic treatment. In the group with a history of prior manipulation of the lower urinary tract, ciprofloxacin or cephalosporins alone are an inadequate choice and the combination of cephalosporins and amikacin is recommended for empirical therapy.
