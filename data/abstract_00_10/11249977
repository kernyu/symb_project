Sinusitis is a major cause of illness in the USA, and represents a substantial economic burden. Treatment of this condition usually involves antibiotics and, where there is a strong suspicion of bacterial etiology, has a high rate of success. Accurate diagnosis depends upon clinical assessment, but only four specific symptoms have been shown to be independent predictors of sinusitis. Other diagnostic approaches such as analysis of a microbiological sample must be considered in cases failing initial treatment. The main factors in choosing antibiotic therapy are the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance and antibiotics' pharmacological profiles. Accurate diagnosis and careful consideration when choosing therapy for sinusitis will optimise the chances of achieving an early cure.
