A total of 34 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from a district hospital in Taiwan were identified with carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase OXA-66/OXA-51-like. In addition, 26 of 28 carbapenem-resistant isolates harbored plasmid-encoded bla(OXA-23)-like genes. Twenty of 28 carbapenem-resistant isolates mapped to the major genotype cluster A of carbapenemase producer by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
