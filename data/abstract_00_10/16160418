The article deals with the production of the extract of Echinacea purpurea herbs when selecting an extractant concentration, the size of particles in a raw material and the method of extraction. Using 60% (v/v) ethanol for production of the immune system enhancing extract, the extract becomes green due to pigmental substances; therefore, 60% (v/v), 70% (v/v), and 96% (v/v) ethanol was not used for extraction. It is recommended to use 50% (v/v) ethanol for extraction. Using 40% (v/v) ethanol not all active substances are extracted and resistance of the extract to microbial contamination is weaker. It was determined that the method of repercolation should be used to yield the largest amount of active substances. The largest amount of active substances in the immune system enhancing extract was obtained when the flow speed of extract was 0.2 ml/min. The quality of extract was tested within the period of 26 months by the monitoring of following parameters: appearance of the extract, refraction index, relative density, ethanol concentration, the amounts of dry residue and chicoric acid. The analysis was carried out every three months. The samples of the extract remained stable during storage: no alterations of color, smell or taste were observed. Some of the samples had deposits, which is quite natural in the production of drugs from herbal material, as they have no influence on the quality of the drug (the amounts of active substances were found to be within acceptable limits). On the basis of the obtained results, the period of expiry of the immune system enhancing tincture was confirmed to be 2 years.
