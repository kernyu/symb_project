The performance of the nitrate reductase assay was evaluated in a multicenter laboratory study to detect resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and streptomycin using a set of coded isolates. Compared with the gold standard proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium, the assay was highly accurate in detecting resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol with an accuracy of 98%, 96.6% and 97.9%, respectively. For streptomycin, discrepant results were obtained with an overall accuracy of 85.3%. The assay proved easy to be implemented in countries with limited laboratory facilities.
