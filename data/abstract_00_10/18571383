In this study, 119 multidrug-resistant isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars collected in Spain (2002-2004) were screened for integrons. Among the isolates, 73.1% contained class 1 integrons, however classes 2 and 3 were not detected. Integrons containing gene cassettes were found in S. Enteritidis (16/32), S. Typhimurium biphasic (18/32) and monophasic [4,5,12:i:-] (11/19), S. Virchow (17/18) and S. Brandenburg (8/8), but not in S. Hadar (0/10). Ten complete and four incomplete gene cassettes, combined in 10 variable regions, were identified, one of which (2100 bp/dfrA1-597 bp-aadA24) was a new description. Most integrons mapped on plasmids of ca. 40-340 kb. Exceptions were 1000 bp/aadA2 and 1200 bp/bla PSE-1 found on the chromosome of biphasic S. Typhimurium, probably as part of SGI1-like structures.
