BACKGROUND: Many rare conditions may cause secondary peritonitis. Injection site infection as a primary source of peritonitis has not been reported. METHODS: Case report and review of the pertinent English-language literature. RESULTS: We describe a 39-year-old intravenous drug user who presented with peritonitis. During the surgical exploration, all abdominal organs were intact, but there was an orifice in the pelvic peritoneum that was related to an inguinal site infection. Cultures of both the inguinal area and the peritoneal cavity discharge revealed Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be aware of secondary peritonitis induced by self-injection of illicit substances in proximity to the peritoneal envelope.
