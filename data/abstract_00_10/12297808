OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate gatifloxacin in adults with acute uncomplicated bacterial rhinosinusitis. STUDY DESIGN: TeqCES was an open-label, multicenter, noncomparative study of the safety and efficacy of gatifloxacin. More than 11,000 adult patients with acute uncomplicated rhinosinusitis received gatifloxacin 400 mg once daily for 10 days. RESULTS: Moraxella catarrhalis (91% beta-lactamase producers), Haemophilus influenzae (28% beta-lactamase producers), Streptococcus pneumoniae (18% intermediately resistant and 14% fully resistant to penicillin), and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant pathogens isolated from purulent nasal discharge. More than 99% of rhinosinusitis pathogens isolated from the nasopharynx of patients meeting the clinical criteria for rhinosinusitis were susceptible to gatifloxacin. Among 10,353 patients whose clinical response could be determined, 91.6% were cured. Clinical cure rates exceeded 90% for the major pathogens. Gatifloxacin was well tolerated; drug-related adverse events that occurred in 1% or more of patients were nausea (4.4%), dizziness (1.8%), diarrhea (1.4%), and headache (1.0%). CONCLUSION: Gatifloxacin is effective for patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in the community.
