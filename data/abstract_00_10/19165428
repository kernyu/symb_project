BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of 6.6 newly diagnosed tuberculosis (TB) cases per 100,000 inhabitants is in decline in Germany, TB remains a disease of significant epidemiologic importance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 04/2001 to 07/2008, a total of 75 TB patients of an internal-pulmonary outpatient clinic had been treated (0.5% of all patients). 58 (77.3%) patients fulfilled the criteria of an active TB, 17 (22.7%) of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI). 68.0% were male (average age men 39.3 +/- 16.9 years [mean +/- standard deviation], women 46.8 +/- 21.5 years; p = not significant). 69.3% of the patients were born in Germany, 30.7% abroad. 84.5% patients had isolated pulmonary, 8.6% additional organ involvement, and 6.9% isolated extrapulmonary TB. 62.1% of active TB cases were microbiologically proven (51.7% microscopically, 43.1% in addition culturally, 6.9% exclusively culturally, 19.0% by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). RESULTS: Of 23 tests, 52.2% were fully sensitive against the most important first-line drugs ethambutol (M), isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), und streptomycin (S). 13.0% had an isolated resistance against H (4.4%) or S (8.6%), 4.4% a multiple drug resistance (MDR) against R und H, 30.4% a polyresistance (S and H). Symptoms were quite often unspecific, not taken care of, or misinterpreted. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis and therapy of an active or latent TB illness remains, an important task and challenge, necessitating an effective cooperation of outpatient, hospital, and health authority institutions.
