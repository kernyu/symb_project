The increase in the number of infections caused by Candida species and the consequent use of antifungal agents favours an increase of resistant isolates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antifungal susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates from patients with different systemic predisposing factors to candidosis. Seventy-nine Candida spp. isolates were assayed for in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B, fluconazole, 5-flucytosine and itraconazole using the technique proposed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Four C. albicans, one C. guilliermondii, four C. parapsilosis and two C. tropicalis isolates were resistant to amphotericin B. Only two isolate was resistant to itraconazole. All the isolates tested were susceptible to fluconazole and flucytosine. It could be concluded that the most efficient drugs against the Candida isolates studied were fluconazole and flucytosine and that all of the antifungal agents used in this study were effective against the Candida spp. isolates tested.
