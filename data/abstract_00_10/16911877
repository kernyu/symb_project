Several invasive serogroup B meningococcal strains phylogenetically related to the lineage III (ET-24) exhibited a mutator phenotype as shown by mutagenicity assay using rifampicin-resistance as a selection marker. Hypermutation was associated to the presence of defective mutL alleles that were genetically characterized. Interestingly, the mutator phenotype was suppressed when a non-functional recB(ET-37) allele, derived from ET-37 meningococcal strains, replaced the functional recB allele in a lineage III strain. In contrast, the same gene replacement did not affect mutation frequencies in a mismatch repair-proficient strain. These results suggested that in MutL-deficient strains spontaneous mutations mostly arise from post-replicative DNA synthesis associated to the activity of the RecBCD recombination pathway.
