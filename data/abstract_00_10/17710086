Increasingly effective therapies for HIV infection are now available. These treatments, referred to collectively as highly active antiretroviral therapy, comprise various combinations of anti-HIV drugs from different drug classes. Recently, a range of metabolic complications have emerged as important toxicities in treated patients. Complications present as abnormalities of body-fat mass distribution in association with an often significant dyslipidemia and glucose homeostasis dysregulation. The body-shape changes, manifesting as peripheral lipoatrophy or central lipohypertrophy, can have a negative impact on quality of life and consequently on adherence to treatment. The combination of central lipohypertrophy, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance is associated with accelerated rates of atherosclerosis and other potentially significant long-term effects. The pathogenesis of these effects is complex and is still being actively investigated. Possible contributing factors relate to host characteristics, HIV viral parameters and specific effects of anti-HIV drugs on adipose-tissue biology and on intermediary metabolism. Management of these complications involves manipulation of the anti-HIV drugs using an understanding of their particular effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, in association with standard therapeutic interventions. Individualized approaches, taking into consideration quality-of-life issues, and assessment of potential cardiovascular risks, are now an important component of effective care of HIV-infected patients.
