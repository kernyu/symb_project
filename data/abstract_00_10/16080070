The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. The trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (MICs, < or =2 microg/mL for most pathogens). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. A few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. The susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. For most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. The excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.
