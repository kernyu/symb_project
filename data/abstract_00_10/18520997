A-to-I pre-mRNA editing by adenosine deaminase enzymes has been reported to enhance protein diversity in the nervous system. In Drosophila, the resistance to dieldrin (RDL) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunit displays an editing site (R122) that is close to the putative GABA-binding site. We assessed the functional effects of editing at this site by expressing homomeric RDL receptors in Xenopus oocytes. After replacement of arginine 122 with a glycine, both agonist and fipronil potencies were shifted to the right in either fipronil-sensitive receptors or mutated resistant receptors (A301G/T350M). These data provide the first insight on the influence of RNA editing on GABA receptor function.
