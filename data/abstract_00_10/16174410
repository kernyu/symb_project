Malaria remains a major cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent of the 4 human Plasmodium species causing malaria, is potentially life threatening, is increasing in prevalence and is becoming even more resistant to in-use drugs. In light of the growing problem of multi-drug resistance to malarial parasites, the development of new drugs or the use of a combination therapy is of primary importance. A previous report describes a remarkable synergistic antimalarial interaction between 2 structurally similar compounds, rufigallol, an anthraquinone derivative and exifone, a benzophenone derivative, in vitro. The synergistic antimalarial activity of exifone and vitamin C was also reported. To extend the same analogy to other ketones, we carried out antimalarial testing of 20 benzophenone derivatives, individually, in combination with rufigallol, and also in combination with vitamin C, in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei. Five ketones, out of 20, showed good antimalarial activity, in vivo, when tested individually. Nine ketones, out of 20, showed good antimalarial activity, in vivo, when tested in combination with rufigallol, indicating the synergism between them. However, synergism between ketones and vitamin C was not satisfactory since only 2 ketones showed good antimalarial activity when tested in combination with vitamin C.
