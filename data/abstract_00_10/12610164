Finger insertion mutations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) (T69S mutations followed by various dipeptide insertions) have a multinucleoside resistance phenotype that can be explained by decreased sensitivity to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) inhibition of the nucleotide-dependent unblocking activity of RT. We show that RTs with SG or AG (but not SS) insertions have three- to fourfold-increased unblocking activity and that all three finger insertion mutations have threefold-decreased sensitivity to dNTP inhibition. The additional presence of M41L and T215Y mutations increased unblocking activity for all three insertions, greatly reduced the sensitivity to dNTP inhibition, and resulted in defects in in vitro DNA chain elongation. The DNA chain elongation defects were partially repaired by additional mutations at positions 210, 211, and 214. These results suggest that structural communication between the regions of RT defined by these mutations plays a role in the multinucleoside resistance phenotype.
