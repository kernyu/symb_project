Tumor promonocytic U937 cells cultured under a low O(2)/high CO(2) atmosphere display altered characteristics after restoration of normal atmosphere: increased resistance to apoptosis induced by different treatments; apoptotic morphology; lack of glutathione (GSH) extrusion in apoptosis; lack of protection by antioxidants; and lack of Ca(2+) mobilization with thapsigargin. These alterations were stably maintained for many months of culture in normal conditions, originating the stable U937-HX variant. Since the hypoxic treatment did not produce a great selective pressure, the alterations are conceivably the result of stable adaptative response.
