A 25-year-old female was admitted to our intensive care unit with septic shock and multiorgan failure caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli originating from the right renal pelvis. A 16-day course of treatment with meropenem reversed the septic condition, but the infection recurred thereafter. The patient recovered fully after therapy was changed to tigecycline.
