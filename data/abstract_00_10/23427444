In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing is really necessary at present in medical mycology laboratories. Minimal inhibitory concentration of 210 Candida yeast strains isolated from HIV/AIDS patients with oral lesions was determined to find out susceptibility to fluconazole and amphotericin B. A CLSI's M27A2 protocol-based dilution micromethod was used. C. albicans was predominant (62.4%)followed by C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis. Regarding amphotericin B, the mode value and MIC50 were 0.125 microg/mL, which indicated the effectiveness of this drug in vitro conditions. Only C. krusei strain showed a minimal inhibitory concentration over 1 microg/mL. 8.1% of strains were resistent to fluconazole whereas 8.1% was dose-depending susceptible. The less susceptible species were C. krusei and C. glabrata. The achieved results laid the foundations for wider studies to be made in the Cuban context and indicated the need of keeping surveillance on the behaviour of clinical yeast isolates to antifungal drugs.
