In the following, the conclusion reached by four expert working groups as regarding the aspect of risk assessment in the risk analysis process on antimicrobial resistance is outlined. Playing a central role is the procedure, which was endorsed by the FAO/WHO CODEX Alimentarius Commission in 1999, entailing hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment and risk characterization. Scientific observations in these four areas are subjected to evaluation. In essence, risk assessment decisions in this context are fundamental as they form the basis for risk management options, which in turn should reduce health risks posed by resistant microorganisms.
