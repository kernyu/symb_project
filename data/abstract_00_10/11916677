We investigated the role in bacterial infection of a putative ABC transporter, designated ybiT, of Erwinia chrysanthemi AC4150. The deduced sequence of this gene showed amino acid sequence similarity with other putative ABC transporters of gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as structural similarity with proteins of Streptomyces spp. involved in resistance to macrolide antibiotics. The gene contiguous to ybiT, designated as pab (putative antibiotic biosynthesis) showed sequence similarity with Pseudomonas and Streptomyces genes involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics. A ybiT mutant (BT117) was constructed by marker exchange. It retained full virulence in potato tubers and chicory leaves, but it showed reduced ability to compete in planta against the wild-type strain or against selected saprophytic bacteria. These results indicate that the ybiT gene plays a role in the in planta fitness of the bacteria.
