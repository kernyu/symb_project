The appearance and spreading of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens is a consequence of the large-scale use of antibiotics in medicine. In view of this, claims for the phage therapy were renewed: in recent studies, the natural phages and their products neutralizing various proteins, as well as the bacterial products often controlled by defective prophages (bacteriocins) were applied for treatment of bacterial infections. Constructs obtained by gene engineering are increasingly used to change some bacteriophage: properties to expand the spectrum of their lytic activity and to eliminate therapeutic drawbacks of some natural phages. In this review, the problem of phage therapy is discussed in general with respect to bacteriophage properties, their genetics, structure, evolution, taking into account long-term experience of the author in the field of bacteriophage genetics. Note that the general concept of phage therapy should be developed to ensure long-term, efficient and harmless phage therapy.
