Human influenza viruses isolated from Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) and South East Asia were analysed to determine their sensitivity to the NA inhibitor drugs, zanamivir and oseltamivir. A total of 532 strains isolated between 1998 and 2002 were tested using a fluorescence-based assay to measure the relative inhibition of NA activity over a range of drug concentrations. Based on median IC50 values, influenza A viruses (with neuraminidase subtypes N1 and N2) were more sensitive to both the NA inhibitors than were influenza B strains. Influenza A viruses with a N1 subtype and influenza B strains both demonstrated a greater sensitivity to zanamivir than to oseltamivir carboxylate, whereas influenza A strains with a N2 subtype were more susceptible to oseltamivir carboxylate. For each of the neuraminidase types, IC50 values for viruses from Australasia and South East Asia were found to be comparable. Based on the data prior to and following the licensing of the drugs into the respective regions, the use of the NA inhibitors did not appear to have a significant impact on the susceptibility of the viruses tested to zanamivir or oseltamivir carboxylate.
