The in silico identification of a beta-defensin-like peptide sequence (omBD-1) in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchuss mykiss) database of salmonid EST is reported here. We have studied the transcript expression of this beta-defensin-like sequence in different organs and expressed the recombinant peptide in a fish cell line. Finally, we have demonstrated the in vitro antiviral activity of the recombinant trout beta-defensin-like peptide against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV), one of the most devastating viruses for worldwide aquaculture. Thus, the resistance to VHSV infection of EPC cells transfected with pMCV 1.4-omBD-1 has been shown. Since EPC cells transfected with omBD-1 produced acid and heat stable antiviral activity and up regulation of Mx, a type I IFN-mediated mechanism of antiviral action is suggested. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing biological activity of a beta-defensin-like peptide from any fish.
