We previously reported that senescent human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) are resistant to apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2) and staurosporine. We report here that senescent HDFs are resistant to thapsigargin-induced apoptosis as well. These agonists caused the reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and in the apoptosis inhibitory protein (B-cell lymphoma) only in young HDFs but not in senescent HDFs. In addition, downregulation of Bcl-2 increased the sensitivity of senescent HDFs to apoptosis induction, suggesting the significant role of Bcl-2 in apoptosis resistance of the senescent HDFs. We further found that P-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a positive regulator of Bcl-2, decreased in stress-induced apoptosis of young HDFs but not in senescent HDFs, and that Bcl-2 was markedly reduced in CREB small interfering RNA (siRNA), transfected senescent HDFs. In addition, activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates p-CREB, significantly increased in young HDFs but not in senescent HDFs treated with H(2)O(2), staurosporine or thapsigargin. Taken together, these results suggest that failure of stress-induced downregulation of Bcl-2 underlies resistance of senescent HDFs to apoptosis.
