Multiresistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is increasingly recognized in solid organ transplant recipients. Leflunomide is a novel drug with both immunosuppressive and anti-CMV properties. Herein we report a case of a renal transplant recipient treated with leflunomide for multiresistant CMV retinitis, and provide correlation between serum and vitreous levels of leflunomide. She had stabilization of her retinitis and measurable levels of drug in her vitreous fluid and serum. These initial findings suggest that leflunomide may be useful in the treatment of CMV disease, including retinitis in patients after solid organ transplantation.
