Surgical sepsis is still too frequent (the thirteenth cause of death in the U.S.) with an estimated cost of 5-10 billion dollars. Since the early 1990s antibiotic resistance has become a serious public health problem, with a relevant increase in nosocomial gram-positive infections. The oxazolidinones, a new class of antibiotics acting on bacterial synthesis at a very early stage, were first commercialized in 1987, and linezolid was the first antibiotic in this class registered for clinical use. This new molecule has been shown to be effective in a variety of aerobic and anaerobic infections (both nosocomial and community-acquired), especially those due to gram-positive agents. Linezolid has complete bioavailability in parenteral and oral administration, is well tolerated and shows little toxicity, thus favoring a shortened hospital stay, improving the patient's quality of life and reducing social costs. Oxazolidinones may be considered the first choice in the treatment of resistant gram-positive infections.
