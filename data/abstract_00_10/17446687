The in vitro antibacterial activity of sitafloxacin using clinical isolates of Vibrio cholerae O1 was compared to other fluoroquinolones: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. Against fluoroquinolone-resistant O1 strains, sitafloxacin was 4- to 16-fold more effective than other fluoroquinolones at MIC(90*). Against fluoroquinolone-susceptible O1 strains, the MIC(90) of sitafloxacin was 2- to 4-fold lower than other fluoroquinolones. This suggests sitafloxacin can be used in the treatment of infections caused by V. cholerae O1 strains including the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains.
