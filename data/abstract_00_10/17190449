Our extended chemical investigation of the crude MeOH-CHCl3 extract of the gorgonian octocoral Briareum polyanthes from Puerto Rico has led to the isolation of three eunicellin-type diterpenoids, 1-3, along with five (4-8) diterpenoids of the asbestinane-type and one (9) of the briarane-type of polycyclized diterpenes. The structures and relative stereochemistry of the new compounds 1-9 were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis (1H NMR, 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, NOESY). The biological activity of these compounds against pathogenic microbes responsible for various human infectious diseases was investigated. In addition, new data recorded for four known asbestinin diterpenes also isolated during this investigation and further analysis through chemical reactions have prompted us to revise our original structural assignments for these compounds.
