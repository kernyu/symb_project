Aminoglycoside-coenzyme A conjugates are challenging synthetic targets because of the wealth of functional groups and high polarity of the starting materials. We previously reported a one-pot synthesis of amide-linked aminoglycoside-CoA bisubstrates. These molecules are nanomolar inhibitors of aminoglycoside N-6'-acetyltransferase Ii (AAC(6')-Ii), an important enzyme involved in bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. We report here the synthesis and biological activity of five new aminoglycoside-CoA bisubstrates containing sulfonamide, sulfoxide, or sulfone groups. Interestingly, the sulfonamide-linked bisubstrate, which was expected to best mimic the tetrahedral intermediate, does not show improved inhibition when compared with amide-linked bisubstrates. On the other hand, most of the sulfone- and sulfoxide-containing bisubstrates prepared are nanomolar inhibitors of AAC(6')-Ii.
