BACKGROUND: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and ambroxol (AMB) have recently been proposed as possible therapeutic agents in the treatment of pulmonary disorders. IL-12 plays an important role in host resistance to infection and the development of Th-1 cells. In contrast, IL-10 is involved in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of NAC and AMB on secretions of IL-12 and IL-10 from human alveolar macrophages. METHODS: Alveolar macrophages were obtained from 7 healthy nonsmokers by bronchoalveolar lavage. The cells were first incubated with either NAC or AMB for 2 h and then cultured in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) solution for 24 h. IL-12 and IL-10 secretions were measured by ELISA. RESULT: Both NAC and AMB enhanced LPS-induced secretion of IL-12. NAC also enhanced LPS-induced IL-10 secretion, while AMB did not. The ratio IL-12/IL-10 secretion was increased by AMB, but NAC did not affect it. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that NAC enhances inflammatory and immune responses and prevents excessive responses reciprocally, through keeping local balance of IL-12 and IL-10 production in alveolar macrophages at inflammatory sites of bacterial pneumonia. AMB appears to strengthen inflammatory responses and cell-mediated immunity, facilitating the development of Th-1 cells, through shifting the local balance to IL-12 dominance.
