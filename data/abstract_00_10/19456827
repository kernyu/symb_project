Among 3904 meningococcal isolates collected between October 2002 and June 2007 by the French Meningococcal Reference Centre, eight (0.20%) were resistant to rifampicin (Rif-R; MIC >1 mg/L) and 27 (0.69%) were intermediate-resistant to rifampicin (Rif-I; MICs between 0.38 mg/L and 1 mg/L) according to the E-test method. The MICs determined by agar dilution were lower, eliminating the E-test intermediate category. All Rif-R isolates had mutations in the rpoB gene, resulting in substitutions at or near amino acid position 552, which were absent in non-resistant isolates. These data suggest that a rifampicin clinical breakpoint of 1.0 mg/L should be adopted for Neisseria meningitidis.
