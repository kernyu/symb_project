There was studied the dependence of hard dental tissues resistance upon general and ionized calcium concentration, activity of alkaline phosphatase responsible for inorganic compounds phosphate removal. Hard dental tissues resistance depended upon lysozyme content in saliva. According to the results received the general and ionized calcium content in all species of mixed saliva raised to the normal values during the study execution. The alkaline phosphatase activity was reduced and lysozyme content was raised. Oral hygiene index in tested subjects was equal to 1.2+/-0.03 and DMF=12.0+/-0.3 before the study beginning; after the study DMF index did not change as well as its component D (3%) that could be interpreted that during 1 year test period carious activity in vegetarians did not change. During examination at the site of active caries pigmented substitutive dentin was detected that testified to the process development stoppage.
