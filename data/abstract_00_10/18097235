In addition to development or selection of resistance, failure to continuously suppress HIV-1 production while still using initially effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may result from super-infection with a drug-resistant strain. Both transmission of drug resistant HIV and super-infection have been demonstrated. We analysed HIV pol genes obtained before start of initially successful cART and during failure while still on cART in 101 patients. Difference in precART and cART failure sequences were explained by evolution and not by super-infection.
