IFN-alpha is commonly used for biotherapy of neuroendocrine carcinomas. However, its antitumor efficacy is often limited due to IFN resistance. In this study, we evaluate the role of suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1) in modulating the effects of type I IFNs (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) in human neuroendocrine BON1 and CM tumor cells. In both cell lines, type I IFNs activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and significantly decreased cell viability. However, the effects of IFN-beta were significantly more pronounced than those of IFN-alpha and involved the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway as shown by cleavage of caspase-8, Bid, and caspase-9. Stable overexpression of SOCS1 completely abolished the apoptotic effects of both type I IFNs. In contrast, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of SOCS1 resulted in strongly enhanced type I IFN signaling as shown by increased and prolonged STAT phosphorylation and stronger induction of apoptosis. Silencing of SOCS1 was associated with down-regulation of basal Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and up-regulation of basal Bak and Bax, suggesting that reduced SOCS1 expression might lower the threshold of susceptibility to type I IFN-mediated apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of antiapoptotic to proapoptotic molecules. In summary, our results indicate an important role of SOCS1 in IFN resistance of neuroendocrine tumor cells, mediated through negative regulation of type I IFN-induced Jak/STAT signaling. Knocking down SOCS1 by siRNA is a promising new approach to enhance the therapeutic potency of type I IFNs in neuroendocrine tumors.
