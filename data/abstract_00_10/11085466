To evaluate the efficacy with which recommendations of means to avoid the spread of anthelmintic resistance in parasitic nematode populations are communicated to farmers on dairy goat farms in France, a questionnaire survey was undertaken on their use of antiparasitic drugs. Information was collected from 73 farms in two main areas of dairy goat production. The data referred to three years. Anthelmintics were used in 69 farms, the mean number of treatments per year being 2.74. Changing the drug from one year to another was not practised. Moreover, of the 58 farms using two or more treatments per year, only 37% used anthelmintics from different classes in the lactation and drying-off periods. Benzimidazoles and probenzimidazoles were given in all except two farms and these substances represented more than 80% of all the treatments. Levamisole/pyrantel or avermectins were used in 15% and 27% of the farms, respectively. Double the ovine dose, as recommended in goats to ensure efficacy of benzimidazoles, was applied in 55% of the farms. In addition, in all the flocks, the substances were given on the basis of a mean estimated live weight and not by reference to the heaviest animal. These results indicate that errors in the use of anthelmintics are still frequent in dairy goat farms in France, with probable consequences for the spread of anthelmintic resistance in the populations of parasites.
