The clinical picture in pyoderma gangrenosum varies but a typical medical history with resistance to antimicrobial treatment and worsening or first manifestation of disease because of surgical procedures are indications of this diagnosis. We describe the course of a woman patient who had a pyoderma gangrenosum for more than 1.5 years. After confirming the diagnosis an immunomodulating therapy was initiated until complete remission of the ulcers. Differential diagnosis and different clinicopathologic forms of pyoderma gangrenosum are discussed and an overview of the association with internal diseases is provided.
