Peptide deformylase (PDF) is a prokaryotic metalloenzyme that is essential for bacterial growth but is not required by mammalian cells. Thus, it represents a selective and promising target for the development of new antibacterial agents. Since deformylase inhibitors have yet to be used clinically as antibacterial drugs, compounds targeting this enzyme should avoid cross-resistance with currently used antibacterial agents. The PDF enzyme is a ferrous ion-containing metallohydrolase, but a nickel-containing surrogate is routinely used in the laboratory for testing inhibitors due to its better stability. Enzymes from several bacterial species have been cloned and both their three-dimensional structures and co-crystal structures with bound inhibitor have been determined. As a metallo enzyme, PDF lends itself to the well-precedented mechanism-based rational drug design approach. Using structural and mechanistic information together with high throughput screening, several types of potent PDF inhibitors have been identified. PDF inhibitors identified to date share a common structural feature of a "chelator + peptidomimetic" scaffold. Although compounds with many different chelators inhibit the cell free enzyme, only compounds containing hydroxamic acid or N-formyl hydroxylamine exhibit appreciable antibacterial activity. Several lead inhibitors have demonstrated in vivo efficacy and an excellent safety profile. Two PDF inhibitors, VIC-104959 (LBM415) and BB-83698, have progressed to Phase I clinical trials. In this review, different PDF inhibitors are compared and their biological activities are discussed. Structure-activity relationships have been established and the implications of this work in the design of future PDF inhibitors are considered.
