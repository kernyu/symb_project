The effects on cloned DNA fragment carrying an actinomycin resistance determinant on physiological processes in streptomyces strains with various potencies in producing this antibiotic, their inactive mutants, and model strain of Streptomyces lividans 66 were studied. This fragment was shown to modulate bacterial resistance to actinomycin and biosynthesis of antibiotics.
