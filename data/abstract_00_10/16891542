We report the first documented case of bacteremia caused by Asaia bogorensis in a young patient with a history of intravenous-drug abuse. A. bogorensis was identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The isolate was exceptionally resistant to almost all antibiotics that are routinely tested for gram-negative rods but was susceptible to netilmicin, gentamicin, and doxycycline.
