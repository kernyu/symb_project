The alternative sigma factor SigF of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been characterized in detail as a general-stress, stationary-phase sigma factor involved in the virulence of the bacterium. While a homologous gene has been annotated in the genome of the fast-growing Mycobacterium smegmatis, little experimental evidence is available on the function of this gene. Here, we demonstrate that SigF of M. smegmatis is required for resistance to hydrogen peroxide, heat shock and acidic pH, but not for survival in human neutrophils. No difference in sensitivity to isoniazid was observed between the wild-type strain and the DeltasigF mutant, suggesting that SigF-mediated resistance to hydrogen peroxide was via a pathway independent of KatG or AhpC. RT-PCR and 5'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) analyses showed that sigF of M. smegmatis was co-transcribed with rsbW (thought to encode an anti-sigma factor for SigF) and MSMEG_1802 (unknown function) and was expressed from two promoters, one upstream of MSMEG_1802 and the second upstream of rsbW. Analysis of transcriptional lacZ fusion constructs in the sigF-deletion background revealed that the MSMEG_1802 promoter was dependent on SigF for expression. Moreover, MSMEG_1802-lacZ was induced twofold upon entry into stationary phase, while exposure of exponentially growing cultures to various stress conditions (e.g. heat, cold, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide or different pH values) did not lead to induction of MSMEG_1802-lacZ. Expression of rsbW-lacZ was independent of SigF and remained constant throughout the growth cycle and under various stress conditions unless the bacteria were challenged with d-cycloserine.
