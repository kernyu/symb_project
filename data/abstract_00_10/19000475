Two new antiretroviral drugs belonging to a new drug family have recently been marketed in Spain. These are maraviroc (CCR5 correceptor inhibitor) and raltegravir (integrase inhibitor). These have the advantage of not presenting crossed resistance with other previously administered antiretroviral drugs, converting them into the cornerstone of the rescue treatment in the patient infected by a multiresistant viral strain. The scientific evidence available on these two drugs is reviewed in this work and its indications in the HIV infected patient are discussed.
