Cefditoren pivoxil (Spectracef, Meiact) is a third-generation oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against pathogens, including both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. Cefditoren pivoxil is approved for use in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute maxillary sinusitis, acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (indications may differ between countries). In clinical trials in adults and adolescents, cefditoren pivoxil demonstrated good clinical and bacteriological efficacy in AECB, CAP, acute maxillary sinusitis, acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections and was generally well tolerated. Thus, cefditoren pivoxil is a good option for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with specific respiratory tract or skin infections, particularly if there is concern about Streptococcus pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to penicillin, or beta-lactamase-mediated resistance among the common community-acquired pathogens.
