To assess prevalence of nelfinavir resistance mutations in children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, sequencing of protease gene from plasma of 53 human immunodeficiency virus-infected children was performed. The prevalence of L90M was similar to that of D30N. There was a significant correlation with a higher viral load and lower age and the occurrence of L90M. These findings suggest differential molecular age- and viral load-related routes for nelfinavir resistance.
