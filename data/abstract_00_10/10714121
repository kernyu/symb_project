BACKGROUND: Recently, increasing antibiotic resistance has been observed among gram-positive bacteria. However, only few isolates were found to be resistant against glycopeptides. Therefore, internationally accepted guidelines recommend a restricted use of vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics in order to prevent the development of resistance against these clinically important antibiotics. In many countries, the hospital pharmacies play a key role in control and reinforcement of antibiotic formulary restrictions. In Germany, however, the hospital pharmacies usually do not take over such control functions, and most wards keep a stock of regularly used drugs including antibiotics, which makes reinforcement of restrictions difficult. METHODS: In an attempt to achieve a restriction of vancomycin use, the pharmacy of our university hospital was advised to deliver vancomycin to the wards only on request with a special order form signed by an attending, individually for every patient who should receive vancomycin. The efficacy of this restriction measure was evaluated in 3-month periods before and after the restriction became effective. RESULTS: Hospitalwide, this led to a 20.1% reduction of i.v. vancomycin and an 85.7% reduction of oral vancomycin use per 1000 patient days. If the hematology/oncology units were not considered, the reduction of i.v. vancomycin use was 41.8%, and the total use after the restriction 24.2 g per 1000 patient days. Microbiology results which justified the use of vancomycin decreased by 8.3% (10.9% hematology/oncology units not considered) between the 2 observation periods. Assuming a 7-day mean course of i.v. vancomycin therapy, the empirical use of i.v. vancomycin decreased from 39.9% to 8% after the restriction had been instituted. CONCLUSION: Allowing only experienced physicians (attendings) to decide on the use of vancomycin therapy, proved in our experience to be an effective measure to reduce unnecessary vancomycin use.
