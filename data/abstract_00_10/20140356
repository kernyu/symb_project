Enterococci are part of the endogenous flora of human beings, are naturally resistant to several classes of antimicrobials, and are able to acquire resistance with relative ease. Currently the vancomycin-resistant enterococci are spread all over the world and treatment options for infections caused by it are often extremely limited. We assessed 193 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from four different hospitals in Porto Alegre for their susceptibility to fosfomycin using the E-test and agar diffusion. Fosfomycin proved to be active in vitro against the great majority of isolates, indicating that it is a valid option in the treatment of these infections.
