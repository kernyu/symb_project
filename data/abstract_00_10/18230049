The multi drug resistant gram negative bacteria especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species are on the rise. The major defense in these bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics is production of metallo beta lactamases (MBLs) which degrade this group of antibiotics including carbapenems. Till now five main types of MBLs have been described throughout the World--IMP, VIM, SPM, GIM and SIM. A new MBL has been recently reported in P. aeruginosa from Australia--bla AIM-1. There are no standard guidelines by CLSI for detection of these enzymes in various bacteria. A number of phenotypic tests based on different beta lactam-inhibitor combinations are being evaluated and used for routine testing. Regarding the treatment options--colistin, various antibiotic combinations and a few novel antibiotics are being tried and evaluated. Prevention is based on age old practices of strict infection control and judicious use of antibiotics.
