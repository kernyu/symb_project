The first isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistant to fluoroquinolones in Argentina were reported in 2000. Since January 2005 to June 2007 Neisseria gonorrhoeae was studied in 595 men who have sex with men (MSM) and 571 heterosexual men. The gonorrhea prevalence in MSM and heterosexual men was 0.091(91/1000) and the Neisseria gonorrhoeae ciprofloxacin resistant (CRNG) was 20% in MSM and 3.8% in heterosexual men (p: 0.0416). Thirteen out of 106 isolates from 11 MSM and 2 heterosexual men were CRNG. Six out of eleven MSM had urethritis, one also carried Neisseria gonorrhoeae in rectum and 5 patients were asymptomatic carriers (rectum 2, pharynx 2, urethra 1). No epidemiological relation was found among the patients. Two heterosexual men had urethritis. The 8 symptomatic men were treated with ciprofloxacin but treatment failed in all of them. These patients and the asymptomatic ones were treated with ceftriaxone, 500 mg IM. The post treatment microbiological controls were negative. The CRNG isolates had ciprofloxacin MIC between 2 and 32 (microg/ml), all were negative to penicillinase, 4 out of 13 were chromosomally resistant to penicillin (MIC: 1 microg/ml). The MICs (microg/ml) ranges for several antimicrobial agents were: penicillin: 0.016-1; tetracycline: 0.125-2; ceftriaxone: 0.004-0.008; erythromycin: 0.032-2; azithromycin: 0.032-0.5; spectinomycin: 8-32. Due to the high level of ciprofloxacin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolated from MSM in our hospital, another antimicrobial agent for empirical therapy should be used in these patients.
