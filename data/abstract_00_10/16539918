INTRODUCTION: The most important causes of the current tuberculosis pandemic are poverty, HIV infection, drug resistance, and the spread of infection by patients with latent tuberculosis infection. In industrialized countries, the main reasons for the increase of this disease are immigration from developing countries and the lack of effective surveillance programs. The situation of children is even more serious as they are more vulnerable to the disease than adults. The children most at risk are those who live with adults at risk for tuberculosis, immigrant children, and adoptees from developing countries. Although children are bacilliferous only exceptionally, the appropriate management of bacilliferous tuberculosis exposure and latent tuberculosis infection in children contributes to the creation of close surveillance of nuclear families and rigorous study of contacts. Moreover, it could prevent serious forms of the disease, which are more frequent in children. OBJECTIVE: The principal objective of this second consensus document of the Spanish Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases (Sociedad Espanola de Infectologia Pediatrica [SEIP]) is to unify the criteria for the treatment of tuberculosis exposure and latent tuberculosis infection in children. A further aim is to increase awareness of the need for strict detection measures in high-risk populations among health authorities.
