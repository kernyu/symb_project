The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of resistance to different antibiotics in 109 clinical strains of Enterococcus isolated consecutively in hospital over a four-month period in 2002. The strains were identified by species using the semiautomatic system Microscan walk away 40 (Dade Behring) and the API20 STREP system (Biomerieux). Three different methods for the susceptibility study were used: Sensititre, E-test and disc diffusion. The percentage of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolated was 92% and 8%, respectively. The following resistance to Enterococcus faecalis was detected: erythromycin (53%), telithromycin (36%), penicillin (2%), ampicillin (1%), vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid (0%), high level resistance to streptomycin (51%) and gentamicin (32%). A high percentage of strains resistant to penicillin and ampicillin was detected in E. faecium (six of nine strains). For two species, high susceptibility to linezolid and glycopeptides was found.
