This study investigated the in vitro potency of the novel quinolone agent gemifloxacin (SB-265805), in comparison with other quionolones, beta-lactams, macrolides and trimethoprim- sulphamethoxazole, against a panel of common respiratory pathogens. This panel comprised recent clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 347), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 256) and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 184). Overall, the quinolones were highly active against H. influenzae and were the most potent agents against M. catarrhalis. Gemifloxacin was the most potent quinolone tested against all three species and was four- to 512-fold more potent against pneumococci than trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, gentamicin, cefuroxime, penicillin, ampicillin, clarithromycin, azithromycin or trimethoprim- sulphamethoxazole. Against 19 ofloxacin-intermediate and 52 ofloxacin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, gemifloxacin retained activity, and was the only agent tested with MICs of < or =0.5 mg/L. The results of this study demonstrate the excellent in vitro antibacterial activity of gemifloxacin against pathogens commonly associated with respiratory tract infections and suggest that gemifloxacin has significant potential in the treatment of such infections, including those caused by pneumococci considered resistant to other quinolones.
