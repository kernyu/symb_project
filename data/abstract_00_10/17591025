BACKGROUND: Adefovir dipivoxil is a nucleotide prodrug approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. During clinical trials, ADV-associated mutations were observed in 0, 3, 11, 18 and 29% of patients after 48, 96, 144, 192 and 240 weeks of therapy, respectively. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase mutations associated with virological breakthrough to ADV include rtA181V and rtN236T, which occur alone or in combination. The rtA181T mutation has also been observed at low frequency, alone or in combination with rtN236T. METHODS: To investigate the in vitro activity of adefovir and other anti-HBV agents against these mutants, we generated five stable cell lines that each expressed one of the following HBV mutants: rtN236T, rtA181V, rtA181V + rtN236T, rtA181T + rtN236T and rtA181T. Using these cell lines, we quantified in vitro changes in drug susceptibility for eight nucleotide/nucleoside analogues. RESULTS: The rtN236T mutant had 7-fold resistance to adefovir but remained sensitive to entecavir, telbivudine and torcitabine (53.2-fold reduced susceptibility). The A181V mutant had 4.3-fold resistance to adefovir and had reduced susceptibility to multiple other agents ranging from 3.2-fold (tenofovir) to >191-fold (clevudine). The A181V + rtN236T double mutant was the most highly resistant showing 18-fold resistance to adefovir and higher levels of resistance to other tested drugs with the exception of tenofovir (10-fold reduced susceptibility). Our results and preliminary clinical data suggest that patients with rtN236T or rtA181V remain susceptible to tenofovir, entecavir and lamivudine. Further clinical data are necessary to precisely define in vitro cutoffs indicative of clinically-relevant resistance, particularly for drugs in development such as emtricitabine, telbivudine, torcitabine and clevudine.
