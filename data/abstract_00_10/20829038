Further investigation of the recently reported piperidine-4-yl-aminopyrimidine class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) has been carried out. Thus, preparation of a series of N-phenyl piperidine analogs resulted in the identification of 3-carboxamides as a particularly active series. Analogs such as 28 and 40 are very potent versus wild-type HIV-1 and a broad range of NNRTI-resistant mutant viruses. Synthesis, structure-activity relationship (SAR), clearance data, and crystallographic evidence for the binding motif are discussed.
