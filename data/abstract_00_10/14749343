OBJECTIVES: Some manifestations of candidiasis are associated with the formation of biofilms on inert or biological surfaces and the intrinsic resistance of Candida albicans biofilms to the most commonly used antifungal agents has been demonstrated. In this study, we report on the influence of the growth of C. albicans in medium containing a sub-inhibitory concentration (MIC/2) of caspofungin, on subsequent fungal adherence to plastic coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. METHODS: Eleven strains of C. albicans were studied: six strains were susceptible to fluconazole in vitro and five strains were resistant to this antifungal agent. RESULTS: Caspofungin induced a decrease in the adherence of all the tested strains that were susceptible to fluconazole but induced a decrease in the adherence of only 60% of the fluconazole-resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the anti-adherent activity of caspofungin but indicated a reduced effect in the case of in vitro fluconazole resistance. These results indicated a possible relationship between the efficiency of caspofungin to inhibit the first step of the development of C. albicans biofilm and the resistance of C. albicans to fluconazole in vitro.
