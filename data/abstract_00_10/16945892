OBJECTIVE: Overuse of antimicrobial agents is closely related to an increase in bacterial resistance. A sound knowledge of appropriate prescribing of antimicrobials among health professionals is thus critical in combating the resistance. The objectives of this study were to assess the rationale for and patterns of antimicrobial prescriptions by general dental practitioners in Yemen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire containing 65 closed questions was used for this cross-sectional study and distributed to 280 dentists in the three major governorates in Yemen. The anonymously completed questionnaires sought answers to demographic questions and to questions on the therapeutic and prophylactic use of antimicrobial agents in dentistry. Correct and incorrect answers were defined according to information available in the current authoritative literature. Each correct answer was given a score of 1 while an incorrect answer scored 0. Thus, the total score had an attainable range from 0 to 65. Frequencies, means, and associations were assessed statistically. RESULTS: Out of 181 collected forms (response rate 64.6%), 150 were appropriately completed and used for data analyses. Penicillins were the most frequently prescribed drugs (72%), followed by spiramycin (10%). It was found that up to 84% of practitioners were likely to prescribe an antimicrobial agent when there was no clinical indication for such a medication. Many respondents (70%) would consider antibiotics for at least one of the given non-clinical factors. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that dental practitioners in Yemen lack uniformity in the rationale for appropriate prescribing of antimicrobials to their patients. Consequently, to reduce overuse, there is an urgent need for the dental community in the country to be informed about evidence-based guidelines and the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents in clinical dental practice.
