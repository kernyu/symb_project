OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of the CmeABC efflux pump to the emergence of fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant mutants in Campylobacter jejuni under various levels of selection pressure. METHODS: The frequency of emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants was measured in wild-type C. jejuni NCTC 11168 and its isogenic cmeB mutant and cmeR mutant (overexpressing cmeABC) using plates containing various concentrations of ciprofloxacin. Representative ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants were selected for gyrA sequence analysis and MIC determination. Accumulation of ciprofloxacin in Campylobacter cells was measured using spectrofluorometry. RESULTS: Mutation of cmeB drastically reduced the frequency of emergence of FQ-resistant mutants at 10x and 32x the MIC of ciprofloxacin, while the cmeR mutant displayed an approximately 17-fold increase in the frequency of emergence of the mutants at 32x the MIC when compared with the wild-type strain. Various point mutations occurred in gyrA in the FQ-resistant mutants selected at 5x and 10x the MIC, while the Thr-86-->Ile mutation was predominant in the mutants selected at 32x the MIC. The Thr-86-->Ile change conferred a high-level resistance to FQs, but other mutations only conferred an intermediate-level FQ resistance. In contrast, all types of gyrA mutations in the CmeABC-overexpressed background conferred high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin. Overexpression of cmeABC significantly reduced the amount of ciprofloxacin accumulated within bacterial cells. CONCLUSIONS: CmeABC is not only important for maintaining high-level resistance to FQs but also contributes significantly to the emergence of FQ-resistant mutants. Inhibition of this efflux pump may prevent the emergence of clinically relevant FQ-resistant Campylobacter mutants.
