Postoperative wounds infections due to surgical intervention of laryngeal cancer are serious therapeutic problem. This process led to the necrosis of surrounding tissues and in consequence prolongs the wounds healing and cause longer hospitalisation, delay of vocal rehabilitation and cause chronic inflammation of trachea and bronchi. We investigated a cause of patient after surgical intervention. Postoperative wound as well as upper respiratory tracts of this patient were colonized by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The following symptoms of in inflammation were noticed: subfebrile condition, muscles and joints pain, excessive secretion of mucus in respiratory tracts and malaise. Patient was treated many times (repeatedly) with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics ambulatory and during hospitalisation. The susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics to isolated MRSA strain was established. The effective therapy occurred using combine of rifampicin and co-trimoxasole. The patient status was radically improved. Patient after therapy was monitored microbiologically for a several month and in clinical material isolated from him did not found MRSA.
