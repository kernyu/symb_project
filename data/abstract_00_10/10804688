AIM: To assess the efficacy of oral microemulsion cyclosporin as the initial treatment of active ulcerative colitis refractory to steroid therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The evolution of five patients treated with a dose of 5 mg/kg/day was analyzed. RESULTS: Oral microemulsion cyclosporin controlled acute attacks of the disease and led to remission during the 3 months of treatment in four of the five patients. Average hospital stay was 5.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Oral microemulsion cyclosporin is an effective treatment in ulcerative colitis. Its administration is simple, the use of venous catheters is avoided and it may reduce mean hospital stay.
