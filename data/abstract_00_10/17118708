The viability of small-ruminant enterprises is under threat in some locations because anthelmintic resistance continues to increase in prevalence and severity. Despite this, no new anthelmintic group has been developed for many years, and animal health companies seem unconvinced of the commercial justification for new compounds for the ruminant market. It is now argued, however, that market conditions are becoming favourable because of increases in multiple-drug resistance in nematodes of ruminants and other hosts and because few non-chemical options exist. A new anthelmintic is urgently needed and will find ready acceptance in an increasing market, and with better knowledge of resistance management, greater product longevity can be achieved.
