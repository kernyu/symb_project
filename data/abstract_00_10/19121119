The plant growth-promoting fungus (PGPF), Phoma sp. GS8-3, isolated from a zoysia grass rhizosphere, is capable of protecting cucumber plants against virulent pathogens. This fungus was investigated in terms of the underlying mechanisms and ability to elicit systemic resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Root treatment of Arabidopsis plants with a culture filtrate (CF) from Phoma sp. GS8-3 elicited systemic resistance against the bacterial speck pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst), with restricted disease development and inhibited pathogen proliferation. Pathway-specific mutant plants, such as jar1 (jasmonic acid insensitive) and ein2 (ethylene insensitive), and transgenic NahG plants (impaired in salicylate signalling) were protected after application of the CF, demonstrating that these pathways are dispensable (at least individually) in CF-mediated resistance. Similarly, NPR1 interference in npr1 mutants had no effect on CF-induced resistance. Gene expression studies revealed that CF treatment stimulated the systemic expression of both the SA-inducible PR-1 and JA/ET-inducible PDF1.2 genes. However, pathogenic challenge to CF-treated plants was associated with potentiated expression of the PR-1 gene and down-regulated expression of the PDF1.2 gene. The observed down-regulation of the PDF1.2 gene in CF-treated plants indicates that there may be cross-talk between SA- and JA/ET-dependent signalling pathways during the pathogenic infection process. In conclusion, our data suggest that CF of Phoma sp. GS8-3 induces resistance in Arabidopsis in a manner where SA and JA/ET may play a role in defence signalling.
