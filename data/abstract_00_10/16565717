The blood-brain barrier possesses active transporters carrying brain-permeable xenobiotics back into the blood against concentration gradients. We demonstrate that multidrug resistance transporter (Mdr)-1 is upregulated on capillary endothelium after focal cerebral ischemia; moreover, Mdr-1 deactivation by pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockout preferably enhances the accumulation and efficacy of two neuroprotectants known as Mdr-1 substrates in the ischemic brain. We predict that Mdr-1 inhibition may greatly facilitate neuroprotective therapies.
