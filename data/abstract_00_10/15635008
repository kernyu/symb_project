Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotyping assays have come to be widely used for monitoring antiretroviral drug resistance. We report a case in which primer-template mismatches during nested PCR-based amplification biased the composition of the original viral population in the sample, magnifying a distinct minority HIV-1 population. This observation might help to explain some unexpected HIV-1 genotypes.
