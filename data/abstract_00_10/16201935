To obtain better insights into the possible exchange of resistance genes between human and animal streptococci, the sequences of the erm (B) genes of streptococcal isolates from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, chickens, and calves were compared. Identical erm (B) gene sequences were present in strains from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, and calves. During in vitro mating experiments, the erm (B) gene was exchanged between porcine Streptococcus suis and human S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. oralis strains. The presence of different tetracycline resistance genes and the int Tn 1545 gene was determined in animal streptococci carrying the erm (B) gene. Although tet(M) and int Tn 1545 genes were detected in 24% of the porcine and pork carcass streptococcal strains, the tet(O) gene was the predominant tetracycline resistance gene in these strains (81%). The latter gene was co-transferred with the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis strains to human streptococci in the mating experiments. These results show that, identical erm (B) gene sequences were present in animal and human streptococci and that transfer of the erm (B) gene from porcine S. suis to human streptococci and vice versa is possible, but probably occurs at a low frequency.
