Thirty-five Bacteroides fragilis clinical isolates with varying susceptibility to meropenem were analysed with a prototype of a double-ended Etest strip containing meropenem +/- EDTA, designed for the detection of the CfiA metallo-beta-lactamase. Phenotypic results obtained with this new Etest strip were related to the genotype and compared to the results of the Etest containing imipenem +/- EDTA. Whereas the Etest with imipenem +/- EDTA only allowed detection of isolates with high-level resistance (both MICs of imipenem and meropenem >32 mg/L), reflecting the possible underestimation of CfiA prevalence in B. fragilis, the Etest with meropenem +/- EDTA proved to be more accurate, particularly for isolates with low-level carbapenem resistance, suggesting its potential for broader detection of CfiA production.
