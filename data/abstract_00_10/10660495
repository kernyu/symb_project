Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) have been used to examine chlorhexidine diacetate (CHA)-sensitive and -resistant isolates of Pseudomonas stutzeri and to determine the effects of CHA on the cells. Significant differences were observed in the structure, size and elemental composition of CHA-sensitive and -resistant cells. Treatment with CHA produced considerably greater changes in CHA-sensitive cells, with widespread peeling of the outer membrane, a substantial loss of cytoplasmic electron-dense material and extensive lysis. Cells from the resistant isolates showed no blebbing of the outer membrane and no structural damage. X-ray mapping confirmed the difference in CHA uptake between CHA-sensitive and CHA-resistant cells. It is proposed that changes in the outer membrane form a major mechanism of resistance to CHA in P. stutzeri.
