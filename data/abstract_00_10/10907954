BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine therapy has not been widely assessed in the treatment of hematological malignancies. We have examined the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine in patients with relapsed or resistant lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gemcitabine (1 g/m2) was given weekly for 7 consecutive weeks, followed by a week off treatment. The drug was then given for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a week off treatment; this regimen was continued until disease progression or drug intolerance. Fifteen patients have enrolled. Most have been extensively pre-treated for advanced diffuse large-cell or mantle-cell lymphoma. RESULTS: The drug was well tolerated; no patient suffered treatment-related sepsis, hemorrhage or death. Non-hematopoietic toxicity led to discontinuation of gemcitabine therapy in two patients. Dose reductions or delays were required for about two-thirds of treatments. Of 13 evaluable patients, one had a complete response, 3 a partial response, 3 stable disease, and 6 disease progression. After 6 infusions of gemcitabine, a patient with advanced Hodgkin's disease has had a complete remission lasting 21 months. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine has substantial activity and acceptable toxicity in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced lymphoma. Further study is warranted.
