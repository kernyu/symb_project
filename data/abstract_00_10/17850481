Salmonella enterica is a facultative intracellular pathogen that replicates within macrophages. The interaction of this pathogen with mammalian cells is a complex process involving hundreds of bacterial products that are sensed by and alter mammalian hosts. Numerous bacterial genes and their protein products have been identified that are required for Salmonella to resist killing by host innate immunity and to modify host processes. Many of these genes are regulated by a specific bacterial sensor, the PhoQ protein, which responds to the acidified phagosome environment. PhoQ is a sensor histidine kinase, which when activated in vivo within acidified macrophage phagosomes, regulates cell surface modifications that promote resistance to antimicrobial peptides and oxidative stress, alter the phagosome to promote intracellular survival, and reduce innate immune recognition. In this review, we discuss mechanisms by which Salmonella interacts with macrophages and focus in detail on recent reports describing the role of antimicrobial peptides and pH in PhoQ activation.
