To study the role of different DNA repair genes in the resistance of Deinococcus radiodurans to mono- and polychromatic UV radiation, wild-type strain and knockout mutants in RecA, PprA, and IrrE of D. radiodurans were irradiated with UV-C (254 nm), UV-(A + B) (280-400 nm) and UV-A (315-400 nm) radiation, and survival was monitored. The strain deficient in recA was highly sensitive to UV-C radiation compared to the wild-type, but showed no loss of resistance against irradiation with UV-(A + B) and UV-A, while pprA and irrE-deficient strains exhibited elevated sensitivity to UV-A and UV-(A + B) radiation. These results suggest that the repair of DNA double-strand breaks is essential after treatment with highly energetic UV-C radiation, whereas protection from oxidative stress may play a greater role in resistance to environmentally relevant UV radiation.
