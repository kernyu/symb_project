Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has recently become a significant pathogen in ocular and systemic disease. Both community- and nosocomial-acquired MRSA orbital cellulitis have been reported in adults. However, there exist only very few published case reports of pediatric MRSA orbital cellulitis, and it is unclear whether these infections were hospital or community acquired and if these children were immunocompromised. We report the first documented case of orbital cellulitis secondary to community-acquired MRSA in a non-immunocompromised child.
