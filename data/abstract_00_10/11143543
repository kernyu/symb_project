BACKGROUND: Doxycycline is an broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, it remains an inexpensive alternative for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections and urinary tract infections. Despite these clinical data the use of doxycycline has decreased during the last years. PHARMACOLOGY: Adverse effects and resistance to therapy are infrequent and not different to fluoroquinolones and macrolide antibiotics. Gastrointestinal and phototoxic side effects are of importance. After oral administration 75% will be absorbed and largely eliminated by the hepatic and intestinal way. Contraindications are severe liver dysfunction and treatment in childhood. CLINICAL INDICATIONS: Bacterial resistance to doxycycline has a low incidence in Germany. A therapeutic success can be expected in respiratory and urinary tract infections in about 80%. Doxycycline is the drug of choice for treating infections caused by Rickettsia, Borrelia, Ehrlichia. It shows good activity against Plasmodium falciparum as one part in a combination therapy. Daily costs of therapy are low, in oral administration DM 0.80 per day, in i.v. administration DM 22,-per day. CONCLUSION: Despite competition from new antibiotics, doxycycline can retain an important place in the treatment of many infectious diseases.
