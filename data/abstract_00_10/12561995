The present study was conducted over a period of 6 months to determine the Candida species causing candidemia in a neonatal intensive care unit and to analyse the risk factors associated with acquisition of significant fungemia. Speciation of the 19 isolated Candida spp was done by the standard techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was determined by disc diffusion method against Amphotericin B, Fluconazole, Ketoconozole and 5-Flucytosine. Candida glabrata was the most common species involved (42.1%). Other species isolated were C. tropicalis (31.6%). Calbicans (21.1%) and C.parapsilosis (5.2%). All the isolates were sensitive to Amphotericin B. Resistance to other antigungal agents was seen only in C. globrata. Significant candidemia was seen in 14/19 (72.6%) of neonates. Risk factors found to be associated with significant candidemis in these neonates included intake of multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics (p<0.0001), use of total parenteral nutrition (p<0.045) and ventilators (p<0.0001).
