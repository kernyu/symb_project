The aim of this study is to evaluate the susceptibility profile to many antifungal drugs of 95 yeast strains isolated from oral mycoses in HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients from the eastern region of Romania. The antifungal drugs tested against all strains were 5-flucytosine (5FC), amphotericin B (AMB), fluconazole (FCA) and itraconazole (ITR), using ATB fungus2 devices (bioMerieux, France). For strains isolated from HIV-positive patients, two new antifungals were tested--voriconazole (VOR) and caspofungine (CAS), using Etest strips. The significance of results (MIC values) has been evaluated according to EUCAST and CLSI recommendations. The percent of resistance varied as follow: 6.31% for 5FC, 0% for AMB, 10.52% for FCA, 20% for ITR, 0% for VOR and O% for CAS. We can observe that all strains isolated from HIV-positive patients are susceptible to VOR and CAS--new antifungal molecules recently marketed. Also, the percent of resistance to current azoles (especially ITR) is relatively high.
