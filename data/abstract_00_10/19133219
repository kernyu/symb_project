Maraviroc (MVC) is a new antagonist of the CCR5 coreceptor and is the first antiviral compound available that has a cell factor essential for HIV entry as a target. The information available from clinical studies with MVC suggests that the main cause of therapeutic failure is, more than the tropism change, the rapid selection of pre-existing strains with an affinity for CXCR4, not detected by the reference test. A recently developed tropism test with an improved sensitivity will help to detect the minority, but clinically significant, presence of strains that use CXCR4. Evidence of resistance to MVC has been shown in vivo in some patients. The mechanism of this resistance appears to be related to changes in gp120 and mainly in the V3 region which enables the virus to recognise the CCR5-co-receptor bound to the MVC molecule. From a practical point of view, standardised tests are currently unavailable to assess susceptibility to MVC, although in dose-response phenotype tests a maximum percentage inhibition (MPI) < 95% would be indicative of resistance to the compound. Similarly, although some mutations associated with resistance in V3, and other zones of gp120, have been described, this preliminary information suggests different resistance patterns and at the moment, we do not know the canonical mutations to be able to establish genotyping algorithms.
