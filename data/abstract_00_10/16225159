After the development of plasmid-mediated resistance against first-line drugs, the emergence of chromosomally-mediated quinolone resistance in typhoid fever has become a major concern. Quinolone insensitivity and treatment failures with ciprofloxacin are being increasingly reported. However, third generation cephalosporins have come as a saviour. To overcome fluoroquinolone insensitivity, higher doses with longer duration of treatment is recommended. Moreover, return of chloramphenicol and furazolidone sensitivity shown by different studies is a welcome observation.
