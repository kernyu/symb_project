Damaged DNA Binding protein 1 (DDB1) is a conserved protein and a component of multiple cellular complexes. Arabidopsis has two homologues of DDB1: DDB1A and DDB1B. In this study we examine the role of DDB1A in Arabidopsis UV tolerance and DNA repair using a DDB1A null mutant (ddb1a) and overexpression lines. DDB1A overexpression lines showed higher levels of UV-resistance than wild-type in a range of assays as well as faster DNA repair. However a significant difference between wild-type plants and ddb1a mutants was only observed immediately following UV treatment in root length and photoproduct repair assays. DDB1A and DDB1B mRNA levels increased 3 h after UV exposure and DDB1A is required for UV regulation of DDB1B and DDB2 mRNA levels. In conclusion, while DDB1A is sufficient to increase Arabidopsis UV tolerance, it is only necessary for immediate response to UV damage.
