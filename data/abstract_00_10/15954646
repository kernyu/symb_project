Exopolysaccharides /EPS/ produced by lactic acid bacteria /LAB/ play a role in the rheology and texture of fermented milks (Cerning 1990) and could also provide a new source of safe additives for use in various food products. The physical properties of EPS, such as rheology and behaviour, depend on several factors, including sugar composition, type of sugar linkages, the presence of organic or inorganic substituents, the degree of polymerization and the length of the side chains. On the other hand certain physiological properties of lactic bacteria are of particular importance in the mechanism of their probiotic functioning: metabolism leading to accumulation of organic acids and other fermentation products in the media; resistance to those metabolites; competitive assimilation of the major nutrients of the media. The significant antimicrobial effect of probiotics towards pathogens and potentially pathogenic microorganisms is outlined in this context. This study was conducted on LAB strains with experimentally established preventive effect in control of chemical carcinogenesis induced by dimethylhydrazine, heavy metals and nitrites. The present study reports the biosynthesis of EPS by strains with proved anticancer effect Lactobacillus bulgaricus LB3 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus LBs on whey-based media. A study on the action of different nitrogen sources (yeast extract and peptone) on the productivity of EPS and the rheological properties of medium was done. When whey-based medium was used the highest production of EPS was determined at 1% peptone--145 mg/g(-1). The carbohydrate substrate influenced the EPS composition. Not only the concentration but also the structure of the EPS is important for its thickening effect. The functional properties of the EPS produced could be modified by influencing the growth conditions. The influence of the different content of glucose on the fermentation process and the viscosity of the whey was performed.
