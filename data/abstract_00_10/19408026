Some of the polyketide-derived bioactive compounds contain sugars attached to the aglycone core, and these sugars often impart specific biological activity to the molecule or enhance this activity. Mycinamicin II, a 16-member macrolide antibiotic produced by Micromonospora griseorubida A11725, contains a branched lactone and two different deoxyhexose sugars, D-desosamine and D-mycinose, at the C-5 and C-21 positions, respectively. The D-mycinose biosynthesis genes, mycCI, mycCII, mycD, mycE, mycF, mydH, and mydI, present in the M. griseorubida A11725 chromosome were introduced into pSET152 under the regulation of the promoter of the apramycin-resistance gene aac(3)IV. The resulting plasmid pSETmycinose was introduced into Micromonospora rosaria IFO13697 cells, which produce the 16-membered macrolide antibiotic rosamicin containing a branched lactone and D-desosamine at the C-5 position. Although the M. rosaria TPMA0001 transconjugant exhibited low rosamicin productivity, two new compounds, IZI and IZII, were detected in the ethylacetate extract from the culture broth. IZI was identified as a mycinosyl rosamicin derivative, 23-O-mycinosyl-20-deoxo-20-dihydro-12,13-deepoxyrosamicin (MW 741), which has previously been synthesized by a bioconversion technique. This is the first report on production of mycinosyl rosamicin-derivatives by a engineered biosynthesis approach. The integration site PhiC31attB was identified on M. rosaria IFO13697 chromosome, and the site lay within an ORF coding a pirin homolog protein. The pSETmycinose could be useful for stimulating the production of "unnatural" natural mycinosyl compounds by various actinomycete strains using the bacteriophage PhiC31 att/int system.
