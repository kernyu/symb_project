OBJECTIVE: The widespread use of fluoroquinolone otic drops has resulted in the emergence and subsequent increase of fluoroquinolone resistance, at rates greater than anticipated. To evaluate the patients with recurrent otorrhea that were unresponsive to topical ciprofloxacin. METHODS: Seventeen pediatric patients who were treated with refractory otorrhea between 2000 and 2001 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: All patients had ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas on culture and sensitivity test. Ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas from these patients were multidrug resistant. Imipenem was the most sensitive antibiotic agent, followed by amikacin. Most patients were treated with intramuscular amikacin and two patients were treated with intravenous imipenem. CONCLUSION: In our series, resistance to cirpfloxacin in patients with otitis media is increasing recently. Culture and antibiotic sensitivity test may help guide management. Continuous surveillance is necessary to monitor antibiotic resistance and to guide antibacterial therapy.
