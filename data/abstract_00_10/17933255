Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as an important pathogen in community-acquired and nosocomial infections. The unique bactericidal action of mupirocin makes it one of the few antibiotics still effective against MRSA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mupirocin resistance in MRSA strains isolated from wound infections of in- and out-patients of two distinct hospitals located in Ankara and Istanbul. A total of 143 MRSA strains were included in the study. Mupirocin resistance was investigated by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and the results were confirmed by determination of the MIC values by E-test strips. Among 143 MRSA isolates, mupirocin resistance was detected by none of the methods, and overall mupirocin sensitivity was detected as 100 percent. The majority of mupirocin resistant MRSA is isolated from wound infections. The aetiology mostly depends on the increased topical use of the agent. The method used in the detection of mupirocin resistance and interpretation of the results are important parameters in the determination of mupirocin resistance in MRSA strains. Since there was no resistant strain among 143 clinical isolates obtained from two different hospitals, it was concluded that, mupirocin resistance is not an important problem in these regions currently, and mupirocin may be safely used in treating wound infections.
