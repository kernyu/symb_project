Community associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is an emerging pathogen typically associated with skin and soft tissue infection, with occasional reports of fatality in previously healthy children and young adults. We report a case of invasive CA-MRSA and highlight the potential impact of such infections on empirical treatment of staphylococcal infections.
