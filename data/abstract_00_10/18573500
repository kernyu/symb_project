An efficient and convenient method, biological fingerprinting chromatogram analysis is presented, which is applied to the comparison of fingerprinting chromatograms of the extracts of Chinese herbal medicines after the interaction with biological systems (cell, DNA, protein, etc.). The method was established for the purpose of screening and analysis of the multiple bioactive compounds in herbal medicines. In this work, microdialysis sampling combined with high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was studied for binding property of MCF-7 and multidrug resistant MCF-7 cell systems. The results showed that pseudolaric acid A (PAA) and pseudolaric acid B (PAB) in the cortex of Pseudolarix kaempferi (Lamb.) Gorden can easily bind to the MCF-7 cells ranging from 0 to 16.3% (PAA) and from 0 to 35.7% (PAB), and another compound, tetrandrine (TET) from the root of Stephania tetrandrae S. Moore, showed higher binding activity with multidrug resistant MCF-7 cells ranging from 0 to 39.9%.
