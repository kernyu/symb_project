BACKGROUND: Because of the previous high prevalence of resistance to usual antibiotics among uropathogens in Bangui, Central African Republic (CAR), a survey focused on Enterobacteriaceae, the most prevalent group responsible for urinary tract infections (UTIs), was conducted. The aim was to help health authorities revise antibiotic policies. METHODOLOGY: We performed a retrospective analysis of all cases of confirmed UTIs due to Enterobacteriaceae in outpatients attending the Institut Pasteur de Bangui (IPB), CAR, between 2004 and 2006. RESULTS: During the study period, 560 (10.9% of urine submissions) UTIs were confirmed and 443 Enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated, representing 79% of the causative agents for UTIs. Among these 560 strains, E. coli was the most common, representing 64% of the isolates, followed by K. pneumoniae (10%) and other Enterobacteriaceae (5%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae significantly increased from five (3.7%) to thirty-three (19.3%) between 2004 and 2006. A significantly increased resistance rate to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was observed in ESBL-nonproducing Enterobacteriaceae over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Empiric treatment for UTIs in Bangui should be reconsidered and prudent use of antibiotics, particularly ciprofloxacin, is highly recommended. The recent spread of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in central African outpatients is striking and underlines the need for further studies.
