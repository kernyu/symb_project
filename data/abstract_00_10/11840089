A 7-year 8-month-old girl was diagnosed with a prolonged course of vulvovaginitis caused by Shigella flexneri. The child was symptomatic with intermittent vaginal bleeding, dysuria and foul smelling vaginal discharge for a 3-year period. Initial attempts to resolve the infection with successive courses of antibiotic therapy using ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid failed. The child's infection was finally resolved by a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin.
