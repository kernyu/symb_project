OBJECTIVE: To describe the antibiotic resistant mode of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases(ESBLs) producing Escherichia coli (E. coli.) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPn) in surgical intensive care unit(SICU), and to implore the molecular epidemiology of ESBLs coding genes of these strains. METHODS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at antibiotics were examined by agar dilution method. The ESBLs coding genes were amplified by TEM, SHV and CTX-M specific primers. Amplicons of such genes with conjugates' plasmids as templates were sequenced. RESULTS: In vitro susceptibility tests of ESBLs producing strains showed a high level of resistance to most of the beta-lactam biotics, especially cefotaxime. 93.5% of these ESBLs positive strains contained CTX-M group genes,and 38.7% of the strains contained SHV genes. By sequencing, some genotype were determined: TEM-1, CTX-M-1,3,14,22. CONCLUSION: ESBLs producing strains were resistant to most of the beta-lactam biotics. The most prevalent ESBLs genotype of ESBLs produced by E coli and KPn in SICU was CTX-M subgroup. The most probable reason might be the extensive use of cefotaxime.
