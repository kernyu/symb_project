In plants, salicylic acid induces both systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and flowering. We found that flower induction in the Lemna species was promoted by reactive oxygen species-generating conditions and SAR inducers. The present paper suggests that SAR in plants and flowering in Lemna share common inducers.
