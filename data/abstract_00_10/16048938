In Alcaligenes faecalis FL-424/98, a clinical isolate that produces the PER-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, the bla(PER-1) gene was found to be carried on a 44-kb nonconjugative plasmid, named pFL424, that was transferred to Escherichia coli by electroporation. Investigation of the genetic context of the bla(PER-1) gene in pFL424 by means of a combined cloning and PCR mapping approach revealed that the gene is associated with a transposonlike element of the Tn3 family. This 14-kb element is a Tn5393 derivative of original structure, named Tn5393d, which contains the transposition module and the strAB genes typical of other members of the Tn5393 lineage plus additional resistance determinants, including the bla(PER-1) gene and a new allelic variant of the aphA6 aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene, named aphA6b, whose product is active against kanamycin, streptomycin, and amikacin. Tn5393d apparently originated from the consecutive insertion of two composite transposons into a Tn5393 backbone carrying the aphA6b and the bla(PER-1) genes, respectively. The putative composite transposon carrying bla(PER-1), named Tn4176, is made of two original and nonidentical insertion sequences of the IS4 family, named IS1387a and IS1387b, of which one is interrupted by the insertion of an original insertion sequence of the IS30 family, named IS1066. In pFL424, Tn5393d is inserted into a Tn501-like mercury resistance transposon. Transposition of Tn5393d or modules thereof containing the bla(PER-1) gene from pFL424 to small multicopy plasmids or to a bacterial artificial chromosome was not detected in an E. coli host harboring both replicons.
