Photodynamic activity of chemical compounds towards microorganisms was first published at the turn of 20th century and it is based on the concept that a chemical compound, known as the photosensitizer, is localized preferentially in the microorganism and subsequently activated by low doses of visible light of an appropriate wavelength to generate reactive oxygen species that are toxic to the target microorganisms. Processes, in which absorption of light by a photosensitizer induces chemical changes in another molecule, are defined as photosensitizing reactions. Since the middle of the last century, antibacterial photosensitizing reactions were forgotten because of the discovery and the beginning of the Golden Age of antibiotics. Certainly, in the last decades the worldwide rise in antibiotic resistance has driven research to the development of new anti-microbial strategies. Different classes of molecules including phenothiazine, porphyrines, phthalocyanines, and fullerenes have demonstrated antimicrobial efficacy against a broad spectrum of antibiotic resistant microorganisms upon illumination. Due to their extended pi-conjugated system these molecules absorb visible light, have a high triplet quantum yield and can generate reactive oxygen species upon illumination. This mini-review will focus on some major advances regarding physical and chemical properties of photosensitizers and light sources that appear to be suitable in the field of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. Currently, topical application of a photosensitizer on infected tissues and subsequent illumination seems to be the most promising feature of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, thereby not harming the surrounding tissue or disturbing the residual bacteria-flora of the tissue.
