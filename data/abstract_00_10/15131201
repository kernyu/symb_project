As a result of the increasing resistance of Helicobacter pylori against first-line antibiotics, other drugs, such as quinolones, will be needed for eradication therapy in the future. We developed a real-time PCR to detect mutations in the gyrA gene associated with ciprofloxacin resistance of H. pylori, thereby contributing to the selection of patients who could be treated by ciprofloxacin-based therapy.
