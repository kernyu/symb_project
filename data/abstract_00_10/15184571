The response regulator AgmR was identified to be involved in the regulation of the quinoprotein ethanol oxidation system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 17933. Interruption of the agmR gene by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance cassette resulted in mutant NG3, unable to grow on ethanol. After complementation with the intact agmR gene, growth on ethanol was restored. Transcriptional lacZ fusions were used to identify four operons which are regulated by the AgmR protein: the exaA operon encodes the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase, the exaBC operon encodes a soluble cytochrome c(550) and an aldehyde dehydrogenase, the pqqABCDE operon carries the PQQ biosynthetic genes, and operon exaDE encodes a two-component regulatory system which controls transcription of the exaA operon. Transcription of exaA was restored by transformation of NG3 with a pUCP20T derivative carrying the exaDE genes under lac-promoter control. These data indicate that the AgmR response regulator and the exaDE two-component regulatory system are organized in a hierarchical manner. Gene PA1977, which appears to form an operon with the agmR gene, was found to be non-essential for growth on ethanol.
