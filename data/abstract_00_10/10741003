Efficacy of a 3-drug combination (Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Indinavir (IDV)) has been evaluated in 17 anti-viral naive patients with HIV infection for 24 months. Our genotypic resistance assay was able to analyze more than 80% of the patients whose viral load (VL) was over 3,000 copies/ml. This therapy was continued in 11 patients (65%) for 24 months. Among them, VL was undetectable (VL < 400 copies/ml) in patients at 24 month (47% by intent-to-treat, 72% by on treatment). Of the 11 patients, a 3TC resistance-related mutantion was detected in only one case. The therapy was discontinued in 6 cases. Main reasons of the discontinuation were side effects. However, if the therapy was switched to other combinations when VL was undetectable, VL remained undetectable in 5 cases at 24 month.
