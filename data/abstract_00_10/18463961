BACKGROUND: Both gemcitabine and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) are antineoplastic drugs with clinical activity in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The present study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of biweekly scheduled gemcitabine and PLD combination therapy in such patients. METHODS: Eighteen women with ovarian cancer that had recurred within 6 months after standard carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy were eligible for enrollment. Gemcitabine 2000 mg/m(2) and PLD 20 mg/m(2) were administered intravenously on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. RESULTS: Hematological toxicity was mild. No severe (grade III/IV) leucopenia/neutropenia or thrombocytopenia was observed. Severe anemia was seen in only 3 (17%) patients. Several other severe nonhematological adverse effects were well tolerated and easily managed. The overall response rate was 28% (5 of 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-54%) with 2 (11%) complete and 3 (17%) partial responses. The median overall survival time was 17 months (range, 1 to 25 months). The median survival for patients with clinical benefit including disease response or stabilization was 17 months (range, 3 to 26 months) compared to that of patients with progressive disease, which was 2 months (range, 1 to 11 months; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: A biweekly schedule of gemcitabine combined with PLD is an active and safe chemotherapy regimen with acceptable and easily manageable toxicities in women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
