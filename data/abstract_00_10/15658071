PURPOSE: The use of colistin for the treatment of infections caused by multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative microorganisms was studied. METHODS: The efficacy of colistin for treating infections caused by MDR gram-negative microorganisms and the development of renal toxicity were studied in hospitalized adult patients in Spain. Patients treated between January 2001 and October 2001 were included. RESULTS: Over the study period, 71 courses of inhaled colistin, 12 courses of i.v. or intramuscular (i.m.) colistin, and 2 courses of intrathecal colistin were administered to 80 patients. All were infected by MDR organisms: 69 (86%) by Acinetobacter baumannii and 11 (14%) by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In 41 patients (51%), the episodes were caused by A. baumannii strains susceptible exclusively to colistin. The causative organisms were cleared in 92% of the patients from whom posttreatment repeat specimens were obtained. The in-hospital mortality rate was 18% (14 patients). There were no significant changes in mean serum urea or creatinine concentrations in patients receiving i.v. or i.m. therapy. CONCLUSION: Colistin was used in 80 patients infected with A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa and appeared to be efficacious and safe.
