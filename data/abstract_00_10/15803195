The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetic model organism linked to an impressive portfolio of fundamental discoveries in biology. This free-living nematode, which can be easily and inexpensively grown in the laboratory, is also a natural vehicle for screening for drugs that are active against nematode parasites. Here, we show that chemistry-to-gene screens using this animal model can define targets of antiparasitic drugs, identify novel candidate drug targets and contribute to the discovery of new drugs for treating human diseases.
