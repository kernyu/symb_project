BACKGROUND: Septic arthritis of the wrist is correlated with a high morbidity. To show diagnostic and therapeutic options we reviewed the patients treated with wrist infections at our institution for one year. METHODS: The data of ten patients who were treated for septic arthritis of the wrist in 2003 and 2004 were collected in a retrospective survey. Etiology, risk factors, microorganism and resistance data were recorded. RESULTS: Six infections were of an iatrogenic nature (four following surgery, one joint puncture and one joint injection). In nine cases there was a single arthritis of the wrist. One patient had oligoarthritis. In four cases Staphylococcus aureus, in one Proteus mirabilis and in one Pseudomonas aeroginosa were identified. In four cases, no microorganism could be identified. Two of the patients suffered from diabetes mellitus, one had rheumatoid arthritis. There was no significant elevation in the white blood cell count with 9.2 (4.5 - 12.5) x 10 (9)/L. Arthroscopic debridement and synovialectomy could be performed in one case. In the other cases open surgery was necessary. In four cases partial bone resection was required. Local antibiotics were installed in eight cases. All infections healed. In nine patients the joint was immobilized with an external fixation device. All patients received systemic antibiotics. Four wrists ended in an arthrodesis, one in a four-corner fusion. On average, two (1 - 6) surgical interventions were necessary per patient. The six patients without an arthrodesis had a range of motion in extension/flexion of 30-0-24 degrees. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment is sufficient in septic arthritis of the wrist. However, an early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention are essential to avoid a permanent disability.
