Infections caused by Aspergillus terreus are rare but have been associated with a poor outcome in immunocompromised patients due to frequent resistance to conventional antifungal therapy. This report describes a case of a woman who developed acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) due to A. terreus during induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia. She initially failed to respond to treatment with amphotericin B but the infection resolved following the introduction of oral itraconazole. Opportunistic infections caused by A. terreus are an emerging problem and can be associated with a high mortality rate. Early microbiological diagnosis is critical since resistance to amphotericin B is likely and itraconazole appears to be an effective treatment for this infection.
