In this study, the distribution of macrolide resistance mechanisms was determined for isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes obtained from the PROTEKT 1999-2000 study (a global, longitudinal study of the antibacterial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections). The global macrolide resistance mechanism distribution results for 1043 macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates collected from 25 countries were as follows: 35.3% mef(A), 56.2% erm(B), 6.8% both mef(A) and erm(B), 0.2% erm(A) subclass erm(TR) and 1.5% negative for mechanisms tested. Mechanisms of macrolide resistance were found to vary widely between countries and different geographical regions with mef(A) predominating in North America and erm(B) in Europe. Approximation of genotype from macrolide MIC without molecular determination of the mechanism of resistance resulted in an error of 10.2% (106 isolates). Overall, for 143 macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes isolates, 46.1% of the isolates tested were mef(A), 30.8% were erm(B), 23.1% were erm(A) subclass erm(TR) and no isolates were negative for all the genetic markers tested. Again, the distribution varied widely between countries and geographical regions. This study provides valuable baseline data for the continued monitoring of the evolution of macrolide resistance development in these important respiratory tract pathogens. The ketolide telithromycin retained excellent anti-pneumococcal activity irrespective of macrolide resistance mechanism, having a MIC(90) of 0.25, 0.5 and 0.5 mg/L against mef(A), erm(B) and mef(A)+erm(B) macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae, respectively. It also exhibited potent activity against S. pyogenes that had become resistant to macrolides via either mef(A), (MIC(90 )0.5 mg/L) or erm(TR), (MIC(90) 0.03 mg/L).
