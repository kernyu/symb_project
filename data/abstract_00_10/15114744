AIM: To study causative agents and sensitivity of E-coli strains isolated from adult outpatients with uncomplicated urinary infection (UI) in different regions of Russia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicenter prospective epidemiological study included adult patients with uncomplicated infections of the upper or lower urinary tracts. MPK of antibiotics was established by dilution in agar according to NCCLS recommendations, 2000-2002. RESULTS: Among UI causative agents, E. coli was most frequent (85.9%). K. Pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Staphylococcus spp., P. Aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. occurred much less frequently (6, 1.8, 1.6, 1.2, and 1.0%, respectively). E. Coli UI was highly resistant to ampicilline (37.1%), cotrimoxasol (21%), maximal resistance being in St-Petersburg (51.9 and 31.5%, respectively). Such oral antibiotics as norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, cefuroxim, amoxicillin/clavulanat, nitrofurantoin were maximally active against E. Coli (4.3, 2.4, 2.6 and 1.2%, respectively). CONCLUSION: High resistance of E. coli, which is the chief causative agent of uncomplicated UI, to ampicillin, cotrimoxasol was detected. Fluoroquinolones, amoxicillin/clavulanat, nitrofurantoin, cefuroxim have high microbiological activity. On the basis of the pharmacokinetic, safety and other evidence it is concluded that drugs of choice for therapy of uncomplicated UI in Russia are oral fluoroquinolones.
