Thirty-four isolates of pan-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa producing VIM-2 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) were detected at a university hospital in Spain (July 2004-September 2006). Eleven (32%) patients had clinically significant infections, and three (27%) of these patients died. A single clone of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa was identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A cluster of isolates associated with the vascular surgery ward involved ten patients and appeared as a series of low-grade, sustained and misdiagnosed endemic infections in the hospital. The identification of MBL-positive P. aeruginosa should be considered mandatory in the surveillance of pan-resistant P. aeruginosa and requires a high index of suspicion in the context of endemic infections with a low attack rate.
