Sirolimus (SRL) not only displays prophylactic activity, it also reverses acute rejection (AR) in humans with ongoing refractory renal allograft rejection and chronic liver allograft rejection. The present case of a human liver allograft recipient documents the utility of SRL therapy for a patient experiencing ongoing resistant recurrent AR just after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and liver dysfunction that had not abated after treatment with corticosteroids and antilymphocyte globulin. SRL was added to the mycophenolate mofetil/steroid regimen to treat the ongoing rejection. The patient was rescued with SRL, not experiencing AR again. To date the patient has exhibited no significant side effects after more than 6 months of SRL therapy and his clinical and general condition have been good; he is completely involved in daily life. SRL is a new and safe immunosuppressive agent for rescue in patients with early OLT and recurrent AR.
