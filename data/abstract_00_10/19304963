The choice of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of gonorrhoea is critical in areas where the prevalence of drug resistance is high. This study aimed to evaluate the antibiotic treatment of gonorrhoea in endemic areas. During 1999-2004, all Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections (n = 90) were evaluated. Patients' medical records and antibiotic treatment regimens were retrospectively reviewed if their isolates were viable (n = 65). In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae isolates was performed. Urethritis (89%) and pelvic inflammatory disease (42%) were the most common presentations among men (n = 53) and women (n = 12), respectively. Of 54 patients with uncomplicated N. gonorrhoeae infection, 32 of them received appropriate antibiotics, including cefuroxime (n = 20), ceftriaxone (n = 10), ciprofloxacin (n = 1) and azithromycin (n = 1) during follow-ups. Among 65 patients, 53.8% were notified to the health authority. Check-ups of other sexually transmitted diseases were carried out in only 46% of patients. Not all isolates were susceptible to penicillin, 96.9% were resistant to tetracycline and 86% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Ceftriaxone, cefixime, spectinomycin and azithromycin were active in vitro against all isolates. In conclusion, It is crucial to develop treatment guidelines according to regional antimicrobial resistances and educational programmes to improve clinical care for genital gonococcal diseases.
