Of 176 urine isolates from female students positive for Escherichia coli, 29.6% were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant and none were nitrofurantoin resistant. Among students with a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) (n = 119), resistance to ciprofloxacin was 11.8%, compared to 1.8% among those without prior UTI. Nitrofurantoin should be considered for empirical therapy of lower tract UTI.
