BACKGROUND: Pre-existing antiviral-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been associated with primary non-response to lamivudine treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B, but little is known of the capacity for resistant HBV to cause primary infection. OBJECTIVE: The study was to investigate if Beijing patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB) are infected with drug-resistant HBV. STUDY DESIGN: Sera were collected from 201 NA-untreated patients with AHB. Direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing was used to screen HBV reverse-transcriptase (RT) domain and clonal sequencing were performed for all resistance-positive samples. RESULTS: Direct PCR sequencing showed that 14 samples (7.0%) were positive for drug-resistant HBV variants, comprised of 11 with the lamivudine-resistant pattern rtM204I and/or rtM204V in the presence and absence of compensatory mutations rtL80I, rtV173L, and rtL180M; two with the adefovir-resistant pattern rtA181V; and one with the entecavir-resistant pattern rtL180M+rtS202G+rtM204V. Concomitance of resistance variants with wild-type HBV was observed in samples from 13 patients. Clonal sequencing verified direct sequencing results. Furthermore, variants associated with resistance to adefovir or entecavir were found in 3 samples. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-resistant HBV strains, including those not resistant to lamivudine, are transmissible and can cause acute hepatitis B in China.
