The MIC results using a dry-form broth microdilution panel (TREK Diagnostic/Sensititre, Westlake, OH, USA) were validated for AZD2563, a novel oxazolidinone compound. In comparision studies against reference frozen-form panels, the commercial MIC results were the same as the reference calue for 82.7% of organisms and all results were within +/- one log2 dilution. Using 462 organisms, most from three genus groups (enterococci, staphylococci, streptococci), test results indicate that Sensititre MIC values were comparable to the reference test and can be utilized in clinical trials of for routine laboratory use when testing AZD2563 and linezolid, the drug class comparator.
