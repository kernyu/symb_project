Antibiotic susceptibility testing by the microdilution technique was performed on 184 Yersinia enterocolitica isolates recovered from children with gastroenteritis in the Detroit area during a 12-year period. The majority of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ticarcillin and cefazolin. The most active agents were cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, gentamicin, tobramycin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, imipenem and ciprofloxacin. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone were effective in the treatment of bacteraemia in 12 patients.
