OBJECTIVES: Recently, there has been a decrease in the eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori due to the increase in antibiotic resistance of this bacterium. Plaunotol, a cytoprotective anti-ulcer agent, exhibits antibacterial activity against H. pylori. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of plaunotol in combination with clarithromycin against clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori clinical isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the chequerboard titration method, the combination of plaunotol and clarithromycin showed a synergistic effect against 67% (10/15) clarithromycin-resistant strains and an additive effect against the other strains. No indifferent and antagonistic effects were observed against any of the strains tested. In a gastritis model of Mongolian gerbils infected with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori, the plaunotol (40 mg/kg) and clarithromycin (66.6 mg/kg) combination exhibited synergistic effects; however, neither plaunotol nor clarithromycin alone showed bactericidal effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that plaunotol may play a useful role in combination with anti-H. pylori drugs in the treatment of diseases associated with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori.
