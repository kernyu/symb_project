The basis of "antibacterial photodynamic therapy" involves the killing of bacteria by reactive oxygen species in the presence of a photosensitizer and light. Possible dermatologic indications include inactivation of bacteria in skin and wound infections and reduction in density of nosocomial multi-resistant infections. The chief advantage of antibacterial photodynamic therapy is that regardless of the resistance pattern of a bacteria, inactivation can be achieved, analogous to the use of antiseptics. The aim of the present review is to describe the physicochemical and biological mechanisms of antibacterial photodynamic therapy as well as possible clinical indications in dermatology.
