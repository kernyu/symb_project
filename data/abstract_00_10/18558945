Forty-two multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were obtained during outbreaks in a Korean hospital. The co-carriage of bla(OXA-23), bla(OXA-51), bla(PER-1) and armA was observed in 23 isolates, and they were susceptible only to colistin and minocycline. The MDR A. baumannii isolates were found to belong to sequence group 1 using sequence-based typing.
