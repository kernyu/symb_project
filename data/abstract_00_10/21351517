This study is to establish a cell-based model targeting to neuraminidase (NA) of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus. NA is an influenza virus structural protein with enzymatic activity of the cleavage of HA-sialic acid interaction to release new viral particles from cells. A model of HIV-1 (pNL4-3.Luc.R(-)E(-)) based pseudovirions packed with HA [hemagglutinin, A/VietNam/1203/2004 (H5N1)] and NA [A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)] was established to evaluate compounds activities on NA function. The viral release can be blocked by neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate, with IC50 of (61 +/- 31) nmol L(-1) and (5.5 +/- 2.9) nmol L(-1) respectively. A point mutation of H275Y on NA leads oseltamivir-resistance. This corresponding mutation was introduced into the system which was also confirmed by oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate.
