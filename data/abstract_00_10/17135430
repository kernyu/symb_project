Testing for susceptibility to pyrazinamide (PZA) and analysis of the pncA gene sequences of 423 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates have revealed a unique silent nucleotide substitution that enables the rapid identification of "M. canettii" (proposed name). Moreover, the lack of a defined mutation within the pncA gene strongly suggests that an alternative mechanism is responsible for PZA resistance. Our results indicate that DNA sequencing of the pncA gene has the potential to shorten the turnaround time and increase the accuracy of PZA susceptibility testing of the M. tuberculosis complex.
