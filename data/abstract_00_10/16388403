Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 is a facultative chemolithotrophic bacterium that possesses two megaplasmids (pMOL28 and pMOL30) that confer resistance to eleven metals. The ability of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 to resist silver is described here. Electronic microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffractometry (DRX) observations revealed that C. metallidurans CH34 strongly associated silver with the outer membrane, under chloride chemical form. Using derivate strains of C. metallidurans CH34, which carried only one or no megaplasmid, we show that this resistance seems to be carried by pMOL30.
