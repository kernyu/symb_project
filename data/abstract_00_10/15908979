The safety and efficacy of early bacterial prophylaxis with piperacillin-tazobactam were prospectively evaluated in 51 autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) recipients. The results were compared with those obtained in 51 control patients receiving oral fluoroquinolones in a retrospective matched-pair control study. Overall, 76% of the study group and 98% of the control group developed at least one febrile episode during neutropenia (P=0.002). Time from neutropenia to the first febrile episode (FFE) was significantly longer in the study group than in the control group (P=0.04). Once a febrile episode appeared, the duration of fever was significantly longer in cases than in controls (median of 5 and 2 days respectively, P<0.001), and led to a more frequent use of empirical amphotericin B (AmB), not statistically significant (P=0.13). However, the total time of antibiotic administration was significantly greater in the control than in the study group (P=0.05). The duration of AmB treatment shows a trend toward a longer duration in the control than in study group (P=0.2). Overall, 86% of the Gram-positive bacteremia and 85% of the Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to the tested antibiotics. Our study suggests that a subgroup of patients could benefit from prophylaxis with piperacillin-tazobactam without increasing toxicity or bacterial resistance.
