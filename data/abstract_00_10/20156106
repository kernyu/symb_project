To evaluate HIV-1 drug resistance-associated mutations among drug-naive HIV-1-infected patients in Northern Vietnam, we performed sequence analysis of HIV-1 pol-PR and pol-RT in samples collected from 206 (161 men and 45 women) consenting patients in 2008. From these 206 samples, we successfully sequenced 173 pol-PR and 155 pol-RT genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all patients were infected with HIV-1 CRF01_AE. Major protease inhibitor resistance mutations, such as L33F, M46I, and M46L, were found in three patients (1.7%). Major reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) resistance mutations were found in seven patients (4.5%), four of whom had single mutations: A62V (nucleoside RTI resistance mutation) in two cases and K103N and Y181C (nonnucleoside RTI resistance mutation) in one case each. Three patients had multiple RTI resistance mutations: two, three, and seven, respectively. Thus, monitoring for drug-resistant HIV-1 and performing drug resistance testing before initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) are recommended to facilitate selection of the appropriate ART and better clinical outcomes in Vietnam.
