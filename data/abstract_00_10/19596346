Vancomycin resistant enteroccoci (VRE) has recently emerged in France and in Europe whereas it has been endemic in the United States for two decades. Despite its little pathogenicity, VRE may be responsible for severe, difficult to treat infections in immunocompromised host. Intestinal colonization precedes infection and is responsible for VRE silent dissemination. In case of epidemy, infection control measures should be quickly implemented to avoid endemicity.
