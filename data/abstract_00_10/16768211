Antibiotic susceptibility of the Listeria monocytogenes isolates from biotic and abiotic objects of the environment in the Primor'e region was estimated. 100% of the isolates proved to be susceptible to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, gentamicin, doxycycline, tetracycline, vancomycin, cefazolin and rifampicin. 96, 92 and 84% of the isolates were susceptible to roxithromycin, clarithromycin and ofloxacin respectively. No significant differences were detected in the susceptibility of the strains isolated from different objects of the environment. 100% of the Listeria monocytogenes isolates was resistant to lomofloxacin and ceftazidime.
