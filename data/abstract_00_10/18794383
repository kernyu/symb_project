The susceptibility to several oligopeptide and amino acid antifungals of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain carrying multiple deletions in yeast multidrug resistance genes was compared to transformants containing the CDR1, CDR2, or MDR1 genes that encode the major Candida albicans drug efflux pumps. Recombinant yeast strains overexpressing Cdr1p and Cdr2p showed enhanced susceptibilities to all tested oligopeptide antifungals. The enhanced susceptibilities of multidrug-resistant yeast strains to oligopeptide antifungals corresponded to higher rates of oligopeptide uptake. Yeast cells overexpressing Cdr1p or Cdr2p effluxed protons at higher rates than the reference cells lacking these ABC transporters. An increased plasma membrane electrochemical gradient caused by the functional overexpression of Cdr1p or Cdr2p appeared to increase cellular susceptibility to oligopeptide antifungals by stimulating their uptake via oligopeptide permeases.
