Evaluation of: Mowat E, Butcher J, Lang S, Williams C, Ramage G: Development of a simple model for studying the effects of antifungal agents on multicellular communities of Aspergillus fumigatus. J. Med. Microbiol. 56, 1205-1212 (2007). Many microorganisms possess the innate ability for adhering to biotic and abiotic objects, and grow as benthic cells. The adhered cells produce an extracellular matrix in which the cells are embedded. The matrix-forming materials together with the cells form a biofilm often hundreds of micrometers in thickness. The biofilm provides the organism with a protective niche from the inhibitory effect of antimicrobial drugs, hence the production of biofilm is considered a survival mechanism. The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans is a well-known biofilm producer. The increasing incidence of antifungal drug resistance of bioprosthetic device infections in particular, and intravascular catheter-related infections of C. albicans is now largely attributed to biofilm formation. An intriguing question is whether the ability to produce biofilm is present in pathogenic filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus species. Mowat et al. describe the development of a simple in vitro model for studying the effects of antifungal drugs on a multicellular community of Aspergillus fumigatus.
