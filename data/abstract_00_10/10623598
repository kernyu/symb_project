The role of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced extracellular matrix proteins in the modulation of cellular response to the cytotoxic effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or Fas ligand was investigated. Murine L929 fibroblasts were prestimulated with or without TGF-beta1 for 1-24 h and the resulting extracellular protein matrices were prepared. Unstimulated control L929 cells were then cultured on these matrices. Compared to control matrix-stimulated L929 cells, the TGF-beta1 matrix-stimulated cells resisted TNF killing in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD), but became more susceptible to killing by anti-Fas antibodies/ActD. The induced TNF resistance is independent of the NF-kappaB antiapoptotic effect. For example, exposure of TGF-beta1 matrix-stimulated L929 cells to TNF failed to result in IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation or activation. Also, control matrix stimulated the activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in L929 cells, whereas TGF-beta1 matrix suppressed the activation. Nonetheless, in response to TNF, JNK activation was restored in the TGF-beta1 matrix-stimulated cells. By metabolic labeling, ammonium sulfate precipitation and N-terminal amino acid microsequencing, TGF-beta1 was shown to induce a novel matrix protein of 46 kDa (p46) from L929 cells. Adsorption of p46 by peptide antibodies against its N-terminus removed the TGF-beta1 matrix protein-mediated protection against TNF/ActD cytotoxicity and its enhancement of anti-Fas/ActD killing, indicating that p46 is responsible for these effects. Immunostaining of L929 cells revealed that the antibodies were bound to a membrane protein of 100 kDa (p100). Thus, the matrix p46 is likely derived from the released membrane p100.
