A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter with antimicrobial resistance from chickens, pigs, dairy cows, healthy farm workers, and children hospitalized with diarrhea in northern Thailand. Resistance was highest in pig samples and lowest in healthy farm workers. Resistance to fluoroquinolones and tetracycline was high in all study populations. The increased prevalence of resistant isolates from meat samples collected at markets, compared to isolates collected from animals on the farm or the slaughterhouse, suggests that contamination after carcasses leave the slaughterhouse is an important factor in the spread of resistant bacteria into the human food chain.
