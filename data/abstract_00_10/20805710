BACKGROUND: This study was performed to determine the biopsy sites that are suitable for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection and to assess the sensitivity of culture, histology, and dual-priming oligonucleotide (DPO)-based multiplex PCR. Moreover, we evaluated the usefulness of PCR for the detection of 23S rRNA mutations, which are responsible for the clarithromycin resistance of H. pylori. METHODS: From 90 patients, we obtained biopsy specimens for culture, histology, and Seeplex ClaR-H. pylori PCR (Seegene Inc., Korea). Phenotypic susceptibility to clarithromycin was evaluated using the E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden). RESULTS: H. pylori was detected in 48 of 90 patients. The positive rates of infection in the antrum and body were higher than those in the biopsies obtained from the duodenal bulb. The positive rates in histology, PCR, and culture were 46.7%, 42.2%, and 34.4%, respectively. Using histology or PCR, we identified H. pylori in 46 of the 48 patients. 23S rRNA mutations were detected in 8 patients. The clarithromycin E-test showed that all the 10 wild-type patients were susceptible. However, the results of the PCR and E-test of 3 of the 8 mutation-positive patients were discrepant. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that a combination of histology and PCR affords a high detection rate of H.pylori infection and that DPO-based PCR can be practically used for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection and the determination of clarithromycin resistance. These techniques were useful for biopsy sampling simultaneously from the antrum and body for the detection of clarithromycin resistance of multiple strain infection or heteroresistance.
