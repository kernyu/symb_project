In this study the ethanol extract (EEMC) of Momordica charantia L. (Cucurbitaceae) was tested for its modifying antibiotic activity against a MRSA strain. The growth of an MRSA (SA358) in the absence and presence of aminoglycosides was evaluated. A potentiating effect between this extract and all aminoglycosides was demonstrated. Similarly, the same effect was shown by chlorpromazine on kanamycin, gentamicin and neomycin, indicating the involvement of an efflux system in the resistance to these aminoglycosides. Extracts from M. charantia could be used as a source of plant-derived natural products with resistance-modifying activity. This is the first report about the modifying antibiotic activity of M. charantia, constituting a new weapon against multi-resistant bacteria such as MRSA.
