Murine Nramp1 encodes a divalent cation transporter that is expressed in late endosomes/lysosomes of macrophages, and the transported cations facilitate intracellular pathogen growth control. The Nramp1 promoter is TATA box-deficient, has two initiator elements, and is repressed by c-Myc, in accordance with the notion that genes that deplete the iron content of the cell cytosol antagonize cell growth. Repression via c-Myc occurs at the initiator elements, whereas a c-Myc-interacting protein (Miz-1) stimulates transcription. Here we demonstrate that a non-canonical E box (CAACTG) inhibits basal promoter activity and activation by Miz-1. A consensus Sp1-binding site or GC box is also necessary for Miz-1-dependent transactivation, but not repression. Repression occurs by c-Myc competing with p300/CBP for binding Miz-1. Our results show that an Sp1 site mutant inhibits coactivation by p300 and that the murine Nramp1 promoter is preferentially expressed within macrophages (relative to a beta-actin control) compared with non-macrophage cells. The effect of the Sp1 site mutation on promoter function shows cell-type specificity: stimulation in COS-1 and inhibition in RAW264.7 cells. Miz-1-directed RNA interference confirms a stimulatory role for Miz-1 in Nramp1 promoter function. c-Myc, Miz-1, and Sp1 were identified as binding to the Nramp1 core promoter in control cells and following acute stimulation with interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. These results provide a description of sites that modulate the activity of the initiator-binding protein Miz-1 and indicate a stimulatory role for GC box-binding factors in macrophages and a inhibitory role for E box elements in proliferating cells.
