Optimal use of antimicrobials is essential in the face of escalating antibiotic resistance, and requires cooperation from all sectors of the health care system. Although antibiotic-restriction policies in the hospital setting are important in altering microbial susceptibility patterns, an overall reduction in antibiotic prescriptions in the outpatient setting is more likely to significantly impact antibiotic resistance. Education of providers, application of clinical practice guidelines, audit and feedback activities, and multifaceted interventions all have had an effect in altering antibiotic prescribing in a research setting. Clinicians must alter antibiotic prescribing for the treatment of infectious diseases, and patients must change their perception of the need for these drugs. Pharmacists can play a major role through clinician education and focused clinical services. With cooperation of health care teams, the effectiveness of available antibiotics may be sustained and the threat of resistance minimized.
