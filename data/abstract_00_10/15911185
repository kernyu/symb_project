This quantitative data (MIC, diameter of inhibition), presented as distribution curves, had for aim to identify and describe, among major bacterial species relevant for clinical use, sub-populations according to their sensitivity level. This information lead the Antibiogram Committee of the French Microbiological Society to establish and redefine breaking points necessary to classify bacteria in three clinical groups: sensitive, intermediately resistant, and resistant. This classification takes into account, for each species, MIC distribution, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, and results of microclinical studies. Global data for the bacterial resistance of major species is obtained from laboratories included in the network. Results are stratified according to simple information, easily obtained in the laboratory: out patient or hospitalized patient, hospitalizing unit, duration, etc. This global data is used, most of the time, to assess the prevalence of species resistance. ONERBA (in collaboration with the national public health system) is part of the European Network for the Surveillance of Bacterial Resistance. This network was created in 1999 and includes 28 countries. ONERBA manages two networks: Ile-de-France (8 general hospitals) and AZAY-resistance (15 university hospitals). They work on E. coli, S. aureus, and Enterococcus (S. pneumoniae is observed by the National Reference Center and regional centers of pneumococcus surveillance).
