Multiresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are characterized by their virulence and clinical resistance to all known beta-lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, the representatives of most other classes of antibiotics are also proving to be no longer effective. While infections with the usual S. aureus strains can mostly be readily managed with penicillinase-resistant penicillins, the rescue antibiotic vancomycin, as also teicoplanin, in combination with, for example fosfomycin, are required in the treatment of MRSA and S. epidermidis infections. Since infections with S. aureus/MRSA are usually of endogenous origin, decolonization with mupirocin-containing nasal ointment applied as a prophylactic measure in patients with high colonization rates and/or immunosuppression, is of major importance. The best protection against further spread of highly resistant germs, such as MRSA is, in particular, profession hygiene management.
