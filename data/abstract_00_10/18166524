Glycopeptide antibiotics represent an important class of microbial compounds produced by several genera of actinomycetes. The emergence of resistance to glycopeptides among enterococci and staphylococci has prompted the search for second-generation drugs of this class and semi-synthetic derivatives are currently under clinical trials. Antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive organisms has been increasing steadily during the past several decades. Dalbavancin, a novel lipoglycopeptide, has a mechanism of action similar to that of other glycopeptides. It has in vitro activity against a variety of Gram-positive organisms specially multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but no activity against Gram-negative or vancomycin-resistant enterococci that possess vanA gene. Due to its prolonged half-life (6-10 days), dalbavancin can be administered intravenously once weekly. In Phase II and III clinical trials, dalbavancin was effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and skin and skin-structure infections. To date, adverse events have been mild and limited; the most common being pyrexia, headache, diarrhea. Dalbavancin appears to be a promising antimicrobial agent for the treatment of Gram-positive infections. Additional clinical data are required to fully assess its use. Despite the remarkable and favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, the use of this potent agent should be restricted to severe infections due to multidrug resistant organisms to limit the risk of selection of resistance. It is active against Gram-positive aerobes and anerobes, including resistant pathogens, with the exception of strains producing vanA-mediated resistance. Its approval by the FDA is expected soon. The extent to which dalbavancin will supplant vancomycin and whether it will be preferred over other newer agents such as linezolid in the next decade remains to be seen.
