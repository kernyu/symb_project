This study compares in vitro antimicrobial resistance development between strains of Staphylococcus aureus including newly described community-acquired methicillin-resistant strains (CA-MRSA). High-level resistance developed in all strains of S. aureus after exposure to rifampicin and gentamicin and in some strains after fusidic acid exposure, independent of methicillin resistance phenotype. Resistance did not develop after exposure to clindamycin, cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, or vancomycin. These results have important implications for therapy of CA-MRSA infections.
