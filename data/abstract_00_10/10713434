In order to assess the extent of genomic diversity among Vibrio cholerae O139 strains, restriction fragment length polymorphisms in two genetic loci, rrn and ctx, were studied. Analysis of 144 strains isolated from different regions of Bangladesh and India between 1992 and 1998 revealed the presence of at least six distinct ribotypes (B-I through B-VI) of which three were new ribotypes, and one of these was represented by a nontoxigenic O139 strain. Strains of ribotypes B-I through B-V shared 11 different CTX genotypes (A through K). Antimicrobial resistance patterns of the strains varied independently of their ribotypes and CTX genotypes. Results of this study suggest that V. cholerae O139 is undergoing rapid genetic changes leading to the origination of new variants, and temporal changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns may be contributing to the selection of different variants.
