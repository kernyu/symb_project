Inactivation of the FCY2 (cytosine permease), FCY1 (cytosine deaminase), and FUR1 (uracil phosphoribosyltransferase) genes in Candida lusitaniae produced two patterns of resistance to flucytosine. Mutant fur1 demonstrated resistance to 5-fluorouracil, whereas mutants fcy1 and fcy2 demonstrated fluconazole resistance in the presence of subinhibitory flucytosine concentrations.
