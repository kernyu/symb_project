41 Brucella strains isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were identified to species level and biotypes detected. All of the isolates were Brucella melitensis: 2 strains of B. melitensis biotype-1 and 39 strains of B. melitensis biotype-3. In vitro activities of these strains were detected by the E test method. According to the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values, the most active agent was doxycycline (MIC90 0.064 microg/ml), followed by ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 microg/ml), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ceftriaxone (MIC90 0.38 microg/ml). Rifampin exhibited the highest MIC90 value (0.75 microg/ml).
