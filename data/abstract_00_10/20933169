A retrospective study was carried out from January 2000 to December 2003 to assess the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antituberculosis drugs and the impact of this on the treatment result. Two hundred and two patients' files were studied (average age: 36 years; sex-ratio: 1.7). Pulmonary localisation (85.7%) or extrapulmonary localisation (14.3%). HIV status is negative (71.3%), positive (10.8%) or unknown (17.9%). The overall recovery rate is 60.7% (61.4% in HIV-; 46.1% in HIV+), the rate of treatment failure is 2.7% (1.1% in HIV-; 15.4% in HIV+), the death rate due to tuberculosis is 6.3% (2.3% in HIV-; 23.1% in HIV+), and the rate of patients who disappeared from the system is 30.3% (35.2% in HIV-; 14.2% in HIV+). Hepatotoxicity that occurred during treatment is observed in 14.3% of cases (recovery: 56.2%; failure: 6.2%; lost from the system: 18.8%). Eighty-four percent of patients never received antituberculosis treatment (group A) versus 15.8% of patients who had already received one or more antituberculosis drugs (group B). The rates of resistance to isoniazid are 6.4% (A) and 12.5% (B), to rifampicin 1.7% (A) and 12.5% (B), to ethambutol 0.5% (A) and 0% (B), to streptomycin 24.1% (A) and 46.8% (B). The percentage of multiresistant strains is 1% in patients not treated previously and 11% in those who had already received antituberculosis treatment. When the patients are carriers of a strain that is responsive to the treatment administered, the recovery rate is 64.2% versus 46.7% in patients whose strain is resistant to at least one of the treatments administered.
