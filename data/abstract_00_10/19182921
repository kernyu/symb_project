Abstract To date, very little information is available regarding the evolution of drug resistance mutations during treatment interruption (TI). Using a survival analysis approach, we investigated the dynamics of mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) during TI. Analyzing 132 patients having at least two consecutive genotypes, one at last NRTI-containing regimen failure, and at least one during TI, we observed that the NRTI resistance mutations disappear at different rates during TI and are lost independently of each other in the majority of patients. The disappearance of the K65R and M184I/V mutations occurred in the majority of patients, was rapid, and was associated with the reemergence of wild-type virus, thus showing their negative impact on viral fitness. Overall, it seems that the loss of NRTI drug resistance mutations during TI is not an ordered process, and in the majority of patients occurs without specific interaction among mutations.
