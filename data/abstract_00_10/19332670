The antimicrobial susceptibility and mechanisms of resistance of 109 Shigella and 40 Salmonella isolates from children with diarrhea in southern Mozambique were assessed. The susceptibility to seven antimicrobial agents was tested by disk diffusion, and mechanisms of resistance were searched by PCR or colorimetric method. A high proportion of Shigella isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol (Chl) (52%), ampicillin (Amp) (56%), tetracycline (Tet) (66%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Sxt) (84%). Sixty-five percent of the isolates were multidrug resistant. Shigella flexneri isolates were more resistant than those of Shigella sonnei to Amp (66% versus 0.0%, P < 0.001) and Chl (61% versus 0.0%, P < 0.001), whereas S. sonnei isolates presented higher resistance to Tet than S. flexneri isolates (93% versus 64%, P = 0.02). Resistance among Salmonella isolates was as follows: Tet and Chl, 15% each; Sxt, 18%; and Amp, 25%. Only 3% of Salmonella isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal), and none to ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone (Cro). Among Salmonella isolates, multiresistance was found in 23%. Among Shigella isolates, antibiotic resistance was related mainly to the presence of oxa-1-like beta-lactamases for Amp, dfrA1 genes for Sxt, tetB genes for Tet, and Chl acetyltransferase (CAT) activity for Chl. Among Salmonella isolates, resistance was conferred by tem-like beta-lactamases for Amp, floR genes and CAT activity for Chl, tetA genes for Tet, and dfrA1 genes for Sxt. Our data show that Shigella isolates are resistant mostly to the most available, inexpensive antibiotics by various molecular mechanisms but remain susceptible to ciprofloxacin, Cro, and Nal, which is the first line for empirical treatment of shigellosis in the country.
