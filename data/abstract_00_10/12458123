Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole (RSF) is relatively common in non-albicans Candida isolates and in Candida albicans recovered from HIV-infected patients with relapsing Candida stomatitis or esophagitis. However, little clinical data on bloodstream infections caused by C. albicans with RSF is available. We analyzed 116 episodes of C. albicans fungemia detected over an 11-year period. Four patients (3.4%) had a blood isolate of C. albicans with RSF. Fluconazole MICs were 16 (3 SDD strains) and 128 microg/ml (1 resistant strain), respectively. Three of the patients were HIV (+) and the fourth was a liver transplant recipient. All of them had been previously treated with an azole compound. The liver recipient had breakthrough fungemia while being treated with 400 mg of preemptive fluconazole despite having an MIC of 16 microg/ml. Fluconazole clinical failure was documented in two of the remaining three cases. Only five other patients with C. albicans fungemia caused by fluconazole-resistant strains (>or=64 microg/ml) are described in the literature. Candida albicans fungemia produced by strains with RSF is still uncommon. It should be suspected in patients previously treated with azole agents or with breakthrough fungemia. In our experience, fluconazole remains a safe option for the treatment of most C. albicans fungemias, although surveillance seems advisable.
