The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) proposed, beginning in 2004, the use of cefoxitin disks to predict resistance mediated by the mecA gene in all species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of the cefoxitin disk and of oxacillin-salt agar screening (MHOX) to characterize the oxacillin resistance mediated by the mecA gene in CoNS. One hundred seven CoNS isolates from different clinical samples were studied. Detection of the mecA gene by PCR was considered the "gold standard." The susceptibility to oxacillin and cefoxitin was detected by the disk diffusion and agar dilution tests, as described by the CLSI. MHOX was also performed with 6 microg/ml of oxacillin and 4% NaCl. The sensitivities of the oxacillin and cefoxitin disks for all CoNS species were 88% and 80%, respectively, whereas the specificities were 63% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivities of the agar dilution test for oxacillin and cefoxitin (for proposed breakpoints of > or =4 microg/ml for resistance and < or =2 microg/ml for susceptibility) were 90% and 85%, respectively, whereas the specificities were 76% and 98%, respectively. MHOX showed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 95% for all CoNS species. Both the MHOX and the cefoxitin disk results indicate that these are appropriate methods for the evaluation of oxacillin resistance mediated by the mecA gene in all CoNS species.
