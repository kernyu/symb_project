A 23-year-old man presented to our sports medicine clinic with a history of nontraumatic left anterior chest pain. Prior to presentation, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) had been performed that showed increased signal in the soft tissues around the sternoclavicular joint, primarily in the pectoralis major, and a small amount of fluid in the joint, thought possibly consistent with sympathetic effusion from a muscle tear. On examination, the patient was toxic appearing and had severe pain with virtually any left upper-extremity movement and with walking. There was swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness over the left sternoclavicular joint. Vital signs were normal, but due to concerns of possible septic arthritis, he was admitted to the hospital. After discontinuation of prednisone and hydrocodone-acetaminophen that he had been receiving, the patient became febrile. Blood and sternoclavicular joint aspirate cultures grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. On re-review of the MRI, subtle abnormal signal compatible with the patient's joint infection was seen. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and, eventually, surgical resection of the left sternoclavicular joint, proximal clavicle, and lateral manubrium with subsequent muscle flap. No predisposing factor for this infection was found. Septic sternoclavicular joint is rare, accounting for 1% of all septic joints. Infection or other unusual pathology should be suspected when clinical findings are not consistent with simple musculoskeletal injury.
