The incidence of hetero-intermediate glycopeptide susceptibility among Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Malta, a country with a high incidence of methicillin resistance, was studied by screening 454 non-repetitive S. aureus isolates on teicoplanin-supplemented agar plates, followed by Etests and genotypic studies. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin, but four (0.88%) exhibited teicoplanin MICs of > 12 mg/L. High methicillin-resistant S.aureus endemicity was not an accurate predictor of the emergence of non-susceptibility to glycopeptides.
