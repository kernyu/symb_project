Community-acquired pneumonia remains an important cause of disease and death both in the developed and the developing worlds, despite the ready availability of potent antimicrobial agents to which the organisms remain susceptible. Furthermore, disease management is complicated by emerging resistance of the common pathogens to the various classes of commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents. Much recent research in the field of community-acquired pneumonia has focused attention on optimal treatment, evaluating the impact of antibiotic resistance, as well as of antimicrobial choices, on the outcome of these infections. In addition, efforts have been directed towards finding adjunctive therapies to antibiotics that may improve the prognosis of these patients. This article reviews some of these research areas, highlighting controversies that still exist with regard to final recommendations, and in particular with regard to infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia.
