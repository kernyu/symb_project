We evaluated antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of microorganisms isolated from intraabdominal infection of Brazilian patients, by agar dilution, agar diffusion, and E test. Among the strictly anaerobes, 57.7% were resistant to penicillin, 28.2% to clindamycin, and 9.9% to metronidazole. The majority of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus were sensitive and resistant to almost all drugs, respectively. Half of Candida samples were resistant to itraconazole. Our data reinforce the importance of this kind of study to support rational antimicrobial therapy.
