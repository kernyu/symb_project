qnr was detected in 2 of 260 Escherichia coli clinical isolates collected from a Korean hospital during the period 2001 to 2003. The two strains were not clonally related. qnr was located in In4 family class 1 integrons of original structure, downstream of orf513 and upstream from another resistance gene (dfrA3b) and a gene of unknown function (orf105). Transfer of the qnr determinant by conjugation could be detected from only one strain.
