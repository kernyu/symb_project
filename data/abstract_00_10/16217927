Thirty isolates of Aeromonas species were isolated from river Narmada at Jabalpur during the period of January 2002-December 2002. Diversity of these fresh water isolates were determined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. These environmental isolates were found to be positive for virulence factors, i.e. protease, amylase, lipase and DNase. Isolates were also positive for beta-hemolytic activity. All Aeromonas species were tested for antibiotic resistance patterns and were found to be resistant to ampicillin and sensitive to gentamycin.
