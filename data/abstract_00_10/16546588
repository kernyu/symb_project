BACKGROUND: Linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood is a rare autoimmune bullous disease that mainly affects preschool-aged children. Dapsone is considered the first-line therapy with prompt response from most patients. However, it may be contraindicated in certain conditions such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy of flucloxacillin in the treatment of linear IgA bullous dermatosis. METHODS: This is an observational study in which all confirmed cases of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (by both histological and immunofluorescence studies) will be treated with flucloxacillin. Flucloxacillin will be continued according to the response or otherwise will be discontinued after 8 weeks in the case of resistance. RESULTS: We describe 7 patients with linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood treated with flucloxacillin. In 4 cases, it induced complete remission within 3 to 4 months of starting therapy with no relapses. In the other 3 cases, it successfully controlled the disease but with prompt relapse on discontinuation of the treatment. LIMITATIONS: This is a case series study with a small number of patients. CONCLUSION: Flucloxacillin may be considered among the first alternative therapies for linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood. Further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the long-term use is required.
