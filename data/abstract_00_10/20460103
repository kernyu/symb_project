The current study presents that ascofuranone isolated from a phytopathogenic fungus, Ascochyta viciae, has antitumor activity against various transplantable tumors and a considerable hypolipidemic activity. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a critical role in cellular glucose and lipid homeostasis. We found that ascofuranone improves ER stress-induced insulin resistance by activating AMPK through the LKB1 pathway. In L6 myotube cells, ascofuranone treatment increased the phosphorylation of the Thr-172 residue of the AMPK alpha subunit and the Ser-79 subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and cellular glucose uptake. Ascofuranone-induced phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was not increased in A549 cells lacking LKB1. Interestingly, ascofuranone treatment also improved insulin signaling impaired by ER stress in L6 myotube cells. These effects were all reversed by pretreatment with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor or with adenoviral-mediated dominant-negative AMPK alpha 2. Taken together, these results indicated that ascofuranone-mediated enhancement of glucose uptake and reduction of impaired insulin sensitivity in L6 cells is predominantly accomplished by activating AMPK, thereby mediating beneficial effects in type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.
