Atazanavir is a novel and potent protease inhibitor that differs from other protease inhibitors because of its good gastrointestinal tolerability, once-daily dosing, low pill burden and it does not seem to cause insulin resistance or lipid elevations in short-term use. Atazanavir produces an increase in indirect bilirubin levels, which is not related to hepatotoxicity. The incidence of atazanavir-related hyperbilirubinaemia does not seem to be increased in hepatitis B or C coinfection. I50L is atazanavir's signature mutation. It has been shown in previously treated patients that resistance is likely when three or more protease inhibitor resistance-related primary mutations are present.
