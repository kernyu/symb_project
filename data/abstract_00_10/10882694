Two new gene cassettes, dfr17 and aadA4, inserted in a class 1 integron of Escherichia coli EC107, are described here. The dfr17 cassette encodes trimethoprim resistance and has 91% identity with the dfrVII dihydrofolate reductase gene. The aadA4 cassette confers resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin and shows 94% identity with the aadA3 gene. The integron carrying the dfr17 and aadA4 cassettes was located on a conjugative plasmid, pEC1072.
