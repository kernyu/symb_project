OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of genetic variation in influencing the risk of metabolic complications associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHODS: Cluster analysis of metabolic traits of 189 patients enrolled in ACTG5005s, the metabolic substudy of ACTG384, a clinical trial of HAART, was performed to identify a subgroup of individuals with increased risk of developing a cluster of metabolic abnormalities after exposure to HAART. Almost 300 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 135 candidate genes were evaluated for their association with this subgroup. RESULTS: A subgroup of patients was identified that had a normal metabolic profile at baseline but developed significantly elevated lipids and insulin resistance on HAART. This high-risk subgroup of patients also experienced significant body composition changes, particularly limb fat loss. Candidate gene analysis revealed that a single nucleotide polymorphism in resistin, a gene previously implicated in obesity and insulin resistance, was associated with this high-risk group (P = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: Genetic variation in resistin is associated with metabolic complications caused by HAART.
