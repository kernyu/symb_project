In recent years, there have been reports on increases in non-albicans, and in this study, based on non-albicans isolated in the fields of surgery and emergency care as well as departments of hematology conducting the preventive administration of antifungal agents, we investigated the detected bacterial strains, detection rates, and trends in the results for susceptibility to antifungal agents, while focusing on rare Candida spp. According to the results, in the departments of hematology, rare Candida spp. were detected at high rates and the susceptibility was low. IN comparison to the fields of surgery and emergency care, the departments of hematology featured shifts toward rare Candida spp. rather than shifts toward C. glabrata or C. krusei. In the future, it will be necessary to pay attention to trends in the frequency of isolation and the results in regard to the susceptibility of rare Candida spp.
