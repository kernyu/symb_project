Methicillin resistance has emerged in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from cats in Switzerland. Three cats suffering from urinary tract infections were infected with methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP). Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the resistance profile showed that the isolates displayed resistance to all beta-lactams and cephalosporins (blaZ, mecA), fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines [tet(K)], macrolides, lincosamides and streprogramins B [erm(B)], chloramphenicol (catpC221), trimethoprim [dfr(G)] and the aminoglycosides gentamicin [aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia], kanamycin and neomycin [aph(3')-III] and streptomycin [ant(6)-Ia]. They also harbor the leukocidin gene lukS-I. MRSP represents a new challenge for antibiotic therapy and this zoonotic bacteria may rapidly spread to animals and humans.
