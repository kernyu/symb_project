Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major complication following solid organ transplantation resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The guidelines published in 2004 have recommendations for therapy; however, the frequency of resistant CMV infection is increasing and therapy is not clearly defined. There are a few alternatives to ganciclovir such as foscarnet, cidofovir, and leflunomide; however, their use is limited by adverse effects. This report summarizes the successful use of high-dose ganciclovir for the treatment of a resistant CMV caused by UL97 mutation.
