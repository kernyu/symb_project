The ArcB/A two-component signal transduction system of Escherichia coli modulates the expression of numerous operons in response to redox conditions of growth. We demonstrate that the putative arcA and arcB genes of Mannheimia succiniciproducens MBEL55E, a capnophilic (CO2-loving) rumen bacterium, encode functional proteins that specify a two-component system. The Arc proteins of the two bacterial species sufficiently resemble each other that they can participate in heterologous transphosphorylation in vitro, and the arcA and arcB genes of M. succiniciproducens confer toluidine blue resistance to E. coli arcA and arcB mutants. However, neither the quinone analogs (ubiquinone 0 and menadione) nor the cytosolic effectors (d-lactate, acetate, and pyruvate) affect the net phosphorylation of M. succiniciproducens ArcB. Our results indicate that different types of signaling molecules and distinct modes of kinase regulation are used by the ArcB proteins of E. coli and M. succiniciproducens.
