Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have been confined to healthcare centres for decades. However, MRSA infections are increasingly seen in young healthy individuals with no exposure to healthcare centres. These community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains differ from healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains in various ways. For example, CA-MRSA is strongly associated with the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV and the toxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin. CA-MRSA spreads relatively easily but often remains susceptible to non-3-lactam antibiotics. Given the epidemic potential of CA-MRSA strains, there is a high probability that the number of CA-MRSA infections will increase in The Netherlands. In order to prevent and control CA-MRSA outbreaks in the community successfully, the restrictive Dutch antibiotic policy must be followed with strict infection prevention measures.
