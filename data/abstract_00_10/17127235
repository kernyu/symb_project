Intrathecal colistin (Polymxin E) is becoming an important option for the treatment of post-neurosurgical meningitis caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. We report a case of 28-year-old man who developed meningitis due to MDR A. baumannii associated with an external ventricular drain. The patient was cured using a 4-week course of intrathecal colistin 3.2 mg via external ventricular drain (EVD) daily without any serious side effects.
