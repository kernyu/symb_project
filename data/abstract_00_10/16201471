OBJECTIVE: To study the status of beta-lactamase produced by multiresistant Aeromonas selected from cirrhosis patients to provide reference for treatment and reduce resistance and control spreading. METHODS: Four multiresistant Aeromonas strains isolated from serious liver cirrhosis patients from the No. 302 hospital. The TEM resistant genes were detected by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Three TEM-1 positive strains were detected from four multiresistant Aeromonas isolates consisting of one Aeromonas sobria and three Aeromonas hydrophila isolated from blood and ascites. This was further confirmed by gene sequencing. The multiresistance to antibiotics was higher in four Aeromonas isolates. All strains tested were resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin and cefmetazole.The cirrhosis patients who suffered from Aeromonas infection had poor prognosis and had mortality rate of 3/4. CONCLUSION: The beta-lactamase TEM-1 resistant genes was detected in clinical multiresistant Aeromonas strain isolated from serious cirrhosis patients.The results suggested that TEM-1 was the main resistance mechanism of Aeromonas strain and was reduced by adding enzyme inhibitor.
