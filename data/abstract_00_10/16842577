This study investigated the prevalence of the erm(A), erm(B) and erm(C) genes among 122 MLS-resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from a Turkish university hospital. Of these isolates, 44 were inducibly resistant and 78 were constitutively resistant. The presence of one or more erm genes was demonstrated in 114 isolates; the erm(C) gene was detected in 97 isolates, and the erm(A) gene was detected in 96 isolates. Seventy-eight isolates harboured both erm(A) and erm(C). The combination of erm(A), erm(B) and erm(C) genes was detected in only one isolate.
