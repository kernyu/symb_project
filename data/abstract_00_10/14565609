OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in plasma viral load, CD4+ cell counts, and drug resistance profiles of HIV-2-infected patients receiving antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS: Consecutive blood samples were collected from 18 HIV-2-infected ARV-naive patients who had received ARV therapy in the UNAIDS drug access initiative (UNAIDS-DAI) in Abidjan between August 1998 and July 2000. Changes in HIV-2 plasma viral load, CD4+ cell counts, and genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance testing were determined. RESULTS: At baseline, 11 (61%) of the 18 patients initiated highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and seven (39%) received dual therapy. No significant change in median viral load was observed at 2 months (P = 0.09), at 6 months (P = 0.06), and at 12 months of therapy (P = 0.26). No significant increase in CD4+ cell counts was observed at 12 months (P = 0.10). All four patients on indinavir-containing HAART had undetectable viral loads at 2-4 months of therapy. However, none of seven patients on nelfinavir-containing HAART had a substantial decrease in viral load. Viruses from 14 patients were analyzed, 12 of which (86%) had at least one primary resistance mutation that is known to confer resistance to HIV-1 virus. Three patients had the multi-drug-resistant mutation, Q151M, two of whom showed reduced susceptibility to zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine and zalcitabine. CONCLUSION: Our limited findings show that nelfinavir-containing regimens may have limited virologic benefit to HIV-2-infected patients.
