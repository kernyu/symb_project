The organophosphorus insecticide, azamethiphos, is widely used throughout the world to control the housefly, Musca domestica (L.). Since its commercial introduction to Denmark in 1983 for this purpose, we have monitored the toxicity of azamethiphos to housefly populations at livestock farms throughout the country and carried out regular field studies. The findings of our field studies, which have revealed a strong potential for resistance development, have been born out by regular surveys showing that resistance has increased in recent years. Through the analysis of a field derived laboratory strain, we have implicated oxidative and hydrolytic mechanisms together with altered acetylcholinesterase in this resistance. Our field and laboratory studies have also indicated that resistance is relatively unstable, and can revert in the absence of selection. The implications of our findings for the continued efficacy of azamethiphos are discussed.
