This study has shown that inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococci can be detected by disk testing on sheep blood agar inoculum purity plates used with the bioMerieux VITEK 2. Tests of 150 erythromycin-resistant isolates correlated with standard D-zone tests on Mueller-Hinton agar and with PCR for erm(A), erm(C), and msr(A).
