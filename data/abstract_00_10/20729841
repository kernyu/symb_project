We have developed a nematode transformation vector carrying the bacterial neomycin resistance gene (NeoR) and shown that it could confer resistance to G-418 on both wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae. This selection system allows hands-off maintenance and enrichment of transgenic worms carrying non-integrated transgenes on selective plates. We also show that this marker can be used for Mos1-mediated single-copy insertion in wild-type genetic backgrounds (MosSCI-biotic).
