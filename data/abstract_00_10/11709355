We developed a nonculture method to predict the susceptibility of Neisseria meningitidis to penicillin G. The penA gene was amplified and submitted to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. This approach was first validated with a collection of 75 meningococcal strains of known phenotypes. It was next successfully applied to 29 clinical samples.
