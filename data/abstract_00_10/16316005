To detect point mutations A2115C, A2143G/C, and A2143G in the 23S rRNA gene of Helicobacter pylori associated with resistance of the microorganism to clarithromycin, a new powerful way of analysis was used. This method involved the reaction of minisequencing followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of reaction products. In ten analyzed clarithromycin-resistant clinical isolates of H. pylori obtained in Russia, the resistance was found to be mediated only by mutation A2144G in the 23S rRNA gene.
