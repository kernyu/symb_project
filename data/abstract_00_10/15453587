Eight representative Enterococcus strains from a collection of over 600 previously isolated from an Irish artisanal cheese were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic analysis of antibiotic resistance and virulence properties. Genes encoding resistance to tetracycline (tet(M) and tet(L)) and/or erythromycin (erm(B)) were detected in five strains. In addition, all strains contained two or more of the virulence genes tested (agg, gel, cyl, esp, ace, efaAfs, and efaAfm). Further investigation into the transferability and environmental dissemination of these resistance and virulence traits will allow risk assessment and safety evaluation of artisanal cheeses.
