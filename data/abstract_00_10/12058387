On studying the dependence of quality and/or quantity of environmental fluconazole-tolerant micromycetes on culture medium in vitro, the highest number of isolates was obtained in Sabouraud agar (SA) without fluconazole (59 CFU/mg of soil sample at 25 degrees C and 31 CFU/mg at 37 degrees C). In the case of SA, fluconazole inhibited the growth of micromycetes to 83%. Significant differences were found between the average concentration of CFU/mg for six cultivation media without and with fluconazole (70 mg/L) at 25 and 37 degrees C. The genus Aspergillus (A. flavus, A. fumigatus, aspergilli from A. glaucus and A. niger group, A. nidulans, A. versicolor, A. ustus), Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Penicillium sp. were the most common isolates. Sabouraud agar combined with malt extract agar, dichloran-18% glycerol agar and potato-dextrose agar were the most suitable for isolation of fluconazole-tolerant fungi.
