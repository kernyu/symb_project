A total of 72 Lactococcus strains (41 Lactococcus lactis and 31 Lactococcus garvieae) isolated from bovine milk were tested for susceptibility to 17 antibiotics and screened for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes using a microarray. Resistance to tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, streptomycin, nitrofurantoin were found. The tetracycline-resistant L. garvieae and L. lactis harbored tet(M) and tet(S). L. lactis that were resistant to clindamycin were also resistant to erythromycin and possessed the erm(B) gene. The multidrug transporter mdt(A), originally described in L. lactis, was detected for the first time in L. garvieae and does not confer decreased susceptibility to erythromycin nor tetracycline in this species. Mdt(A) of L. garvieae contains one mutation in each antiporter motif C, which is known to play an essential role in drug efflux antiporters. This suggests that the mutations found in the C-motifs of Mdt(A) from L. garvieae may be responsible for susceptibility. The study revealed the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in non-pathogenic and pathogenic lactococci from bovine milk, including a mutated multidrug transporter in L. garvieae.
