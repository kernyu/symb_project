In this study we evaluated the performance of the oxacillin agar screen test, and agar dilution tests using cefoxitin and oxacillin antimicrobials, to detect meticillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The presence of the mecA gene, detected by PCR, was used as the standard to which agar screen and agar dilution tests were compared. The best performance was obtained using the agar dilution test (99.4 % accuracy) with breakpoints of 4 mug ml(-1) for oxacillin and 8 mug ml(-1) for cefoxitin, and using the oxacillin agar screen test. Also, a strong correlation between MIC values of cefoxitin and oxacillin permits the use of either drug for detection of meticillin resistance.
