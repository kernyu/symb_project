For many years, serious systemic fungal infections have been treated with amphotericin B or narrow-spectrum azole antifungals. These treatments have been effective in many patients, but are associated with tolerability or pharmacokinetic concerns, or suboptimal antifungal activity in some patient groups. Voriconazole is a second-generation triazole with an extended spectrum of activity offering the potential to treat life-threatening fungal infections. The drug is available for intravenous or oral administration and has been shown to be effective in invasive aspergillosis, fluconazole-susceptible and -resistant candidiasis, and infections caused by various other fungal pathogens, including some formerly refractory organisms. Voriconazole is generally well tolerated with transient visual disturbances, liver enzyme abnormalities and skin rashes being the most common adverse events reported, but these rarely lead to treatment discontinuation.
