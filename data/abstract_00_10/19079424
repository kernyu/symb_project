BACKGROUND: beta-lactams are our most valuable and frequently used antibiotics. Resistance towards them, in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, challenges their antimicrobial effect. beta-lactamases are the most important resistance mechanism against beta-lactams in Gram-negative bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review is based on literature retrieved through a non-systematic search of Pubmed (with the terms "ESBL", "AmpC", and "carbapenemases"), as well as the authors' own research experience. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: We now observe a global dissemination of particularly broad spectrum beta-lactamases; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), plasmid-mediated AmpC, and carbapenemases. These beta-lactamases are hosted by multidrug-resistant clones of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with few, if any, therapeutic alternatives. We have observed that this pandemic has reached Norway with an increase in ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in particular, but also pan-resistant carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa OG A. baumannii during the last years. The latter ones have been associated with import after hospitalization abroad, but this situation may change due to the epidemic potential of these resistant clones. Rapid diagnostic service and targeted infection control measures are important to prevent them from spreading.
