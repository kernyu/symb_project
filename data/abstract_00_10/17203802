The microbiological monitoring in the Intensive Care Units, in the last few years, revealed a significant increase of infections caused by Gram+ bacteria. Authors of multi-center studies focus upon the problems related to the treatment of the infections caused by the methicilline-resistant staphylococci (MRS) as well as to its spreading. The Staphylococcal infections were 26.6 % of all bacterial infections in the Intensive Care Unit of the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care of the Medical Academy in Bialystok, during one year observation. MRS rods counted 21.4% among all pathogens isolated from the specimens collected from the patients, undergoing the treatment in the ICU, and were responsible for 83.6% of all Staphylococcal infections. The analysis revealed the significant percentage MRS rods resistant to commonly used empirical antibiotic therapy. Our experience shows that vancomycin or linezolid should be used, as an empirical antibiotic therapy, in suspected MRS-caused severe infections along with the simultaneous monitoring of changes in G+ bacteria drug resistance and strict infection-control regime.
