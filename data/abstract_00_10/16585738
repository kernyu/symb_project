Previous studies have demonstrated that fruiting body-derived Myxococcus xanthus myxospores contain two fully replicated copies of its genome, implying developmental control of chromosome replication and septation. In this study, we employ DNA replication inhibitors to determine if chromosome replication is essential to development and the exact time frame in which chromosome replication occurs within the developmental cycle. Our results show that DNA replication during the aggregation phase is essential for developmental progression, implying the existence of a checkpoint that monitors chromosome integrity at the end of the aggregation phase.
