The drugs currently approved for treatment of HBV infections are: interferon alpha2a and alpha2b, pegylated interferon (PeglFN-al-pha2a) natural interferons and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA): adefovir, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine (currently not available in Poland) and tenofovir. The following questions are described: the primary goal of antiviral treatment, criteria in therapeutic decision-making (including extrahepatic manifestations, compensated and decompensated cirrhosis of the liver), treatment failure (including: drug resistance), management of patients with HBV-positive markers, in whom chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy is planned. In treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B the first line therapy should be PeglFN-alpha2a monotherapy, and the first-line should be entecavir or tenofovir (highest potential for HBV replication suppression and high genetic barrier to resistance). In drug resistance the patient should be switched to another, preferably high-potency NA (entecavir or tenofovir) or start PeglFN-alpha2a therapy.
