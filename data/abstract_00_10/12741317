Comparative study of two staphylococcus aureus 209P strains--resistant and susceptible to gramicidin S demonstrated that peptidoglycanes of two strains differ by ratio glycine/serine at peptide bridges. Besides peptidoglycanes significantly differ by amidation of alfa-carboxyles of glutamic acid in muropeptide. This peptidoglycane modification of resistant cells along with enhanced content of etherized D-alanine in teichoic acid provides lower negative charge of cell wall components. It may influence the cell wall ability to react with positively charged gramicidin molecules. It was shown that isolated cell walls and peptidoglycane of resistant cells binds significantly less gramicidin than cell walls and peptodoglyce of susceptable cells. Simultaneous determination of gramicidin binding by intact S. aureus cells and their killing revealed that lower ability of resistant cells to bind gramicidin is significant but not critical factor of gramicidin resistance.
