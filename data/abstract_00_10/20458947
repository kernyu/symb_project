The studying of the species and their sensitivity to antibiotics of mostly spread infection factors constitute one of the main trends in intrastationary infection prophylaxis. In 307 patients, suffering the infection processes of various localization, such as purulent wounds, cholecystitis, cholangitis, peritonitis etc., there were studied up the species and sensitivity to antibiotics of the microorganisms determined. Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli were determined most frequently, somewhat rarely--P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., E. faecalis, S. pyogenes, C. albicans and Citrobacter spp. The factors determined were most sensitive to imipenem (72,09% of sensitive clones), carbenicilline (61.9%), meropenem (60.49%) and ceftriaxone (58.33%).
