The recommended breakpoints for the cefoxitin disk diffusion test for Staphylococcus aureus were recently modified. In this large-sample study, cefoxitin sensitivity and specificity compared to those of oxacillin were 97.3% and 100%, respectively. This study validated the new cefoxitin breakpoints for the detection of mecA-mediated resistance in S. aureus.
