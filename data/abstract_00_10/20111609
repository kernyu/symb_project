BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) is a DNA polymerase that converts viral RNA genomes into proviral DNAs. How HIV-1 RT regulates nucleotide selectivity is a central issue for genetics and the nucleoside analog RT inhibitor (NRTI) resistance of HIV-1. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that an ATP molecule at physiological concentrations acts as an allosteric regulator of HIV-1 RT to decrease the K(m) value of the substrate, decrease the k(cat) value, and increase the K(i) value of NRTIs for RT. Computer-assisted structural analyses and mutagenesis studies suggested the positions of the ATP molecule and NRTI-resistance mutations during a catalytic reaction, which immediately predict possible influences on nucleotide insertion into the catalytic site, the DNA polymerization, and the excision reaction. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data imply that the ATP molecule and NRTI mutations can modulate nucleotide selectivity by altering the fidelity of the geometric selection of nucleotides and the probability of an excision reaction.
