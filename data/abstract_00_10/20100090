In this review, I describe the available assays for detecting resistance of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to antivirals and emphasize the practical utility of the genotypic approach. The indications for such testing and the contraindications are discussed, as are the interpretation of results and the evidence of cross-resistance between antivirals.
