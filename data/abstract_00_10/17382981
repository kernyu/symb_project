Although visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in various parts of India, mainly Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, and neighbouring countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh, it is rarely reported from the hilly areas of India. We report on nine male VL cases from the non-endemic Garhwal region of Uttarakhand who were treated successfully with sodium stibogluconate. We conclude that sodium stibogluconate-sensitive VL is emerging in this region and that urgent and effective vector control measures may be warranted to prevent the disease from becoming a major health problem and to ensure that resistance to sodium stibogluconate does not emerge.
