The in vitro activities of penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and telithromycin were determined against 155 viridans group streptococci (VGS) and 18 Streptococcus bovis blood isolates. Heterogeneity in the susceptibility patterns and macrolide resistance phenotypes and genotypes in the different groups of VGS was detected. We found seven telithromycin-resistant S. bovis isolates all harboring the erm(B) gene.
