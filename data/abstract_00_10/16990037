Although the extensive use of Aspergillus-active antifungals has been recently associated with an increase in zygomycosis in several cancer centers, the frequency of this opportunistic mycosis began to rise earlier, since the mid 1990s. The reasons for that emergence are unclear. Recent evidence suggests that endosymbiotic bacteria of Rhizopus species produce toxins that enhance fungal pathogenicity. We postulate that, although Zygomycetes appear equally ubiquitous and virulent to Aspergillus, zygomycosis was rare in the past in immunosuppressed patients specifically because of the widespread use of antibacterials in this patient population. Such use may have resulted in inhibition of endosymbiotic, toxin-producing bacteria and led indirectly in attenuation of Zygomycetes virulence. Thus, the growing rates of antimicrobial resistance over the past decade selected for multidrug-resistant endosymbiotic bacteria of Zygomycetes, which could facilitate the emergence of zygomycosis. This hypothesis, if true, will be the first paradigm of modulation of virulence of opportunistic fungi by antibacterials.
