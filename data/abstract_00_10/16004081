The clinical emergence of lamivudine and adefovir resistance mutations on prolonged therapy further necessitates the development of additional drugs for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. We have evaluated a number of novel 2'-fluoro-2',3'-unsaturated D- and L-nucleosides for their anti-HBV activity in the HepG2-2.2.15 cell system. The most potent nucleosides were beta-L-2'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrocy-tidine (L-2'-Fd4C) and beta-L-2'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-5-fluorocytidine (L-2'-Fd4FC) with median effective concentrations (EC50) of 0.002 microM and 0.004 microM, respectively. The D-enantiomers of the 2'-fluoro-substituted cytidine analogues in this series showed activity, with the 5-fluorocytidine (D-2'-Fd4FC) being the most potent (EC50 = 0.05 microM). The active compounds were not cytotoxic to a number of cell lines or to bone marrow progenitor cells. Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA synthesis and function were not affected by these nucleosides. L-2'-Fd4C did not affect viral transcription, implying that it does not inhibit cellular RNA polymerase II. Studies with the HBV polymerase in core particles revealed that the 5'-triphosphates of L-2'-Fd4C and D-2'-Fd4FC produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the incorporation of 32P-dCTP into the HBV DNA, indicating that the mechanism of action of these compounds is through specific inhibition of viral DNA synthesis. This class of nucleosides, which exhibit potent antiviral activity and a favourable safety profile, have potential for the treatment of HBV infections and warrant further development.
