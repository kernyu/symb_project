This study aims to determine the presence of extended-spectrum (ESBL) and plasmidic class C beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in poultry, pig and rabbit farms of Catalonia (Spain). PFGE typing showed a low clonal relationship among strains carrying these mechanisms of resistance. Ninety-three percent of them were resistant to two or more of the non-beta-lactam antimicrobials tested and harboured ESBL and plasmidic class C beta-lactamases. Greater diversity of these enzymes was found in strains from poultry farms, the CTX-M-9 family, especially CTX-M-14, with CMY-2 being the most frequent. The isolation of TEM-52 and SHV-2-producing Escherichia coli strains from these animal farms is noteworthy. In contrast, 73% of the strains from pig farms had CTX-M-1, and neither the CMY-type nor CTX-M-9 family enzyme was found. Likewise, it is the first time that CTX-M-1 and SHV-5 encoding strains have been isolated in pigs. On the other hand, in rabbit farms CTX-M-9 family was also the most frequent, being detected in three of a total of four strains. The last one showed a CMY-2, for the first time detected in these animals, too. In conclusion, commensal E. coli strains of food-producing animal farms are a reservoir of ESBL and plasmidic class C beta-lactamases.
