The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in a university hospital in Turkey. Thirty nine clinical isolates were collected from 37 patients and one from an environmental source between 1998 and 2001. Susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials was studied. The isolates were categorised into six groups: A through F. Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole was the most active agent against the tested isolates. Genotypic analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of clinical isolates identified 21 different PFGE patterns. Three most common clusters were composed of 11, seven and four strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility identified multi-resistant phenotype in all S. maltophilia PFGE clones. All the remaining 18 isolates (45%) revealed unique PFGE patterns. Resistance was not lower in unique strains. The clones mainly with two unique macrorestriction profiles strongly suggests nosocomial transmission of these strains from either a common source and/or between patients.
