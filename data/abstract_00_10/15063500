Multidrug resistance plasmids carrying the bla(CMY-2) gene have been identified in Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Newport from the United States. This gene confers decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone, and is most often found in strains with concomitant resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. The bla(CMY-2)-carrying plasmids studied here were shown to also carry the florfenicol resistance gene, floR, on a genetic structure previously identified in Escherichia coli plasmids in Europe. These data indicate that the use of different antimicrobial agents, including phenicols, may serve to maintain multidrug resistance plasmids on which extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance determinants co-exist with other resistance genes in Salmonella.
