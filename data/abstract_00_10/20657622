Salmonella spp. isolates obtained from healthy swine in 2008 were analyzed for antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genotypes. The resistance profiles of the 2008 isolates were compared with those of a Salmonella collection isolated from the same geographical area in 2005. The 2008 isolates consisted of strains that were 97% oxytetracycline resistant, 33.3% amoxicillin resistant, 31.8% amoxicillin- plus clavulanic acid resistant, 27.5% trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant, 17.3% streptomycin resistant, and 7.2% enrofloxacin-ciprofloxacin resistant. The presence of integrons and resistance genes and their topological association in resistant strains was assessed by PCR. The prevalence of class 1 integrons was the highest, at 46.2%, while class 2 integrons were present in 17.9% of the isolates. In strains that harboured class 1 integrons, we identified 3 different gene cassette arrangements; a single class 2 integron arrangement of dfrA1-sat1-aadA1 was found. Comparison of these results with data obtained from the 2005 isolates showed that Salmonella strains resistant to amoxicillin and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid had clearly emerged over the span of 3 years, along with an increase in the prevalence of class 1 integrons and the acquisition of new gene cassette arrangements. These findings highlight the need for continual monitoring of regional isolates to establish more efficient vigilance programs that can address variations in resistance over short periods of time within the same geographical area.
