Hypertension often complicates type 2 diabetes mellitus, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment has been shown to improve insulin resistance in such cases. However, the effect of angiotensin II type-1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists on insulin resistance is still controversial. To gain further information on this effect, we examined the effect of losartan on insulin resistance in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Losartan administration alone lowered systolic blood pressure, but did not improve oral glucose tolerance test or insulin resistance in OLETF rats. However, the administration of losartan with exercise significantly improved both systolic blood pressure and insulin resistance relative to control OLETF rats. On the other hand, losartan treatment, regardless of exercise, increased glucose uptake in excised soleus muscle and fat cells. To explore the beneficial effect of losartan on skeletal muscle glucose uptake, we examined intracellular signaling of soleus muscle. Although Akt activity and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) expressions were not affected by losartan with or without exercise, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activities were increased by both interventions. These results indicate that angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist improved local insulin resistance, but not systemic insulin resistance. These findings may explain the controversy over the effect of angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonists on insulin resistance in clinical use. The enhancing effect of angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist on skeletal muscle glucose uptake may be attributable to MAP kinase activation or other mechanisms rather than phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.
