Ten percent to 20% of patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) are refractory to first-line therapy or relapse. Existing salvage regimens have response rates of 60-85%, considerable toxicity and frequent treatment delay or dose reduction. We report a gemcitabine, cisplatin, and dexamethasone regimen (GemCis) with intensive growth factor and platelet support and no treatment delay. Seventeen patients with relapsed or refractory biopsy proven HL were treated. Toxicity, transfusion requirement, stem cell harvesting and engraftment data were collected. Response assessment was by computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Overall and complete response rates were high (94% and 65%, respectively). There were no episodes of febrile neutropenia, treatment delays or hospital admissions. All 15 patients intended for autograft were successfully harvested. All engrafted successfully with a median time for the entire group to neutrophil engraftment of 14 days. With a median follow-up of 22 months, the median survival has not yet been reached, and the estimated 2-year survival is 88%. GemCis is a well-tolerated outpatient regimen for relapsed/ refractory Hodgkin lymphoma which does not inhibit stem cell mobilisation, gives excellent response rates and compares favourably with previously published salvage regimens using these or other chemotherapy agents.
