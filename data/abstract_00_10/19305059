We investigated the resistance determinant of 13 clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii collected from a regional hospital in the north of Thailand. All isolates were multidrug resistant and produced the OXA-23 carbapenemase. The bla(OXA-23) gene was found adjacent to ISAba1. Furthermore, two isolates carried the metallo beta-lactamase gene, bla(IMP). The bla(OXA-23) and bla(IMP) genes were plasmid-mediated according to the transformation assays. This is the first description of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii from Thailand.
