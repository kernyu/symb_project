Thioridazine (TZ) has previously been shown by us to have in vitro and ex vivo activity against antibiotic-susceptible and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDRTB). Because current therapy of MDRTB is highly problematic even when all five 'first line of defence' drugs are employed, there is a need for effective antituberculosis drugs. New derivatives of TZ were synthesised and their in vitro activity against a reference strain of M. tuberculosis was evaluated with the aid of the BACTEC 460 system. Derivatives that presented significant activity were evaluated by ex vivo studies and were shown to enhance the killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis.
