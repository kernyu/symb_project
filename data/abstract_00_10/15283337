Whey-fermenting Kluyveromyces cultures were revealed among 105 yeast strains assimilating lactose. Eighteen most potent strains isolated from milk products fermented galactose, sucrose, and raffinose, in addition to lactose. Many yeast strains fermented inulin. Most strains were resistant to cycloheximide and grew in medium containing glucose, NaCl, and ethanol at concentrations of up to 50, 11-12, and 10-12%, respectively (4 degrees C). Three strains had mycocinogenic activity. After fermentation of whey with selected yeast strains at 30 degrees C for 2-3 days, ethanol concentration was 4-5%.
