The Enterococcus faecalis class IIa bacteriocin MC4-1 encoded by the sex pheromone-responding, multiple-antibiotic resistance plasmid pAMS1 exhibits "siblicidal" (sibling-killing) activity under certain conditions. Stabs of plasmid-containing cells on solid medium containing lawns of bacteria of the same (plasmid-containing) strain give rise to zones of inhibition. If the plasmid-containing host also produces gelatinase, bacteriocin cannot be detected.
