The rates of nonsusceptibility to penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin of 191 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci collected from across Canada in 2000 were 36, 42, and 10%, respectively. Although 8% of the strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC >or= 4 microg/ml), the MICs of gemifloxacin, BMS 284756, telithromycin, and ABT 773 at which 90% of the strains were inhibited were 0.06, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.03 microg/ml, respectively.
