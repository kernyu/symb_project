Twenty-one patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia were treated with nebulized polymyxin E (colistin). Overall clinical and microbiological response rates were 57.1% and 85.7%, respectively. Nebulized colistin may be reasonably efficacious and safe for treatment of MDR pneumonia. Its role in therapy warrants further investigation in comparative studies.
