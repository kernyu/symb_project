Recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) carrying non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs) resistance mutation at codon 181 showed reduced incorporation and high efficiency of phosphorolytic removal of stavudine, a nucleoside RT inhibitor. These results reveal a new mechanism for cross-resistance between different classes of HIV-1 RT inhibitors.
