Treatment of HIV infection currently presents a number of problems such as: a) Capacity choice of antiretrovirals used (classic and new), b) study of the emergence of resistance to them (molecular mechanisms of emergence of mutations agains treverse transcriptase, protease, integrase and CCR5 antagonists), c) high cost of drugs, as well as analytical testing or hospital incarnation, so palpable that expensive treatment; d) Information clinical application of tests of resistance, ie to whom and when tobe performed; e) Interpretation of genotype resistance, good clinical type (internal, external and cross), the fuzzy rules and fuzzy rules mathematics, neural networks (net neurat Works) or the different cohorts of resistance based on the development of databases.
