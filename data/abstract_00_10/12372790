Recent evidence suggests that salt-sensitive hypertension develops as a consequence of renal infiltration with immunocompetent cells. We investigated whether proteinuria, which is known to induce interstitial nephritis, causes salt-sensitive hypertension. Female Lewis rats received 2 g of BSA intraperitoneally daily for 2 wk. After protein overload (PO), 6 wk of a high-salt diet induced hypertension [systolic blood pressure (SBP) = 156 +/- 11.8 mmHg], whereas rats that remained on a normal-salt diet and control rats (without PO) on a high-salt diet were normotensive. Administration of mycophenolate mofetil (20 mg. kg(-1). day(-1)) during PO resulted in prevention of proteinuria-related interstitial nephritis, reduction of renal angiotensin II-positive cells and oxidative stress (superoxide-positive cells and renal malondialdehyde content), and resistance to the hypertensive effect of the high-salt diet (SBP = 129 +/- 12.2 mmHg). The present studies support the participation of renal inflammatory infiltrate in the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension and provide a direct link between two risk factors of progressive renal damage: proteinuria and hypertension.
