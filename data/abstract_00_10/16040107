The effects of drug treatment of human hosts upon a population of schistosome parasites depend upon a variety of factors. Previous models have shown that multiple strains of drug-resistant parasites are likely to be favored as the treatment rate increases. However, such models have neglected to account for the complex nature of schistosome mating biology. To more accurately account for the biology of these parasites, a simple mating structure is included in a multi-strain schistosome model, with parasites under the influence of drug treatment of their human hosts. Parasites are assumed to pay a cost for drug resistance in terms of reduced reproduction and transmission. The dynamics of the parasite population are described by a system of homogeneous differential equations, and the existence and stability of the exponential solutions for this system are used to infer the impact of drug treatment on the maintenance of schistosome genetic diversity.
