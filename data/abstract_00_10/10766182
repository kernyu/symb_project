Better understanding of the immunology of prostate cancer is needed for the development of new therapeutic approaches that can be used in conjunction with current treatment methods. The present study was designed to compare the immunological properties of a genetically matched pair of primary tumor- and metastasis-derived prostate cancer cell lines generated from the mouse prostate reconstitution (MPR) model. Only the primary prostate cancer cells were immunogenic in that prior immunization with irradiated primary but not the metastatic prostate cancer cells delayed the growth of subsequently injected live cancer cells. The lack of immunogenicity of the metastatic cells was not attributable to their inability to induce antitumor cytotoxic T cells. Both primary and metastatic cells induced antitumor CTLs in syngeneic hosts, but unlike the primary cells, the metastatic cells were resistant to CTL lysis. Differential resistance to cytolysis in metastatic versus primary prostate cancer cells was not attributable to the differential expression of molecules such as transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-1, TAP-2, low molecular weight protein of the proteasome complex (LMP)-2, and LMP-7 that contribute to antigen presentation by class I MHC. IFN-gamma induced surface class I MHC expression, as well as gene expression of TAP-1, TAP-2, LMP-2, and LMP-7 in the metastatic cells, yet the cells remained resistant to cell lysis induced by CTLs. Interestingly, although in comparison to the primary cells the metastatic cells were resistant to cytolysis, both cell types were susceptible to DNA fragmentation induced by CTLs. Cell fusion between primary and metastatic cancer cells resulted in hybrids that also resisted the cytolytic activity of CTLs. Therefore, there is a dominant factor(s) in the metastatic prostate cancer cells that confers specific protection against CTL cytolysis in this model system.
