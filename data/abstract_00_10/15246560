Suicide gene therapy could be an attractive addition to the treatment of ovarian carcinomas, for which acquired chemoresistance frequently results in treatment failure. Here we show that transfection of the HSV-tk gene, followed by incubation with up to 1 mM ganciclovir fails to induce cell death in SKOV3 chemoresistant human ovarian carcinoma cells. However, co-transfection of HSV-tk with Cip1/Waf1 encoding the p21(cip1/waf1) inhibitor of cdks, allows 100 microM ganciclovir to eradicate the population of tumor cells. Potentiation of a drug by co-transfer of HSV-tk with Cip1/Waf1could thus represent another therapeutic approach for tumours that are resistant to conventional therapy.
