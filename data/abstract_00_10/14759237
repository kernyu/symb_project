Peptide insertions in codons 67-71 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) pol gene were detected in 11 (2.7%) of 414 genotypic analyses performed in a hospital cohort of 2900 outpatients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The duration of antiretroviral treatment (bi- or tri-therapy) before the detection of insertions ranged from 12 to 60 months. Dipeptide insertions were detected in ten patients, of which the most frequent was serine-serine. A monopeptide insertion was diagnosed once. The amino-acid composition patterns of insertions varied with time in five of the 11 patients. Peptide insertions were always associated with various patterns of pre-existing or appearing resistance mutations in the RT pol gene to different antiretroviral drugs. Genotypic-guided treatment resulted in virological and immunological improvement in two patients. In contrast, the remaining patients did not respond to any of the various antiretroviral regimens prescribed. Furthermore, various patterns of resistance mutations developed to the prescribed antiretroviral drugs, with AIDS-related conditions leading to death in two patients. It was concluded that peptide insertion in this region of the HIV-1 RT pol gene constitutes a rare cause of persistent therapeutic failure, and that management of such patients remains challenging despite successive genotypic analyses aimed at detecting mutations conferring antiretroviral drug resistance.
