Quinacrine was used to visualize the intracellular pH changes in the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae RXII occurring after exposure to four recently-synthesized lysosomotropic drugs: DM-11, PY-11, PYG-12s and DMAL-12s. The cells took up quinacrine, mostly accumulating it in their vacuoles. DM-11 and PY-11 gave rise to diffuse quinacrine fluorescence throughout the cells, with the vacuoles staining to a somewhat greater extent than the cytosol. This quinacrine-detected overall acidification of the cell interior is very probably caused by blocking of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. PYG-12s gave rise to a strong vacuolar accumulation of the dye. Like the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A(1), DMAL-12s strongly lowered the intensity of quinacrine fluorescence. Owing to its low pK(a), it can penetrate rapidly into the cells and may inhibit vacuolar H(+)-ATPase and prevent quinacrine-detectable vacuolar acidification without causing strong cell acidification. Since these drugs were found to penetrate into the cells, their lack of effect may reflect a higher resistance of both plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase and vacuolar ATPase to the drugs. Our data indicate that the lysosomotropic drugs under study have a dual action. On entering the cell, they cause intracellular acidification, very probably by inhibiting plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase and curtailing active proton pumping from the cells. Furthermore, they interfere with the function of V-type ATPase, causing vacuolar alkalinization and eventually cell death.
