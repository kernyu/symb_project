This paper provides an overview and summary of the data that demonstrate the effectiveness of a dentifrice containing triclosan/copolymer/fluoride in significantly reducing plaque, calculus, gingivitis, and the onset and progression of periodontitis. The caries-preventive benefit of the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice was at least as good as that of a fluoride dentifrice. No evidence of bacterial resistance or the development of pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria was observed.
