We examined erythromycin and clindamycin susceptibilities with Etest methodology among 546 group A streptococcal isolates collected in Hawaii between February 2000 and November 2004. Erythromycin resistance was low (3.1%). No isolate was clindamycin resistant. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance in group A streptococci remains low in Hawaii.
