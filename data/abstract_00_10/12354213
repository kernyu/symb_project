Cell-mediated immunity conferred by CD4+ T helper cells is considered the predominant host defense against mucosal Candida infections, with Thelper (Th1)-type responses associated with resistance to infection and Th2-type responses associated with susceptibility to infection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis, the most common oral opportunistic infection in HIV-infected persons, is associated with a Th2-type cytokine profile in saliva. To obtain more direct evidence for a role of salivary cytokines in susceptibility to oropharyngeal candidiasis during immunosuppression, we evaluated Th1/Th2-type cytokines in the saliva of those with denture stomatitis, a form of oropharyngeal candidiasis not related to immunosuppression. Results showed that HIV-negative denture wearers with and without denture stomatitis demonstrated a mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine profile with no significant differences found between the groups. These results suggest that a local Th cytokine dichotomy in saliva is not associated with susceptibility to denture stomatitis in immunocompetent persons.
