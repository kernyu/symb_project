Sixteen novel cephalosporin derivatives with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are described. The compounds were synthesized using substituted thiopyridones, generated either by cyclization of functionalized precursors, or by direct alkylation of the enolate of 2-methyl substituted pyrones. The most active compound in vitro against a strain of MRSA (A27223) displayed an MIC of 0.5 microg/mL. The most efficacious compound in vivo had a PD50 of 2.1 mg/kg.
