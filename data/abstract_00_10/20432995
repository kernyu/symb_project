For successful treatment of prosthetic joint infection, the identification of the infecting microorganism is crucial. Cultures of synovial fluid and intraoperative periprosthetic tissue represent the standard method for diagnosing prosthetic joint infection. Rapid and accurate diagnostic tools which can detect a broad range of causing microorganisms and their antimicrobial resistance are increasingly needed. With newer diagnostic techniques, such as sonication of removed implants, microcalorimetry, molecular methods and mass spectrometry, the sensitivity has been significantly increased. In this article, we describe the conventional and newer diagnostic techniques with their advantages and potential future applications.
