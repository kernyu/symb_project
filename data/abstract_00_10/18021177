OBJECTIVES: Trabectedin (ET-743, Yondelis) is a natural marine product, with antitumour activity, currently in phase II/III clinical trials. Previous studies have shown that cells hypersensitive to ultraviolet (UV)-rays because of nucleotide excision repair (NER) deficiency, were resistant to trabectedin. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether this resistance was associated with different drug-induced cell cycle perturbations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An isogenic NER-proficient cellular system (CHO-AA8) and a NER-deficient one (CHO-UV-96), lacking functional ERCC-1, were studied. Flow cytometric assays showed progressive accumulation of cells in G2 + M phase in NER-proficient but not in NER-deficient cells. Applying a computer simulation method, we realized that the dynamics of the cell cycle perturbations in all phases were complex. RESULTS: Cells exposed to trabectedin during G1 and G2 + M first experienced a G1 block, while those exposed in S phase were delayed in S and G2 + M phases but eventually divided. In the presence of functional NER, exit from the G1 block was faster; then, cells progressed slowly through S phase and were subsequently blocked in G2 + M phase. This G2 + M processing of trabectedin-induced damage in NER-proficient cells was unable to restore cell cycling, suggesting a difficulty in repairing the damage. CONCLUSIONS: This might be due either to important damage left unrepaired by previous G1 repair, or that NER activity itself caused DNA damage, or both. We speculate that in UV-96 cells repair mechanisms other than NER are activated both in G1 and G2 + M phases.
