OBJECTIVE: The guidelines on the management of acne vulgaris have been developed in an attempt to improve the outcomes of acne treatment in South Africa. This extremely common condition has a major impact on the quality of life of South African young people and it is expected that if implemented, these guidelines will play a role in improving this situation. RECOMMENDATIONS: All health care workers involved in the management of acne should take note of these guidelines and endeavour to implement them in clinical practice. All treatment methods and procedures not substantiated by evidence from the literature should be discontinued and avoided to decrease the financial burden of acne treatment. VALIDATION: These guidelines were developed through general consensus by a group of about 40 internationally recognised experts in the field of acne treatment (the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, see details below) and further refined for South African circumstances by the majority of South African dermatologists who attended a series of six discussions held in the major centres of South Africa during 2004. GUIDELINE SPONSOR: The meetings of the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne as well as the South African discussion meetings were sponsored by Galderma.
