BACKGROUND: Many antimalarial interventions are accompanied by molecular monitoring of parasite infections, and a number of molecular typing techniques based on different polymorphic marker genes are used. Here, we describe a genotyping technique that provides a fast and precise approach to study Plasmodium vivax infection dynamics during circumstances in which individual clones must be followed over time. The method was tested with samples from an in vivo drug efficacy study. METHODS: The sizes of polymerase chain reaction fragments were evaluated by capillary electrophoresis to determine the extent of size polymorphism for 9 potential genetic markers (5 genes of merozoite surface proteins [msp] and 4 microsatellites) in 93-108 P. vivax-positive blood samples from 3 villages in Papua New Guinea. RESULTS: The microsatellites MS16 and Pv3.27 showed the greatest diversity in the study area, with 66 and 31 different alleles, respectively, followed by 2 fragments of msp1 and 2 other microsatellites. msp3alpha, msp4, and msp5 revealed limited polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: Even for the most diverse markers, the highest allelic frequencies reached 6% (MS16) or 13% (Pv3.27). To reduce the theoretical probability of superinfection with parasites that have the same haplotype as that detected at baseline, we propose to combine at least 2 markers for genotyping individual P. vivax infections.
