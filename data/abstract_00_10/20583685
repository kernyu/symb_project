OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to review bacterial isolates from cases of urinary tract infection (UTI) and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern for the years 2005-2007 in St Kitts. It is hoped that the study will be of use in the treatment of cases of UTI in St Kitts. METHODS: The laboratory records at St Francis Hospital, Basseterre, St Kitts, for bacterial isolates from cases of urinary tract infection and their susceptibility profiles for three years, 2005-2007, were retrospectively reviewed and compared. RESULTS: A total of 595 isolates of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria were recovered from cases of UTI. Escherichia coli was the predominant species recovered each year. Among the other species frequently recovered were Citrobacter spp, Enterobacter spp, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: This study, the first of its kind from St Kitts serves to emphasize that treatment of UTI should be instituted generally on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
