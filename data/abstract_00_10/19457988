A negative association between polymorphism Leu-214 and type-1 thymidine analogue mutations (TAM1) and a positive association with a clinically favorable virological response to thymidine analogue-based combination antiretroviral therapy have been described. In this study, the impact of Leu-214 on replication capacity and resistance to zidovudine (ZDV) of viruses containing TAM1 or TAM2 was determined. Leu-214 decreased the growth rate of viruses bearing Tyr-215, as well as their resistance to ZDV. This observation was confirmed by structural and molecular modeling data, suggesting a regulatory role for Leu-214 in the emergence and phenotypic resistance of TAM1.
