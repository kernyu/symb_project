A microdilution method was used to test 11 antifungal drugs against clinical isolates of Fusarium thapsinum and three different phylogenetic clades of Fusarium verticillioides that were characterized by sequencing a region of the beta-tubulin gene. Terbinafine was the most-active drug against both species, followed by posaconazole against F. verticillioides.
