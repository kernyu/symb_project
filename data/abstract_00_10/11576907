A 42-year-old woman on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) developed peritonitis secondary to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Candida albicans while hospitalized for pneumonia. She was treated successfully with intravenous linezolid, fluconazole given by nasogastric tube, and removal of the peritoneal catheter. A concentration of linezolid above the minimum inhibitory concentration for most gram-positive pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant E faecium, was achieved in the dialysate fluid after an oral loading dose of 1200 mg. Additional data are needed to establish the role of linezolid in treating CAPD-associated peritonitis.
