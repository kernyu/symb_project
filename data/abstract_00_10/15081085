In the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance programme, isolates were collected from 21 hospitals over a 3-month period in 2000 (TSAR II) and rates of resistance in Gram-positive pathogens were determined. Resistance rates were high including oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (60%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (80%), high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) in Enterococcus faecalis (60%) and penicillin non-susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae (69%). Oxacillin resistance had increased from 1998 (TSAR I) and may be spreading into outpatient settings. In contrast, less than 2% enterococci were vancomycin-resistant. No linezolid resistance was found in either staphylococci or enterococci.
