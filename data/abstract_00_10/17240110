We evaluated all Candida sp. bloodstream isolates obtained from patients admitted to 4 tertiary care hospitals between 1995 and 2003 in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Susceptibility to amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazole (FCZ), itraconazole (ITZ), and voriconazole (VCZ) was determined using the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. We tested a total of 1000 strains, including 400 strains of Candida albicans (40%), 243 of Candida tropicalis (24.3%), 238 of Candida parapsilosis (23.8%), 44 of C. glabrata (4.4%), 30 of Candida guilliermondii (3%), and 25 of Candida rugosa (2.5%). Only 1.9% of the strains tested were susceptible in a dose-dependent manner, and 0.2% of them were resistant to FCZ. Almost 100% of the strains were susceptible to VCZ. Despite that azole resistance was a rare finding, a trend toward increased resistance among C. rugosa strains to FCZ and ITZ was noted.
