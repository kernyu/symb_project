The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, in both humans and animals, calls for the development of new strategies for administering antibiotics in order to bring these microorganisms under control and, most importantly, to prevent the risk of resistant bacteria being transmitted to animals and humans. One such microorganism, Staphylococcus aureus, especially its methicillin-resistant strains, is particularly hazardous to public health. This study, conducted in intensive rabbit farms in Spain, has demonstrated a high prevalence of S. aureus strains, 17.2% of which were found to be methicillin-resistant. The study also unveiled very high resistance to quinolones and to some forms of penicillin. This source of multidrug resistance merits special attention in view of the problems it poses for choosing suitable treatment and the risk of this resistance being transmitted to humans, either from direct contact or via the food chain.
