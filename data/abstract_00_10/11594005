The wide variety of prevalence of antimicrobial resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in different countries confirms the importance of determining local patterns of resistance. From 1992 to 2000, we studied the pattern of antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae and its evolution along the years, using 468 strains isolated in the Hospital de Ninos de Cordoba. A total of 177 isolates (37.8%) were not susceptible to penicillin, with 19% intermediate and 18.8% resistant strains. High and intermediate resistance levels to cefotaxime were 4.9% and 10.9%, respectively. Decreased susceptibility to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMS), erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and rifampin was found in 194 isolates (41.5%), 32 (6.8%), 13 (2.8%) and 3 (0.6%), respectively. No isolates resistant to vancomycin were detected. The most commonly combined resistance patterns were: penicillin/TMS (35.6%) and penicillin/TMS/cefotaxime (11.8%). This study highlights the increased rate of drug resistant S. pneumoniae during the last years, and the importance of antimicrobial resistance surveillance of adequate empirical therapy involving local and regional susceptibility patterns.
