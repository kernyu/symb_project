This article reviews the biology of cytomegalovirus (CMV), the approved antiviral therapies, and mechanisms of resistance to these drugs. The rates of resistance development in clinical trials are presented, as are the assays for testing susceptibility by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Factors that favor the development of clinical and in vitro antiviral resistance are discussed. Finally, approaches to altering antiviral therapy as resistance develops are outlined.
