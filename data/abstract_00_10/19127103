Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) is one of the most important resistance mechanisms that hamper the antimicrobial treatment of infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae. ESBLs are classified into several groups according to their amino-acid sequence homology. While TEM and SHV enzymes were the most common ESBLs in the 1990s, CTX-M enzymes have spread rapidly among Enterobacteriaceae in the past decade. In addition, some epidemiological studies showed that organisms producing CTX-M enzymes had become increasingly prevalent in the community setting in certain areas in the world. Several novel enzymes with hydrolyzing activity against oxyimino-cephalosporins, albeit with additional enzymatic characteristics different from those of original TEM and SHV ESBLs (e.g., inhibitor-resistance), have been discovered and pose a problem on the definition of ESBLs. Although several methods to detect the production of ESBL are available in clinical laboratories, existence of other factors contributing resistance against beta-lactams, e.g., inducible production of Amp-C beta-lactamase by some species of Enterobacteriaceae, or inhibitor-resistance in some ESBLs may hinder the detection of ESBLs with these methods. Carbapenems are stable against hydrolyzing activity of ESBLs and are regarded as the drug of choice for the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Although several other antimicrobial agents, such as fluoroquinolones and cephamycins, may have some role in the treatment of mild infections due to those organisms, clinical data that warrant the use of antimicrobial agents other than carbapenems in the treatment of serious infections due to those organisms are scarce for now.
