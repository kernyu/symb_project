OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the antifungal drug susceptibilities of Candida bloodstream isolates in Andalusia, obtained through a multicenter active laboratory-based surveillance between October 2005 and September 2006. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-seven Candida isolates were collected. The MICs of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were established using the Sensititre YeastOne panel. The MICs of posaconazole and caspofungin were determined by Etest. RESULTS: C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species (49.2%), followed by C. parapsilosis (17.3%), C. tropicalis (15.2%), C. glabrata (13.7%) and C. krusei (3.6%). All strains were inhibited at MICs of </=1 mg/L of amphotericin B and 98.5% of isolates were inhibited at MICs of < or = 1 mg/L of posaconazole. A total of 8 isolates (4.1%) were classified as resistant to fluconazole (MIC > or = 64 mg/L) and 7 (3.6%) were considered resistant to itraconazole (MIC > or = 1 mg/L). All the isolates were susceptible to voriconazole and caspofungin. CONCLUSION: In our study C. krusei and C. glabrata were identified in over 18% of cases of candidemia. Most clinical isolates of these species are resistant or susceptible-dose-dependent to fluconazole but susceptible to voriconazole and caspofungin. These agents must be used in the empiric treatment of candidemia rather than fluconazole.
