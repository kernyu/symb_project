For detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the hospital environment, sedimentation plates were placed in the rooms of two hospitals. Three environmental isolates, two Klebsiella pneumoniae, and one Escherichia coli resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins with a phenotype indicating CTX-M enzymes production (the minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] of cefotaxime was higher than the MIC of ceftazidime) were recovered. By PCR and sequencing, the three isolates were found to produce CTX-M-15. The bla(CTX-M-15) genes in the three isolates were transferred by conjugation. One K. pneumoniae environmental isolate showed an identical and unique RAPD profile with two other K. pneumoniae clinical isolates recovered from urinary tract infection from patients hospitalized in two different wards of another hospital.
