Clindamycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with activity against aerobic, anaerobic, and beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. This antibiotic has been used for many years as prophylactic treatment during dental procedures to prevent endocarditis. However, the spectrum and susceptibility of the bacteria species involved in dental infections indicate that clindamycin would also be an effective treatment option for these conditions. In addition to its antiinfective properties, clindamycin has high oral absorption, significant tissue penetration, including penetration into bone, and stimulatory effects on the host immune system. This review discusses the microbiologic and clinical evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of clindamycin for the successful management of dental infections.
