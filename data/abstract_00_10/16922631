We compared the in vitro activities of tigecycline to those of other agents against 300 nonduplicate isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (194 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (60 isolates), and Moraxella catarrhalis (46 isolates) recovered from patients treated in three major hospitals in Taiwan from August through December, 2003. All of these isolates were inhibited at 0.5 mg/L of tigecycline. For S. pneumoniae isolates, 72% were not susceptible to penicillin (69% intermediate and 3% resistant) and 96% were not susceptible to azithromycin. Among the 178 isolates resistant to azithromycin, 53 isolates (30%) had the M phenotype and 70% had the cMLSB phenotype. The rate of nonsusceptibility to ertapenem, telithromycin, moxifloxacin, and quinupristindalfopristin in S. pneumoniae was 3%, 2%, 1%, and 57%, respectively. For H. influenzae, 36 (60%) were not susceptible to ampicillin, among which 31 possessed beta-lactamase. A high rate (8.3%) of H. influenzae isolates with beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant phenotype was found. All H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to azithromycin, but 40% of them were not susceptible to clarithromycin. Ninety-eight percent (44 isolates) of M. catarrhalis possessed beta-lactamase. All three fluoroquinolones tested were highly active (MIC90 < or =0.12 mg/L) against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis.
