Testing 54 strains of staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. hominis, S. capitis) revealed that S. aureus in contrast to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) is more resistant to bactoriocidal action of human thrombodefensins (resistance index: 60.3 vs 25.6%), less hydrophilicolipophilic balance-HLB: -0.42 vs -0.64) and less charged (x-potential: -32.4 vs -35.6 mV). In groups of staphylococci (S. aureus and CNS) correlation links of bacterial resistance to human thrombodefensins with their HLB and x-potential (r=-0.32...-0.36). By In vitro experiments, it was shown that 5 passages of staphylococci in meat-peptonic broth with human thrombodefensins (50 mkg protein/ml) lead to adaptation of bacteria followed by the formation of resistance to cationic peptides from thrombocytes, a decrease of hydrophobicity and x-potencial. The role of physico-chemical properties in providing thrombodefensin-resistance of staphylococci as a developmental factor of infectious-and-inflammatory process and persistence of bacteria was confirmed with Salmonella infection.
