Extensive SAR studies and optimization of ADME properties of benzimidazol-2-one derivatives led to the identification of BMS-433771 (3) as an orally active RSV fusion inhibitor. In order to extend the structure-activity relationships for this compound series, substitution of the benzimidazole ring was examined with a view to establishing additional productive interactions between the inhibitor and functionality present in the proposed binding pocket. Amongst the compounds synthesized, the 5-aminomethyl analogue 10aa demonstrated potent antiviral activity towards wild-type RSV and retained excellent inhibitory activity towards a virus that had been developed to express resistance to BMS-433771 (3), data consistent with an additional productive interaction between the inhibitor and the fusion protein target.
