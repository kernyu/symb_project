Klesiella specie isolated from clinical specimens from Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital (EBSUTH). Abakakliki were studied to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Between January, 2003 and September 2004 a total of 3.600 specimens processed in the routine Medical Microbiology laboratory of EBSUTH, of which 245(6.8%) yielded Klebsiella species, with 84 from out - patients and 161 from in - patients. The number of isolates from various samples were: Urine 126, Sputum 37 Endocervical swab 13, Aspirates 8, High Vaginal Swab 7, Blood 3, Eye Swab, Ear Swab and Cerebrospinal fluid were 2 samples each. Organisms were identified by conventional methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was done by the disk diffusion methods. The antimicrobial disk used include: Ceftazidime, Cefuroxime, Cefotaxine, Augmentin, Pefloxacin (30ug), Doxycyline (25ug) Genticin (10 ug) Ciprofloacin and Ofloxacin (5ug) each and Erythromycin (15ug). All were Oxoid products. Results were interpreted according to NCCLS criteria. Klebsilla species were isolated mostly from urine specimens (51.4%) followed by wound swabs (18.4%). Antimicrobial susceptibility to various groups drugs used was generally poor. The most sensitive antimicrobial was Ciprofloxacin with 121(49.4%) isolates susceptible to it, followed by Gentamicin with 95 (38.8%) and Ceftazidime with 90(36.7%). Seventeen isolates were multiresistant to all the antimicrobial agents used. The result of this study will help in the empiric therapy of infection caused by Klebsiella species in Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Nigeria but continuous surverillance of antimicrobial resistance of the organnisn is very necessary in the formulation of a sound antibiotic policy in the hospital.
