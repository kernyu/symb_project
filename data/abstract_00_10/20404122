This study assessed the in vitro activities of ceftaroline and five comparator agents against a collection of Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) isolates and showed bactericidal activity against vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), heteroresistant VISA (hVISA), and daptomycin-nonsusceptible S. aureus (DNSSA) isolates. Ceftaroline may represent a bactericidal treatment option for infections caused by these pathogens.
