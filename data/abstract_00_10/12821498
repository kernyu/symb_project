The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of the anaerobic intestinal spirochete Brachyspira pilosicoli was investigated by an agar dilution method. Human (n = 123) and porcine (n = 16) isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, ceftriaxone, meropenem, tetracycline, moxifloxacin, and chloramphenicol; erythromycin and ciprofloxacin were not active. Resistance to amoxicillin and clindamycin varied. Amoxicillin susceptibility was restored by clavulanic acid.
