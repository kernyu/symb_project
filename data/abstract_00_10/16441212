Similar to the epidemiology of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections occur in children in different regions of the USA and throughout the world. Although minor skin and soft-tissue infections predominate, life-threatening invasive disease and death can result. The novel genetic elements, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec IV and V, explain the narrow antibiotic resistance pattern, and suggest the mechanism of spread among staphylococci. Panton-Valentine leukocidin apparently plays a role in its pathogenesis. Clindamycin therapy is often effective for treatment, but inducible resistance can develop if the isolate exhibits macrolide resistance due to the erm mechanism. Other drugs displaying in vitro activity against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracyclines, quinolones, linezolid and vancomycin. While experience in pediatric patients is limited, daptomycin, ketolides, glycylcyclines, newer glycopeptides and beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins may be useful in the future. Further research could include well-designed studies of mechanisms of virulence, continued surveillance of changes in pathogenicity and susceptibility, as well as treatment effectiveness.
