In chronic liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been implicated as regulators of sinusoidal vascular tone. We studied the relative role of Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent contraction pathways in rat HSCs and correlated these findings to in situ perfused cirrhotic rat livers. Contraction of primary rat HSCs was studied by a stress-relaxed collagen lattice model. Dose-response curves to the Ca(2+) ionophore A-23187 and to the calmodulin/myosin light chain kinase inhibitor W-7 served to study Ca(2+)-dependent pathways. Y-27632, staurosporin, and calyculin (inhibitors of Rho kinase, protein kinase C, and myosin light chain phosphatase, respectively) were used to investigate Ca(2+)-independent pathways. The actomyosin interaction, the common end target, was inhibited by 2,3-butanedione monoxime. Additionally, the effects of W-7, Y-27632, and staurosporin on intrahepatic vascular resistance were evaluated by in situ perfusion of normal and thioacetamide-treated cirrhotic rat livers stimulated with methoxamine (n = 25 each). In vitro, HSC contraction was shown to be actomyosin based with a regulating role for both Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent pathways. Although the former seem important, an important auxiliary role for the latter was illustrated through their involvement in the phenomenon of "Ca(2+) sensitization." In vivo, preincubation of cirrhotic livers with Y-27632 (10(-4) M) and staurosporin (25 nM), more than with W-7 (10(-4) M), significantly reduced the hyperresponsiveness to methoxamine (10(-4) M) by -66.8 +/- 1.3%, -52.4 +/- 2.7%, and -28.7 +/- 2.8%, respectively, whereas in normal livers this was significantly less: -43.1 +/- 4.2%, -40.2 +/- 4.2%, and -3.8 +/- 6.3%, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that HSC contraction is based on both Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent pathways, which were shown to be upregulated in the perfused cirrhotic liver, with a predominance of Ca(2+)-independent pathways.
