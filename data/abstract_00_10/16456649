Three antimicrobial peptides exhibiting in vitro antifungal activity were expressed in Arabidopsis to compare their in planta activity. Beta-Purothionin, cecropin B, and phor21 were expressed under an endogenous promoter with moderate-level activity and excreted extracellularly. Expression of beta-purothionin rendered the greatest antibacterial and antifungal resistance while cecropin B enhanced only antibacterial activity and phor21 did not improve antimicrobial resistance. The transgenic beta-purothionin arrested fungal growth on leaf surfaces and infection of stomata. Leaf extracts from plants producing beta-purothionin and cecropin B displayed membrane permeabilizing activity. The in planta antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides was consistent with previously reported in vitro experiments. The expression strategy allowed enhanced antifungal resistance without high-level transgene expression.
