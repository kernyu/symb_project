Bacteriologic examination of 1589 patients showed that, aside from C. diphtheriae, 11% of acute upper respiratory tract infections were caused by other Corynebacterium species. Such bacteria can cause infections of various localizations (bronchitis, pyelonephritis, urethritis, colpitis, dermatitis, arthritis, etc.). C. pseudodiphtheriticum and C. xerosis were isolated from clinical specimens most frequently. Corynebacterium spp. have adhesive, hemolytic, hemagglutinating, and neuraminidase activity; some of them are highly pathogenic. The most virulent, were following species: C. diphtheriae, C. pseudotuberculosis, C. urealyticum, and C. ulcerans. Corynebacterium non diphtheriae were frequently isolated from clinical specimens in association with staphylococci and streptococci. In such cases, factors of pathogenicity and resistance to antibiotics were more pronounced. Strains isolated with association with other bacteria have lost susceptibility to tetracycline, oleandomycin, penicillin, and erythromycin. It is important to be vigilant about bacteria from Corynebacterium genus in clinical settings, and thoroughly study their biologic characteristics, especially in immunocompromised patients.
