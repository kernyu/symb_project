It has been reported that direct hemoperfusion with the adsorbent column using polymyxin B-immobilized fiber (DHP with PMX-F column) ameliorates hyperdynamic circulation in septic shock and improves survival rate. However, the clinical characteristics of patients with an improvement of septic shock after DHP with PMX-F column have not been evaluated. To clarify this issue, the clinical profiles of 46 patients who were suggested to have gram-negative septic shock and treated using DHP with PMX-F column were analyzed retrospectively. Of 46 patients, 31 were diagnosed with gram-negative septic shock (G group). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) just before DHP with PMX-F column was not different between the G and the non-G group. As compared with the non-G group, the G group had a higher cardiac index (CI) and a lower systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Significant increases in MAP and SVR with a significant decrease in CI were observed after DHP with PMX-F column in the G group. In the non-G group, MAP was significantly increased after the DHP therapy, but systemic hemodynamics were unchanged. Patients in the G group who fulfilled the following criteria were considered as the effective group: MAP was elevated more than 10 mm Hg or 125% of the basal MAP and/or the dose of vasopressors was reduced after DHP with PMX-F column. Twenty-one patients (67.8%) were in the effective group. In comparison with the effective group, the noneffective group was characterized by a significant increase in CI before DHP with PMX-F column. All patients with a CI less than 6 L/min/m2 were in the effective group. These data suggest that DHP with PMX-F column was useful for patients with gram-negative septic shock who did not have severe hyperdynamic circulation.
