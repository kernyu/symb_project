Lactic acid bacteria are the most adequate microorganisms for natural preservation of food. In the present work, the strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121 was employed in the manufacture of craft dry-fermented sausages and its performance as a biopreservative was analysed. This strain is devoid of the genes for haemolysin and gelatinase and does not produce biogenic amines. It is sensitive to almost all the antibiotics tested and opsonophagocytic assays showed that it is devoid of a capsule. This strain had a high LD50 (10(11)CFU ml(-1)) in mice. No statistical differences were found between control and sausages inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121 regarding the production of lactic acid, pH variation over time, reaching a minimum pH value of 5.1, and sensory analysis in both series. Sausages inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121 had lower viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram-positive cocci at the end of fermentation and 7 days and no viable enterobacteria and S. aureus were recovered at the end of drying. E. faecalis CECT7121 did not affect the growth of Lactobacillus spp. but it displaced the autochthonous populations of enterococci. E. faecalis CECT7121 was recovered in each time point as assessed by its inhibitory activity on Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus. These results would indicate that the addition of E. faecalis CECT7121 during the manufacture of craft dry-fermented sausages offers an interesting alternative for biopreservation.
