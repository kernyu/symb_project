Seventy-eight Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg isolates from humans were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance genes, and plasmids and genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Most (88%) contained plasmids, and 47% were resistant to antimicrobials. The overall results were compared to those of previous S. Heidelberg studies of food- and animal-related sources, and multiple similarities were observed.
