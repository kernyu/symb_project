Surveillance of Plasmodium falciparum crt(K76T) [Pfcrt(K76T)], a resistance marker of chloroquine and, limitedly, amodiaquine, in >4,000 children in northern Ghana revealed a prevalence of 79%. Pfcrt(K76T) was heterogeneously distributed and associated with chloroquine use, low parasitemia, and the dry season. Widespread chloroquine resistance challenges the regional life span of amodiaquine as a partner drug in artemisinin combination therapy.
