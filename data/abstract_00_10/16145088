The aim of this study was to present the first set of comprehensive data on fungemia in Denmark including the distribution of species and range of susceptibility to major antifungal compounds based on a seminational surveillance study initiated in 2003. The catchment area of the participating hospitals had a population of 2.8 million, or 53% of the Danish population. A total of 303 episodes of fungemia were registered (annual rate, 11 of 100,000 people or 0.49 of 1,000 hospital discharges). Candida species accounted for 97.4% of the fungal pathogens. C. albicans was the predominant species (63%), but the proportion varied from 57% to 72% among participating departments of clinical microbiology. C. glabrata was the second most frequent species (20%; range, 8% to 32%). C. krusei was a rare isolate (3%) and occurred only at two of the participating hospitals. Retrospective data retrieved from the Danish laboratory systems documented a continuous increase of candidemia cases since the early 1990s. For the 272 susceptibility-tested isolates, MICs of amphotericin B and caspofungin were within the limits expected for the species or genus. However, decreased azole susceptibility, defined as a fluconazole MIC of >8 microg/ml and/or itraconazole MIC of >0.125 microg/ml, was detected for 11 Candida isolates that were neither C. glabrata nor C. krusei. Including intrinsically resistant fungi, we detected decreased susceptibility to fluconazole and/or itraconazole in 87 (32%) current Danish bloodstream fungal isolates. We showed a continuous increase of fungemia in Denmark and an annual rate in 2003 to 2004 higher than in most other countries. The proportion of bloodstream fungal isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and/or itraconazole was also notably high.
