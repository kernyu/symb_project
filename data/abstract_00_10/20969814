Bacterial biofilms are structured communities of bacterial cells enclosed in a self-produced polymer matrix that is attached to a surface. Biofilms protect and allow bacteria to survive and thrive in hostile environments. Bacteria within biofilms can withstand host immune responses, and are much less susceptible to antibiotics and disinfectants when compared with their planktonic counterparts. The ability to form biofilms is now considered a universal attribute of micro-organisms. Diseases associated with biofilms require novel methods for their prevention, diagnosis and treatment; this is largely due to the properties of biofilms. Surprisingly, biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens of veterinary importance has received relatively little attention. Here, we review the current knowledge of bacterial biofilms as well as studies performed on animal pathogens.
