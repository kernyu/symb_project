Increasing resistance and decreasing numbers of antibiotics reaching the market point to a growing need for novel antibacterial drugs. Most antibiotics are very inefficient at killing non-multiplying bacteria, which live side by side with multiplying ones of the same strain in a clinical infection. Although non-multiplying bacteria do not usually cause disease, they can revert to the multiplying state that leads to overt disease, at which time resistance can emerge. Here we discuss the concept of developing antibacterial drugs by targeting non-multiplying organisms. We define non-multiplying bacteria, discuss the efficacy of existing antibiotics, and assess whether targeting these bacteria might lead to new antibiotics that will decrease the rate of emergence of resistance. Lastly, we review the potential of new molecular targets and live non-multiplying bacteria as possible routes for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs.
