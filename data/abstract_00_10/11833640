A urea-formaldehyde resin (UF) continuous bed has been prepared through in-situ condensation polymerization in a confined tube. The monolith is an agglomerate of 2-microm irregular particles. Nitrogen adsorption shows that the monolith has a bimodal pore size distribution. It has low resistance to flow. A dyed monolith is obtained through modification of the UF monolith with Cibacron blue F3GA. Although its dye concentration and dynamic capacity are low compared to Sepharose type affinity media, the dyed monolith can separate some proteins in the affinity mode of liquid chromatography.
