The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of resistance to fluoroquinolones in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) Klebsiella spp isolated from urines of consulting and hospitalized patients in Rabat Specialities Hospital. A retrospective survey was made over 3 years (2006-2008). Two hundred ant fifty three patients presented with confirmed urinary tractus infection (UTI). Klebsiella spp was the etiologic agent in 28% (72/253) of reported UTI. Among them, 86% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 14% of Klebsiella oxytoca. The frequency of Klebsiella spp resistance to fluoroquinolones was 33% and to third generation cephalosporins was 35%. Thirteen Klebsiella spp strains were producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase witch corresponds to 18% of all the klebsiella. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase strains with resistance to fluoroquinolones were 85% (11/13) or 15 % of all klebsiella (11/72). None of those strains was resistant to imipenem. In conclusions resistance of enterobacteries such as Klebsiella spp to fluoroquinolones is becoming worrying among consulting and hospitalized patients. Eleven strains multiresistant (ESBL + resistance to fluoroquinolones), isolated probably because of plasmids carrying genes of ESBL and fluoroquinolones resistances. This increasingly frequent resistance mechanism should lead to a more careful use of first line fluoroquinolones for UTI.
