In 2006, the first isolate of KPC-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the world was identified in Colombia. Recently, similar strains have been reported in Puerto Rico. We now report KPC-2-producing P. aeruginosa in Trinidad and Tobago. Surveillance for similar strains is warranted, considering their wide geographic spread and known association with mobile genetic elements.
