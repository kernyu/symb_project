Candidemia is common in extremely low birth weight infants and is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. Treatment options have traditionally been limited to amphotericin B deoxycholate or fluconazole. We present a case of a premature infant with persistent candidemia despite antifungal treatment that responded to therapy with caspofungin, an echinocandin antifungal. The infant's Candida isolate developed resistance to azoles during fluconazole administration and also suffered from severe hypercalcemia during the initiation of caspofungin therapy.
