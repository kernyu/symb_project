A series of chlorinated bisindole pyrroles, lynamicins A-E (1-5), was discovered from a novel marine actinomycete, NPS12745, which was isolated from a marine sediment collected off the coast of San Diego, California. Close to full length 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that NPS12745 is a novel strain of a recently described marine actinomycete with the proposed genus name Marinispora. The antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds was evaluated against a panel of 11 pathogens, which demonstrated that these substances possess broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Significantly, compounds 1-5 were active against drug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
