To establish an experimental system to directly observe molecular evolution, a DNA fragment that confers ampicillin resistance on Escherichia coli was cloned from an archaeal genomic DNA. The activity of this clone was enhanced by 50 rounds of directed evolution by using DNA shuffling. Analysis of the evolved DNA fragments shows that two genetic regions have coevolved: One region, which has no obvious ORF, is essential for the activity, whereas the other, which appears to encode a protein, is not essential but enhances the activity of the former region. Analysis of the evolutionary intermediates shows that negative mutations are effectively removed while beneficial mutations accumulate and illustrates how a protein has evolved over the course of the evolution experiments. Although the mechanism of the activity remains unclear, the evolved DNA fragments also confer resistance to other drugs that inhibit bacterial cell-wall synthesis. The present system would serve as an experimental model to study evolutionary dynamics in the laboratory and provide the concept of screening natural libraries to obtain starting materials for directed evolution.
