Every year in Poland from tens to more than hundred bacteriologically verified extraintestinal infections caused by Salmonella species have been registered. These unusually located infections have substantially heavy course and in many cases hospitalisation and antibiotic therapy have to be involved. Cases of extraintestinal infections with these Gram-negative rods, which were described in the literature, concerned: pneumonias, lung abscesses and thoracic empyemas, and infections of: blood, bones and joints, wounds, fistulas and urinary tract. The aim of this study was to set extraintestinal Salmonella infections and to analyze a susceptibility of isolated strains to antimicrobial agents. Between 01.07.2002 and 31.12.2004 (30 months) 13 strains of Salmonella genus have been isolated, including 11 S. enteritidis and 2 S. Hadar. In general, with one exception, isolated strains were susceptible to tested antibiotics/chemotherapeutics. ESBL - positive strains were not detected. The tendency of Salmonella strains to cause extraintestinal infections has been noticed. The problem is still escalating, especially in group of patients chronically treated, with immunodeficiency and immunosuppression, after complicated medical procedures, also in the group of small children and aged persons. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate a susceptibility to antibiotics/chemotherapeutics of every strain from confirmed case of Salmonella extraintestinal infection and it is important to apply a guided therapy.
