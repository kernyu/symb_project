This is the first report on the use of a normally lethal dose of ciprofloxacin in a Campylobacter agar medium to kill all ciprofloxacin-sensitive Campylobacter spp. but allow the selective isolation and quantitation of naturally occurring presumptive ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter CFU in rinses from retail raw chicken carcasses (RTCC). Thermophilic-group total Campylobacter CFU and total ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter CFU (irrespective of species) were concurrently quantified in rinses from RTCC by direct plating of centrifuged pellets from 10 or 50 ml out of 400-ml rinse subsamples concurrently on Campylobacter agar and ciprofloxacin-containing Campylobacter agar at 42 degrees C (detection limit = 0.90 log(10) CFU/carcass). For 2001, 2002, and 2003, countable Campylobacter CFU were recovered from 85%, 96%, and 57% of RTCC, while countable ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter CFU were recovered from 60%, 59%, and 17.5% of RTCC, respectively. Total Campylobacter CFU loads in RTCC rinses ranged from 0.90 to 4.52, 0.90 to 4.58, and 0.90 to 4.48 log(10) CFU/carcass in 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively. Total ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter CFU loads in RTCC rinses ranged from 0.90 to 4.06, 0.90 to 3.95, and 0.90 to 3.04 log(10) CFU/carcass in 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively. Overall, total Campylobacter loads of 0.90 to 2.0, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5 log(10) CFU/carcass, respectively, were recovered from 16%, 32%, 26%, and 5% of RTCC tested over the 2-year sampling period. For the same period, total ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter loads of 0.90 to 2.0, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 5 log(10) CFU/carcass, respectively, were recovered from 24%, 11%, 7%, and 0.2% of RTCC tested. There was a steady decline in total Campylobacter and total ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter loads in RTCC rinses from 2001/2002 to 2003.
