A dynamic 4-year monitoring of aerobic bacterial environment in the ENT department shows its relative qualitative stability with predominance of the coccal flora, primarily staphylococcal. Gram-negative flora was represented for the most part with non-fermentating microorganisms, most of them Acinetobacter. A wide-spectrum resistance to antibacterial drugs was found. This resistance has a trend to extend.
