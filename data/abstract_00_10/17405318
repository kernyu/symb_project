Candidiasis is one of the fungal infections with the highest incidence in the immunosuppressed host. The evolution of infection and the increase of antifungal medical drugs resistance could both contribute to the mortality attributable to Candida infection in the immunosuppressed host. Even though the data from international studies are well known, few studies have been published in Romania on this subject. In the case-control study we demonstrated the link between the immunosuppression and the presence of Candida infection. Further studies are to be carried out in order to identify more accurately this link and to extend the study to other fungi. There is a need to increase the microbiological diagnosis use at least at the hospital laboratory level in order to better identify the real situation of fungal infections and the link between them and the concrete status of different hosts. Continued surveillance for infections caused by C. albicans and other species of Candida among hospitalized patients is recommended. Control of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial infections caused by C. albicans and other species of Candida requires rational policies for use of both antifungal and antibacterial agents and appropriate surveillance for the emergence of resistant strains and species.
