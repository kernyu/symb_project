PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in the management of children with vertical HIV-1 infection in the developing and developed worlds are discussed in reference to literature published in 2003/4. Studies in mother-to-child transmission are beyond the scope of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Improvements in mortality and morbidity from HIV-1 infection following combination antiretroviral therapy are extremely encouraging. There is an increase in the understanding of the immune response to HIV-1 in infants and children and a possible future role for immunomodulatory therapies. Preliminary data are available on the timing of initiation of antiretroviral therapy, the optimization of drug combinations and the clinical interpretation of genotypic resistance testing and therapeutic drug monitoring. Evidence is emerging that early antiretroviral therapy can protect the central nervous system in infants. In resource-limited settings, mortality and morbidity remain extremely high but low-cost health interventions such as prophylactic co-trimoxazole can reduce mortality prior to the expansion of antiretroviral therapy programmes. SUMMARY: Further randomized controlled trials assessing antiretroviral therapy combinations with a sustained virological/immunological response with minimal toxicities are required. The roles of therapeutic drug monitoring and resistance testing require further elucidation. The expansion of antiretroviral therapy programmes is essential for children with HIV living in resource-limited settings.
