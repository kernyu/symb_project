The molecular duplication of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) O-(2-phthalimidoethyl)-N-arylthiocarbamates (C-TCs) led to the identification of symmetric formimidoester disulfides (DSs) as a novel class of potent NNRTIs. The lead compound 1 [dimer of the isothiocarbamic form of TC O-(2-phthalimidoethyl)-N-phenylthiocarbamate] turned out to prevent the wild-type HIV-1 multiplication in MT-4 cell culture with an EC(50) value of 0.35 microM. In order to perform a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study, we prepared 40 analogues of 1 by an unprecedented one-pot method of solution-phase parallel synthesis. The SAR strategy was focused on the variation of the N-aryl portion (mono-, di- and trisubstitution of the phenyl ring and its replacement with a 1-naphthyl, cyclopropyl or benzyl group) and of the 2-phthalimidoethyl moiety (introduction of a methyl on the phthalimide substructure, replacement of the phthalimide moiety with a phenyl ring and elongation of the ethyl linker). Most DSs proved to inhibit the wild-type HIV-1 replication in cell-based assays and 15 of them were active at nanomolar concentrations. The most potent congeners (11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 32, EC(50): 10-70 nM) shared the N-para-substituted phenyl moiety. Compound 17 tested in enzyme assay against recombinant wild-type reverse transcriptase displayed an IC(50) value of 0.74 microM. Compounds 19 and 33 were active at micromolar concentrations against the clinically relevant Y181C and/or K103R resistant mutants.
