LmrA is an ATP binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporter in Lactococcus lactis that is a structural and functional homologue of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1 (ABCB1). LmrA is also homologous to MsbA, an essential ABC transporter in Escherichia coli involved in the trafficking of lipids, including Lipid A. We have compared the substrate specificities of LmrA and MsbA in detail. Surprisingly, LmrA was able to functionally substitute for a temperature-sensitive mutant MsbA in E. coli WD2 at non-permissive temperatures, suggesting that LmrA could transport Lipid A. LmrA also exhibited a Lipid A-stimulated, vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity. Reciprocally, the expression of MsbA conferred multidrug resistance on E. coli. Similar to LmrA, MsbA interacted with photoactivatable substrate [3H]azidopine, displayed a daunomycin, vinblastine, and Hoechst 33342-stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity, and mediated the transport of ethidium from cells and Hoechst 33342 in proteoliposomes containing purified and functionally reconstituted protein. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MsbA and LmrA have overlapping substrate specificities. Our observations imply the presence of structural elements in the recently published crystal structures of MsbA in E. coli and Vibrio cholera (Chang, G., and Roth, C. B. (2001) Science 293, 1793-1800; Chang, G. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 330, 419-430) that support drug-protein interactions and suggest a possible role for LmrA in lipid trafficking in L. lactis.
