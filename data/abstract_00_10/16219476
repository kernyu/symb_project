The total haemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase activity, respiratory bursts (release of superoxide anions), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency to the pathogen Lactococcus garvieae were measured when freshwater giant prawns Macrobrachium rosenbergii (18.2+/-2.1 g) were individually reared in water containing concentrations of trichlorfon of 0, 0.2, or 0.4 mg L(-1) for a 144-h period. No significant differences in the THC were observed among prawns at the beginning and following 144 h of exposure to 0, 0.2, and 0.4 mg L(-1) trichlorfon. However, phenoloxidase activity significantly decreased when the prawns were exposed to trichlorfon at 0.2 and 0.4 mg L(-1), and no significant differences were observed between the two concentrations at any sampling time. The total production of superoxide anion by M. rosenbergii significantly increased with exposure to 0.2 and 0.4 mg L(-1) trichlorfon, and no significant differences were observed between the two concentrations during the 144-h exposure period. However, M. rosenbergii exposed to 0.2 and 0.4 mg L(-1) trichlorfon showed decreased SOD activity from 48 to 144 h. Phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency to L. garvieae significantly decreased when prawns were exposed to 0.2 and 0.4 mg L(-1) trichlorfon for 48 h. In another experiment, prawns were challenged with 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)prawn(-1) of L. garvieae, then reared in water containing different concentrations of trichlorfon. The onset of mortality was earlier in prawns exposed to trichlorfon compared to those exposed to the zero control. The cumulative mortality of prawns directly increased with ambient trichlorfon concentrations in the range of 0-0.4 mg L(-1) after 168 h. It is concluded that exposure of M. rosenbergii to trichlorfon at 0.2 mg L(-1) or more caused cytotoxicity resulting in depression of the immune response, and increased its susceptibility to L. garvieae infection.
