From the aerial parts of Scoparia dulcis L. (Scrophulariaceae) grown in Vietnam, four scopadulane-type diterpenoids (4-7), of which 7 is new and was given the trivial name scopadulcic acid C, together with nine known compounds were isolated. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses. The absolute configurations of 4-7 were ascertained by applying the modified Mosher's method to iso-dulcinol (6). The isolation of the lignans nirtetralin and niranthin for the first time from S. dulcis is also of chemotaxonomic interest. The cytotoxic activity in KB cells, inhibitory effect on LPS/IFNgamma-induced NO production, inhibition of multidrug resistance (MDR), and antibacterial and antifungal activities of the scopadulane-type diterpenoids 4-7 were examined in this study.
