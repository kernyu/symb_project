BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer is a significant problem. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of gemcitabine and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the activity and toxicity of gemcitabine and PLD combination in 35 patients with recurrent platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer who had been treated and followed up in 7 centers in Turkey between December 2005 and June 2008. The patients received gemcitabine 1.000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and 8, and PLD 25 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 187 cycles (median, 6 cycles) were delivered. An objective response rate of 28,6 % (1 complete, 9 partial response) was achieved. Additionally, 16 patients (45.7 %) had disease stabilization. The median time-to-progression was 6 months (95 % confidence interval, 4-8) and the median overall survival was 17 months (95 % confidence interval, 12-22). Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities were as follows: leucopenia (14.3%), neutropenia (8.6%), and anemia (2.9%). One febrile neutropenic episode (2.9%) was observed. Non-hematologic toxicity was well tolerated and easily managed and no grade 3-4 palmoplantar erytrodysestesia (PPE) was observed. CONCLUSION: The combination of gemcitabine and PLD is an effective and tolerable treatment option, with 74.3 % disease control rate for patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
