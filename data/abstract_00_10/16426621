A sensitive, simple, specific, precise, accurate and rugged method for the assay and determination of enantiomeric purity of S-(-)-9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl)-5-methyl-1-oxo-1H,5H-benzo [i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid L-arginine salt tetrahydrate (WCK 771) in bulk drug has been developed. The method is RP-HPLC using endcapped C-18 stationary phase and chiral mobile phase. Chirality to the mobile phase was imparted with addition of beta-cyclodextrin. The UV-vis detector was operated at 290 nm. The flow rate of mobile phase was 2 ml/min. The method offers excellent separation of two enantiomers with resolution more than 2 and tailing factor less than 1.5. The method was validated for the assay of WCK 771 and quantification of R-(+)-enantiomer impurity in bulk drug. The calibration curves showed excellent linearity over the concentration range of 0.05-0.15 mg/ml for WCK 771 and 0.5-7.5 microg/ml for R-(+)-enantiomer. The precision (RSD) of the assay was 0.23%. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation of the method for WCK 771 were 0.015 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation for R-(+)-enantiomer were 0.025 and 0.09 microg/ml, respectively. The average recovery of the R-(+)-enantiomer was 100.5%. Same method was applied for the assay and determination of enantiomeric purity of WCK 771 in the intravenous formulation.
