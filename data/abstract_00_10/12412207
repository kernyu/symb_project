Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent; although its mechanisms of action are not fully understood, many authors have described its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. More interestingly, thalidomide has shown the ability to suppress tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) production and to modify the expression of TNF alpha induced adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and on human leukocytes. Thalidomide has been used in several diseases (i.e. dermatological, autoimmune, gastrointestinal). In this review we focus specifically on the use of this drug in disorders with rheumatological features such as lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Still's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and Behcet's disease. Despite its well known side effects, first of all peripheral nerve involvement and teratogenesis, which can be avoided by following strict guidelines, thalidomide could represent an alternative drug in some rheumatological conditions, particularly in patients who show resistance, contraindication or toxicity with other conventional treatments.
