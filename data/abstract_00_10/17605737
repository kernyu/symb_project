BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection frequently complicates the postoperative course in deceased-donor liver transplantation. The incidence and risk factors of MRSA infection after Living-donor Liver transplantation (LDLT), however, are unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data from 242 adult patients who underwent LDLT at the University of Tokyo Hospital. The microbiologic and medical records of the patients from admission to 3 months after LDLT were reviewed. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors for postoperative MRSA infection. RESULTS: Postoperative MRSA infection occurred in 25 of 242 patients by median postoperative day 23. Preoperative MRSA colonization, preoperative use of antimicrobials, operation time (> or =16 h), and postoperative apheresis independently predicted postoperative MRSA infection. CONCLUSION: Surveillance culture should be checked periodically after admission to identify patients at high risk for MRSA infection and to administer appropriate antimicrobials for perioperative infection. Postoperative apheresis, suggesting postoperative liver dysfunction, predisposed patients to MRSA infection.
