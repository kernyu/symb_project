A case of pneumonia due to Mycoplasma hominis in a healthy adult is presented. The bacterium was diagnosed by a quantitative culture method and identification to the species level by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene. The objective of this presentation is to bring to attention the need to search for this opportunistic pathogen. Mycoplasma may be an important cause of bacterial pneumonia without microbiological diagnosis and its incidence may be underestimated.
