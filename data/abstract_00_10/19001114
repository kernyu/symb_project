The relative strengths of the uncommon promoters hybrid 2, hybrid 1 with an active P2 promoter (hybrid 1+P2), and strong+P2, which drive transcription of resistance genes in class 1 integrons, were evaluated using bla(GES-1) as a reporter gene cassette. Hybrid 2 was stronger than hybrid 1. Coupling P2 with the strong promoter and with hybrid 1 caused a measurable increase in GES-1 expression.
