Drugs for anti-influenza have played very important roles in influenza treatment and prevention, especially neuraminidase inhibitors are effective on both influenza A and B which have more safety and tolerance, therefore they have been widely used for influenza treatment. However, several viral drug-resistant cases have been reported. In this paper, the clinic therapy, prevention and drug resistance of neuraminidase inhibitors, including zanamivir, oseltamivir and peramivir, and progress in the research and development in our country are presented in order to promote research and development of new drugs for influenza treatment and prevention.
