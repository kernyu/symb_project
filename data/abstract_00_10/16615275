OBJECTIVE: To investigate the H2O2-induced expression of human histone acetyltransferase-like protein (hALP), a telomerase regulation-associated gene, and its effects on the stress-triggered cellular senescence. METHODS: The induced expression of hALP was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescent histochemistry after treatment of HeLa cells by H2O2. The effects of hALP expression on cellular responses to H2O2 were analyzed by MTT, flowcytometry, and SA-beta-gal staining, respectively. RESULTS: hALP mRNA could be dose-dependently induced by treatments of 0.2-1.6 mmol/L H2O2, and the induction could be observed after 6 hours and kept for 36 hours in the presence of 0.4 mmol/L H2O2. Meanwhile, the immunofluorescent staining showed marked stronger nuclear intensity of hALP protein in H2O2-treated HeLa cells. In the treatment of H2O2, the ectopic expression of hALP enhanced continuous growth and overcame G2/M arrest as well as decreased senescence-associated beta-gal staining. On the contrary, the transfected clones with antisense or blank vector and original He-La cells presented growth suppression, G2/M delay and higher percentage of SA-beta-gal activities in the presence of H2O2. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of hALP could be up-regulated by treatment of H2O2, and elevated expression could enhance cellular resistance to H2O2-induced cellular senescence. The data might be of references to elucidation of basic biological function of hALP gene and its associated telomerase activity.
