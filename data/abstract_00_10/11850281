Transient kinetic studies with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 reverse transcriptase suggest that nucleotide analogs containing the 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy ribose ring structure present in D4T (stavudine) triphosphate are among the most effective alternative substrates. For unclear reasons, however, the corresponding purine nucleoside, 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine (D4G), was found to be inactive in cell culture. We have found that the previously reported lack of activity of D4G is primarily due to solution instability, and in this report we describe a novel use of a guanosine prodrug approach to stabilize the nucleoside. D4G was modified at the 6 position of the purine ring to contain a cyclopropylamino group yielding the prodrug, cyclo-D4G. An evaluation of cyclo-D4G revealed that the prodrug possessed anti-HIV activity. In addition, cyclo-D4G had increased stability, lipophilicity, and solubility, as well as decreased toxicity relative to D4G, suggesting that further study is warranted.
