Antiviral proteins (AVPs) named CAP-I and CAP-II purified from the leaves of Chenopodium album cv Pusa Bathua-1 induced systemic resistance against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and sunnhemp rosette virus (SRV) in both hypersensitive as well as systemic hosts. An increased accumulation of two polypeptides (approximately 17 kDa and approximately 26 kDa) was observed in untreated upper leaves of Cyamopsis tetragonoloba plants whose basal leaves were treated with CAP-I/CAP-II. Both AVPs exhibited ribosomal RNA N-glycosidase activity on 28S rRNA of tobacco leaves and also caused in vitro degradation of TMV RNA. It is suggested that the CAP-I and -II are multi-functional and may be acting at multiple levels to ensure maximum possible inhibition of viral infection.
