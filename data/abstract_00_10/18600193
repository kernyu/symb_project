The bacterial agents causing bone and joint infections have been changing. Currently, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Kingella kingae are emerging pathogens. For treatment of MRSA infections, clindamycin, vancomycin, and linezolid are commonly prescribed antibiotics. Kingella are sensitive to most penicillins and cephalosporins. Because MRSA osteoarticular infections tend to be severe, longer periods of antibiotic treatment with more frequent monitoring of inflammatory markers are sometimes required to obtain a complete cure with no residual complications. To assist management, we have included a clinical decision tree with antibiotic treatment protocols.
