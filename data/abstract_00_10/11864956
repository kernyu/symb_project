Antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori has been a growing problem with current treatment regimens. However, second-line therapy for cases with eradication failure remains to be established. The aim of this study was to evaluate (in vitro) the potential use of rifampicin for H. pylori eradication. The susceptibility of 52 H. pylori strains isolated from children and adults to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and rifampicin was determined. Forty H. pylori isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were investigated for in vitro inducement of resistance. All isolates were susceptible to rifampicin. None of the H. pylori isolates tested acquired rifampicin resistance during prolonged exposure in in vitro inducement experiments. It is suggested that rifampicin has stable activity against H. pylori.
