The global dissemination of the multiply-antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 clone with the resistance genes located in a class 1 integron, here designated In104, within genomic island SGI1 is a significant public health issue. Here, we have shown that SGI1 and variants of it carrying different combinations of resistance genes are found in several Salmonella enterica serovars. These are serovars Cerro, Derby, Dusseldorf, Infantis, Kiambu, and Paratyphi B dT(+) isolated from human infections and serovar Emek from sewage effluent. Two new variants, SGI1-I and SGI1-J, both of which include the dfrA1-orfC cassette array, were identified.
