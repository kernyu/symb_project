Many different drug-resistant lines of rodent malaria are available as screening models. It is obligatory to screen new compounds for antimalarial activity against a series of resistant lines in order to identify a compound with potential for the treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) malaria infections. Instead of using a battery of resistant lines, a single MDR Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis strain that shows a wide spectrum of drug resistance to high doses of chloroquine, mepacrine, amodiaquine, mefloquine, quinine, quinidine, halofantrine as well as tetracyclines, fluoroquinolines and erythromycin, was used to assess the blood schizontocidal efficacy of a new macrolide azithromycin and other antibiotics. The present study shows that only azithromycin has the potential to control an MDR P. y. nigeriensis infection in Swiss mice, provided the treatment with a dose of 50-100 mg/kg/day by oral route is continued for a period of 7 days. Tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycyline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, although active in vitro, failed to protect the mice. Tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin combinations with chloroquine did not control the infection. Additionally, the antimalarial efficacy of azithromycin can be potentiated with the addition of arteether, which is an ethyl ether derivative of artemisinin. A total (100%) curative effect has been obtained with a shorter regimen of 4 days only.
