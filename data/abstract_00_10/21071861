Agrobacterium tumefaciens was used to transform the vegetative dikaryotic mycelium of Flammulina velutipes using a hygromycin B resistance gene as selectable marker. The gene coding for urogen III methyltransferase (cob) was introduced into F. velutipes dikaryotic cells. The resulting transformant cells generated a bright red fluorescence, indicating that cob is promising as a reporter gene in F. velutipes.
