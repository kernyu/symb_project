Week 48 HIV-RNA treatment response to the protease inhibitor tipranavir co-administered with ritonavir was compared with that of lopinavir co-administered with ritonavir in patients whose baseline isolates had varying lopinavir genotypic mutation scores. With increasing lopinavir mutation scores, the proportion of patients achieving a week 48 treatment response was increased in the tipranavir/ritonavir compared with the lopinavir/ritonavir arm. Tipranavir/ritonavir therapy improves treatment response rates compared with lopinavir/ritonavir in patients whose viruses have reduced susceptibility to lopinavir/ritonavir.
