An eight-year-old neutered female Persian cat with a four-year history of relapsing skin disease, characterised by ulcerated nodules with a yellow granular discharge, was examined. A diagnosis of granulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis (pseudomycetoma) caused by Microsporum canis was made on the basis of history, clinical signs, histopathological examination of skin biopsy specimens and culture of macerated tissue. Because previous therapy, comprising repeated surgical excision and the administration of griseofulvin and itraconazole, had not been successful, terbinafine was administered for an eight-month period. However, lesions progressed despite this treatment and the cat was euthanased.
