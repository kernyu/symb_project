The Infectious Diseases Society of America has published guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. Recommendations are that for healthy, adult, nonpregnant women with bacterial cystitis, 3 days of trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) or trimethoprim alone is standard therapy in those regions where less than 10% to 20% of Escherichia coli that cause such infections is resistant to TMP/SMZ. In those regions where resistance is more than 10% to 20%, the committee recommended using an oral fluoroquinolone for 3 days, and that alternatives such as nitrofurantoin for 7 days or fosfomycin as single-dose therapy need more study. These recommendations were established in the late 1990s as resistance to TMP/SMZ among uropathogens was increasing in the United States, a phenomenon earlier observed in other parts of the world. Clinicians should be alert to patients infected with possibly resistant organisms, eg, patients who have recently been hospitalized or are receiving antibiotics.
