The prevalence and cotrimoxazole susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from sputum of 100 HIV-positive patients attending the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research clinic was investigated using standard microbiological methods. Eleven of the sputum specimens grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that all the isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin, augmentin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol but were resistant to cotrimoxazole. Continuous surveillance of S pneumoniae in sputum samples of HIV-positive subjects in this environment is necessary in order to regulate treatment regimen, considering that cotrimoxazole is the drug recommended by WHO for respiratory infections in HIV patients.
