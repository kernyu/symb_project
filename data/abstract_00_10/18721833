The medical device-related infections are frequently a consequence of Staphylococcus biofilm, a lifestyle enhancing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Antibiotic susceptibility tests are usually performed on planktonic forms of clinical isolates. Some methods have been developed to perform antibiotic susceptibility tests on biofilm. However, none of them counts bacterial inoculum. As antibiotic susceptibility is related to bacterial inoculum, the test results could be mistaken. Here, a new method, BioTimer Assay (BTA), able to count bacteria in biofilm without any manipulation of samples, is presented. Moreover, the BTA method is applied to analyze antibiotic susceptibility of six Staphylococcus strains in biofilm and to determine the number of viable bacteria in the presence of sub-inhibitory doses of four different antibiotics. To validate BTA, the new method was compared to reference methods both for counting and antibiotic susceptibility tests. A high agreement between BTA and reference methods is found on planktonic forms. Therefore, BTA was employed to count bacteria in biofilm and to analyze biofilm antibiotic susceptibility. Results confirm the high resistance to antibiotics of Staphylococcus biofilm. Moreover, BTA counts the number of viable bacteria in the presence of sub-inhibitory doses of antibiotics. The results show that the number of viable bacteria depends on sub-inhibitory doses, age of biofilm and type of antibiotic. In particular, differently to gentamicin and ampicillin, sub-inhibitory doses of ofloxacin and azithromycin reduce the number of viable bacteria at lower extent in young than in old biofilm. In conclusion, BTA is a reliable, rapid, easy-to-perform, and versatile method, and it can be considered a useful tool to analyze antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus spp. in biofilm.
