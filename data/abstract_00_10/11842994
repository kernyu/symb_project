Contamination in an intensive care unit caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii complex (MRAB)-colonized patients was evaluated using environmental and patient cultures. MRAB occurred in 21% of patients' cultures, 2.1% of 513 areas surrounding MRAB-patients, and one of 372 common areas. No transmission to other patients occurred. Barrier precautions and ethanol disinfection may prevent dissemination.
