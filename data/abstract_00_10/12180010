Cycloheximide in the concentration inhibiting protein synthesis and frost resistance of plants proved to prevent formation of cell and chloroplast structures specific for the plants adapted to frost. Important role of structural rearrangement of the cells during hardening preventing intracellular ice nucleation is proposed.
