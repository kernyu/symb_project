Due to its function, anatomy, and exposition to multiple pathogens, the hand is highly susceptible to infection. Most of these infections are post-traumatic. Isolates of pathogens from infected hands contain mainly Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci. We find Pasteurella canis and P. multocida from cat and dog bite wounds and Eikenella corrodens from human bite wounds. The "fight-bite clenched fist" wound, with penetration of the metacarpophalangeal joint and its high risk of septic arthritis, has always to be suspected when patients present with human bites. The therapy of hand infection is based on three principles: surgical treatment, adequate antimicrobial therapy, and early physiotherapy. Early infectious conditions of the hand, e.g. cellulitis and early paronychia, may be treated without surgery. Antimicrobial treatment must be specific for the pathogen and its resistance to antimicrobial agents. Bite wounds should be treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors. Staphylococci and streptococci can be covered by first and second generation cephalosporins. The increasing resistance of staphylococci to antibiotics has to be taken into account. Infections with anaerobic and gas-producing bacteria are rare but occur predominantly in diabetics and immune-compromised individuals.
