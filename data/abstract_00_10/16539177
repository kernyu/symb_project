The aim of the study was to perform microbiological and molecular analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains isolated from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis originating from two different regions of Silesia voivodship in 2000 year. One of 135 strains subjected to the study lacked IS6110 insertion sequence. Its belonging to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was confirmed by positive test for specific gyrB gene sequence. Strain resistance analysis revealed that in previously diagnosed patients resistance to streptomycin (16,2%) was more frequent than other. In contrast to never treated patients group where the prevalence of resistance to isoniazid was the most frequent (4,5%). In both group of patients resistance to rifampin or ethambutol was not detected. The multidrug resistance strains (4,6%) were detected only in the previously diagnosed group. Combined analysis of microbiological, epidemiological and molecular data are essential for creation of functional registry of patients infected with resistant Mycobacteria, giving the possibility of surveillance of drug resistant tuberculosis in populations.
