We analyzed the development of nevirapine (NVP) resistance in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected Malawian infants who received regimens containing single-dose NVP (SD-NVP) for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1. All infants received SD-NVP, and some randomly received zidovudine (ZDV) as well. Mothers did or did not receive SD-NVP on the basis of when they arrived at the hospital for delivery. In infants 6-8 weeks of age, NVP resistance was less frequent when infants had received SD-NVP plus ZDV and mothers had not received SD-NVP than when infants had received SD-NVP alone and mothers had received SD-NVP (4/15 [27%] vs. 20/23 [87%]; P < .001). The risk of MTCT of HIV-1 was comparable with these regimens. Infant-only prophylaxis also eliminates the development of NVP resistance in mothers.
