Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (serotype A) was isolated from 12 soil samples mixed with pigeon droppings (16.9%) from 71 soil samples in Barcelona and rural areas of Catalonia. C. neoformans was not isolated from indoor dust and Eucalyptus debris. PCR fingerprinting was performed in 22 representative isolates and all of them corresponded to the VNI pattern. Susceptibility testing for the 22 isolates of C. neoformans var. grubii showed that all of them were susceptible to amphotericin B. Three isolates presented MICs (Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations) > or = 1 microg/ml to Itraconazole, five MICs > or = 1 microg/ml to ketoconazole and four were fluconazole resistant, (MICs > or = 64 microg/ml), while three of them were shown to have MICs > or = 1 microg/ml to voriconazole. In spite that all isolates presented the same DNA fingerprinting pattern, the susceptibility to antifungals is very variable. The possibility of acquiring cryptococcosis infection with primarily resistant environment strains is feasible.
