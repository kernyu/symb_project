OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inhibitory effect of cyclosporin A on p-glycoprotein function in peripheral nerves (VIIth, VIIIth and sciatic nerves). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Male mdr1a(-/-) and mdr1a(+/+) FVB mice were used. Doxorubicin (30 mg/kg) was administered intravenously with or without i.p. administration of cyclosporin A (200 mg/kg). Vinblastine (5 mg/kg) was also administered intravenously with or without i.p. administration of cyclosporin A (200 mg/kg). RESULTS: Tissue concentrations of doxorubicin and vinblastine in peripheral nerves of the mdr1a(+/+) mice pretreated with 200 mg/kg cyclosporin A were significantly higher than those in the mdr1a(+/+) mice administered doxorubicin or vinblastine alone, suggesting that cyclosporin A inhibited the efflux pump function of p-glycoprotein in the peripheral nerves. In the mdr1a(-/-) mice, tissue concentrations of doxorubicin and vinblastine in peripheral nerves were also significantly higher than those in the mdr1a(+/+) mice administered doxorubicin or vinblastine alone. Based on these results, it is suggested that p-glycoprotein plays an important role in blood-nerve barrier function by preventing side-effects induced by neurotoxic drugs. CONCLUSION: When doxorubicin and vinblastine are co-administered with cyclosporin A, the patient should be carefully monitored because peripheral nerve disorders may be induced.
