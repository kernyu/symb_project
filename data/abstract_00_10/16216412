The potential of purifying phenol aqueous solutions (0.0006-0.0064 M) using ultraviolet (UV) radiation and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 0.005-0.073 M) was investigated. Although the direct photolysis of phenol and its oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (without ultraviolet light) were insignificant, the combination of UV and H2O2 was extremely effective on phenol degradation. However, the chemical oxygen demand was on no occasion entirely eliminated, indicating the resistance of the intermediate products formed to the photo-oxidation. Increasing the initial concentration of phenol had as a result lower phenol conversions achieved, whereas the increase in hydrogen peroxide initial concentration enhanced significantly the degradation of phenol. In contrast, COD removal was less sensitive to these changes.
