AIM: To investigate the effect of different proton pump inhibitors, S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19) genotype and antibiotic susceptibility on the eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-seven H. pylori-infected peptic ulcer patients were randomly treated with either rabeprazole (10 mg b.d.) or lansoprazole (30 mg b.d.) plus amoxicillin (750 mg b.d.) and clarithromycin (400 mg b.d.) for 1 week. The antibiotic susceptibility and CYP2C19 genotype (extensive or poor metabolizer) were investigated. RESULTS: The eradication rates in the rabeprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin (RAC) and lansoprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin (LAC) groups were 75% and 69%, respectively, on an intention-to-treat basis, and 80% and 75%, respectively, on a per protocol basis. The eradication rate for clarithromycin-resistant strains was significantly lower than that for clarithromycin-sensitive strains (24% vs. 86%, P < 0.05). For clarithromycin-sensitive strains in the LAC group, there was a tendency for a lower eradication rate in extensive than poor metabolizers. The eradication rate in extensive metabolizers in the RAC group tended to be higher than that in extensive metabolizers in the LAC group (89% vs. 78%, P = 0.079726). CONCLUSIONS: The success of the 1-week proton pump inhibitor-amoxicillin-clarithromycin regimen depends on the susceptibility of H. pylori to clarithromycin. Moreover, differences in CYP2C19 genotype influence the eradication rates of lansoprazole-based therapy, and the rabeprazole-based regimen has an advantage especially in extensive metabolizers.
