Kaposi sarcoma commonly occurs in HIV-positive and immunocompromised patients. We describe a case of Kaposi sarcoma that developed in an HIV-negative patient with tuberculosis. The Kaposi sarcoma completely regressed with antituberculous therapy without the institution of chemotherapy. The patient remained disease-free after a follow-up period of 20 months. Patients with Kaposi sarcoma should be monitored for coexisting diseases such as tuberculosis.
