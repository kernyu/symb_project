The disk screening methods for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains were evaluated. The confirmatory work is reduced significantly in settings such as those in this study, by changing the cefpodoxime breakpoint to < or =20 mm and by not testing cefoxitin-resistant isolates. Cefotaxime and ceftazidime disk screening is reliable, and the laboratory-prepared cefotaxime- and ceftazidime-clavulanic acid disks are stable at -20 degrees C for 12 weeks.
