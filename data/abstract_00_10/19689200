HIV-1 from infected subjects has been characterized in order to provide a more accurate view of the strains that are currently found in a given region. In this report, we focused on characterizing the pol gene diversity obtained from newly diagnosed patients in Santos metropolitan area, Brazil. This region is composed of nine cities and an international port. Analysis of the 33 samples revealed that 22 strains belonged to subtype B, 4 to subtype F, and 2 to subtype C; 5 strains were B/F recombinants. Our results demonstrated that 18.2% of samples were primary antiretroviral resistance genotypic mutations, with high-level resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors in both subtypes B and F and in recombinant forms B/F. Our data revealed that the primary antiretroviral resistance genotypic mutations should be carefully investigated in developing countries with widespread access to antiretrovirals, such as Brazil.
