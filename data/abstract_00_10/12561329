We studied the effects of exogenous salicylic acid on the level of endogenous cytokinins and abscisic and salicylic acids in the tissues of leaves of phloxes contrasting in resistance against the powdery mildew causative agent: susceptible Phlox paniculata L. and resistant Ph. setacea L. Studies were carried out under the conditions of biotic stress. The initial level of salicylic and abscisic acids and cytokinins is the highest in the resistant phlox species. After treatment with salicylic species, the total level of cytokinins and endogenous salicylic acid increased in both species. When the treated phlox species were infected by the powdery mildew causative agent, the level of abscisic and salicylic acids increased in the susceptible Ph. paniculata, while that of cytokinins increased in the resistant Ph. setacea. The role of salicylic acid in the induction of plant defense reactions against phytopathogens is discussed.
