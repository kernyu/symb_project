Two hundred thirty-one Campylobacter were isolated from acute diarrheic patients between January 2001 and December 2005. We evaluated annual changes in identified species of Campylobacter and their susceptibilities against antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni (219 strains; 94.8%) and Campylobacter coli (12 strains; 5.2%) were identified to the species. Susceptibilities to four antimicrobial agents, minocycline (MINO), levofloxacin (LVFX), erythromycin (EM) and clindamycin (CLDM) were examined. The resistant rates of four antimicrobial agents in C. coli were significantly higher than that in C. jejuni. The susceptibility of C. jejuni to LVFX was variable, and MICs gave a bimodal distribution. The resistant rate against EM was estimated to be 9.2% in C. jejuni, 66.7% in C. coli. Moreover, young people ranging from 19 to 24 years old were predominant (47.7%) among the Campylobacter enteritis patients.
