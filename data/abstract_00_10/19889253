Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and is usually acquired via the woman's birth canal. GBS serotypes isolated from 200 pregnant women were determined. Serotypes V (19%) and VI (17%) were the most frequent followed by serotypes III (12%), Ia (11.5%) and IV (10%); 17% of the strains were non-typable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, 96% to erythromycin and 97.5% to clindamycin. The emergence of new GBS serotypes has important implications for vaccine prevention strategies.
