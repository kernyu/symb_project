The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in foods of animal origin is a potential health threat because resistance can be transferred among bacteria, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens may not respond to antibiotic treatments. Thirteen brands of ready-to-eat shrimp representing four countries of origin were obtained from local grocery stores. Total heterotrophic plate counts were determined, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria were isolated. Total heterotrophic colony counts ranged from 3.3 to 5.6 log CFU/g, which was within approved quality limits. A total of 1,564 isolates representing 162 bacterial species were recovered during screening of resistance to 10 antibiotics: ampicillin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and vancomycin. Six hundred fifty-seven (42%) of the isolates and 131 (81%) of the species had acquired resistance to antibiotics. Numerous resistant human pathogens were isolated, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus spp., and Vibrio spp. Nonresistant Yersinia spp. also were isolated. Ready-to-eat shrimp is sold with instructions to thaw the product before serving, which may result in consumer exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Widespread trade of this product provides an avenue for international dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
