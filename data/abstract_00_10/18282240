We conducted a prospective study in four urban health care centres between January 2004 and November 2005 to determine the distribution and susceptibility patterns of Shigella strains causing invasive diarrhoea in Bangui, Central African Republic. Of the 155 Shigella isolated, Shigella flexneri (51%) and Shigella dysenteriae (30%) were the most common and the most resistant to usual antibiotics, including amoxicillin, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim and chloramphenicol. Though multi-drug resistance was common, no strains were resistant to quinolone and fluoroquinolones. We conclude that short-course treatments with ciprofloxacin can be recommended in Bangui for treatment of invasive diarrhoea.
