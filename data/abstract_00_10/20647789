The challenges in managing patients with infection in the intensive care unit are increased in an era where there are dwindling antimicrobial choices for multidrug-resistant pathogens. Clinicians in the intensive care unit must balance between choosing appropriate antimicrobial treatment for patients with suspected infection and utilizing antimicrobials in a judicious fashion. Improving antimicrobial utilization is a critical component to reducing antimicrobial resistance. Although providing effective antimicrobial therapy and improving antimicrobial utilization may seem to be competing goals, there are effective strategies to accomplish both. Antimicrobial stewardship programs provide an organized way to implement these strategies and can enhance the intensive care unit physician's success in improving patient outcomes and combating antimicrobial resistance in the intensive care unit.
