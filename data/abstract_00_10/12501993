Fifty eight enterococcal isolates from wild herbivores were tested for their antibiotic sensitivity pattern and lectin-like binding of extracellular matrix (ECM) and serum proteins. Kanamycin resistance was very frequent; many multiresistant strains were also isolated. All isolates were sensitive to rifampicin. Resistance to gentamicin, novobiocin, and tetracycline was widely distributed in the microflora of wild herbivores breeded in zoological garden in Kosice. No autoaggregating strains were detected among these 58 enterococcal isolates. Various degrees of binding of mucins, fetuin, heparin, fibrinogen, and fibronectin were observed in individual strains. However, bovine lactoferrin binding by enterococci from deers and chamoises was either negative (0) or strongly positive (3). With regard to influence of growth media, TH agar was found to be better for the expression of lectin-like binding than blood agar, TH broth and Nutrient broth. A significant effect (P < 0.001 or P < 0.05) of proteolytic treatment was observed in six selected strains. However, there is a difference between the effect of trypsin and pronase P. Pronase treatment more effectively decreased binding of some strains (1H, 6A, EF 1111, EC 1292), while trypsin treatment decreased more binding of other enterococcal strains (EF 953 and 1E). Significant (P < 0.001) influence of metaperiodate, which cleaves the C-C bond between vicinal groups of sugars, on collagen I binding by three selected strains (1E, 1H, 6A) and bovine lactoferrin binding (by EF 1111, EC 1292, EF 953) was also observed. However, its influence was very different. In two strains (1H and EC 1292), ECM binding was decreased, while in four other strains (1E, 6A, EF 1111, EF 953) it was increased.
