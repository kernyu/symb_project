We believe, especially in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, that the integration of PK/PD models and stochastic techniques provides a powerful new tool to clinicians, researchers, and regulatory agencies alike. By using techniques such as these, we can begin to level the playing field so that PK/PD measures for therapeutic agents can be more accurately compared with greater certainty, and not be limited to discussions of susceptibility method variation or comparisons of MIC results.
