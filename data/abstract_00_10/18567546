5-Enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase is an essential enzyme of the shikimate pathway and is the target for the herbicide, glyphosate. Several glyphosate-insensitive forms of Escherichia coli EPSP synthase had been reported in the literatures. In the present study the function and structure of wild type enzyme and three different mutated variants (G96A, A183T and G96A/A183T) were compared. Results showed that G96A and G96A/A183T variants are insensitive to glyphosate but display a 31- and 8-fold lower affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as substrate, respectively. In addition, chemical stability of the enzyme variants against Gdn-HCl revealed more stability of the wild type and G96A variant when compared to the G96A/A183T and A183T variants. Comparison of the enzymes containing Ala183Thr replacement with the wild type showed a lower resistance to digestion by the proteases. Moreover, with respect to fluorescence quenching by acrylamide, A183T and G96A/A183T variants were characterized by a higher structural flexibility and more exposure of tryptophan residues to the solvent. In addition, based on the results of circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence studies, these two variants represent a significant decrease of secondary structures and changes in the tertiary structure as compared to the wild type and the G96A variant.
