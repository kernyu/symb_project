Outbreaks of Acinetobacter baumannii demonstrating multiple antibiotic resistance, including meropenem resistance, have been described as severe therapeutic problems. Here we describe a monoclonal outbreak of infection and colonization with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii over a two-month period. Resistance to meropenem was mediated by expression of a metallo-beta-lactamase enzyme. Four of 14 patients showed clinical signs of infection and two died. Contamination of the environment, water, or instruments were excluded as causes of the outbreak. All patients, except one, underwent surgery in a specific operation theatre where surgery of contamination class IV (infected, dirty) was performed. Although individual surgeon error was eliminated, analyses of the patients' histories suggested that bacterial transmission had occurred during surgery. Five patients showed signs of A. baumannii infection and two of these patients suffered from large abdominal wounds infected with a high density of A. baumannii requiring repeated revisions. Presumably, these revisions favoured the transmission of A. baumannii, which is remarkably resistant to various environmental stresses including soaps, disinfectants and dry conditions. No case of meropenem-resistant A. baumannii had been observed in the hospital before the outbreak. Interestingly, the resistant bacteria appear to have been imported by a patient returning from West Africa. This indicates that, similar to MRSA, multiresistant A. baumannii may be introduced by patients from foreign hospitals. The outbreak was stopped in the following months by reinforcing standard procedures and by taking all necessary precautions such as patient isolation, and finally only one new case was detected.
