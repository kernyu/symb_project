Allogeneic stem cell transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) can be offered to patients who are ineligible for high-dose conditioning because of their age or comorbidities. Malignant haematological diseases have so far been the most common indication of this new treatment modality; it has been less often used for nonmalignant diseases, and there are only a few reports of RIC and allotransplantation to treat acquired severe aplastic anaemia (SAA). We report two elderly patients (62 and 65 years of age) with SAA who underwent RIC (fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + ATG) and HLA-identical sibling allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation. Two important findings emerged. First, both of our patients who had failed standard immunological treatments and had a heavy transfusion history experienced successful engraftment after RIC and blood allografting, and one of them continues in full haematological remission 20+ months post-transplant. Secondly, the other patient died of Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) soon after engraftment, which implies that even if PTLD has been described in only few single cases after RIC, it may also complicate RIC allotransplants.
