BACKGROUND: A survey of 400 growers of maize, soybeans and cotton was made in the United States to determine perceptions, experiences and management practices with glyphosate-resistant weeds. The survey included growers in the north (corn belt) and south (cotton belt) of the USA in spring 2006. RESULTS: Interestingly, 24 and 39% of northern and southern growers, respectively, assumed they had glyphosate weed resistance on their farm. Of the 200 southern growers interviewed, 67% had planted continuous glyphosate-resistant (GR) crops for a period of 3-5 years. According to the survey respondents, the key method for managing glyphosate-resistant weeds was to rotate to other herbicides. CONCLUSION: Growers do value GR crop technology but are adopting measures to manage resistance only as needed.
