OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication rates in northern Sardinia using standard 1-wk triple therapies (i.e., a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics) are typically <60%, primarily because of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to test b.i.d. quadruple therapy as primary and as salvage therapy in this population. METHODS: This was a prospective, single center study of consecutive dyspeptic H. pylori-infected patients. Therapy consisted of omeprazole 20 mg, tetracycline 500 mg, metronidazole 500 mg, and bismuth subcitrate caplets 240 mg, all b.i.d. with the midday and evening meals for 14 days. H. pylori status was evaluated by 13C-urea breath test and histology before and 4-6 wk after therapy. Eradication was defined as no positive test. RESULTS: We enrolled 118 consecutive dyspeptic patients (mean age 46 yr; 73 men, including 15 with peptic ulcer disease). Of the patients, 42 (38%) had failed prior therapy: twice in 21 cases, three times in 12, and four or more times in nine. The intention-to-treat cure rate was 95% (110 of 116) (95% CI = 90-98%) overall, and 98% per protocol, irrespective of diagnosis, age, prior treatment failure, or smoking status. Moderate or severe side effects were experienced by only 5% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bismuth subcitrate-based b.i.d. quadruple therapy was an excellent primary and salvage therapy and should be considered as first line therapy.
