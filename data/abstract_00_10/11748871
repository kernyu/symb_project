The paper presents the proposal for a method for testing the resistance of materials used for the production of protective clothing and gloves to penetration by concentrated chemical preparations of pesticides. It has been based to a large extent on the recommendations of European standards, with certain modifications resulting from the specific properties of non-volatile and non-water-soluble biologically-active components of pesticides. These modifications primarily involved the use of a solid sorption medium and adjustment of research apparatus to the research conditions consistent with the proposed method. The results of preliminary studies on penetration of the selected biologically-active components of pesticides (dichlorvos, 2,4-D, cypermethrin, carbofuran) through the selected protective materials (fabric coated with viton and butyl on both sides, rubberised fabric, butyl rubber) are presented. The study confirmed the usefulness of the proposed method for testing the resistance of materials protecting against the effect of pesticides.
