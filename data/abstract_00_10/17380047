Legionella pneumophila is the etiologic agent of Legionnaires' disease. This bacterium contains a single monopolar flagellum, of which the FlaA subunit is a major protein constituent. The murine macrophage resistance against this bacterium is controlled by the Birc1e/Naip5 gene, which belongs to the NOD family. We evaluated the intracellular growth of the flaA mutant bacteria as well as another aflagellated fliA mutant, within bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice with an intact (C57BL/6, BALB/c) or mutated (A/J) Birc1e/Naip5 gene. The flaA mutant L. pneumophila multiplied within C57BL/6 and BALB/c macrophages while the wild-type strain did not. Cell viability was not impaired until 3 days after infection when the flaA mutant bacteria replicated 10(2-3)-fold in macrophages, implying that L. pneumophila inhibited host cell death during the early phase of intracellular replication. The addition of recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to the infected macrophages restricted replication of the flaA mutant within macrophages; these treated cells also showed enhanced nitric oxide production, although inhibition of nitric oxide production did not affect the IFN-gamma induced inhibition of Legionella replication. These findings suggested that IFN-gamma activated macrophages to restrict the intracellular growth of the L. pneumophila flaA mutant by a NO independent pathway.
