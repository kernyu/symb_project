Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production by Klebsiella sp. and E. coli is an emerging problem. In this study, 107 clinical isolates (53 E. coli, 47 K. pneumoniae and 7 K. oxytoca) screened as ESBL producers by the NCCLS disk diffusion procedure were submitted to a double disk confirmatory test (DDT) and to the E-test double strip for confirmation of ESBL production by demonstration of clavulanic acid inhibition effect (CAIE). Only 72/107 (67%) of the isolates were confirmed as ESBL producers by DDT, with diverse results among species. By the E-test, 58/107 (54%) isolates were confirmed as ESBL producers, and 18/107 (17%) were not determinable. Susceptibility to cefoxitin was found in 57/68 (83%) of strains that did not show CAIE. ESBL detection remains a controversial issue and clinical laboratories are in need of a simple and effective way to recognize strains with this kind of resistance.
