INTRODUCTION: During recent years a rise in the occurrence of candidaemia has been reported in the USA as well as in Europe, and especially in intensive care units (ICUs). The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of candidaemia and related Candida infections in the hospitals of Aarhus County, Denmark, from 1993 to 2002, and to assess possible causal factors, among these the consumption of antimicrobial agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material included blood cultures carried out at the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH), during the study period, plus Candida-positive cultures from other normally sterile sites from patients with candidaemia. Microbiological findings were compiled from our laboratory information system, MADS. Information regarding the use of antimicrobial agents in the hospitals of Aarhus County was obtained from the University Hospital pharmacy and the Danish Medicines Agency Web site. RESULTS: During the study period the fraction of positive blood cultures was constant, while the fraction of positive cultures yielding Candida species increased from 1.8% to 3.4%, with an especially marked increase among patients in AUH. An increase in the proportion of Candida non-albicans species compared to C. albicans was noted, and it was also noted that the consumption of antimicrobial agents had risen markedly during the period. DISCUSSION: The present study adds to the assumption of a causal relationship between candidaemia and the use of antimicrobials and foreign bodies.
