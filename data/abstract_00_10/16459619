Bioinert polyelectrolyte multilayers comprised of poly(acrylic acid) and polyacrylamide were deposited on colloidal particles (1.7 microm in diameter) at low pH conditions by layer-by-layer assembly using hydrogen-bonding interactions. The multilayer films were coated uniformly on the colloidal particles without causing any flocculation of the colloids, and the deposited films were subsequently cross-linked by a single treatment of a carbodiimide aqueous solution. The lightly cross-linked multilayer films show excellent stability at physiological conditions (pH 7.4, phosphate-buffered saline), whereas untreated multilayer films dissolved. The multilayer-coated surfaces, both on flat substrates and on colloidal particles, exhibit excellent resistance toward mammalian cell adhesion. With this new solution-based cross-linking method, bioinert H-bonded multilayer coatings offer potential for biomedical applications.
