OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae of simulated amoxicillin serum concentrations obtained in humans after 2000/125 mg sustained-release (SR) and 875/125 mg co-amoxiclav administered twice and three times a day, respectively. METHODS: An in vitro computerized pharmacodynamic simulation was carried out and colony counts were determined over 24 h. Ten strains non-susceptible to amoxicillin (four of them exhibiting an MIC of 4 mg/L, five strains with an MIC of 8 mg/L and one strain with an MIC of 16 mg/L) were used. RESULTS: With amoxicillin 2000 mg, an initial inoculum reduction >99.99% was obtained for strains with an MIC of 4 mg/L, > or =99% for strains with an MIC of 8 mg/L and 70.6% for the strain with an MIC of 16 mg/L at 24 h sampling time. At this sampling time, no reduction of initial inocula was obtained with amoxicillin 875 mg/8 h for two of the four strains with an MIC of 4 mg/L, three of the five strains with an MIC of 8 mg/L or for the strain with an MIC of 16 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: The new co-amoxiclav 2000/125 mg SR formulation appears to offer advantages versus previous formulations with respect to bactericidal activity against current amoxicillin non-susceptible strains.
