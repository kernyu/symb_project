Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged in the last decades as a major cause of healthcare-associated infections and nosocomial outbreaks. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii is a rapidly emerging pathogen in healthcare settings, where it causes infections that include bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, and urinary tract and wound infections. Antimicrobial resistance poses great limits for therapeutic options in infected patients, especially if the isolates are resistant to the carbapenems. Other therapeutic options include sulbactam, aminoglycosides, polymixyns and tigecycline. The discovery of new therapies coupled with the development of controlled clinical trial antibiotic testing combinations and the prevention of transmission of MDR Acinetobacter infection are essential to face this important hospital problem.
