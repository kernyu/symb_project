The drug sensitiveness to beta-lactam antibiotics of the bacterial flora, taken by sinus puncture from 115 patients with unior bilateral acute exacerbation of chronic maxillary sinusitis was analysed. About 90% of the isolated pathogens, as well as in subgroup treated with amoxicillin with potassium clavulanate and in subgroup treated with cefuroxime axetil showed antibiotic sensitivity. Among isolated pathogens before the treatment, 4 (9.5%) were resistant to the amoxicillin with potassium clavulanate disks in subgroup A and 3 (7.3%) to the cefuroxime axetil in subgroup B. There was only one pathogen isolated in the control evaluation in both group after the treatment.
