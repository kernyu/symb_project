The effect of a native peanut (Arachis hypogaea) microsymbiont strain (streptomycin resistant mutant) introduced into acid soil on the indigenous micro-organism population as well as the survival of this isolate was studied. Although the isolate survived at a fairly low population level after the 3 month period of soil incubation, it maintained its antibiotic resistance. Slight changes in the total bacteria and fungi soil populations as a result of this inoculation were also detected.
