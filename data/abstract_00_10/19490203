The increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance in general, and that of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in particular, is raising significant medical, economical and public health challenges worldwide, both within hospitals and throughout the community. These considerations, along with the extensive time and costs associated with the development and approval of new therapeutic agents, represent some of the major reasons why understanding the advantages and limitations of new antibiotics, ensuring their judicious use and maximising their active shelf life should become global priorities. On March 18, 2008, the Food and Drug Administration issued an approvable letter for ceftobiprole, a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic active against MRSA and other clinically relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Ceftobiprole is currently available only for parenteral administration, and besides its remarkable antimicrobial spectrum, this antibiotic possesses additional desirable characteristics, such as low propensity to select for resistance, efficacy in animal models of disease and good safety profile. Furthermore, in recently completed clinical trials, ceftobiprole demonstrated non-inferiority to comparator compounds such as vancomycin, and emerged as a promising clinical option of monotherapy for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired pneumonia. Here, we discuss some of the most important clinically relevant findings on ceftobiprole obtained from in vitro studies, animal models of disease and recently completed phase III clinical trials.
