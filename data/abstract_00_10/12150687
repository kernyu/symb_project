Bacterial pathogens are isolated from middle ear fluid in up to 90% of children with acute otitis media (OM). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis predominate. Acute OM can be classified as uncomplicated, persistent, recurrent or chronic. Patient age, symptom severity, prior treatment history and exposure through day-care attendance in children influences pathogen distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and anticipated clinical and microbiological responses to empirical and pathogen-directed therapies. The natural history of acute OM without intervention is favourable. However, meta-analysis of clinical trials shows an improvement in symptom and middle ear effusion resolution with antimicrobials. Aminopenicillins, cephalosporins and macrolides are often selected as therapy for acute OM. The various agents have differing activity against acute OM pathogens, particularly organisms with resistance mechanisms and they differ in dosing schedule, side effects and compliance enhancing factors. Consideration should be given to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles in antibiotic selection. Selection criteria include antibiotic activity against drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and efficacy against beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative organisms. The necessary duration of treatment for acute OM varies according to multiple factors, including local preferences, but there is growing, compelling data to support short-course therapy. Tympanocentesis has been endorsed in various guidelines as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Best-practice for management of acute OM continues to advocate antibiotic therapy with careful, accurate diagnosis and consideration of the major pathogens and their mechanisms of resistance.
