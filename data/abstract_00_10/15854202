Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) is a common complication of viral upper respiratory tract infections and represents a considerable social burden both in terms of diminished quality of life for the patient and the economic implications of decreased productivity and treatment costs. Several national health authorities have developed guidelines for the management of ABS, which aim to promote rational selection of anti-bacterial therapy to optimise clinical outcomes while minimising the potential for selection of anti-bacterial resistance as a result of inappropriate anti-bacterial usage. This article provides an overview of current guidelines, with particular focus on the clinical significance of variations in treatment recommendations and new treatment options, such as the ketolide telithromycin, which was recently added to a number of national treatment guidelines.
