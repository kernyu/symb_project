Because of the increasing incidence of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, dermatologists will be increasingly confronted with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains which display a great variability of their virulence factors. In view of the high mortality of systemic MRSA infections (estimated 700-1.500 deaths per year in Germany), dermatologists should be well aware of the various aspects of diagnosis, therapy and prevention of this problem bacteria. Adequate screening measures must be in place to identify high-risk patients and institute appropriate prophylactic measures and therapy. If only colonization is present, topical antiseptic measures are sufficient. If an infection is present, either systemic or topical therapeutic approaches may be indicated. We review the role of MRSA infection and colonization in skin diseases.
