OBJECTIVES: Dalbavancin is a novel, semi-synthetic glycopeptide antibiotic. The aim of this study was to further explore its activity against staphylococci. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of dalbavancin was studied using MBC and time-kill methods. The potential for resistance to dalbavancin was examined using single-step and serial-passage experiments. RESULTS: Dalbavancin was bactericidal against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in both the presence and absence of human serum. No resistance was seen with any isolate tested. After serial passage, bacterial populations were more homogeneous in their susceptibility to dalbavancin than to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: Dalbavancin is bactericidal for staphylococci. Resistance to this semi-synthetic glycopeptide is not readily developed in vitro.
