We constructed a series of deletion mutants lacking all of the four major mex operons for Mex multidrug efflux pumps or possessing each one of the operons from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The drug specificity of MexAB-OprM, MexXY-OprM and MexCD-OprJ was investigated. Surprisingly, we found that the MexCD-OprJ was an inducible pump, inducers of which were tetraphenylphosphonium chloride, ethidium bromide, rhodamine 6G and acriflavine. Fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline were not inducers although they were substrates of MexCD-OprJ.
