The most frequent and serious complication after burn injury is infection. Bacteriological monitoring of patients after burn injury is part of complex care. The algorithm of bacteriological checkups is set. Burned areas are microbiologically monitored by semi quantitative imprint method. Colonization is proportional to the length of patient's hospital stay. Resistance of the bacteria to antibiotics is usually higher in burn units than in other departments. That is why it is important to consider antibiotic treatment and strictly observe sensitivity by obtaining bacteriological results and current epidemiological situation. Burned patients are in danger of infection from the burned areas, respiratory tract, urinary tract and central venous catheters. Attending doctor should daily be in contact with the bacteriological laboratory.
