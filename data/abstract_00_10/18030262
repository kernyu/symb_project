Str. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to penicillin, all to also ofloxacin and chloramphenicol and cefotaxim and 39 (100%) to cotrimoxazol. Concerning S. aureus, all isolates 22 were susceptible to oxacillin and chloramphenicol, and 21 also to cotrimoxazol. All N. meningitidis isolates but one-10 of all were susceptible to penicillin, all to cefotaxim, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazol. All H.influenzae isolates were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol, as well as to ofloxacin and cotrimoxazol. Those surprisingly high susceptibilities to rather "old" antibiotics may be explained by low antibiotic consumption, accessibility and therefore low usage which is a key promoter of resistance both in community and hospital.
