The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of recently licensed quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid which have not yet been in clinical use in Turkey against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) strains isolated from various clinical specimens by using the Etest. The results showed that all MRSA strains were fully susceptible to both the new compounds. All strains were inhibited by 1 mg/l quinupristin/dalfopristin (mode MIC 0.38 mg/l) and by 3 mg/l linezolid (mode MIC 1.5 mg/l). Four strains of Enterococcus faecium showed an increase of resistance of 2-3 mg/l to quinupristin/dalfopristin (susceptible mode MIC 0.38 mg/l). With linezolid, all strains except two fell within the range 0.75-2.0 mg/l.
