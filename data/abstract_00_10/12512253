A total of 21 Salmonella strains isolated in Libya (16 from children with diarrhea and 5 from healthy controls) were serotyped and studied for their cell invasive ability, production of cytotoxin, antibiotic susceptibility, beta-lactamase activity and plasmid profiles. Eight different serotypes of Salmonella were identified: 6 S. saintpaul, 4 S. wien (1 from control), 2 S. newport, 2 S. muenchen (1 from control), 2 S. typhimurium (1 from control), 2 S. hadar (1 from control), 2 S. reading (1 from control), 1 S. kottbus. Twenty (95%) were positive in the invasiveness assay using HeLa cells, and all (100%) were negative for cytotoxin production in HT29 cells. More than 40% were resistant to ampicillin, cefalexin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, mezlocillin and trimethoprimsulphamethoxazole and 100% were susceptible to the new quinolones. Most (67%) of the strains harbored plasmids and 43% produced beta-lactamase. A strong association was observed between the presence of more than one plasmid, beta-lactamase activity, and multiple-resistance to antimicrobial agents and serotypes S. saintpaul and S. wien. Curing experiments with acridine orange showed that 2 plasmids (33 and 1.4 megadaltons) might be responsible for the resistance to chloramphenicol and gentamicin. The present study demonstrated that multiple-resistant salmonellae are widespread in Libya and the resistance is mainly plasmid mediated.
