While malaria eradication campaigns once adopted a combination of vector control and chemotherapy to overcome the disease, today's opinion on the matter is equivocal. So what has changed? This paper reviews some of the confusing hypotheses on the relationship between Plasmodium falciparum transmission and levels of drug resistance. New field evidence showing variations of in vivo chloroquine resistance in relation to indoor residual spraying and natural endemicity patterns, is considered with a view to how these phenomena implicate on control.
