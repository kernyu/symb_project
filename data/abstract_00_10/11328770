One-hundred and twenty-two urinary isolates of Escherichia coli were studied for trimethoprim resistance. Seventy-seven (63.1%) of the 122 isolates were found to be resistant to trimethoprim. Of the 77 trimethoprim-resistant isolates, 75 dfr genes were detected in 72 isolates as follows: the dfrA17 gene was the most prevalent, being found in 27 isolates, followed by dfrA12 in 26, dfrA1 in 15, dfrA5 in four and dfrA7 in three. Southern blot and PCR mapping analysis revealed that all of the dfrA17, dfrA12, dfrA5 and dfrA7 genes were located on class 1 integrons. The dfrA1 gene inserted as a gene cassette in class 1 integrons was found in 10 of 15 isolates, and the intI2 gene of Tn7 was detected in two out of five isolates. In conjugation experiments, the dfr genes inserted in class 1 integrons were transferred to a recipient E. coli in 32 (42.7%) of the 75 dfr genes. In conclusion, the dfrA17 and dfrA12 genes were the most prevalent genes responsible for trimethoprim resistance in urinary tract isolates of E. coli from Korea and the dfr genes inserted in integrons are more widespread than those that are not related to gene cassettes.
