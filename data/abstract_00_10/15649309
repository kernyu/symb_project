Amikacin-resistant Escherichia coli strains are isolated rarely from clinical samples. In the present study, investigation of an amikacin-resistant clinical isolate of E. coli demonstrated the presence of two class 1 integrons carrying the aacA4 gene plus the aacA7 gene, and the dfrA17 gene plus the aadA5 gene, respectively. Resistance to amikacin in this E. coli isolate was related to the presence of both aacA4 and aacA7.
