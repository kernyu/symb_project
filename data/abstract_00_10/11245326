Between July 1998 and July 1999, 3,060 Haemophilus influenzae and 1,486 Moraxella catarrhalis strains were isolated in 31 centers in 15 countries in order to determine their antimicrobial susceptibilities and the presence of beta-lactamase production in Haemophilus influenzae. Overall 17.1% of the Haemophilus influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase positive, while more than 95% were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, loracarbef, cefuroxime, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. Eleven (0.3%) isolates were beta-lactamase positive and ampicillin resistant and 7 (0.2%) isolates were ciprofloxacin resistant. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the isolates tested were lowest for ciprofloxacin (0.03) and highest for cefprozil (8) against Moraxella catarrhalis.
