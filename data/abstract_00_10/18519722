Polymyxin B, minocycline, and tigecycline were the most potent of 10 antibiotics against 170 isolates of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. In time-kill studies, the exposure of a highly tigecycline-resistant isolate to tigecycline resulted in enhanced susceptibility to amikacin and synergistic bactericidal activities of the two drugs.
