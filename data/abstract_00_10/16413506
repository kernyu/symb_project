The antimicrobial class of penems has the potential to address most of the relevant resistance issues associated with beta-lactam antibiotics because of their exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and their intrinsic stability against hydrolytic attack by many beta-lactamases including ESBL and AmpC enzymes. The subclass of carbapenems covers the spectrum of hospital pathogens whereas the subclass of penems covers community pathogens. The only currently available penem, faropenem, has a low propensity for resistance development, beta-lactamase induction and selection of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This makes it attractive for the treatment of community-acquired infections and for step-down or sequential therapy following carbapenem treatment without jeopardizing the activity of carbapenems or the entire beta-lactam class in the hospital environment.
