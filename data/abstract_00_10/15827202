A broad variety of herpes simplex virus type 1 clones was selected under a single round of high-dose selection with brivudin. Mutations in the thymidine kinase (TK) genes consisted of 42% frameshift mutations within homopolymer repeats of G's and C's and single nucleotide substitutions (58%) that produced stop codons (Q261 and R281) or a new codon at the site of the substitution (A168T, R51W, G59W, G206R, R220H, Y239S, and T287 M). The A168T change, associated with an altered TK phenotype, proved to be the most commonly selected substitution. For the different mutants, a correlation between phenotype, genotype, and in vivo neurovirulence was observed.
