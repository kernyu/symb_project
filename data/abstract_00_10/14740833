Dairy calves are commonly fed milk from cows treated with antibiotics. The concentration of beta-lactam antibiotic residues found in milk from treated cows was used to determine the range of concentrations of penicillin used in a dose-regulated experiment. Thirty-one Holstein calves were randomly assigned to milk with penicillin G added at concentrations of 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 microl/kg. Fecal swabs were taken from each calf twice weekly. Resistance to penicillin was tested by measuring the zone of inhibition in bacterial growth around a disk impregnated with the antibiotic. Inhibition was greatest for bacteria from calves fed milk with no penicillin (2.89 +/- 0.14 mm), and declined as the penicillin dose provided in the milk increased (to a low of 0.70 +/- 0.10 for the 50 microl/kg treatment group). In conclusion, resistance of gut bacteria to antibiotics increases with increasing concentrations of penicillin in the milk fed to dairy calves.
