BACKGROUND: Massive antibiotic use in intensive care units (ICU) is associated with increased microbial resistance. Therefore avoiding unneccesary antibiotic usage is essential. To achieve a more considered antibiotic prescribing practice, a new antibiotic policy was implemented at our ICU. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of this intervention, and described the aetiology and incidence of blood stream infections and selected antibiotic-resistant pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In November 2002, a local antibiotic management program (LAMP) was implemented. This included a new infectious diseases specialist consultation service and restricted authorisation to prescribe antibiotics. The effect on ward-level antibiotic use was examined by segmented regression analysis. Patient, ICU and microbiology data were also recorded and compared before and after policy implementation. RESULTS: The patient populations and the subsequent mortality rate were comparable before and after the implementation of the policy. Total antibiotic consumption was markedly reduced from 162.9 to 101.3 defined daily dose (DDD) per 100 patients, and per day (DDD per 100 patient-days). This was mainly accounted for a reduction in the use of quinolones, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, metronidazol, carbepenems and third generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed that establishing a targeted LAMP, based on close co-operation between intensive care physicians and infectious disease specialists together with a restricted prescribing authority, can reduce the use of antibiotics.
