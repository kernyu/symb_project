The in vitro activity of voriconazole was compared with those of fluconazole and itraconazole against 270 clinical isolates of yeasts from the mouths of patients receiving palliative care for advanced cancer. A broth micro-dilution assay as described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was employed for determination of MICs. Of the 270 isolates, 206 (76 %) were fluconazole sensitive and 64 were fluconazole resistant. Voriconazole showed more potent activity than either fluconazole or itraconazole, including against some isolates resistant to both fluconazole and itraconazole. However, for fluconazole-resistant isolates, the MICs of itraconazole and voriconazole were proportionally higher than for the fluconazole-susceptible isolates, suggesting cross-resistance. Voriconazole may be a useful additional agent for the management of oral fungal infections caused by strains resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole, but susceptibility cannot be assumed and in vitro MIC determination is recommended prior to its use.
