The therapeutic effect of a subcurative dosage of praziquantel (PZQ) on Schistosoma mansoni infected mice and resistance to challenged worm infection after treatment were assessed and compared with conventional treatment using a curative dosage of PZQ. S. mansoni infected mice were treated with PZQ at a curative dosage (600 mg kg(-1)) or a subcurative dosage (300 mg kg(-1)) at 9 weeks after infection. Untreated mice and non-infected mice were added as controls. The therapeutic effect of the drug was evaluated in terms of the mortality of mice after treatment, and the parasitological and pathological findings in mice sacrificed at 1 week, 1 month, or 3 months after treatment. Another sample of mice was not killed but challenged with S. mansoni cercariae at 1 week, 1 month, or 3 months after treatment. Resistance to re-infection was evaluated by the extent of challenged worm reduction. In conclusion, there was no significant difference in mortality, or parasitological and pathological findings between mice treated with PZQ at the two dosages. However, resistance to challenged worm infection was more sustained in the group treated with subcurative dose PZQ, especially at 3 months after treatment.
