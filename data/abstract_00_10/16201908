G3139 is an antisense Bcl-2 phosphorothioate oligonucleotide that has been combined with DTIC in a phase III clinical trial in melanoma. However, its actual mechanism of action in melanoma is controversial. Treatment of 518A2 melanoma cells with either G3139 or G4126 (a two-base mismatch) and then with light-activated DTIC caused these cells (but not SK-Mel-30 or 346.1 cells) to be protected against the cytotoxic effects of DTIC. This cytoprotection was not recapitulated with a phosphodiester congener of G3139 nor with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) also targeted to the Bcl-2 mRNA. Administering the drugs in reverse order also did not produce cytoprotection, and an 18- mer phosphorothioate homopolymer of thymidine was also inactive. Subsequently, it was discovered that gemcitibine and cis-platinum also induced cytoprotection to DTIC in this cell line, suggesting that the cytoprotection is a stress response to chemical proapoptotic stress. Cytoprotection was completely inhibited by O(6)-benzylguanine, an inhibitor of O(6)-guanosine alkyltransferase (OGAT) activity. However, a direct assay of OGAT activity demonstrated that 518A2 melanoma cells are essentially completely devoid of it, either basally or induced. The cytoprotection may thus be caused by a chemical stress-induced increase in mismatch repair activity.
