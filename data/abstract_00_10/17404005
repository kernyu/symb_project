Clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 470) were collected during a 7-year period and investigated for the genetic determinants of resistance to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams. Thirty-one isolates produced the TEM-92 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and were clonally related. This is the first report of A. baumannii producing a TEM-type ESBL.
