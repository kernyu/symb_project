The in vitro activity of DX-619, a new des-F(6) quinolone, against anaerobic bacteria was evaluated. DX-619 showed potent activity against Bacteroides, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Micromonas, Actinomyces, and Clostridium spp., with MIC(50)s/MIC(90)s of </=0.03 to 0.25/</=0.03 to 1 microg/ml, respectively. DX-619 was also active against imipenem-resistant Bacteroides spp., with MIC(50)s/MIC(90)s of 0.25/1 microg/ml, respectively.
