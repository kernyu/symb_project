All 238 Clostridium difficile isolates were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin, whereas 84% and 1% were resistant to clindamycin and fusidic acid. Etest MICs for metronidazole were lower than agar dilution MICs (P < 0.01) but without difference in susceptible-intermediate-resistant categorization. No particular PCR ribotype was associated with clindamycin or fusidic acid resistance.
