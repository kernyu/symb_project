We conducted a nationwide survey of the variable 5' emm (M protein gene) sequences from 614 pharyngeal Streptococcus pyogenes isolates susceptible (299 isolates) and resistant (315 isolates) to erythromycin that were isolated in Spain from 1996 to 1999. Almost 98% of these isolates had emm sequences in agreement with previously recorded M antigen association. We only identified a new 5' emm sequence in 17 isolates. Nine different emm types accounted for 85% of the S. pyogenes isolates susceptible to erythromycin. By contrast, only 3 emm types accounted for 70% of the erythromycin-resistant isolates. Further characterization of these isolates by ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that high frequency of erythromycin resistance in Spain is due to few clones.
