We describe two mutants of Mycoplasma hominis PG-21 which show resistance to 16-membered macrolides but susceptibility to lincosamides, obtained by in vitro exposure to increasing doses of josamycin. The 23S rRNA gene showed that each had a mutation (A2062G and A2062T) corresponding to nucleotide 2062 in Escherichia coli, which was associated with the acquired phenotype.
