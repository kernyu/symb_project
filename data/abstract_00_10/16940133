The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) population in the Hospital Universitario Nuestra Senora de Candelaria over a 5-year period (1998 to 2002) was marked by shifts in the circulation of pandemic clones. Here, we investigated the emergence of high-level mupirocin resistance (Hi-Mup(r)). In addition to clonal spread, transfer of ileS2-carrying plasmids played a significant role in the dissemination of Hi-Mup(r) among pandemic MRSA lineages.
