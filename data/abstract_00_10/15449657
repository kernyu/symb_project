Excessive use of antibiotics (AB) has resulted in resistant strains of microorganisms, adverse drug reactions (ADR's) and cross-resistance. This study showed that AB are being used indiscriminately. We carried out a retrospective comparative cost analysis study on the use of AB in clinics and hospitals on a larger population by analyzing 1200 prescriptions of various diseases containing AB and cost effectiveness was compared. It was found that surgeons prescribed costliest AB whereas physicians used cheapest AB. Overall the costliest treatment was prescribed by gynecologists of hospitals, and the most economical treatment was prescribed by pediatricians in the clinics.
