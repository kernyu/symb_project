Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene from 138 ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC, > or =4 microg/ml) and 24 ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC, < or =1 microg/ml) clinical Campylobacter jejuni isolates were subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing. All of the isolates could be assigned to three genotypic clusters based on silent mutations. All resistant isolates had a point mutation at codon 86.
