This review examines the contribution dental prescribing makes to the selection of antibiotic resistance in bacteria of the oral flora. The antibiotics commonly used in dental prescribing in the UK are discussed, together with the problems of resistance in members of the oral flora. The antibiotic prescribing habits of general dental practitioners are then reviewed with respect to therapeutic prescriptions and those drugs that are prescribed prophylactically. Not all antibiotic prescriptions for dental problems are written by dentists; prescribing outside the dental profession is also considered. The review then considers the support available to dentists from clinical diagnostic microbiology laboratories. It concludes that better use of diagnostic services, surveillance and improvements in dental education are required now to lessen the impact of antibiotic resistance in the future.
