OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of surgical management combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of drug-resistant gestational trophoblastic neoplasm (GTN) patients, and investigate factors influencing the outcome of the surgery combined with chemotherapy. METHODS: Medical records of 42 patents with drug-resistant GTN who were treated by chemotherapy combined with surgical management at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from Jan 1996 to Jan 2006 were reviewed. RESULTS: Among 42 patients, 32 achieved serologically complete remission (SCR) with an SCR rate of 76%, and 10 patients had a treatment failure. Treatment failure was more frequently seen in patients who also had metastasis of other sites except for lungs and vagina and patients with antecedent non-molar pregnancy (P = 0.023 and 0.017, respectively). Preoperative human chorionic gonadotropin-beta subunit (beta-hCG) titer > 10 U/L (P = 0.020), failure to reach normal serum titers of beta-hCG during treatment (P = 0.003), age > or = 35 years (OR: 12.6, 95% CI: 2.4 - 66.0, P = 0.002) and preoperative chemotherapy regimens > or = 4 (OR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.0 - 20.1, P = 0.059) were also correlated with treatment failure. All the 10 patients with treatment failure had at least 3 of 6 above mentioned predictors of treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical management combined with chemotherapy is effective in the treatment of drug-resistant GTN. Age > or = 35 years, antecedent non-molar pregnancy, metastasis of other sites except for lungs and vagina, preoperative beta-hCG titer > 10 U/L, failure to reach normal serum titers of beta-hCG during treatment, and preoperative chemotherapy regimens > or = 4 are significant predictors of treatment failure. Patients with 3 or more predictors of treatment failure usually have poor prognosis. Therefore, surgical management should not be performed for these patients.
