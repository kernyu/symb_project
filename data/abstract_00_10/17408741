In recent work, we described excision of a large genomic region from Enterococcus faecium D344R resulting from the interaction of Tn916 and a related transposon designated Tn5386. In the present study, we present and analyze the complete sequence of Tn5386. Tn5386 is 29,451 bp in length. Fifteen of its 30 open reading frames are analogous to ORFs found in Tn916. Significant differences include a series of ORFs with homology to lantibiotic immunity genes in the same location where tetM is found in Tn916, insertion of a Group II intron and an ORF with similarities to previously described surface exposed collagen adhesion proteins. Our results indicate that Tn5386 falls within the Tn916 family of transposons, and in place of tetM encodes a novel region that may confer resistance to lantibiotics.
