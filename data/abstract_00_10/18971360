Blood isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi from two recently returned Bangladeshi patients in Kuwait were ciprofloxacin resistant, with ciprofloxacin MICs of 12 mg/liter for both isolates. Both isolates had three novel gyrA mutations (55-Leu-->Trp, 87-Asp-->Ala, and 106-Gln-->Arg) and three novel parC mutations (84-Glu-->Lys, 106-Trp-->Gly, and 128-Tyr-->Asp).
