OBJECTIVES: Platinum resistance is a significant problem in patients with ovarian cancer. The aim of this phase II study was to define the response rates, the progression-free survival and the toxicity profile of the combination of PEG liposomal doxorubicin (L-DXR) and gemcitabine (GEM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty one patients with histologically confirmed platinum-refractory or -resistant epithelial ovarian cancer were scheduled to receive 6 cycles of L-DXR 30 mg/m(2) on day 1 as well as GEM 650 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 every 28 days. RESULTS: The median number of chemotherapy cycles given was 4. The mean dose intensity for L-DXR and GEM on day 1 was 96% and 97%, respectively. The mean dose intensity for GEM on day 8 was 93%. The overall response rate was 33% (10 of 30 evaluable patients; 20% complete responses). The median progression-free survival was 3.8 months, and the median overall survival was 15.8 months, respectively. Toxicity was acceptable. One quarter of patients developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, but none developed febrile neutropenia. Palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) grades 2 and 3 occurred in 13% and 3% only, respectively, and no grade 4 PPE was observed. Grades 1 to 3 stomatitis was found in 58% of patients (10% grade 3). CONCLUSION: The combination of L-DXR and GEM is an active and acceptably tolerated option in the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant and -refractory ovarian cancer. Dose reductions seem advisable in the case of > or =grade 2 stomatitis and/or PPE > or =grade 2.
