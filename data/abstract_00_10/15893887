Locally prevalent pathogenic bacteria 189 Gram (-) and 135 Gram (+) strains, all isolated from pediatric patients severely infected, were tested in vitro against 11 essential oils from commercial origin. All the strains showed resistance to selected antibiotics. Cinnamomum verum, Origanum vulgare and Thymus vulgaris exhibited the highest and broadest antibacterial activity. Emphasis is made in the potential implications of these resources, uncommon at the clinical setting of the study, employed against non-commercial, locally pathogenic strains, being a step to submit in the ensuing period essential oils from plants used in Mexican traditional medicine.
