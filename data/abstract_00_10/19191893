BACKGROUND: The study compares the eradication success of standard first-line triple therapies of different durations (7, 10, and 14 days). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 592 naive Helicobacter pylori-positive patients were randomized to receive pantoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin or metronidazole for 14 days (PACl14 or PAM14), 10 days (PACl10 or PAM10), or 7 days (PACl7 or PAM7). H. pylori eradication was assessed by histological, microbiological, and rapid urease examination. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses have shown no overall statistically significant differences between the eradication success of PACl and PAM treatment groups (ITT p = .308, PP p = .167). Longer treatment duration has yielded statistically significant increase in eradication success for clarithromycin (ITT p = .004; PP p = .004) and metronidazole (ITT p = .010; PP p = .034) based regimens. Namely, PACl10, PACl14, and PAM14 protocols resulted in eradication success exceeding 80% in ITT and 90% in PP analysis. Primary resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole equals 8.2% and 32.9%, respectively. Prolonging the metronidazole-based treatment duration in patients with resistant strains resulted in statistically significant higher eradication success. CONCLUSIONS: For all antimicrobial combinations, 14 days protocols have led to a significant increase of H. pylori eradication success when compared to 10 and 7 days, respectively. Prolonging the treatment duration can overcome the negative effect of metronidazole resistance. Only PAM14, PACl10 protocols achieved ITT success > 80% and should be recommended as the first line eradication treatment in Croatia.
