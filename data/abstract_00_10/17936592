During the last 10-15 years understanding of relationships between pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters and bacteriological and clinical outcomes has expanded allowing correlation between in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy. PK and PD principles can be applied to development of new antibacterials and formulation of existing agents to help address the increasing prevalence of antibacterial resistance. For beta-lactams, such as penicillins, the unbound serum concentration of the drug exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration of the causative pathogen for 40-50% of the dosing interval is predictive of bacteriologic efficacy (bacterial eradication) and can be used to determine a PK/PD breakpoint for that specific dosing regimen. Amoxicillin/clavulanate was one of the earliest antibacterials to use the unique approach of PK/PD principles to develop new and enhanced formulations, allowing it to remain a significant antibacterial agent in the management of respiratory tract infections.
