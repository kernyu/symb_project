A 21-month-old girl with neuroblastoma developed chronic verrucous Oka strain varicella-zoster infection during chemotherapy. Virus isolated from the patient demonstrated high-level acyclovir resistance, and its thymidine kinase had no in vitro enzymatic activity. After foscarnet therapy, she underwent stem cell transplantation without varicella reactivation. This is only the second reported case of resistant varicella zoster virus caused by Oka strain virus.
