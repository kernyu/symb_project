Of 96 Helicobacter pylori isolates from patients in Shanghai and Guangzhou, China, 5 had the A2143G 23S rRNA mutation as determined by primer-mismatch PCR and were resistant to clarithromycin by the E-test. The remaining isolates were primer-mismatch PCR negative and susceptible to clarithromycin. The conclusion is that the prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori isolates among these Chinese patients is 5%.
