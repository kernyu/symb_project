We have evaluated 102 Staphylococcus intermedius isolates of canine origin for susceptibility to antimicrobial primary agents, i.e. penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, trimethoprim/sulfonamides, neomycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, norfloxacin, tetracycline, vancomycin, erythromycin and secondary agents, i.e., chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, lincomycin, teicoplanin, rifampicin, imipenem, mupirocin. Antimicrobial sensitivity was examined using the disk diffusion method and performed according to NCCLS quidelines. Methicillin resistance was detected using the disk diffusion method with oxacillin, and the occurrence of mecA gene was detected by PCR. Resistance to streptomycin, penicillin, amoxicillin, neomycin, followed by tetracycline was predominant. From 14 mecA-positive strains, 12 were multidrug-resitant, and the remaining two showed atypical susceptibility. One strain resistant to oxacillin in the disc diffusion method was mecA-negative, suggesting a different mechanism of resistance. Our results indicate that the emergence of S. intermedius resistance to methicillin may be underestimated. In case of clinical multidrug-resitant S. intermedius isolates, resistance to methicillin should be considered.
