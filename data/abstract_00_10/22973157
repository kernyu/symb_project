Twenty-eight isolates of E. faecalis and 5 isolates of E. hirae were isolated from chicken samples obtained from markets in Sri Serdang, Selangor. They were tested for susceptibility to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents. All of the isolates showed multiple resistance to the antibiotic tested. All Enterococcus spp. were resistant (100%) to ceftaxidime, cephalothin, erythromycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid and streptomycin. Resistance was also observed to norfloxacin (97%), tetracycline (91%), penicillin (85%), bacitracin (82%), chloramphenicol (61%) and the least resistance was to ampicillin (27%). High prevalence to vancomycin resistance was detected among the E. faecalis (27of 28) and E. hirae (4 of 5) isolates. The multiple antibiotic resistance index ranging between 0.64 to 1.0 showed that all strains tested originated from high-risk contamination. Plasmid profile analysis of Enterococcus spp. revealed plasmid DNA bands ranging in size from 1.3 to 35.8 megadalton but some isolates were plasmidless. No correlation could be made between plasmid patterns and antibiotic resistance.
