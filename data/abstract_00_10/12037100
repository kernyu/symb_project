Nosocomial oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA) bloodstream isolates were tested to determine the prevalence of vancomycin heteroresistance. We screened 619 ORSA nosocomial bloodstream isolates from 36 hospitals between 1997 and 2000. Only one isolate exhibiting heterotypic resistance was detected. Thus, vancomycin heteroresistance in clinical bloodstream isolates remains rare in the United States.
