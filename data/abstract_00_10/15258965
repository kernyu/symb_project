This study aimed at identifying HIV-1 protease amino acid changes associated with protease inhibitor (PI) exposure and susceptibility. New amino acid substitutions were correlated with the number of experienced PIs, reaching statistical significance only for those at positions 3, 44, and 74. The correspondence multivariate model demonstrated that > or =3 experienced PIs and substitutions or mutations at positions 3, 46, 54, 73, 74, and 84 were correlated with PI cross-resistance, including resistance for lopinavir and amprenavir in this cohort of patients who were naive for these drugs.
