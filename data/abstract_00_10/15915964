To determine the frequency of pneumococci meningitis with reduced sensitivity to penicillin G isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, 539 strains were studied between 1996 to 2000. All strains were analysed with oxacilline containing 5 mcg / standard antibiogram for determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for penicillin G by E-test. Our results do not show any significant variation from 1996 to 2000. Generally as regard the penicillin G sensitivity we observed that strains were classified as: sensitive strains (CMI < or = 0.06 mg/l): 22.5%, less sensitive strains (0.6 mg/l < CMI < or = 2 mg/l): 58.2%, resistance (CMI > 2 mg/l): 19.2%. The pneumococci rate with reduced sensitivity observed in our study is high and should be taken into consideration in the therapeutic choices.
