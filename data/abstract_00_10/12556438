Macrolide resistance among pneumococci is increasing worldwide and is associated with increasing macrolide use. Recent studies show that use of macrolides and azalides increases nasopharyngeal carriage of both macrolide-resistant and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Carriage of a resistant pneumococcus may foster dissemination. The clinical relevance of in vitro resistance has been debated. However, recent data from a matched case-control study showed that 18 (24%) of 76 patients had breakthrough bacteraemia with an erythromycin-resistant pneumococcus while taking a macrolide, whereas none of the 136 matched controls with an erythromycin-susceptible pneumococcal bacteraemia was taking a macrolide (P = 0.0000001). Moreover, five (24%) of 21 patients bacteraemic with the low-level resistant M phenotype and none of the 40 matched controls were taking a macrolide (P = 0.00157). These data indicate that macrolide resistance due to both the efflux and the methylase mechanisms is clinically relevant. Furthermore, they favour guidelines for the empirical treatment of outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia that recommend high-dose oral amoxicillin and reserve coverage of atypical pathogens for selected high-risk populations.
