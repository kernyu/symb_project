While surveys in Southern Africa indicate anthelmintic resistance of gastrointestinal nematodes to be common in small ruminants in South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe there have been no reports of resistance in Zambia. The objective of this study was to determine whether anthelmintic resistance occurs in Zambia, and to obtain information on nematode control practices in the country. During the rainy season six commercial sheep farms were selected in and around Lusaka and Chisamba. Worm control practices were gauged by means of a questionnaire, and the Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test was performed for assessing anthelmintic efficacy of albendazole, levamisole and ivermectin. On all farms anthelmintic treatment was the only approach used to control nematode infections. Frequency of treatment varied from twice a year to every 6 weeks and drugs of different anthelmintic groups were alternated within the same year. There was a wide range in faecal egg counts of individual sheep before treatment, with some individual counts of up to 87000. Larval identification showed that Haemonchus was almost the only genus recovered from the faecal cultures before and after treatment. Albendazole resistance was found on five of the six farms. On each of the four farms where ivermectin gave less than 95% reduction in egg counts, there was resistance to albendazole as well. Levamisole showed an efficacy of 95% or higher on all six farms.
