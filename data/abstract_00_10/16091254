Combination antiretroviral therapy potently suppresses HIV replication, but does not eradicate the infection. Drug resistance and long-term toxicities limit its use. The recovery of general immune function is often not complete. Immune-based therapies have the potential to boost HIV-specific immunity and reduce the need for antiretroviral drugs, and to promote general immune competence in situations in which antiretroviral treatment alone is inadequate. Strategies to reduce the immunopathogenic consequences of HIV infection with immunomodulating therapies are conceivable. Ultimately, eradication of the infection will require methods to target the latent memory T-cell reservoir of virus.
