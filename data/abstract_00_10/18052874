Chloroquine (CHQ), an antimalarial, is also used as an anti-inflammatory drug for systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the frequency of organ involvement and disease flares, and relieves skin and joint symptoms. CHQ reduces the immunologically-mediated inflammation of the joints. HCQ and combination therapies have a significant benefit on synovitis, pain and physical disability on RA. We advocate the investment of resistance Plasmodium prevalence determinations in countries beset by malaria, and to match thereafter the quantity of persons administered CHQ. Follow-up investigations are essential to diagnose and prevent visual damage.
