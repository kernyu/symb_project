Posaconazole (POS) is a newer triazole with activity against yeasts and moulds. POS and fluconazole were tested in vitro against 32 Candida albicans, 30 C. glabrata, 21 C. tropicalis, 29 C. krusei, 28 C. parapsilosis, 50 C. inconspicua, 13 C. kefyr and 5 C. famata isolates using CLSI broth microdilution method (BMD). We compared E-test and a modified BMD using polyethylene-glycol (PEG) as solvent to the CLSI method. BMDs and E-test were performed according to CLSI and the manufacturer's instructions respectively. Geometric means of POS MICs using BMD were 0.71, 0.22 and 0.21 microg ml(-1) against C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. inconspicua, respectively, and remained below 0.1 microg ml(-1) against all other species tested. One of two C. albicans and two of three C. glabrata isolates resistant to fluconazole showed MICs above 8 microg ml(-1) to POS. The impact of using PEG instead of DMSO had only a minor effect (agreements above 95% with the exception of C. parapsilosis). E-tests read after 24 h showed good agreement with the BMD. POS exhibited excellent in vitro activity against Hungarian Candida strains. E-test showed good correlation with the CLSI method, but to facilitate the comparability of results we believe that DMSO should be used as solvent in the BMD.
