TB is still a global health problem. The selection and spread of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains represents a threat for global TB control. The reappearance of TB has driven an increased interest in understanding the mechanisms of drug action and drug resistance, which could provide a significant contribution in the development of new antimicrobials. In this article, the authors describe the mode of action and the resistance mechanisms of the principal first- and second-line antitubercular agents, namely isoniazid, ethionamide, ethambutol, D-cycloserine, rifamycins, fluoroquinolones, streptomycin, linezolid and pyrazinamide. A brief outline of the seven drugs in clinical development is reported, showing how the development of new TB drugs is still required.
