We report a case of infective endocarditis due to vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus that developed after repeated courses of vancomycin. The patient had underlying end stage renal disease and dissecting aortic aneurysm with aortic graft and prosthetic aortic valve replacement. He responded to prolonged combination therapy with linezolid and amikacin without undergoing surgical intervention.
