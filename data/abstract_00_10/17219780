Engraftment of muscle-derived cells (MDCs) into the urethral sphincter may cure urinary incontinence. However, poor cell survival after injection prompted us to evaluate whether 24-h preincubation with sodium ascorbate (ASC) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) prior to cell transfer improves the survival of MDCs facing oxidative stress in vitro. We examined MDCs isolated from female rats for the presence of myogenic markers and for the ability to differentiate and respond to growth factors. Isolated cells were positive for desmin, M-cadherin, and myogenin. The fusion index exceeded 29%, and Akt kinase was phosphorylated at Ser473 residue upon exposure to insulin-like growth factor 1 (100 ng/ml). We then autologously transplanted MDCs transfected with lacZ marker gene into urethral wall of the rats; 2 wk later, the urethra and caudal wall of the urinary bladder were harvested from these animals. Serial cryosections revealed that transplanted cells formed multinuclear clusters at injection sites. In addition, we found that the viability of MDCs exposed to a cytotoxic concentration of H2O2 was higher after preincubation with 0.1 mM ASC (2.6-fold), 10 ng/ml bFGF (2.9-fold), or 20 ng/ml bFGF (3.5-fold) than that after exposure to H2O2 only. We conclude that preincubation with ASC or bFGF increases the resistance of MDCs to oxidative stress in vitro. Pretreatment with either agent might be used to enhance survival of MDCs after transplantation.
