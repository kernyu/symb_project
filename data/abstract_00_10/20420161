The influence of amoxicillin (AMPC) on drug-resistant Haemophilus influenzae gene must be carefully considered in using antibiotics to treat children with respiratory infections. We studied 197 isolates from pediatric outpatients and their previous antibiotic use in northern Japan from 2004 to 2006. We found that the population treated with antibiotics was 45%-11% decrease from the previous 2001-2003 study. Those treated with AMPC increased by 15% and those treated with cephalosporins decreased by 18%. Susceptibility testing showed that strains resistant to ampicillin (ABPC) increased from 31% to 49%. Strains with altered pbp gene(s) in ABPC-susceptible strains also increased. AMPC use was clearly associated with strains with resistant gene(s) such as beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (low-BLNAR), BLNAR, beta-lactamase-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLPAR) beta-lactamase-producing amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-resistant H. influenzae (BLPACR).
