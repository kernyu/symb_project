The adhesive capacity, resistance to antibiotics and biological properties of Salmonella strains of different serogroups, circulating in the Gomel region, were under study. Resistance to antibiotics and changes in biological properties were accompanied by an increased adhesiveness of these strains. A high degree of adhesiveness was noted in S. hadar, a new for Belarus strains.
