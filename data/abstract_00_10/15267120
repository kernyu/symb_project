Antifungal agents have greatly contributed to the improvement of public health. Nevertheless, antifungal resistant pathogens have increased during the past decade, becoming a serious concern. Candida albicans has been the most extensively studied pathogen in antifungal resistance because of their morbidity and mortality associated with infections in immunocompromised patients. This review describes the antifungal mechanims of the azole fluconazole widely used for the prophylaxis and treatment of candidal infections. The specific molecular pathways occurring in fluconazole-resistance of C. albicans and some issues about new antifungal agents are also discussed.
