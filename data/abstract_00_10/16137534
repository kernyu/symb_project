The diagnosis of atypical cervicofacial lymphadenitis is often not readily clinically apparent. Parents may bring a child to the physician's attention long before the development of the classic findings. When assessing the child with acute-onset cervicofacial lymphadenitis, there are 2 imperative clinical determinations: Is the lymphadenitis of viral, bacterial, or mycobacterial etiology? If of mycobacterial etiology, is it an atypical or tuberculous mycobacterial process? The goal in management is to avoid misdiagnosis and lengthy duration of symptoms before appropriate therapy is instituted. This paper includes a case study-based review of the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of cervicofacial lymphadenitis in children due to atypical mycobacterial organisms.
