A total of 15 of 101 (14.8%) nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates exhibited mupirocin resistance (Mup(r)) compared with 1 of 154 (0.6%) methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates. A total of 14 (93%) isolates exhibiting high-level Mup(r) belonged to a single clone. Horizontal plasmid transfer and transmission of Mup(r) strains contribute to a high incidence of Mup(r) MRSA at our institution.
