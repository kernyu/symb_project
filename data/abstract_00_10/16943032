Samples of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected from natural beds on the Adriatic Sea in front of Ancona Province (Marches, Central Italy) officially recognized for human consumption. The mussels were analyzed to evaluate the prevalence of Aeromonas spp. pathogenic strains. Out of 144 samples, 32 Aeromonas strains were isolated and 12 showed virulence and enterophatogenicity on mice. Isolates were also examined to check their sensitivity to different antimicrobial agents. All isolates were sensitive to imepenem, neomycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycicline, chloramphenicol, polymyxin B, and colistin sulfate, but resistant to penicillin, carbenicillin, cephalotin, sulfamethoxazole, lincomycin, novobiocin, and rifampicin. Multiple resistance to antimicrobial agents with different mechanism of action was observed. Owing to the high occurrence of pathogenic Aeromonas strains, the risk of developing human infections by eating raw or undercooked mussels is envisaged.
