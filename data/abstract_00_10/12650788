OBJECTIVES: This multicenter, randomized, active-controlled trial assessed efficacy of bismuth-based quadruple therapy with omeprazole, bismuth biskalcitrate, metronidazole, and tetracycline (OBMT) using a single-triple capsule of BMT compared with triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (OAC) in treatment of patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcers. METHODS: Patients with active duodenal ulcer or diagnosed within the past 5 yr and with infection documented by (13)C-urea breath test plus histology or culture were randomly assigned to 10-day course of OBMT using a single-triple capsule containing bismuth biskalcitrate 140 mg, metronidazole 125 mg, and tetracycline 125 mg given as three capsules q.i.d. with omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., or a 10-day course of OAC, omeprazole 20 mg plus amoxicillin 1 g plus clarithromycin 500 mg, all b.i.d. Eradication was confirmed by two negative urea breath tests at >1 month and >2 months after therapy. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients received OBMT and 137 OAC. Modified intent-to-treat eradication rates were 87.7% for OBMT and 83.2% for OAC (95% CI = -3.9%-12.8%; p = 0.29). OBMT eradicated 91.7% metronidazole-sensitive and 80.4% metronidazole-resistant strains (p = 0.06). OAC eradicated 92.1% clarithromycin sensitive and 21.4% clarithromycin-resistant strains (p < 0.001). Adverse events occurred in 58.5% of OBMT patients and 59.0% of OAC patients. CONCLUSIONS: OBMT regimen using the single-triple capsule is as efficacious and well-tolerated as the widely used OAC regimen for H. pylori eradication. This OBMT therapy largely overcomes H. pylori metronidazole resistance, present in 40% of patients in this study.
