In this study, the tet(W) gene region of a human clinical isolate of Clostridium difficile resistant to tetracycline was characterized. This gene was a new allele showing 99% sequence identity to the gene found in the human strain Bifidobacterium longum F8, and it is not transferable by "in vitro" mating experiments.
