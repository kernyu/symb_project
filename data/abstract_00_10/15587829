BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To assess if gestational factors affect the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to L major infection, this study determined the levels of IL-4 and IFN-gamma in popliteal lymph node cells of pregnant C57BL/6 mice infected with L. major at 16 hours, 5 days-, 10 days- and 15 days- post plug by PCR, ELISA and BIOASSAY. DESIGN/SETTING: Experimental. RESULTS: Infected pregnant C57BL/6 mice developed larger cutaneous footpad lesions compared with non-pregnant C57BL/6 mice (that showed signs of resolution 7-10 weeks after infection). But, the lesions in infected pregnant C57BL/6 mice and infected non-pregnant C57BL/6 mice were not as large as in susceptible BALB/c mice. The mean litter weight was also reduced in pregnant infected C57BL/6 mice particularly in the groups infected at later stages of pregnancy (day 10- and day 15-post plug). The levels of both IL-4 and IFN-gamma increased with gestation in pregnant infected C57BL/6 mice compared with pregnant non-infected group, while only IL-4 was raised in pregnant infected mice compared with infected non pregnant mice. CONCLUSIONS: It may be concluded that increased IL-4 in pregnant infected C57BL/6 mice caused the transient susceptibility to L major infection while reduced litter weight was associated with increased IFN-gamma. These effects were pronounced in C57BI/6 mice infected with L major in late pregnancy.
