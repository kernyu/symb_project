Interleukin-12 (IL-12) has been identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine which is thought to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. However, to date, the various associations between factors related to the course of type 2 diabetes, like metabolic compensation, beta cell secretory dysfunction, insulin resistance and IL-12 serum levels, remain unclear. Our study involved 41 patients with type 2 diabetes, 19 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and 19 healthy controls. We measured serum levels of fasting glucose, HbA(1)c, 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol, and lipids. In addition, serum levels of C-peptide, insulin, proinsulin and IL-12 were assayed. HOMA(IR) score was calculated. The serum concentrations of IL-12 were higher in diabetics than in either patients with CAD or healthy controls, and were correlated with BMI, C-peptide, insulin, HOMA(IR), proinsulin and HDL serum levels. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the IL-12 serum level in type 2 diabetics primarily is dependent upon fasting proinsulin concentration. Our results demonstrate that elevated IL-12 serum levels in type 2 diabetics treated with sulphonylureas are induced especially by peripheral insulin resistance and beta cells dysfunction, as expressed by fasting serum proinsulin levels. This finding gives us hope that treatment to decrease peripheral insulin resistance and to avoid excessive proinsulin secretion might be successful in the prevention of IL-12-induced atherosclerosis.
