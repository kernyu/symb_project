Biofilm growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis was found to be unaffected at an isoniazid concentration that inhibited growth of planktonic bacilli (i.e. at isoniazid minimum inhibitory concentration=10 microg ml(-1)). Significant growth (50% of drug-free control) of biofilms was observed at up to 40 microg ml(-1) and the MIC for biofilm growth showed an increase to up to 80 microg ml(-1) isoniazid. Thus, the biofilm growth modus appears to be a strategy for replicating bacilli to evade the onslaught of antibacterials.
