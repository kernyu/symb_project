The level and duration of exposure to gastrointestinal nematode infections are of crucial importance for the development of acquired immunity in first season grazing calves. An excessive reduction of host-parasite contact by chemoprophylaxis, pasture management, or both, causes a diminished level of acquired immunity. Moreover, the level of acquired resistance is negatively related to the degree of suppression of host-parasite contact. Whether or not a reduced resistance against establishment and development of gastrointestinal nematode infections has a negative effect on weight gain in the second grazing season, depends both on the intensity of the prophylaxis used and on the level of the challenge infection. Cross-sectional serological surveys and questionnaire surveys in The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium indicated that parasitic nematode control in first season grazing calves tends to be overprotective. Possible consequences of over-treatment, besides higher treatment costs and a reduced level of acquired immunity, are more drug residues in animal products and in the environment and increased selection for anthelmintic resistance.
