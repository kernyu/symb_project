Racemic 7-(phenylacetamido)-1-dethia-3-aza-1-carba-2-oxacephem 3 was synthesized and found to possess antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus FDA 209P, Escherichia coli ATCC 39188, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1101-75 and Klebsiella pneumoniae NCTC 418 as well as the beta-lactamase producing organisms E. coli A9675 and P. aeruginosa 18S-H and the methicillin-resistant organism S. aureus 95. Formation of the carbacephem 3 originated from the Barton photochemical reaction in the conversion of 8 to 10. Intramolecular cyclization of syn-oximino beta-lactam 10 afforded 7-azido-2-oxa-3-azacephem 11, which was reduced and acylated to 12. Enzymatic removal of the methyl group from 12 gave the target molecule 3.
