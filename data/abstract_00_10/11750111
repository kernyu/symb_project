The development of species and populations of parasitic helminths with resistance to one or more anthelmintics is an increasing problem world-wide. The majority of currently available anthelmintics used to control parasitic nematodes of cattle and sheep belong to only three main groups, the benzimidazoles, imidazothiazoles and the avermectins/milbemycins. The successful implementation of helminth control programmes designed to limit the development of resistance in nematode populations depends to some degree on the availability of effective and sensitive methods for its detection and monitoring. A variety of in vivo and in vitro tests have been developed for the detection of nematode populations resistant to the main anthelmintic groups, but each suffers to some degree from reliability, reproducibility, sensitivity and ease of interpretation. This review covers those tests that have been reported and described and highlights some of their strengths and weaknesses.
