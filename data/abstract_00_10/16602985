The diversity among 1354 strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, serotype Enteritidis (n = 847) and Typhimurium (n = 507) isolated in Finland in 1991-2002 (n = 608) and in 2003 (n = 746) were studied. The former strains were studied retrospectively by phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) harmonized in the European Salm-gene project. The latter strains were studied prospectively, and the results correlated to their antimicrobial susceptibility and association with travel to popular tourist destinations. During both periods, S. Enteritidis phage types (PTs) PT1 and PT4, and S. Typhimurium definite types (DTs) DT1 and DT104 were the major phenotypes. SENTXB.0001 was the dominating single PFGE type among S. Enteritidis strains (40% in 1991-2002; 57% in 2003), and accounted correspondingly for 23% and 63% of the PT1 strains, and 81% and 88% of the PT4 strains. No PFGE types dominated among the S. Typhimurium strains but a correlation was found between certain phage and PFGE types: among DT1 strains, STYMXB.0098 accounted for 66% (1991-2002) and 98% (2003) and among the DT104 strains STYMXB.0001 accounted for 84% and 97% in the two time periods, respectively. Of the S. Enteritidis strains isolated in 2003, 91% were associated with travel, most commonly to Spain, Greece, and Bulgaria. SENTXB.0001 was the major Salmonella PFGE type in these countries. In contrast, most (55%) S. Typhimurium strains were of domestic origin. While only 1.3% of the S. Enteritidis strains were multiresistant and 24% were resistant to nalidixic acid only, 30% of the S. Typhimurium strains were multiresistant. Among the multiresistant S. Typhimurium strains, R-type ACSSuT and PFGE type STYMXB.0001 of the DT104 complex dominated.
