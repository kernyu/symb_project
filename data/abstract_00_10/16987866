OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of sequential treatment with lamivudine and interferon-alpha monotherapies in Chinese patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-two patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B were included in this study. Ninety-eight were treated with lamivudine alone (100 mg per day) for 48 weeks (group B). Sixty-four were treated with lamivudine alone (100 mg per day) for 20 weeks, then combined with interferon-alpha-2b (5 million units three times per week) for 4 weeks and then treated for another 24 weeks with interferon-alpha-2b alone (5 million units three times per week) (group A). All patients were followed for an additional 24 weeks. RESULTS: After 48 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients with normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels or hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels below 1000 copies/mL was not significantly different between the lamivudine monotherapy group (55.10% and 55.10%, respectively) and the sequential treatment group (59.36% and 56.25%, respectively). The percentage of patients with normalized ALT levels was significantly higher in group A (53%) than in group B (36%) at week 72 (P<0.05). The percentage of patients with lamivudine-resistant mutations was significantly higher with lamivudine monotherapy (22.45%) than with sequential therapy (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sequential treatment of chronic hepatitis B with lamivudine and interferon-alpha monotherapies is as effective as lamivudine-alone treatment in Chinese patients. However, sequential treatment can significantly suppress the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutations.
