We compared the performances of a new DNA-based strip assay and the VITEK 2 system for identification of 105 enterococcal strains and differentiation of their van gene-associated resistance levels. Both methods provided excellent results. The molecular assay showed advantages in time to result for identification of van-associated genes.
