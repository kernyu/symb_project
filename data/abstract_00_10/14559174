The isolation and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains from broilers arriving in French slaughterhouses, were analysed according to production types (i.e. standard, export or free-range) and antimicrobial (i.e. coccidiostats, growth promoters or therapeutic agents) administration in flocks. Prevalence was 56.6% in standard, 51.3% in export and 80.0% in free-range broilers. Three hundred and ninety-three strains were identified. Two-thirds of the strains belonged to the species C. jejuni. The others were C. coli. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out for ampicillin, nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin and gentamicin according to a dilution method. The percentages of resistant strains were, 23, 25, 17, 57, 0.3 and 0% for C. jejuni and 29, 43, 40, 70, 31 and 0% for C. coli. Statistical analysis revealed significant difference in distribution of C. jejuni and C. coli and antimicrobial resistance according to production type or antimicrobial administration.
