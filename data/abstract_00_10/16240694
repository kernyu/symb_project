Five penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) were isolated from urethral specimens of men admitted to the "Santa Chiara" Hospital (Trento, Italy). All strains proved to be resistant to penicillin and ampicillin, and sensitive to cefuroxime, erythromycin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. PPNG plasmid profiles showed that four of the isolates carried the 3.2 MDa "Africa" plasmid and one the 4.5 MDa "Asia" plasmid, the two well-known phenotypes reported in the USA and Europe as well as in Asian and African countries. Membrane matings were performed using N. gonorrhoeae carrying the 24.5 MDa conjugative plasmid as donors and E. coli K12 J 53 as recipient. The transfer of beta-lactamic antibiotic resistance was supported by the presence of 4.5 or 3.2 MDa plasmid bands and by beta-lactamase production in the transconjugants. Restriction analysis of Asian and African plasmids is reported.
