Candida krusei is an emerging fungal pathogen found primarily in immunocompromised patients. Intrinsic resistance to fluconazole and decreasing susceptibility to other anti-fungal agents are problematic. When colonization occurs, dissemination may follow rapidly. We present a case of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who, despite being treated prophylactically with fluconazole, developed disseminated C. krusei.
