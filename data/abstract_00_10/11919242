PURPOSE: We have simplified the treatment of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) in order to reduce the number of patients exposed to potentially carcinogenic chemotherapy. Patients who score 0 to 8 on the Charing Cross scoring system are classified as low-risk and receive methotrexate (MTX) and folinic acid (FA), whereas those who score higher than 8 are classified as high-risk and receive the etoposide, methotrexate, and dactinomycin (EMA)/cyclophosphamide and vincristine (CO) regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1992 and 2000, 485 women with GTD were commenced on MTX/FA at Charing Cross Hospital, London, United Kingdom. If patients developed MTX resistance or toxicity, treatment was altered according to the level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If serum hCG was < or = 100 IU/L, patients received dactinomycin; if hCG was greater than 100 IU/L, patients received EMA/CO. RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 4.7 years. Overall survival was 100% and the relapse rate was 3.3% (16 of 485 patients). hCG values normalized in 324 (66.8%) of 485 patients with MTX alone, whereas 161 (33.2%) of 485 patients required a change in treatment, 11 because of MTX toxicity and 150 because of MTX resistance. Sixty-seven patients changed to dactinomycin, of whom 58 achieved normal hCG values, and nine required third-line chemotherapy with EMA/CO. hCG values normalized in 93 (98.9%) of 94 patients who changed directly to EMA/CO from MTX. CONCLUSION: Single-agent dactinomycin has activity in patients with low-risk GTD who develop MTX resistance and whose hCG is low. Simplifying the stratification of GTD into two classes (low- and high-risk) does not compromise overall outcome and may reduce the risk of second tumors.
