Among the more important problems in modern hospitals is the prevalence of bacterial pathogens expressing resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. The frequency of multiresistance suggests mechanisms by which bacterial species can concentrate and efficiently exchange a variety of resistance determinants. Mechanisms by which this occurs include insertion of transposons within transposons, coalescence through the activity of insertion sequences and the employment of integrons. In some instances, more than one of these mechanisms is involved in creating large multiresistance genetic elements. The association of the elements with transferable elements or transposons may promote rapid dissemination among clinical strains, and create further opportunities for inclusion of additional resistance determinants.
