The incidence of resistant gram-positive bacteria in nosocomial and, more recently, community-acquired infections is increasing. Staphylococci, because of their natural habitat on the skin, have always been the leading cause of peritonitis in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). These organisms have demonstrated a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antibiotics, first with penicillin, then antistaphylococcal penicillins (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and more recently, strains expressing resistance to vancomycin (vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus) have emerged. Enterococci are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally cause PD peritonitis. In the past 15 years, vancomycin-resistant enterococci have emerged as significant pathogens in many areas. In the past 5 years, novel antibiotics that have activity on gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant strains, have become available. The problem of resistant gram-positive bacteria in PD peritonitis, their therapy, and the role of these newer agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin, are reviewed.
