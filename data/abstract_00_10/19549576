Advances in supportive care over the past two decades have decreased the morbidity and mortality attributed to opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, including those with hematologic malignancies, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and aplastic anemia. Despite advances in antiviral therapy, opportunistic viral infections such as influenza, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) still cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with compromised host defenses. Antiviral agents are key antimicrobials used for treatment and prophylaxis of viral infections in immunocompromised hosts. Currently, there are more than 40 antiviral agents approved for clinical use, but the majority of these agents are for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral hepatitis. This review will focus on antiviral agents used for the treatment of herpesviruses (HSV, VZV, CMV), community-acquired respiratory viruses (influenza), and adenoviruses. Antiviral agents used for the treatment of HIV and viral hepatitis will not be addressed in this review.
