Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are a large, rapidly evolving group of enzymes that confer resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins and monobactams and are inhibited by clavulanate. Rapid reliable detection of ESBL production is a prerequisite for successful infection management and for monitoring resistance trends and implementation of intervention strategies. We evaluated the performance of the new VITEK 2 ESBL test system (bioMerieux, Inc, Hazelwood, Mo.) in the identification of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates. We examined a total of 1,129 clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae isolates (including 218 that had been previously characterized). The ESBL classification furnished by the VITEK 2 ESBL test system was concordant with that of the comparison method (molecular identification of beta-lactamase genes) for 1,121 (99.3%) of the 1,129 isolates evaluated. ESBL production was correctly detected in 306 of the 312 ESBL-producing organisms (sensitivity, 98.1%; positive predictive value, 99.3%). False-positive results emerged for 2 of the 817 ESBL-negative isolates (specificity, 99.7%; negative predictive value, 99.3%). VITEK 2 ESBL testing took 6 to 13 h (median, 7.5 h; mean +/- SD, 8.2 +/- 2.39 h). This automated short-incubation system appears to be a rapid and reliable tool for routine identification of ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacteriaceae.
