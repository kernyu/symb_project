The current drama of antibiotic resistance has revived interest in phage therapy. In response to this challenge, a phage therapy center was established at our Institute in 2005 which accepts patients from Poland and abroad with antibiotic-resistant infections. We now present data showing that efficient phage therapy of staphylococcal infections is no longer a treatment of last resort (when all antibiotics fail), but allows for significant savings in the costs of healthcare.
