The data on the antimicrobial in vitro action of a complex of natural cytokins (CNC)--the substance and the preparation "Superlymph"--on virulent museum and clinical macrolid-resistant group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, are presented. CNC suppressed the growth of museum test culture of streptococci in the concentration dependent manner. Moreover, the preparation "Superlymph" proved to be an effective antistreptococcal remedy in its action on erythromycin-resistant group A streptococcal (GAS) strains. The substance of the preparation induced the lysis of GAS cells, grown on lawn plates and in the system of spectrophotometric analysis. The effect thus established could be caused by cationic antimicrobial peptides (protegrins), contained in "Superlymph".
