To determine effects of exposure of parental animals to antibiotics on antibiotic resistance in bacteria of offspring, sows were either treated or not treated with oxytetracycline prior to farrowing and their pigs were challenged with Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and treated or not treated with oxytetracycline and apramycin. Fecal Escherichia coli were obtained from sows, and E. coli and salmonella were recovered from pigs. Antibiotic resistance patterns of isolates were determined using a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electroporation were used to characterize the genetic basis for the resistance and to determine the location of resistance genes. Treatments had little effect on resistance of the salmonella challenge organism. The greatest resistance to apramycin occurred in E. coli from pigs treated with apramycin and whose sows had earlier exposure to oxytetracycline. Resistance to oxytetracycline was consistently high throughout the study in isolates from all pigs and sows; however, greater resistance was noted in pigs nursing sows that had previous exposure to that drug. The aac(3)-IV gene, responsible for apramycin resistance, was found in approximately 90% of apramycin-resistant isolates and its location was determined to be on plasmids. Several resistant E. coli bio-types were found to contain the resistance gene. These results indicate that resistance to apramycin and oxytetracycline in E. coli of pigs is affected by previous use of oxytetracycline in sows.
