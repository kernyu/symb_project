Knowledge of the genetic basis for bacterial survival and persistence in soil is a critical component in the development of successful biological control strategies and for understanding the ecological success of bacteria. We found a locus specifying polyphosphate kinase (ppk) and a nonpredicted antisense RNA (iiv8) in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 to be necessary for optimal competitive fitness in LB broth culture and sterile loam soil. Pf0-1 lacking ppk and iiv8 was more than 10-fold less competitive against wild-type Pf0-1 in sterile loam soil low in inorganic phosphate. Studies indicated that ppk, and not iiv8, was required for competitive fitness. No role for iiv8 was identified. While a ppk and iiv8 mutant of Pf0-1 did not have increased sensitivity to osmotic, oxidative, and acid stress, it was more sensitive to elevated temperatures in laboratory medium and during growth in sterile soil. ppk was shown to be part of the Pho regulon in P. fluorescens, being upregulated in response to a low external P(i) concentration. Of importance, overproduction of polyphosphate in the soil environment appears to be more deleterious than production of none at all. Our findings reveal a new role for polyphosphate (and the need for proper regulation of its production) in competitive fitness of P. fluorescens in laboratory and soil environments.
