Genetic analysis of bacterial magnetosome biomineralization has been hindered by the lack of an appropriate methodology for cultivation and genetic manipulation of most magnetotactic bacteria. In this report, a genetic system for Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense is described. The system includes a plating technique that allows the screening of magnetic vs non-magnetic colonies, and a protocol for the transfer of foreign DNA by electroporation and high-frequency conjugation. Various broad-host-range vectors of the IncQ, IncP, and pBBR1 groups were found to be capable of replication in M. gryphiswaldense. Several antibiotic resistance markers that can be expressed in M. gryphiswaldense were identified. Tn 5 transposons delivered on a suicide plasmid showed transpositional insertion into random chromosomal sites.
