Bradyrhizobium strains, isolated in New Caledonia from nodules of the endemic legume Serianthes calycina growing in nickel-rich soils, were able to grow in the presence of 15 mM NiCl2. The genomes of these strains harbored two Ni resistance determinants, the cnr and nre operons. By constructing a cnrA mutant, we demonstrated that the cnr operon determines the high nickel resistance in Bradyrhizobium strains.
