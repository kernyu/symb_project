A 492-bp DNA fragment, designated RM07, was isolated from the chromosomal DNA of the halophilic Archaea, Halobacterium halobium, and was shown to confer promoter activity in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis revealed that RM07 contained three consensus sequences of the archaeal distal promoter element as well as the typical -35 and -10 box sequences of bacterial promoters. Promoter probe analysis confirmed that RM07 conferred promoter activity in all three domains of life: Archaea (Haloferax volcanii), Eukarya (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Bacteria (Escherichia coli). Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis further identified the functional regions within RM07 required for promoter activity. This is the first report of a DNA fragment from Archaea that confers promoter activity in all three domains of life, suggesting that the promoter structure and activity may be viewed as a bridge narrowing the gaps among the different domains of life.
