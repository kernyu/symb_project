OBJECTIVE: To determine the overall carriage rate for Haemophilus influenzae in young children in day-care centers, the frequency of resistance to various classes of antibiotic, and the clonal relationship between isolates of the various resistant phenotypes. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens were obtained and cultured on chocolate agar with bacitracin. Antibiotic susceptibility testing and serotyping were performed for all isolates. The genetic polymorphism of ampicillin-susceptible and beta-lactamase-producing isolates was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using SmaI. RESULTS: Of the 596 NP secretion cultures, 152 (25.5%) were positive for H. influenzae. Sixty-four (42.1%) isolates produced beta-lactamase and two (1.3%) were ampicillin resistant but did not produce beta-lactamase. We were unable to serotype 150 isolates; one isolate belonged to capsular serotype e and one to serotype f. Forty-six major DNA patterns were identified among 76 randomized isolates. beta-lactamase producing isolates more frequently showed EP than ampicillin-susceptible isolates P < 10(-4). The frequency of isolates with EP was significantly lower in day-care centers attended by less than 20 children than in those attended by more than 20 children (P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: Resistance due to beta-lactamase production has disseminated in some day-care centers, mostly by person-to-person spread but also via the possible conjugal transfer of large plasmids between strains. The size of day-care centers may affect the risk of transmission.
