Elevated expression of stress proteins can be a characteristic of human cancer and may be involved in the development of resistance to some types of chemotherapeutic agent. In this paper, the effect of physiological stress conditions, such as glucose deprivation, was investigated in overexpressing nPKCdelta murine melanoma BL6 (BL6T) cells. Glucose stress conditions decreased the proliferative capacity, increasing the percentage of BL6T cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, under such conditions, nPKCdelta, whose subcellular localization is cell cycle dependent, showed a cytoplasmic and perinuclear localization by immunohistochemistry, this being typical for cells in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, these cells expressed GRP-78, a known stress protein. On the other hand, glucose depletion enhanced intracellular melanin as well as tyrosinase activity and expression. In summary, these data demonstrate that stress conditions can modify the biological characteristics of BL6T cells, and therefore can select a quiescent cellular population.
