Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella are widely recognized as important agents of foodborne disease with worldwide distribution. The use of ionophores in feeding growing ruminants is widespread in the United States and has attracted recent interest due to the apparent temporal relationship between initial ionophore use and the increase in human E. coli O157:H7 cases. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of short-term feeding of ionophores on fecal shedding, intestinal concentrations, and antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli O157:H7 and S. typhimurium in growing lambs. Sixteen lambs were used in each experiment, four lambs per treatment group: monensin, laidlomycin propionate, bambermycin, and a control treatment. Lambs were fed a grain and hay (50:50) diet with their respective ionophore for 12 d before experimental inoculation with E. coli O157:H7 or S. typhimurium. Animals were maintained on their respective diets an additional 12 d, and fecal shedding of inoculated pathogens was monitored daily. Lambs were killed and tissues and contents were sampled from the rumen, cecum, and rectum. No differences (P > 0.05) in fecal shedding of Salmonella or E. coli O157:H7 were observed due to treatment. Occurrence of Salmonella or E. coli in luminal contents and tissue samples from the rumen, cecum, and rectum did not differ (P > 0.05) among treatments. Feeding monensin decreased (P < 0.05) the incidence of scours in sheep infected with Salmonella compared with the other treatments. No differences in antimicrobial susceptibility were found in any of Salmonella or E. coli O157:H7 isolates. Results from these studies indicate that short-term ionophore feeding had very limited effects on E. coli and Salmonella shedding or on antimicrobial susceptibility in experimentally infected lambs.
