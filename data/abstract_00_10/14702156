Stool samples obtained from 594 Senegalese patients were examined for characterization of pathogenic Escherichia coli in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related diarrhea. Multiple virulence genes were observed in stool samples obtained from HIV-infected patients with diarrhea. Enteroaggregative E. coli and enteroinvasive E. coli were present in stool samples obtained from patients with diarrhea significantly more often than in stool samples obtained from patients without diarrhea (P=.000001). Quinolones may be an effective alternative treatment for E. coli-related diarrhea in HIV-infected adults in Senegal.
