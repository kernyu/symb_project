Streptogramins represent a unique class of antibiotics remarkable for their antibacterial activity and their unique mechanism of action. These antibiotics are produced naturally as secondary metabolites by a number of Streptomyces species and have been classified into two main groups. They consist of at least two structurally unrelated compounds, group A or M (macrolactones) and group B or S (cyclic hexadepsipeptides). Both groups bind bacterial ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis at the elongation step and they act synergistically in vitro against many microorganisms. Streptogramins A and B act synergistically in vivo; the mixture of the two compounds is more powerful than the individual components and their combined action is irreversible. The pharmacokinetic parameters of group A and B streptogramins in blood are similar. The major gap, limiting the therapeutic use of the natural compounds, was represented by the lack dissolution in water. The synthesis of water-soluble derivatives of pristinamycin I(A) and II(B) has allowed the development of injectable, first represented by quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) and oral formulations, represented by RPR-106972, streptogramins with fixed compositions. Streptogramins have demonstrated activity against Gram-positive microorganisms in vitro and in vivo, including those with multi-drug resistance. Moreover, the absence of cross-resistance to macrolides in many of these microorganisms and the rarity of cross-resistance between the two groups of antibiotics associated with the rapid bacterial killing are the principal features of the streptogramins, offering the possibility for treating the rising number of infections that are caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
