Attempts were made to select resistant pneumococcal mutants by sequential subculturing of 12 clinically isolated pneumococci, [four were penicillin sensitive (MIC) 0.03-0.06 mg/l, four penicillin intermediate (MIC 0.25-0.5 mg/l) and four penicillin resistant (MIC 2-4 mg/l)] in sub-inhibitory concentrations of ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. Subculturing in gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and ceftriaxone selected 12 mutants (12/12), 10 mutants (10/12), 10 mutants (10/12) and three mutants (3/12), respectively. DNA sequencing of the quinolone-resistant mutants showed that most strains had mutations in GyrA at E85 or S81. This in vitro mutation study demonstrates a clear distinction between the low frequency of development of resistance with ceftriaxone exposure as opposed to the high frequency with quinolone exposure.
