The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) is an ATP-binding cassette drug efflux transporter that extrudes xenotoxins from cells in intestine, liver, mammary gland, and other organs, affecting the pharmacological and toxicological behavior of many compounds, including their secretion into the milk. The purpose of this study was to determine whether three widely used fluoroquinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin) are substrates of Bcrp1/BCRP and to investigate the possible role of this transporter in the in vivo pharmacokinetic profile of these compounds and their secretion into the milk. Using polarized cell lines, we found that ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin are transported by mouse Bcrp1 and human BCRP. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that the ciprofloxacin plasma concentration was more than 2-fold increased in Bcrp1(-/-) compared with wild-type mice (1.77 +/- 0.73 versus 0.85 +/- 0.39 microg/ml, p < 0.01) after oral administration of ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve in Bcrp1(-/-) mice was 1.5-fold higher than that in wild-type mice (48.63 +/- 5.66 versus 33.10 +/- 4.68 min x microg/ml, p < 0.05) after i.v. administration (10 mg/kg). The milk concentration and milk/plasma ratio of ciprofloxacin were 2-fold higher in wild-type than in Bcrp1(-/-) lactating mice. We conclude that Bcrp1 is one of the determinants for the bioavailability of fluoroquinolones and their secretion into the milk.
