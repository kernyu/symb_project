Plasmid pGL4W15-96 was constructed from the pGL4W74 vector without promoter for kanamycin and a sequence of 480pb containing the supposed J15 promoter with the objective of confirming the role of J15 sequence as a promoter for Leptospira, which restored the transcription of the gene of resistance to kanamycin in Escherichia coli and Leptospira biflexa, corroborating this way the function of the insertion as a promoter for both organisms.
