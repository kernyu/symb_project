BatG is a trans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase, encoded in the kalimantacin/batumin (kal/bat) biosynthesis operon. It is not essential for the production of the kal/bat secondary metabolite. Instead, BatG is an isoform of FabI, conferring full resistance to target bacteria. It also complements FabI in its role in fatty acid biosynthesis. The identification of FabI as the antibacterial target is important to assess clinical potential of the kalimantacin/batumin antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus.
