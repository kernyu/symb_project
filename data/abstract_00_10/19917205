A 58-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 14-month history of persistent trichomoniasis not responsive to numerous courses of metronidazole and tinidazole. Vaginal secretion samples were obtained for sensitivity testing and treatment recommendations. In vitro susceptibility testing revealed the patient's Trichomonas vaginalis isolate was highly resistant to both metronidazole and tinidazole. She was treated with topical furazolidone and experienced a complete symptomatic cure and culture remained negative 35 days post furazolidone treatment.
