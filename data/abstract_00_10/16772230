We present the results of studies of the in vitro susceptibility of 52 isolates of Trichophyton rubrum and 40 of Trichophyton mentagrophytes to griseofulvin, terbinafine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole and cyclopiroxolamine. All test strains were recovered from patients with toe nail onychomycosis and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each antifungal against both species was individually assessed. In addition, we investigated the MIC of the combination of cyclopiroxolamine and itraconazole and cyclopiroxolamine and ketoconazole. The NCCLS approved procedure M38-A as modified by Santos and Hamdan was employed. The studies of the two drug combinations were conducted with a checkerboard design. Analysis of the data revealed that terbinafine was the most effective in vitro against all isolates, followed in order by itraconazole, cyclopiroxolamine, ketoconazole and fluconazole. We observed no significant difference in the in vitro susceptibility profiles between either species to any of the antifungals (P<0.05). Our in vitro results confirm that terbinafine is the most effective of the antifungals included in this study. Furthermore, synergistic interactions were found in the two drug combinations with all of the dermatophyte test isolates. The latter results are in agreement with clinical data that show synergism between oral and topical antifungals in the treatment of onychomycosis.
