The antibacterial drug discovery industry is fast losing participants; at the same time it is facing the challenge of developing new antibiotics that are effective against frequently occurring and multiply resistant organisms. One intriguing approach is to target bacterial virulence, and the last decade or so has seen a focus on bacterial pathogenesis along with the development of reagents and strategies that could make this possible. Several processes utilised by a range of bacteria to cause infection may be conserved enough to make attractive targets; indeed it is known that mammalian cells can affect bacterial gene expression and vice versa. Interesting targets involving virulence include type III secretion systems, two-component signal transduction systems, quorum sensing, and biofilm formation. In order to better understand these systems and strategies, investigators have developed novel strategies of their own, involving negative selections, surrogate models of infection, and screens for gene induction and antigenicity. Inhibitors of such targets would be unlikely to adversely affect patients, be cross-resistant to existing therapies, or cause resistance themselves. It might be the case that virulence target-based therapies would not be powerful enough to clear an existing infection alone, but if they are instead considered as adjunct therapy to existing antibiotics, or potentiators of the host immune response, they may show efficacy in a non-traditional way.
