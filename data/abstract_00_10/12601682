The aerial parts of Centaurothamnus maximus yielded three cytotoxic guaianolides, chlorojanerin (1), cynaropicrin (2) and janerin (3). The structure elucidation of 1-3 was based on (1)H and (13)C NMR data, mainly 2D-NMR (1)H-(1)H COSY and (1)H-(13)C HETCOR experiments. Compounds 1-3 showed in vitro cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines of malignant melanoma (SK-MEL), epidermoid (KB), ductal (BT-549) and ovarian (SK-OV-3) carcinomas with IC(50) values of 2-6 microgram/mL. In addition, 12 sesquiterpene lactones (4-15), isolated previously from the aerial parts of Vicoa pentanema, were evaluated for cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities. 2alpha- Acetoxy-3beta-hydroxyalantolactone (10) and 8beta-hydroxyparthenolide (14) were found to be the main cytotoxic agents (IC(50) values of 2-6 microgram/mL against SK-MEL, BT-549 and SK-OV-3), while lactones 4, 5, 11 and 15 selectively inhibited the growth of human malignant melanoma (IC(50) value of 3.6-7.3 microgram/mL). Cell aggregation and cell adhesion assays, using HL-60 and HeLa cell lines, evaluated the effect of cytotoxic constituents 1-3, 10 and 14 on immune response and inflammation.
