Here, we report a case of multidrug resistance in a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The patient sequentially received lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil and entecavir, and subsequently developed single-, double- and triple-drug-resistant HBV strains. We consider this case report important because it documents, for the first time, that triple-drug-resistant HBV strains identified in a clinical setting were suppressible by lamivudine add-on adefovir dipivoxil when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was not available.
