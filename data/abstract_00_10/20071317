At the 25th anniversary of the identification of HIV virus as the causative agent of AIDS, virologist and clinician authors provide an overview of the discovery and identification of HIV, its significance in the development of clinical diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, which led to the development of effective antiretroviral treatment. Besides the epidemiological and sociological aspects of the infection, authors provide a detailed chronology of the special aspects of the fight against HIV/AIDS in Hungary, from the diagnosis of the first HIV and AIDS cases, through the establishment of the nationwide screening network and counseling units to the appearance of drug resistant virus mutants, and the recent penetration of African HIV strains to the country. Further actions are urged locally and worldwide for the better understanding the interactions of the human host organism and the HIV virus for the more effective treatment. For these political consensuses, a large scale long term financial support, views based on scientific and public health evidences, and cooperation of the whole society worldwide are needed.
