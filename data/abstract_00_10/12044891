We previously reported that liposomalized 5'-O-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl 2'-C-cyano-2'-deoxy-1-beta-D-arabino-pentofuranosylcytosine (DPP-CNDAC), a hydrophobized derivative of the novel antitumor nucleoside CNDAC, is quite useful for cancer therapy. On the other hand, for anti-neovascular therapy, we recently isolated peptides homing to angiogenic vessels from a phage-displayed random peptide library, and observed that peptide-modified liposomal adriamycin strongly suppressed tumor growth, perhaps through damaging angiogenic endothelial cells. In the present study, we modified DPP-CNDAC-liposomes with one of the angiogenic homing peptides, APRPG, and examined their antitumor activity. Three doses of APRPG-modified DPP-CNDAC-liposomes (15 mg/kg as CNDAC) strongly inhibited tumor growth compared with the same number of doses of unmodified DPP-CNDAC-liposomes. The life span was increased 31.8%, with one completely cured mouse out of the six mice treated. Since the accumulation of liposomes in the tumor tissue was not so much different between APRPG-liposomes and non-modified liposomes, the enhanced therapeutic efficacy may be explained as the alteration of targets, i.e. APRPG-modified DPP-CNDAC-liposomes caused tumor growth suppression through damage of angiogenic endothelial cells. Anti-neovascular therapy promises no drug resistance, and should be effective against essentially any kind of solid tumor; and thus the present results demonstrate another benefit of the therapy, namely, high efficacy of cancer treatment.
