A total of 104 carbapenemase (serine- and metallo-beta-lactamase [MbetaL])-producing strains of the Enterobacteriaceae family collected from 2000 to 2005 in medical centers distributed worldwide were tested against tigecycline and 25 comparators by reference broth microdilution methods. The most frequent carbapenemase was KPC-2 or -3 (73 strains), followed by VIM-1 (14), IMP-1 (11), SME-2 (5), and NMC-A (1). All serine carbapenemases were detected in the United States, while MbetaL-producing strains were isolated in Europe. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of resistance to most antimicrobial agents tested. The rank order of in vitro activity against these strains was as follows: tigecycline (100.0% susceptible) > polymyxin B (88.1%) > amikacin (73.0%) > imipenem (37.5%). Tigecycline was very active (MIC(90), 1 microg/ml) against this significant, contemporary collection of well-characterized strains and appears to be an excellent option compared to the polymyxins for treatment of infections caused by these multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
