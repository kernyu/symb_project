The ChrA protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasmid pUM505 confers resistance to chromate. Using an in vitro system, we reported [Alvarez, A.H. et al. (1999) J. Bacteriol. 181, 7398-7400] that chromate resistance is based on energy-dependent efflux of chromate. It is shown here that ChrA determines in vivo efflux of 51CrO(4)(2-) as well. Chromate-loaded cell suspensions of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 harboring recombinant plasmid pEPL1, which expresses the ChrA protein, showed accelerated efflux of 51CrO(4)(2-) as compared to the plasmidless chromate-sensitive derivative. After a 10-min loading, about 40% of 51CrO(4)(2-) was lost from resistant cells in 15 min. Chromate efflux by resistant cells showed a typical saturation kinetics with an apparent K(m) of 82+/-11 microM chromate and a V(max) of 0.133+/-0.009 nmol chromate min(-1) (mg protein)(-1). Oxyanions sulfate and molybdate inhibited chromate efflux in a concentration-dependent fashion, whereas arsenate and ortho-vanadate had no significant effect on chromate release. Inhibition of chromate extrusion by valinomycin, nigericin, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, but not by oligomycin or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, indicated that chromate efflux was driven by the membrane potential.
