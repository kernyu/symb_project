Rapid identification of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an important problem to adequate patient treatment. However, current clinical assays for determining antibiotic susceptibility in M. tuberculosis require many weeks to complete due to the slow growth of the bacilli. We have developed simple and rapid drug susceptibility test using DNA microarray "Oligoarray TB," that allows the detection of rifampicin (RFP), isoniazide (INH), kanamycin (KM), streptomycin (SM), and ethambutol (EM)-resistant strains within 6 h with DNA extracted directly from sputum or cultured cells. The genes related to drug-resistance, results of detection using Oligoarray TB, comparative evaluation with media, and sequencing analysis of strains generating discrepant results in testing for INH-resistant will be discussed in this presentation.
