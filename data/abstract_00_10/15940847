This paper reports a two-phase study in Bangui, Central African Republic (CAR): first, we assessed the clinical efficacy to chloroquine (CQ), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and amodiaquine (AQ), then we tested the efficacy of two combinations: CQ + SP and AQ + SP. We used the standard 14-day WHO 2001 protocol to compare therapeutic responses in children under 5 years of age with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Bangui between February 2002 and March 2004. The overall treatment failure rates with CQ, AQ, SP, CQ + SP, and AQ + SP were 40.9%, 20.0%, 22.8%, 7.2%, and 0%. These findings suggest that the Ministry of Health should recommend an interim policy with AQ + SP combination as the first-line antimalarial drug in Bangui until best alternative treatments like artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) become available at low prices in the CAR.
