The aims of this study were (i) to identify alternative Mx stimulatory compounds in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and to characterise the kinetics and intensity of the stimulated responses and (ii) to investigate the effect of temperature on such responses by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Mx transcripts were measured in Atlantic salmon parr kept at 14 degrees C and injected with either LPS, the synthetic double-stranded polyribonucleotide poly I:C, Vibrio anguillarum serotypes I and II-ordalii bacterin, beta-glucan, whole yeast cells or yeast RNA. Sampling periods lasted until transcripts were undetectable or up to three weeks after immunisation. The effect of temperature on poly I:C-induced Mx response was studied by injecting parr kept at 6 degrees C. Newly hatched salmon fry were immersed once, twice or three times in the Vibrio bacterin diluted five or 10 times and sampled for three weeks. None of the yeast compounds induced Mx expression in Atlantic salmon parr. LPS induced a very low Mx response 2 and 3 days after injection. The Vibrio bacterin administered by injection in parr (but not by immersion in fry) resulted in strong Mx induction on days 2 and 3, disappearing by day 6. Poly I: C-induced Mx responses that were more intense and longer lasting than those induced by the bacterin, peaking on day 3 and lasting over 6 days, disappearing by day 9 at 14 degrees C. Lower temperature caused a longer lasting Mx response to poly I:C (at least 21 days), which peaked on days 7-14, with a similar intensity and no delayed onset as compared with the response at 14 degrees C. However, some toxicity of the poly I:C was indicated in treatments at 6 degrees C.
