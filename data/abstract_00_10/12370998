The rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) differ from slow-growing mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis by virtue of their more rapid growth in culture media and their in vitro resistance to standard antituberculosis drugs. The RGM can produce numerous infections including chronic lung disease. The most common causes of pulmonary disease are Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium fortuitum. This article reviews the management of patients with lung disease caused by RGM.
