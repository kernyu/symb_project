Combinations of carbapenems and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg; a main constituent of tea catechins) showed potent synergy against 24 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MICs of imipenem in the presence of EGCg at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 microg/ml, were restored to the susceptible breakpoint (< or =4 microg/ml) for 8, 38, 46, and 75% of the MRSA isolates, respectively. Similar results were also observed for combinations of panipenem or meropenem and EGCg. Therefore, the combinations may be worthy of further evaluation in vivo against MRSA infection.
