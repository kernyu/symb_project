OBJECTIVES: To monitor for a decade the incidence and the clinical and microbiologic characteristics of pneumococcal bacteremia in children in Soweto and to assess the influence of HIV infection on any changes. METHODS: Case records of children with pneumococcal bacteremia at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital from July, 1986, to June, 1987 (1986/ 1987), and from July, 1996, to June, 1997 (1996/ 1997), were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were 194 episodes, 62 in 19861 1987 and 132 in 1996/1997. The minimum annual incidence for children younger than 5 years of age increased from 61 per 100000 (179 per 100000 for those <12 months old) in 1986/1987 to 130 per 100000 (349 per 100000 for those <12 months old) in 1996/1997. Sixty-seven (60%) of 111 patients tested in 1996/1997 were HIV-seropositive; none were tested in 1986/1987. The HIV-infected compared with HIV-noninfected were more likely to be malnourished (61% vs. 36%, P = 0.02), less likely to have other underlying disease (12% vs. 50%, P = 0.00001) and more frequently used antibiotics recently (69% vs. 43%, P = 0.008). Penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates were found in 22 (35%) patients in 1986/1987 and 52 (39%) in 1996/1997. There was no significant change in antimicrobial susceptibility during the decade or by HIV serostatus. CONCLUSIONS: Children in Soweto had a high incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia which doubled during the decade mainly as a result of the impact of the HIV epidemic. There has been no significant change in antimicrobial susceptibility for the decade.
