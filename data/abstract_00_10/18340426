According to the new German guidelines therapy of chronic hepatitis B is recommended when HBV-DNA is >10.000 copies/ml and when GPT is >twice the ULN or biopsy shows inflammation/fibrosis. When patients are not suitable for interferon therapy, mono-therapy with adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine of lamivudine may be initiated provided that HBV-DNA is <1 Mio. copies/ml and cirrhosis is absent. When viral load is high, entecavir should be preferred. HBV-DNA need to be checked for early detection of non-response or resistance. When resistance is present, combination therapy is recommended.New studies warrant individualization of previous recommendation for therapy of hepatitis C because one can now early evaluate how successful and long the therapy shall be. When viral load is low and HCV-RNA becomes negative after 4 weeks, therapy may be shortened to 24 weeks. Without such rapid response HCV-RNA needs to be checked after 12 and 24 weeks: when HCV-RNA becomes negative only after 24 weeks, a prolongation of therapy might be advisable.
