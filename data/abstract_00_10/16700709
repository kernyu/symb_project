Enterobacter cloacae (n = 110) isolates from a district hospital in Taiwan were screened for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). In total, 17 ESBL-producers were identified, based on the combination-disk synergy test using cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanic acid. Investigation of ESBL genes in 33 ceftazidime-resistant isolates revealed the SHV-12 gene in the same 17 ESBL-producers. In addition, one isolate also carried the CTX-M-3 gene, and two isolates also carried the CTX-M-9 gene. No major epidemic clone of ESBL-producers was identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Routine screening for the ESBL phenotype, focusing on ceftazidime-resistant E. cloacae, should be undertaken in this area.
