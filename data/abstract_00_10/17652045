BACKGROUND: In chronic hepatitis B, long-term use of alpha interferon is hampered by side effects, and long-term treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues is burdened by drug-resistant mutants. We hypothesized that alternate rounds of lamivudine and alpha interferon might circumvent previous shortcomings. AIM: To evaluate efficacy of sequential lamivudine or IFN-alpha2b monotherapies in preventing occurrence of tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) mutants and achieving virological and biochemical response. METHODS: Fifteen patients with hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HBe-positive chronic hepatitis received four consecutive rounds of monotherapy with lamivudine (100 mg/day), IFN-alpha2b (5MU/tiw), lamivudine, IFN-alpha2b. Serum HBV-DNA levels were evaluated during and off treatment, HBV polymerase and pre-core/core regions sequenced. RESULTS: End-of-treatment response was achieved in 10 patients (67%). One patient did not respond, a second developed genotypic resistance at week 24. A rebound in viremia occurred in three patients at week 48. Six patients (40%) remained sustained responders. Triple promoter mutations at nucleotides 1762-1764-1896 prevailed in non-responders (60%) as compared to responders (20%). L180M/M204V mutations were identified during virological breakthrough. CONCLUSION: Sequential approach of alternate rounds of lamivudine or interferon may help patients to tolerate a prolonged schedule of therapy and protect them from emergence of viral strains.
