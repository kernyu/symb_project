Despite the limited reports of praziquantel resistance, the relative success of chemotherapy-based control programmes for schistosomiasis has prompted overdue efforts to expand the use of cheap, generic, praziquantel in sub-Saharan Africa. The likely impact of such programmes on the development and spread of praziquantel resistance is uncertain, but this possibility reinforces the need for monitoring the spectrum of praziquantel sensitivity of schistosome populations and for an improved knowledge of the precise targets for the action of the drug. The search for alternatives to praziquantel and other tools for control of schistosomiasis must continue.
