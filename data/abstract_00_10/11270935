In recent years, one of the more alarming aspects of clinical microbiology has been the dramatic increase in the incidence of antibacterial resistance among pathogens causing nosocomial as well as community-acquired infections. Numerous antibacterial agents have lost their in vitro activity as a result of selective pressure exerted by antibacterial usage. There is a general consensus on the fact that emergence and spread of resistance may be delayed by improving hygiene measures, reducing inappropriate use of antibacterials, and adopting successful empirical therapy based on sound epidemiological data. As a consequence, worldwide international studies of antibacterial resistance surveillance have been established. Surveys such as the Alexander Project and the SENTRY Programme supply high quality data to participating countries, stimulate collaboration and provide the educational information required for clinical decision-making that may result in improved cure rates.
