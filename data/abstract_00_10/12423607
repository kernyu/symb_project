Community acquired pneumonia is a common illness with significant morbidity and mortality and a high cost to society. Guidelines for management in the UK issued by the British Thoracic Society have been in existence since 1993 (Br J Hosp Med 1993; 49: 346-350). These have been updated in 2001 (Thorax 2001; 56(Suppl IV)). This review summarises the guidelines with emphasis on aetiology, investigations and antibiotic treatment.
