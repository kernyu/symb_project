The emerging reports of clinical failures using macrolides and their associations with macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae prompted us to review the literature describing these cases. Thirty-three cases reporting macrolide treatment failure during treatment of pneumococcal infections were available for review. The most prevalent diagnosis (24/27 or 88.8% of available diagnoses) was community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Previous medical history included cardiopulmonary disease in eight (24.2%) and immunocompromised states in five (15.1%) patients. The majority, 31/33 (93.9%) of patients received oral macrolide treatment in an outpatient setting. S. pneumoniae was isolated from the blood in 26 (78.8%) of 33 patients, three (9.1%) patients had bacteria present in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid, two (6%) patients grew S. pneumoniae from blood and bronchial washings and two (6%) patients had positive sputum cultures. The MLS(B) phenotype was the most predominant phenotype present in 12 (63.2%) of 19 patients. After failing initial macrolide treatment, 26 (78.8%) of 33 patients received parenteral antibiotic treatment. Of 33 patients admitted to hospital, 29 (87.8%) had their outcome described as 'survived'.
