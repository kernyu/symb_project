It was shown in 1999 thalidomide could induce a therapeutic response in patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Between March 2000 and January 2002, we treated 21 patients with refractory multiple myeloma with thalidomide (Thalidomide) at initial dose of 400 mg a day. Response rate (Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome criteria) was 33 percent and median progression-free survival estimated to 15 months. All patients suffered from drowsiness and constipation requiring lowest doses. Five patients developed a sensitive neuropathy. Eight refractory patients were treated by a combination of their prior maximally tolerated dose of thalidomide and monthly dexamethasone (Soludecadron) alone (n = 4) or associated to cyclophosphamide (Endoxan) and etoposide (Etopophos) (n = 4). Six patients on 8 were responders. Our results suggest that the combination thalidomide/dexamethasone should be compared to thalidomide alone in a prospective, randomized study in patients with refractory multiple myeloma.
