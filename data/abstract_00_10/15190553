Deep infection is a devastating complication following total joint arthroplasty. Preclinical testing; randomized; clinical trials; national joint replacement data; and our experience indicate that the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is a potentially effective strategy in reducing the risk of deep infection following both primary and revision total joint arthroplasty. Allergic reactions, bacterial resistance, and cost represent barriers to the widespread use of antibiotic bone cement.
