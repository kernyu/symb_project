Molecular techniques are of growing importance in the study of anthelmintic resistance in trichostrongylid worm populations. A knowledge of the genetic determinants of benzimidazole (BZ) resistance has made it possible to construct a molecular tool for genotyping individual worms, in respect of mutation of the beta-tubulin gene responsible for BZ resistance. This tool offers new possibilities in the diagnosis of BZ resistance, and also in the study of anthelmintic use and other breeding management factors that can affect the selection of BZ-resistant alleles in worm populations. New molecular methods have also made it possible to study the origin and diversity of BZ-resistant alleles in trichostrongylid populations. The results demonstrate the value of a multidisciplinary approach to the study of anthelmintic resistance, combining molecular, ecological and epidemiological techniques.
