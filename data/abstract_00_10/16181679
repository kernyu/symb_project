Patients with mutations in the IFNgamma/IL-12 pathway show an exquisite susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases. An IL-12Rbeta1 deficient patient with impaired intestinal absorption suffered from a 13 year culture-positive Mycobacterium bovis-BCG infection with acquired multidrug resistance. A combined parenteral and enteral anti-mycobacterial treatment, including recombinant IFNgamma, helped to clear his infection.
