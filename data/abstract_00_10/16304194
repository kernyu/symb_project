In vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for 21 antimicrobials against 41 isolates of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small-colony type, the cause of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. Of the antimicrobials used most widely in Africa, oxytetracycline and tilmicosin were effective, while the isolates were resistant to tylosin. These results provide a baseline for monitoring antimicrobial resistance.
