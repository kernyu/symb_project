Bacterial speck caused by the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (P. s. tomato) is a devastating disease of tomato plants. Here we show that inhibition of Ep5C gene expression, which encodes a secreted cationic peroxidase, is sufficient to confer resistance against P. s. tomato. The inhibition of Ep5C protein accumulation in antisense tomato plants established resistance that was not accompanied by the pre-activation of known defense pathways. Therefore, Ep5C inhibition represents a novel form of disease resistance based on a loss-of-gene function in the plant required for successful infection by a compatible bacterial pathogen. Ep5C expression is rapidly induced by H2O2, a reactive oxygen intermediate normally generated during the course of a plant-pathogen interaction. This was corroborated by monitoring the expression of an Ep5C-GUS gene in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Collectively, these results identify a signaling pathway that uses early signals generated during the oxidative burst, such as H2O2, for the selective activation of host factors required for mounting a compatible interaction. Thus, Ep5C provides a new resource for developing bacterial speck disease-resistant varieties.
