Antimicrobial susceptibility test of 98 isolates of Salmonella was assayed from September 2003 to February 2004 using the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS).The result revealed that 32.7% of Salmonella isolates were resistant to one or more of the 24 antimicrobials tested. Generally resistance for 13 different antimicrobial drugs was recognized. The most common resistance was to streptomycin (24/32, 75%), ampicillin (19/32, 59.4%), tetracycline (15/32, 46.9%), spectinomycin (13/32, 40.6%) and sulfisoxazole (13/32, 40.6%). All the three Salmonella Kentucky isolates showed resistance to at least 8 antimicrobials. Out of the 12 Salmonella Braenderup isolates, 10 (83.3%) showed multidrug resistance to ampicillin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and trimethoprim. Among the 8 S. Hadar isolates 7 (86.5%) showed antimicrobial resistance. All the 6 S. Dublin isolates were resistant to carbadox (100%). All the 6 S. Haifa isolates were resistant for at least ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline. Up to ten different antimicrobial resistances pattern was observed. Multiple antimicrobial drug resistance was observed in 23 Salmonella isolates (23.5%). The level of antimicrobial resistance was significantly higher for isolates from chicken carcass (18/29, 62.1%) and pork isolates (5/22, 22.7%) (p = 0.003). The findings of the present study ascertain that significant proportion Salmonella isolates have developed resistance for routinely prescribed antimicrobial drugs and poses considerable health hazards to the consumers unless prudent control measures are instituted.
