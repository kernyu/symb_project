In HIV-infected patients with multiple antiretroviral treatment failure, two trials show that adding darunavir + ritonavir to optimised antiretroviral treatment is more effective than adding other protease inhibitors. Clinical trials, involving relatively few patients, revealed no significant adverse effects that had not previously been seen with HIV protease inhibitors. There is a high risk of drug interactions with darunavir.
