Candida haemulonii(types I and II) is rarely isolated from clinical specimens. We isolated a strain that is phylogenetically close to C. haemulonii from the blood of a Thai patient, and named it C. pseudohaemulonii sp. nov. (CBS 10099T = JCM 12453T = DMST 17134T). The new species and C. haemulonii types I and II were resistant to amphotericin B and azole agents but were susceptible to a 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthetase inhibitor, micafungin, and 5-flucytosine. The species were easily distinguished using an ID32 yeast identification kit. The taxonomic description of C. pseudohaemulonii sp. nov. is presented.
