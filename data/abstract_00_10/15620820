In the 21st century, we face the problems of escalating antibiotic resistance, difficult-to-treat infections and slowed new drug development. Healthcare practitioners are increasingly recognising the importance of good antimicrobial stewardship. Various strategies such as formulary management, prior approval, clinical pathways, post-prescribing evaluation and intravenous to oral conversion have been used singly or in combination to improve prescribing and reduce costs. Combining a multifaceted approach with a full-time dedicated multidisciplinary team appears to be capable of yielding satisfactory clinical and economic outcomes and most importantly, sustaining efforts of antimicrobial stewardship. The multidisciplinary approach to antibiotic management should be tailored to fit the individual needs of an institution. More data are needed to document effects on curbing resistance.
