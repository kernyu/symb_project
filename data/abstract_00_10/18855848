Aspergillus fumigatus is the predominant etiological agent of sino-orbital aspergillosis in humans and animals. Here we report for the first time A. udagawae, a previously recognised but rare opportunistic pathogen causing fatal orbital aspergillosis in a cat. Identification of this isolate was secured by comparative sequence based analyses of the ITS and the beta tubulin region. Antifungal susceptibility testing results revealed that this isolate had high in vitro MIC to amphotericin B (AMB) that correlated with in vivo failure of therapy with AMB.
