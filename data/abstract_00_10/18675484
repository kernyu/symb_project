The antibacterial potential of a preparation of medicinal herbs for the treatment of salmonellosis was evaluated. The preparation contained a combination of methanolic extracts from Mume Fructus, Coptidis Rhizoma and Schizandrae Fructus, and is designated NP532. NP532 was tested against 26 different Salmonella stains. All these strains were affected by NP532 even though many of the salmonella strains were resistant to multiple antibiotics. The MIC values of this combination against the Salmonella strains varied from 0.49 to 7.8 mg/ml. The in vivo antibacterial activity of NP532 was examined using a S. Gallinarum infection chicken model. The chickens were initially infected with S. Gallinarum, and NP532 was then administered. This preparation was found to have major effects on mortality. The histopathological observations of the NP532 treated animals did not show any of the clinical signs and rarely showed histological damage associated with the disease. On the other hand, the untreated controls showed the clinical signs, e.g. congestion and necrotic changes in the liver, kidney, and spleen. This suggests that NP532 might be an effective treatment for salmonellosis.
