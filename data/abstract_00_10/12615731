The resistance of neuroblastoma (NB) cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis has been attributed to a lack of caspase 8 expression. Here we demonstrate a clinically applicable molecular targeting strategy that not only increases caspase 8 expression ex vivo in NB cell lines but also in the tumor tissues of NB patients receiving IFN-gamma treatment. We identify the functional caspase 8 promoter, which is different from the methylated region reported previously, and show promoter activity is up-regulated by IFN-gamma through a IFN-gamma activation site-containing region. IFN-gamma also induces TRAIL expression in NB cell lines. However, the IFN-gamma restoration of caspase 8 in some NB cells revealed persistent TRAIL resistance in most NB cell lines examined. This additional lesion in the TRAIL path is because of a loss of cell membrane TRAIL receptors (TR1/TR2) not only in cell lines but in most of the NB tumor tissues evaluated. Restoration of TR2 expression by transfection enhances IFN-gamma-induced TRAIL sensitivity. Furthermore, we have found that we can improve TRAIL sensitivity in NB by reconstituting caspase 8 with IFN-gamma and TR2 with chemotherapeutic agents.
