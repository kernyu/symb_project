The influence of sub-MIC of ciprofloxacin on the surface properties of 25 non-P mannose-resistant uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains was studied. Thirteen isolates responded to antibiotic treatment with an increase in haemagglutination titre and/or surface hydrophobicity, which correlated with a higher expression of surface proteins. Only UPEC strains with ciprofloxacin-enhanced hydrophobicity increased their adhesiveness to urinary catheters that correlated, in one analysed case, with a dramatic increase in the number of fimbriae peripherally located. The overall results indicate that sub-MICs of ciprofloxacin could increase the adhesiveness, and hence the risk of colonization by UPEC strains expressing mannose-resistant adhesins different from type P.
