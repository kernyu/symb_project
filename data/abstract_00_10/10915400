Clarithromycin, an advanced-generation macrolide antibiotic, has demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). Potent activity against Streptococcus pyogenes and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile have made it a reasonable alternative for treatment of patients with streptococcal pharyngitis. The safety and efficacy of clarithromycin and penicillin V were compared in a randomized, investigator-blind study. Children 6 months to 12 years of age received 5 days of clarithromycin suspension 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (n = 268) or 10 days of penicillin V suspension 13.3 mg/kg three times daily (n = 260). Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms of pharyngitis, and throat swabs for culture were obtained prior to therapy, at the end of therapy, and at follow-up. Clarithromycin and penicillin V produced comparable rates of clinical success (cure + improvement) at the posttreatment (97% and 94%) and follow-up (81% and 82%) evaluations. The GABHS eradication rate, however, was significantly higher with clarithromycin (94% vs 78%, P < .001). Both drugs were well tolerated; gastrointestinal complaints were similar and mild. Resistance did not occur with the short course of clarithromycin or the standard regimen of penicillin V. Five days' treatment with clarithromycin was superior to 10 days of penicillin in eradicating S. pyogenes.
