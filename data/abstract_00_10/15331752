The gamma(1)34.5 gene product is important for the resistance of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) to interferon. However, since the inhibition of protein synthesis observed in cells infected with a gamma(1)34.5 mutant virus results from the combined loss of the gamma(1)34.5 gene product and the failure to translate the late Us11 mRNA, we sought to characterize the relative interferon sensitivity of mutants unable to produce either the Us11 or the gamma(1)34.5 polypeptide. We now demonstrate that primary human cells infected with a Us11 mutant virus are hypersensitive to alpha interferon, arresting translation upon entry into the late phase of the viral life cycle. Furthermore, immediate-early expression of Us11 by a gamma(1)34.5 deletion mutant is sufficient to render translation resistant to alpha interferon. Finally, we establish that the Us11 gene product is required for wild-type levels of replication in alpha interferon-treated cells and, along with the gamma(1)34.5 gene, is an HSV-1-encoded interferon resistance determinant.
