Sixty Gram-negative bacterial isolates were collected from Palestinian hospitals in 2006. Thirty-two (53.3%) isolates showed multidrug resistance phenotypes. PCR and DNA sequencing were used to characterize integrons and antimicrobial resistance genes. PCR screening showed that 19 (31.7%) and five (8.3%) isolates were positive for class 1 and class 2 integrons, respectively. DNA-sequencing results for the captured antimicrobial resistance gene cassettes within class 1 integrons identified the following genes: dihydrofolate reductases, dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA7, dfrA12, dfrA17 and dfrA25; aminoglycoside adenyltransferases, aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, aadA12 and aadB; aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, aac(6')-Ib; and chloramphenicol resistance gene, cmlA1. ESBL were identified in 25 (41.7%) isolates. The identified ESBL were bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-56), bla(OXA-1), bla(SHV-1), bla(SHV-12), bla(SHV-32) and bla(TEM-1) genes. Moreover, we characterized the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, aac(6')-Ib-cr and qnrB2, which were detected in seven (11.7%) and two (3.3%) isolates, respectively. In this study various types of antibiotic resistance genes have been identified in Gram-negative bacteria from Palestinian hospitals, many of which are reported in the Middle East area for the first time.
