We developed a novel multiplex PCR assay for rapid identification and discrimination of the USA300 and USA400 strains and concomitant detection of Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes, with simultaneous discrimination of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains, S. aureus strains from coagulase-negative staphylococci, and staphylococci from other bacteria.
