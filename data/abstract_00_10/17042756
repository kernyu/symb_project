Candida dubliniensis and Candida albicans are dimorphic fungal species with a number of pathogenic capabilities, including biofilm formation, systemic infection and development of fluconazole resistance. In this study, the ability of farnesol to disrupt these virulence capabilities was investigated. Biofilm assessment and susceptibility studies indicated antifungal and antibiofilm properties for farnesol on both species with a disruptive effect on the cell membrane. Synergy testing of farnesol and fluconazole in resistant strains resulted in reversal of fluconazole resistance, indicating a potential application for farnesol as an adjuvant therapeutic agent.
