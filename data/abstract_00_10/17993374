During 2001-2005, 210 Salmonella enterica strains were isolated from seafood samples imported into US. Strains of S. enterica serovar Weltevreden were the most predominantly found among the 64 different serovars isolated. A total of 37 Salmonella Weltevreden isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), plasmid profiles and antibiotic susceptibility to assess genetic diversity. Our results showed a low frequency of antibiotic resistance; 35 of the 37 isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, sulfisoxazole, streptomycin and kanamycin. Only two isolates, from samples originating in the Philippines and India, showed resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline and to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole and tetracycline, respectively. Of the 37 isolates, two isolates did not carry any plasmid and 35 isolates harbored several small and mega-plasmids. These isolates were differentiated into 10 distinct types based on plasmid profiles. Four different PFGE clusters were obtained with a genetic similarity of 66-76%. Four groups of isolates (formed by two or three isolates each) showed 100% similarity in the PFGE profiles. One of these groups included strains isolated in Vietnam in 2003, 2004 and 2005 from fish and shrimp. The other groups included strains isolated in Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand in 2000, 2004 and 2005 from snail, shrimp and fish. Our findings show genetic diversity and temporal persistence of S. enterica serovar Weltevreden in recently monitored seafood imports.
