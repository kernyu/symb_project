The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 337 gram-positive European clinical isolates with known resistance genes was determined. The MIC ranges for Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, pneunococci, and streptococci were 0.03 to 1, 0.25 to 8, 0.12 to 1, and 0.06 to 8 micro g/ml, respectively. For only one streptococcus isolate and seven enterococcus isolates was the MIC 8 micro g/ml.
