The occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in strongyles was investigated in 440 horses on 90 farms in Switzerland. The egg hatch assay suggested that benzimidazole (BZ)-resistance was present in 40 of 82 farms (49%). Faecal egg count reduction after pyrantel-treatment was above 96% in 14 of 15 farms. In the remaining farm the efficacy was only 80%. Ivermectin efficacy was investigated on 5 farms and the efficacy was recorded at 98-100%. Faecal cultures undertaken after treatment revealed almost exclusively larvae of the family Cyathostominae. Data about management practices, pasture hygiene and anthelmintic usage were obtained with a questionnaire. Horses were treated on average 3.5 times per year. In 75% of the farms BZ were a component of the seasonal treatment schedule. Only the use of BZ had a significant correlation with the presence of BZ-resistance (P < 0.01). Recommendations for the control of equine strongyles should include measures that minimize the risk of resistance developing against remaining effective anthelmintics.
