We reassessed the in vitro synergistic effect of fluconazole with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent ibuprofen against the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. No synergistic effect of fluconazole combined with ibuprofen was seen against fluconazole-susceptible strains, but a remarkable effect was seen against fluconazole-resistant strains (FIX index: 0.02-0.03). Furthermore, vigorous growth of the microorganism, the so-called 'Eagle effect', was observed at concentrations higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ibuprofen and fluconazole. Our results suggest that the combination of ibuprofen and fluconazole should prove useful for treating infection caused by fluconazole-resistant C. albicans.
