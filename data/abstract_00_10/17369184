Anthocyanin synthesis regulation gene C1-Lc was used as the reporter gene to optimize the parameters of gene-gun transformation protocol through counting of red spots on wheat calli after transient expression. Wheat Beclin1 like gene TaTBL and thiosulfate sulfutransferase gene TaTST proved to have an increased expression level after induction of wheat powdery mildew fungus (Erysiphe graminis f.sp. tritici Em. Marchal.). These two resistance-related genes were constructed into expression vectors driven by the strong ubi promoter and used to perform genetic transformation on wheat cv Yangmai158 immature embryo-derived calli through particle bombardment. After two rounds of herbicide bialaphos selection and regeneration, herbicide-resistance plants were obtained, which were subsequently subjected to PCR analysis. Five TaTBL transgenic plants and six TaTST transgenic plants were identified. Pathogen inoculation of detached leaves showed that the introduction of exogenous gene increased wheat resistance level by delaying the development of powdery mildew symptoms.
