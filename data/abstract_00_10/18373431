The impact of tipranavir plasma levels (TPV C(min)) on virological response was examined in 36 antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected individuals. Although TPV C(min) did not predict outcome in patients with less than five or more than eight baseline TPV-associated resistance mutations, TPV C(min) values were greater in responders than in nonresponders with five to seven baseline TPV-associated resistance mutations (38.8 vs. 13.8 g/ml, p = 0.017). Thus, therapeutic drug monitoring might be helpful in ensuring a viral response in this subset of patients.
