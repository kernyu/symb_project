UNLABELLED: Private dispensaries play an important role in the use of drugs such as antibiotics at community level. However, the knowledge and perceptions of staff working in these private dispensaries as regards bacterial resistance have not been sufficiently studied. OBJECTIVES: To assess the knowledge and perceptions of staff working in private dispensaries in Abidjan as regards bacterial resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was carried out among 123 members of staff working in private dispensaries, during a horizontal study conducted in 18 private dispensaries selected at random in the town of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast. Group meetings were also held to better understand the perceptions of staff working in these private dispensaries as regards bacterial resistance. RESULTS: Four antibiotics out of five bought in these private dispensaries in Abidjan were dispensed by pharmacy assistants. However, they were less informed than the pharmacists as regards bacterial resistance and the factors involved in its emergence. All the pharmacists interviewed in the study showed a good theoretical knowledge of bacterial resistance. However, the group meetings revealed that the risks of emergence of bacterial resistance in the case of antibiotics being dispensed without a prescription, and the threat of this resistance in terms of public health, were less perceived by the pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: Assistants in dispensaries are less well-informed about bacterial resistance and the factors determining its emergence even though they dispense the most antibiotics to customers. Pharmacists have theoretical knowledge of bacterial resistance but are less conscious of its impact in terms of public health. Information campaigns on bacterial resistance are highly recommended as regards staff working in private dispensaries in Abidjan.
