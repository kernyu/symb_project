The original screening test and one-point population analysis (OPPA) were compared for the detection of hetero-vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the influence of osmolarity on those tests was evaluated. The positivity rates and the reproducibilities were similar for both tests. The addition of NaCl increased the MIC as well as the positivity rates for both tests and the reproducibility of OPPA.
