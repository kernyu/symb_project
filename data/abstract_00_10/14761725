We have studied the in vitro interactions of amphotericin B (AMB) with terbinafine (TBF), itraconazole, voriconazole (VCZ), albaconazole, and ravuconazole (RVZ), as well as TBF combined with the same azoles, against 11 isolates of Fusarium spp. using the fractional inhibitory concentration index. The highest percentage of synergistic interactions was observed for the combinations AMB-RVZ, TBF-VCZ, and TBF-RCZ.
