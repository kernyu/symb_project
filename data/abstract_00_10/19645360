Fifty five thermophilic Campylobacter spp. strains were isolated from the caecum of broilers, cecum and colon of pigs and from human faeces. The strains were identified as Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. The more prevalent species in humans and broilers was Campylobacter jejuni, and in pigs Campylobacter coli. In the framework of this study, sensitivity to ciprofloxacin in isolated strains of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli was tested by E-test. Resistant to ciprofloxacin were 50.0% of 24 thermophilic Campylobacter strains isolated from humans. In 16 tested strains isolated from broilers, 56.2% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. More resistant species was Campylobacter coli (83.3%). In 15 strains of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. isolated from pigs, the percentage of resistant strains was 26.7%, a relatively high percentage considering the quinolones have not been extensively used in swine farming compared to poultry farming.
