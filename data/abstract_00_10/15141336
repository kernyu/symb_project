In order to determine the potential role that various antifungal agents might have in the management of cryptococcosis in tropical areas, the in vitro susceptibility of Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from Africa ( n=52) and Cambodia ( n=110) to three antifungal agents (amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole) were compared using the E-test method. The results of this study (i) confirm the value of the E-test for testing the in vitro susceptibility of C. neoformans towards voriconazole; (ii) provide the first evidence demonstrating good activity of amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole against Cambodian isolates; and (iii) show there are differences in susceptibility between African and Asian C. neoformans isolates, with Cambodian isolates appearing less susceptible to the agents tested but with amphotericin B maintaining good activity.
