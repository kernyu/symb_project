One hundred isolates of Staphylococcs aureus were collected in a laboratory serving several hospitals and clinics in southeastern Wisconsin and tested for mupirocin susceptibility. Only two isolates of S. aureus showed mupirocin resistance. The mupirocin-resistant isolates were from hospitalized patients with positive blood cultures.
