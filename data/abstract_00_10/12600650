The improved prognosis of HIV-infection that has occurred since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in renewed emphasis being placed on co-morbidities associated with HIV-infection, and chronic viral hepatitis in particular. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important infection in HIV-1 infected individuals because of the influence of HIV-1 co-infection on the natural history of HBV infection. Antiviral therapies with activity against both viruses have enabled targeted therapy in co-infected individuals, however, optimism regarding improved prognosis has been tempered by the development of antiviral resistant HBV. Emerging new classes of HBV therapies herald the possibility of combination HBV therapy.
