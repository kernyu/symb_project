OBJECTIVES: Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infections. However, the two antibiotics have not been compared in terms of safety and efficacy in a prospective randomized study. The objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the two drugs in the treatment of VREF infections in cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty cancer patients with VREF infection were randomized to receive linezolid 600 mg every 12 h or quinupristin-dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg every 8 h. All patients were followed up for 30 days after discontinuation of study drugs. RESULTS: Linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin had comparable clinical responses (58% and 43%, respectively, P = 0.6). Myalgias and/or arthralgias occurred at a frequency of 33% in patients who received quinupristin-dalfopristin, but were not observed in the linezolid group (P = 0.03). In contrast, drug-related thrombocytopenia occurred in 11% of patients who received linezolid, but was not observed in the quinupristin-dalfopristin group (P = 0.2). CONCLUSION: In cancer patients, quinupristin-dalfopristin treatment is associated with a relatively high frequency of myalgias/arthralgias; however, profound thrombocytopenia might limit the choice of linezolid in a subpopulation of cancer patients.
