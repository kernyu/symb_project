Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), a generalized exfoliative dermatitis complicating infections by exfoliative toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, is rarely observed in adults, especially in those with chronic renal failure. In contrast to the mortality in infants, the mortality in adults is usually high. A case of generalized SSSS in a peritoneal dialysis patient is reported. A-62-year old Japanese man in whom peritoneal dialysis had been carried out was admitted to our hospital with acute peritonitis. It was intractable peritonitis in terms of resistance to various antibiotics; however, improvement of the peritonitis was shown after the injection of vancomycin. Nine days after the completion of this medication, erythema appeared in the eyes and mouth, and around the nostrils, with an exothermic reaction at 39.0 degrees C. Radial cracks formed in the face within a few days, and the erythema rapidly expanded to the neck, axilla, the whole body. The blood pressure was also lowered, and this led to a state of shock. Culture of skin biopsy specimens yielded identical strains of S. aureus. A presumptive diagnosis of SSSS was made. The patient was treated with antibiotics that were effective against the organisms and with both fluid supplementation and dopamine, resulting in subsidence of the signs and symptoms. The exothermic reaction and skin symptoms were improved promptly, with improvement in the general condition, including the state of shock. This appears to be the first reported case of SSSS caused by S. aureusin an adult patient with peritoneal dialysis who was treated successfully. It is very important that SSSS be differentiated from toxic epidermal necrosis, as the treatment is different.
