Nocathiacin I (1) and nocathiacin IV (2) are novel indole-containing thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, which exhibit potent activity against key Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including multi drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium. New nocathiacins 7-12 were prepared from 2 by a condensation with glycolaldehyde followed by tandem reductive amination of the 2-oxoethyl intermediate 4. The latter was formed via Amadori rearrangement from initial 2-hydroxyethylideneamide 3. This transformation readily tolerates the complex architecture of nocathiacins and allows selective incorporation of water solubilizing groups to the primary amide in 2 without protecting group manipulation.
