The article contains a clinical- X-ray- and laboratory description of 56 patients with tuberculosis (disease length ranging from 2 to 5 years), who, during the previous treatment stage, received a therapy in compliance with the generally accepted methods and without any effect. All patients discharged bacteria. Drug-resistance to 3 and more preparations was registered in all patients. A complex approach to the therapy of patients with destructive pulmonary tuberculosis is suggested, within the study, with regard for the presence of multidrug-resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT), for a degree of inactivation of isoniazid and for a degree of bacterial-static activity of patient's blood, which provides for a higher treatment efficiency.
