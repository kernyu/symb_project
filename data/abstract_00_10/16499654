The author demonstrated that disks containing beta-lactamase inhibitors sulbactam or tazobactam combined with ampicillin (SAM) and piperacillin (TZP) are not suitable for performing the double-disk synergy test (DDST) with the aim of determining the sensitivity of beta-lactamases to these inhibitors. The presence of antibiotics (especially of piperacillin) is so disturbing that the results of testing are not specific. In contrast, the use of disks containing sulbactam or tazobactam alone yields very specific results. The author suggested to the firms producing sensi-disks that they make these commercially available to laboratory workers.
