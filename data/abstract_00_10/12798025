We investigated IS6110 polymorphism in clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients attending the outpatient department at various hospitals in northern India. DNA fingerprinting of 126 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis was carried out using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) associated with the IS6110 element in M. tuberculosis genomes. A substantive degree of polymorphism was evident in the MDR M. tuberculosis isolates. The number of bands in the fingerprints varied from 0 to 19. However, the lack of common bands made it difficult to cluster the majority of these isolates. We were also unable to associate drug resistance with IS6110 copy number. Specific regions of the gyrA and katG genes from a representative number of these isolates were sequenced to determine the genotype. The majority of the isolates analyzed were found to belong to Group 1, indicating that these strains were evolutionarily older. We find no evidence of the W strain, prevalent in the US, in our study. The epidemiological patterns of the various strains in India seem to be very complex, as reflected by the presence of a large number of different strains (types) within north India.
