BACKGROUND: The recurrence of chronic hepatitis B after liver transplantation results in increased risk for graft failure and death of patients. Lamivudine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, but resistance to this agent is common after prolonged administration. METHODS: One patient with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection developed resistance to lamivudine after 15 months of treatment. The resistance was confirmed by mutation in the HBV DNA polymerase gene. The patient was treated subsequently with adefovir dipivoxil for 7 months. RESULT: HBV DNA and HBsAg were tested negative, but HBeAb and HBsAb were positive. CONCLUSION: This study provides an evidence that adefovir dipivoxil can be effective in the treatment of lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants.
