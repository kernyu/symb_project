OBJECTIVE: To look for a quantitative model linking departmental consumption of antibiotic drugs to the subsequent isolation of resistant hospital-acquired coliform pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Included in the study were all patients with hospital-acquired bloodstream infections caused by a coliform pathogen, detected in six departments of internal medicine of one university hospital during the period 1991-1996, who had not been hospitalized in the month before the infection (n = 394). Departmental consumption of antibiotics in the year before the infection [expressed as defined daily dosages (DDD)/100 patient days], antibiotic treatment given to the individual patient before the infection, the day of hospital stay on which the infection occurred, and the department and the calendar year were all included in a logistic model to predict the isolation of a resistant pathogen. We looked at five drugs: gentamicin, amikacin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: Five logistic models were fitted for the resistance to each of the antibiotic drugs. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for a pathogen resistant to the specific antibiotic were 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-1.50] for gentamicin, 1.80 (95% CI 1.00-3.24) for amikacin, 1.12 (95% CI 1.02-1.23) for cefuroxime, 1.45 (95% CI 1.19-1.76) for ceftazidime and 1.06 (95% CI 0.57-1.97) for ciprofloxacin, per 1 DDD/100 patient days. CONCLUSIONS: The departmental consumption of cephalosporin drugs and amikacin in six autonomous departments of medicine in the same hospital was associated with a measurable and statistically significant increase in the probability of infection caused by a resistant pathogen.
