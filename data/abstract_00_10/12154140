Cerebrosides, compounds categorized as glycosphingolipids, were found to occur in a wide range of phytopathogens as novel elicitors and to induce the effective disease resistance for rice plants in our previous study. Here, we showed that cerebroside elicitors lead to the accumulation of phytoalexins and pathogenesis-related (PR) protein in cell suspension cultures of rice with the structural specificity similar to that for the rice whole plants. This elicitor activity of the cerebroside was greater than jasmonic acid (JA) and chitin oligomer (which is known to be an elicitor for cell suspension cultures of rice). Treatment of cell suspension cultures with cerebroside and chitin oligomer resulted in a synergetic induction of phytoalexins, suggesting that cerebroside and carbohydrate elicitors, such as glucan and chitin elicitor, enhance the defense signals of rice in vivo. Induction of phytoalexins by the treatment with cerebroside elicitor was markedly inhibited by LaCl(3) and GdCl(3), Ca(2+ )channel blockers. It is possible that Ca(2+) may be involved in the signaling pathway of elicitor activity of cerebroside.
