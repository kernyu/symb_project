AmpC overexpression (AmpC++) is a significant mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but its impact on clinical outcomes is not well established. To examine the influence of AmpC++ on clinical outcomes of patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia, we screened all bloodstream P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from 2003 to 2006 for AmpC++. Demographics and outcomes were retrospectively compared between patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia caused by AmpC++ and pan-susceptible strains (wild-type controls). Of the 263 isolates screened, 63 (24.0%) were nonsusceptible to ceftazidime. Clinical data of 42 AmpC++ isolates from 21 patients were compared with 33 control patients. The 2 groups were similar in sex and race. Patients in the AmpC++ group was more likely to receive inappropriate empiric antibiotics (odds ratio [OR] = 67.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3-720.0) and experience microbiologic persistence (OR = 12.2; 95% CI, 1.7-87.7). In institutions with a high prevalence of AmpC++, empiric therapy with agents with activity against AmpC++ strains may be warranted.
