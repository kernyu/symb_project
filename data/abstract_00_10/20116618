ART (antiretroviral therapy) currently continues to indefinitely prolong the survival of patients who live with HIV. Due to this, we are increasingly faced with specific problems that previously did not have time to develop or did not have the importance that they have now, and which are related to the existence of special patient populations. Examples of situations that characterise these special populations are: co-infection with hepatitis virus B and/or C, pregnancy, lipodystrophy, cardiovascular risk, renal failure, treatment of children and adolescents, immigrant health care, and the management of patients receiving methadone replacement therapy, among others. In this article we review the role that Atazanavir (ATV) can play in the ART of patients in the situations mentioned, except those that are already dealt with specifically in other articles, such as co-infection by hepatitis virus B and/or C.
