PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The inappropriate choice of antibiotics (in nearly one third of episodes) is the most important risk factor for death. Traditionally, a narrow-spectrum drug was used first, and the most potent drugs were reserved for subsequent use. RECENT FINDINGS: As multidrug resistance increases in the intensive care unit in patients treated for nosocomial pneumonia, costs, mortality, and morbidity are rising. Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are frequently considered together, they have different virulence, risk factors and susceptibilities, requiring different antimicrobial choices. Assessment of clinical resolution should be differentiated in the presence of acute lung injury. In the absence of biochemical markers, oxygenation and core temperature should guide therapeutic decisions. SUMMARY: As ventilator-associated pneumonia increases, empiric therapy should be based on local pathogen etiology and antibiotic resistant patterns. A new approach to consider is to start with a high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotic and then tailor the individual therapy based on microbiological results and clinical resolution. With the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics available in empiric therapy tailored after reassessment of the patient, there is hope for reducing costs, length of stay and mortality whereas the emergence of resistance will be minimized.
