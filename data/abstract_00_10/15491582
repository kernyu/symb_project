Control of soil-transmitted helminth infection and elimination of lymphatic filariasis by periodic chemotherapy increase drug pressure for possible occurrence of resistance against single dose anthelminthics. In veterinary practice, frequent treatment of closed populations has led to a serious problem of anthelminthic drug resistance which is now largely irreversible. Reduced efficacy of single dose drugs against nematodes of humans should be taken as early warnings to tackle the issue in due time. Research and development of sensitive tools for monitoring and early detection of drug resistance is urgently needed to sustain the benefits of helminth control programs gained so far. A concerted action with international partners and the creation of a network of scientists to address this issue is the next pressing public health issue for helminth control.
