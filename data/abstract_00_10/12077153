The last two decades of the 20th century were marked by an increasing resistance rate among several bacteria. Threat of resistance is present in Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae, which are the major pathogens in nosocomial infections. In the community, too, increasing resistance can be observed and is attributed mainly (but not exclusively) to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. To scrutinize this trend, resistance surveillance in the community was established about 10 years ago. One of the multinational, longitudinal surveillance programmes in place is the Alexander Project, which was established in 1992 to monitor the susceptibility of the major community-acquired lower respiratory tract pathogens to a range of antibacterial drugs. The Alexander Project has revealed a tendency towards increasing resistance of S. pneumoniae to penicillin and macrolide therapy. Within Europe, the prevalence of penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae isolates is particularly high in France and Spain. Macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae is also a growing problem in European countries such as France, Spain, Belgium and Italy, where the extent of macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae now exceeds that of penicillin resistance.
