OBJECTIVES: Infection with Candida glabrata and Candida krusei represents a major challenge. We sought to describe outcomes for patients with candidaemia/invasive candidiasis (C/IC) due to these pathogens who were treated with micafungin. METHODS: We pooled two randomized trials of micafungin versus comparator. We identified patients infected with either C. glabrata or C. krusei. One trial compared micafungin (100 mg/day with option for dose escalation) with liposomal amphotericin B, while the other compared micafungin (either 100 or 150 mg/day) and caspofungin (NCT00106288 and NCT00105144). Clinical cure was our primary endpoint while 28 day mortality represented a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Among 1070 subjects with C/IC, 183 were infected with either C. glabrata (n = 144) or C. krusei (n = 39). One hundred and seventeen received micafungin. Clinical cure rates in those receiving micafungin were similar to those randomized to comparator [73.5% (86/117) versus 62.1% (41/66), P = not significant]. Mortality at 28 days was also similar [29.1% (34/117) with micafungin versus 34.8% (23/66) with comparator, P = not significant]. In logistic regression, treatment agent correlated with neither cure nor mortality. Factors independently linked with lower cure rates included: IC neutropenia; higher severity of illness; and medical admission. Higher severity of illness and failure to remove a central venous catheter were associated with 28 day mortality. Crude and adjusted outcomes were comparable irrespective of micafungin dose administered. CONCLUSIONS: Micafungin results in similar outcomes to comparators for C/IC due to C. glabrata and C. krusei. The 100 mg/day dose represents an acceptable option in this setting. Patient characteristics and catheter management appear to be more important factors affecting clinical outcomes.
