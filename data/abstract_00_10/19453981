BACKGROUND: Drug resistance profiles of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in treatment-naive infections have been reported in developed countries. However, little is known in developing countries, including China, especially in treatment-naive volunteer blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-two HIV-1-positive samples of blood donors were collected from 2005 to 2006 in Yunnan, China. Recent and long-term infections were distinguished by the HIV-1 subtypes B, E, and D immunoglobulin G-capture enzyme immunoassay assay. The nucleotide sequences of pol genes were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic tree and drug resistance analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 49 samples successfully analyzed, circulating strains were circulating recombinant form (CRF)08_BC (51.0%), CRF07_BC (24.5%), CRF01_AE (20.4%), and B (4.1%). No protease inhibitors (PI) major drug resistance mutation (DRM) was detected. Six samples (12.2%) displayed seven minor PI DRMs. Nine samples (18.4%) displayed 10 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor DRMs, and DRMs to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were present in one sample (2.0%). There was only one sample of the 49 (2.0%) in which the DRMs were of sufficient magnitude to result in a clinical change to drug susceptibility, but even in this sample, the clinical effect of these DRMs was predicted to be low. Significant differences were not observed between the long-term and recent infected population. Differences in DRMs were not observed between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma within an individual. CONCLUSIONS: CRF_BC was the dominant subtype circulating in HIV-1-infected donors in Yunnan. Prevalence of genotypic drug resistances among donors in Yunnan was low in this study. Surveillance on HIV-1 infections among blood donors should be continued in China.
