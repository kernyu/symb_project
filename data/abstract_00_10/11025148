The stem bark and seeds of Andira inermis, Fabaceae, are employed as a purgative, vermifuge, and febrifuge. In particular, the powdered bark is claimed to be efficacious in intermittent fever. Bioassay-guided fractionation of lipophilic extracts from the stems and leaves yielded six isoflavones: biochanin A, calycosin, formononetin, genistein, pratensein, and prunetin. Calycosin (3', 7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone) and genistein (4',5, 7-trihydroxyisoflavone) have been shown to possess in vitro activity against the chloroquine-sensitive strain poW and the chloroquine-resistant clone Dd2 of Plasmodium falciparum.
