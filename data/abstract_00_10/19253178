PURPOSE: To present the outcomes of prophylaxis of postoperative endophthalmitis following cataract surgery with intracameral Cefuroxime. METHOD: A retrospective study was done on 4281 eyes that underwent cataract surgery from October 2003 to September 2008. All patients underwent phacoemulsification cataract surgery. All cases received an injection of 0.1 ml intracameral Cefuroxime (1 mg) at the end of surgery except those patients allergic to penicillin and cephalosporin until September 2007 and thereafter only those with demonstrated allergy to cefuroxime. RESULTS: The rate of postoperative endophthalmitis was 0.11% (5 cases). Four of them had a positive culture. We found no evidence of clinical ocular toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Intracameral cefuroxime works very well for reducing the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis. It appears safe to use and is easy to prepare.
