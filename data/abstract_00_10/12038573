A total of 319 strains of Aeromonas hydrophila were isolated from 536 fish and 278 prawns for a 2-year period. All the strains were tested for resistance to 15 antibiotics and 100% of the strains was resistant to methicillin and rifampicin followed by bacitracin and novobiocin (99%). Only 3% of the strains exhibited resistance against chloramphenicol. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indexing of A. hydrophila strains showed that all of them originated from high-risk sources.
