In a previous study, levofloxacin 750 mg eradicated 4 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae from an in vitro pharmacodynamic model (IVPM). However, quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations were not detected among those isolates. This study further evaluates levofloxacin 500 mg and 750 mg against S pneumoniae strains with characterized QRDR mutations. Six isolates with levofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 2 to 4 microg/mL were selected for this study. Strains 5401, 5409, and 5437 contained only parC mutations. Three additional strains contained 2 mutations each: strain 5429 (parC and parE ), strain 5442 (parC and gyrA), and strain 5445 (parC and gyrB). Logarithmic-phase cultures (approximately 1 x 10(7) CFU/mL) were inoculated into the peripheral compartment of the IVPM and exposed to peak free-drug concentrations achieved with levofloxacin 500 mg and 750 mg (PO) and ciprofloxacin 750 mg (PO). Elimination pharmacokinetics were simulated and changes in viable counts were measured over 30 h. Ciprofloxacin exhibited very little antibacterial activity against the 6 strains, while levofloxacin 750 mg rapidly killed and eradicated the 3 parC mutant strains and the dual parC/parE mutant strains. Although levofloxacin 500 mg initially decreased viable counts by 4.5 to 6 logs, inoculum regrowth was observed between 12 and 24 h for the 6 strains. Regrowth was not due to the selection of mutant subpopulations. The pharmacodynamics of both levofloxacin doses were substantially diminished against the 2 strains with dual mutations in both parC and gyrA/B. The rapid eradication of single parC and dual parC/parE mutants with levofloxacin 750 mg demonstrates that this dose may slow the emergence of resistance due to these mutations. The decreased efficacy of both levofloxacin doses against the double parC and gyrA/B mutants highlights the importance of preventing the development and spread of double mutants.
