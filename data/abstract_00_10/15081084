This study was undertaken to assess the in vitro activity of several antimicrobial agents against Brazilian isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae from 1996 to 2000. The antibiotics used were penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (A/C), ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefixime, cefprozil, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (T/S). MICs were determined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) method and interpreted using NCCLS and PK/PD breakpoints. For S. pneumoniae 80.0% were penicillin susceptible, 18.3% intermediate, 1.7% resistant; most active agents were amoxicillin, A/C, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin; T/S was the least active agent. Beta-lactamase was produced by 13.7% of H. influenzae. All were susceptible to A/C, cefdinir, cefixime, ceftriaxone and quinolones. The least active agents were T/S and macrolides.
