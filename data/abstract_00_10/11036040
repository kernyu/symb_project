We compared the activity of delavirdine (DLV) plus zidovudine (AZT) (n = 300) with that of AZT (n = 297) against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. DLV exerted a transient antiviral effect, and mutations for resistance to DLV were found in more than 90% of subjects at week 12. The K103N mutation, which confers nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor cross-resistance, was found in 85% of the patients.
