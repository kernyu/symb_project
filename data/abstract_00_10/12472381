The 42nd Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy took place in San Diego on 27-30 September 2002. The meeting was held in the light of current events. Bioterrorism, malaria, issues of surveillance and multiple resistance were discussed in depth. Few truly new drugs or potential targets were presented. Peptide deformylase inhibitors and several other metalloenzymes as new targets were among the most promising results.
