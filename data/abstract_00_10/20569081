IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are amongst the most common infectious diseases. Therefore, any improvement in UTI management will have a high impact on the quality of life of the individual patient and the entire healthcare system. A dramatic, clinically significant increase in the antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens over the past 5 - 10 years calls for new concepts in the treatment of UTIs. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This article focuses on uncomplicated and complicated UTIs, and discusses antimicrobial resistance trends and antibacterial strategies. A literature search was undertaken concerning treatment studies in UTI from 1998 on. Emerging drugs for the treatment of UTI were mainly selected using the Investigational Drugs Database. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The aim of this review is to highlight new and emerging drugs in the antibacterial treatment of uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. This article discusses current and future aspects for recommending antibacterials for the treatment of UTIs. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Resistance rates of uropathogens are also significantly increasing. Emerging antimicrobial substances are not always investigated for their suitability in the treatment of UTIs. Especially, substances active against multiresistant Gram-negative pathogens will rarely be developed in the coming years.
