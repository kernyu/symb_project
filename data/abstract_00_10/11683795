OBJECTIVE: To determine the penicillin resistance and serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains and to identify clonal relationships of isolates resistant to penicillin by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). METHODS: In total, 193 S. pneumoniae strains were isolated from clinical specimens between November 1997 and January 2000. Susceptibility testing was carried out by E test, and serotyping by the Quellung reaction. Clonal relationship was analyzed by using PFGE with smaI endonuclease. RESULTS: Of the S. pneumoniae isolates, 23% were intermediately resistant to penicillin. There were no high-level resistant pneumococci. The majority of isolates intermediately resistant to penicillin were of serogroups/serotypes 19, 23, 14 and 1, in descending order of frequency. There were eight major clones in strains intermediately resistant to penicillin. It was seen that serogroups in the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine, 7-valent, 9-valent, and 11-valent vaccine formulations caused 92%, 75%, 78% and 87% of pneumococcal diseases in our region, respectively. CONCLUSION: Penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae is relatively uncommon in Kayseri. All vaccine formulations can prevent the majority of pneumococcal diseases, and there is genetic heterogeneity in intermediately penicillin-resistant pneumococci in this region.
