We describe an in vivo evolution of an antimicrobial profile from susceptibility to full-resistance to carbapenems, with heteroresistance as an intermediate stage, in an Acinetobacter baumannii strain. Heteroresistance was characterized by the growth of sub-populations within the susceptibility halo in both disk-diffusion and Etest. PCRs for the main A. baumannii carbapenemases were negative. The exact resistance mechanism, diagnostic methods and clinical relevance of heteroresistance in A. baumannii warrant further investigations. This is the first description of such phenomenon in vivo and the second report of heteroresistance to carbapenems in A. baumannii.
