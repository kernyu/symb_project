A protein exometabolite isolated from the culture liquid of Luteococcus japonicus subsp. casei reactivates the cells of this microorganism, following H2O2 or paraquat-induced oxidative stress. The resistance of L. casei cells to these oxidizers is accounted for by the high activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase. The effect of the protein exometabolite is universal, in that it reactivates the cells after UV irradiation, heating, or oxidative stress. However, the cells subjected to oxidative stress are significantly less susceptible to the reactivating effect, as compared to their UV-irradiated or heated counterparts. Possible causes of these differences are discussed.
