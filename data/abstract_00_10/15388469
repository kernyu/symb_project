This study employs time-kill techniques to examine the most common drug combinations used in the therapy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, vancomycin plus either gentamicin or rifampin. Community-associated MRSA were more likely to be synergistically inhibited by combinations of vancomycin and gentamicin versus vancomycin alone compared to inhibition associated with hospital-acquired strains.
