The paper considers drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) in the Barents region of Russia and Norway. Along with a rise in tuberculosis morbidity, there has been recently an increase in the number of patients isolating MBT that are resistant to antituberculous agents. The most dangerous trend is an increase in MDR of MBT strains. In the north-west of Russia there are high MBT drug resistance rated as compared to Norway. There are differences in the determination of drug resistance by the absolute concentration method and by the BACTEC method.
