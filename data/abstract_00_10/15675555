SETTING: In the first 2 years of the East Timor National TB Control Programme, 7960 new patients were treated (2RHZE/6HE) and 224 received a retreatment regimen (2SRHZE/1RHZE/4R3H3Z3E3). OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature and extent of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in treatment failure cases in East Timor. METHODS: Sputum specimens from retreatment failure cases were processed and inoculated into a BACTEC MGIT960 tube and onto Lowenstein-Jensen media. Isolates were identified by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, hybridisation with nucleic acid probes and biochemical investigations. Susceptibility testing was performed using the radiometric proportion method. Pyrazinamide testing was performed using the Wayne indirect method. RESULTS: Eighteen patients failed retreatment (0.7% of new cases) and 14 were available for analysis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from all specimens, despite considerable transport delays. Nine (64.3%) had multiple drug resistance (MDR-TB) and four (28.6%) had other drug resistance. All MDR-TB isolates were susceptible to amikacin, capreomycin and ethionamide, with most also susceptible to ciprofloxacin and para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS). CONCLUSIONS: An excellent TB control programme has been established in East Timor. If funds are available, East Timor provides an ideal setting for a small-scale DOTS-Plus programme to treat prevalent cases of MDR-TB, and this study could inform the second-line drug regimen.
