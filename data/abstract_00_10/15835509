Of 864 consecutive culture positive cases of tuberculosis (TB) treated in the period 1991-2001, a total of 19 (2.1%) were M. bovis and 32 (3.7%) were drug resistant - Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (8); poly drug resistant (7); mono drug resistant (17). Iatrogenic factors were important in the cause of resistance in 9 cases (4 cases of MDR-TB): in 6 cases patients factors were important. Comparison with previous report for the period 1982-1985 showed relatively more isolates of M. bovis (p = 0.02); drug resistant TB (p = 0.005); and MDR-TB (p = 0.01) in the current study. Comparison with the background population of TB patients showed that patients with resistant TB were more likely to have a previous history of TB (Relative Risk = 3.58) and more likely to be foreign nationals (Relative Risk = 1.93) We conclude that while overall incidence of TB has declined that in relative terms the caseload of drug resistant TB and MDR-TB has increased. The drug cost of treating MDR-TB may be as high as 44,900 euros per patient.
