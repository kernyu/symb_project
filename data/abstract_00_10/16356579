For the treatment of HBV/HIV-co-infection, study data on interferon-based therapy are very limited and insufficient to draw any specific conclusions. In contrast, data on HBV-polymerase inhibitors (lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir) are available from controlled trials. Lamivudine is well tolerated and safe, however, development of HBV-resistance is frequent. Adefovir has a nephrotoxic potential and may at least theoretically induce antiretroviral resistance in HBV/HIV-patients treated with adefovir. Tenofovir has gastrointestinal side effects, is associated with hypophospatemia, which has not induced serious osteopenia so far and may have a nephrotoxic potential. For HCV/HIV-co-infection pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin is standard of care. Flu-like symptoms, fatigue and depressive mood changes are frequent. In patients with a history of neurotic or minor depression initiation of treatment with antidepressants before the start of interferon-based therapy should be considered. Weight loss may be pronounced in individual cases. A marked decrease in absolute, but not relative CD4 +/- cells is the rule, but no relevant increase in opportunistic infection was observed, and anaemia (<10 g/dl) is reported in up to 30% of patients. Neutropenia (< 1,000 cells/microl) is observed in up to 50% of the patients. Adverse events specific to the HCV/HIV-patient population as compared to HCV-mono-infected patients are the occurrence of hyperlactataemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic decompensation.
