BACKGROUND: In chronic renal failure, the renal excretion of certain drugs is dramatically reduced. To determine whether other routes of drug elimination, such as secretion through the intestinal barrier by intestinal P-glycoprotein can be altered, we compared P-glycoprotein activity, P-glycoprotein protein content, and P-glycoprotein mRNA levels in intestine of control and chronic renal failure rats. METHODS: Chronic renal failure was surgically induced in rats by partial (7/8) nephrectomy. After 5 weeks, intestinal transport of rhodamine 123, a P-glycoprotein substrate, was carried out using an in vitro model of everted gut sacs. P-glycoprotein protein content was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and P-glycoprotein mRNA expression was evaluated by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A decrease of intestinal rhodamine 123 transport was observed in chronic renal failure rats, pointing to an inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity. Transport was inhibited in both sham-operated rats and rats with chronic renal failure by verapamil and cyclosporin A, but relative inhibition vs baseline was less marked in chronic renal failure than in sham-operated rats. In contrast, no significant differences in levels of P-glycoprotein protein or mRNA were observed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal secretion of rhodamine 123 is mainly mediated by P-glycoprotein. It was reduced in rats with chronic renal failure, reflecting reduced intestinal drug elimination via a decrease in P-glycoprotein transport activity rather than via protein underexpression.
