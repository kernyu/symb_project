Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were experimentally infected by continuous or single exposure with the monogenean Discocotyle sagittata. To determine whether immunity follows primary infection, fish were exposed to a secondary challenge by one of two modes: (1) primary infections were cleared with praziquantel (PZQ) and hosts re-infected with 100 oncomiracidia; (2) parasites were allowed to reach maturity and hosts super-infected with 100 oncomiracidia. Fish challenged after initial continuous exposure developed significant partial resistance to re-infection, carrying burdens 35% lower than controls. PZQ treatment controls demonstrated that the drug did not account for the protection observed. Single exposure did not significantly modify the outcome of secondary challenges. Super-infection experiments suggested that no concomitant immunity develops. No correlation was found between initial burdens and the outcome of secondary challenges in the same individual. Significantly elevated anti-D. sagittata antibodies were detected in infected fish, but there was no correlation between immunoglobulin levels and parasite burdens.
