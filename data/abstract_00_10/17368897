In an attempt to search for a new class of antibacterial agents, we have discovered a series of pyrazole analogs that possess good antibacterial activity for Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms via inhibition of type II bacterial topoisomerases. We have investigated the structure-activity relationships of this series, with an emphasis on the length and conformation of the linker. This work led to the identification of tetrahydroindazole analogs, such as compound 1, as the most potent class of compounds.
