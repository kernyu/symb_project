Antibiotic resistance has increased dramatically over the past 10 years. In many countries, penicillin resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae is nearly 50% with resistance to other drugs rising as well. One of the mechanisms responsible for the development of resistance is the widespread use of antibiotics in the primary care setting, chiefly for the treatment of respiratory disorders. Reduction in antibiotic prescribing for respiratory diseases in primary care has been associated with decreases in drug resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. This article will review common reasons for overuse of antibiotics in primary care settings and some strategies for reducing injudicious antibiotic prescribing.
