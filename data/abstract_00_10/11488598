To clarify the mechanism of apoptosis of the macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 induced by cationic liposomes, we focused on the mitochondria and investigated the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c following treatment of cationic liposomes composed of stearylamine (SA-liposomes). SA-liposomes induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and also the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Caspase-3 was also activated by SA-liposome treatment. Pretreatment of cells with N-acetylcysteine, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), conferred resistance to the induction of the membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation by SA-liposomes. These results indicated that SA-liposomes caused the apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells through the mitochondrial pathway, and ROS generation was required for this phenomenon.
