This study characterised non-multiresistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (nmMRSA) isolates from Kuwait hospitals to ascertain whether they were community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). Forty-two nmMRSA isolates obtained between July 2001 and October 2003 were analysed by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, bacteriophage typing, production of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), urease and staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C and D, TSST-1, and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Forty-one isolates were SCCmec type IV, and one isolate was SCCmec type III. The isolates belonged to six PFGE patterns, with two types, A and D, distributed in six and four hospitals, respectively. Most (n = 26; 61.9%) isolates produced urease. These isolates were mainly from wound and skin infections, showed low-level methicillin resistance (MIC 8-48 mg/L), and nine carried genes for PVL. These characteristics, together with their carriage of the type-IV SCCmec, identified the isolates as CA-MRSA. Ten of the 16 urease-negative isolates produced staphylococal enterotoxin C; 12 reacted weakly with phage 75, and were resistant to clindamycin and/or erythromycin, which are characteristics of EMRSA-15. Thus, this study identified the co-existence of two types of nmMRSA, i.e., CA-MRSA and EMRSA-15, in Kuwait hospitals.
