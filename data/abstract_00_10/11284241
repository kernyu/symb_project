A total of 132 neonatal deaths among 627 infants admitted to the neonatal ward of the San Fernando General Hospital, Trinidad over a 2-year period were reviewed. The most common cause of death was prematurity (43.9%). Infection was the second most common cause (21.2%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently isolated organisms (43%). The major drugs used empirically in suspected cases of sepsis were ampicillin or ceftazidime plus gentamicin. About 85% of S. aureus were resistant to ampicillin, and P. aeruginosa resistance to ceftazidime and gentamicin was 76.7% and 72.1%, respectively. Significant risk factors in maternal history were infrequent antenatal care and prolonged rupture of membranes. The incidence of infection among low birthweight infants was 85.6%. Early-onset sepsis (86.4%) seemed to have a nosocomial origin because of the type of pathogens seen. There is an urgent need to improve the staff-to-patient ratio in the neonatal unit and for staff to be constantly reminded to employ simple infection control practices such as proper hand-washing to reduce cross-infections.
