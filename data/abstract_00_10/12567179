BACKGROUND: Sentinel surveillance of the antimicrobial resistance of strains isolated from female sex workers in North Sumatra, Indonesia, has been carried out since 1975. In 1996 a high prevalence of strains with plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline and penicillin was observed. GOAL: The goal was to further characterize strains isolated from a core group of patients in Indonesia with sexually transmitted infections in 1996. STUDY DESIGN: The strains were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid analysis, subtype of the determinant, and analysis of genomic DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: A total 161 strains obtained from 592 female sex workers in 10 different places in North Sumatra, Indonesia, in 1996 were investigated. All strains exhibited plasmid-mediated resistance to penicillin (PPNG: penicillinase-producing ) and/or tetracycline (TRNG: tetracycline-resistant ); 115 strains were PPNG/TRNG (71%), 45 were TRNG (28%), and 1 was PPNG. All strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, and spectinomycin. All PPNG strains tested carried the 7.2-kb (Asian type) plasmid except one, which carried the 4.9-kb (Toronto type) plasmid. All TRNG strains except one contained the Dutch-type gene. PFGE analysis of 156 strains documented that a diversity of strains existed and that certain genotypes had spread in a defined area or between different areas in North Sumatra. CONCLUSION: Our results underline the importance of continuous surveillance of the changing patterns of antimicrobial resistance of in high-risk populations.
