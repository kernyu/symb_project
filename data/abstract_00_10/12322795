A 50-year-old woman patient began receiving lamivudine because of acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B. She also suffered from adult-onset Still's disease and had received prednisolone for 5 years. Lamivudine was effective for treatment of the first flare. Fifteen months after lamivudine treatment was started, a breakthrough due to lamivudine-resistant strain M5521 occurred. Between 10 and 12 months after the breakthrough, flare with jaundice occurred 3 times. We decided interferon would not be suitable, because it could induce activation of Still's disease. Prolonged lamivudine therapy is only recommended in cases of hepatitis B in which there is no alternative treatment.
