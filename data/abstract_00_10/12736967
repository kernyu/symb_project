Following the death of an unvaccinated 16-year-old school student with isoniazid resistant pulmonary tuberculosis, extended screening of sixth formers took place to identify further cases of tuberculosis and to establish the need for BCG vaccination. Eight hundred and four 16-19 year olds in the school underwent Heaf testing and completed a demographics questionnaire. Forty-nine (5.5%) of these children had a positive Heaf test and were offered a chest radiograph. Four children were diagnosed with pulmonary or mediastinal tuberculosis, none linked to the index case. Fifty-four students (6.7%) with no prior BCG had a Heaf grade 0-1 reaction and were recommended for vaccination. Ninety-one percent of students were from ethnic minority groups and 29% had been born outside the UK. British Thoracic Society recommendations on the management of tuberculin positive cases of this is open to interpretation and we suggest that a more directed and aggressive approach to TB control should be considered in inner city schools with a high proportion of at risk ethnic minority students.
