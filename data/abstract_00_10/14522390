OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors of infections with amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant Escherichia coli in ICU patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive sample survey study. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 133 patients from whom culture results were positive for E. coli during their ICU stay. METHODS: Risk factors analysed included demographics, comorbid conditions, and antimicrobial drug exposure. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified only one significant independent factor associated with the emergence of amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant E. coli: prior use of amoxicillin (odds ratio: 5.45). CONCLUSION: Clinicians should avoid administering amoxicillin-clavulanate as empiric therapy for possible E. coli infection in patients that have recently been treated with amoxicillin.
