Eradication can be defined as the permanent reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts. Eradication strategies must be designed to increase access to and utilization of veterinary and animal health support services beyond that normally achieved by routine services. Consequently, before undertaking an eradication program, proponents must be certain that they can be sure of a commitment of resources sufficient to complete the project. A helminth eradication campaign would require the application of anthelmintics to all hosts at a level aimed at killing heterozygote resistant individuals. This strategy runs counter to the prevailing opinion that resistance to chemicals will always occur and control schemes should accept some production loss by letting a proportion of parasites escape selection (in refugia) and thereby increase the useful life of the chemical. Under certain circumstances, environmental constraints may make some species of parasitic nematodes vulnerable to an eradication program. Anthelmintics have been used to exploit these constraints in past control programs and have lead to local eradication of several species of gastro-intestinal parasitic nematodes. Also, there are at present eradication programs for nematode parasites of human that are based on anthelmintic treatment. However, the suppressive pesticide treatment required to bring about the virtual elimination of species is a high-risk strategy and should only be undertaken if eradication is an achievable goal. It is also important to plan an exit strategy if eradication fails.
