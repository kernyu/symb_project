INTRODUCTION: Platinum resistant ovarian cancer is a current challenge in Oncology. Current approved therapies offer no more of a 20% of response. New therapeutic options are urgently needed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated with the combination of Pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) d1 and Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) d1,8 in a 21 days basis. RESULTS: 10 platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients were treated under compassionate use. Mean previous chemotherapy lines were 3.3. Mean administered cycles were 4. Mean CA 125 decrease was on average of 47%, with one patient experiencing a 95% decrease in her CA 125 level. 1 patient had a complete clinical remission, and 2, had partial radiological responses. Mean Progression free survival was 16.5 weeks, and Overall Survival was 21.2 weeks. Treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Deemd to the observed activity, the combination of Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine deserves deeper investigation in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients.
