Gene technology can offer creative solutions to problems of agronomical relevance, which may not be solved by conventional breeding methods. One of the major problems of wheat cultivation is disease caused by a number of fungal pathogens including the wheat powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt). Transgenic wheat plants that constitutively express the coding sequence of the defence-related wheat peroxidase TaPrx103 (previously TaPERO) in shoot epidermis under the control of the wheat GstA1 promoter were generated and found to exhibit enhanced resistance to Bgt (Altpeter et al., Plant. Mol. Biol. 57, 271-283). Here, I report on physiological and molecular analyses of these plants in order to assess the mode of action of the peroxidase encoded by the TaGstA1:TaPrx103 transgene. Epidermal cells of transgenic lines with enhanced resistance were found to respond to Bgt attack more frequently with hypersensitive cell death and the generation of hydrogen peroxide. By contrast, resistance of epidermal cell walls to degradation by fungal enzymes appeared to be similar in transgenic and wild-type plants. Moreover, the analysis of the abundance of approximately 10,000 wheat transcripts revealed no significant effect of the GstA1i:TaPrx103 transgene on host gene expression in non-inoculated leaves and only a marginal effect in Bgt-challenged leaves, compared with wild-type plants treated in the same manner. The results indicate that the TaPrx103 protein is involved in generating reactive oxygen species specifically in pathogen-attacked cells, which may lead to localized cell death and resistance. I therefore suggest that the transgenic plants presented here can be regarded as substantially equivalent to non-transgenic wheat.
