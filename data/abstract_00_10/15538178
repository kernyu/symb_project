The neurotoxicity of the AMPA/kainate receptor agonist kainate was investigated in motor and cortical neurones from mice over-expressing the wild-type and G93A mutant form of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) human gene, a mouse model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. G93A mutant motor neurones were more vulnerable and wild-type SOD1 motor neurones were more resistant to kainate toxicity than were controls. Voltage-gated Na channels blockage prevented G93A mutant SOD1 motor neurone death. Cortical cultures exhibited fewer differences in their vulnerability to kainate toxicity. These results demonstrate that SOD1 over-expression selectively affects the sensitivity to kainate excitotoxicity of motor neurones but not neocortical neurones, and that wild-type SOD1 expression increases the resistance to excitotoxicity of motor neurones.
