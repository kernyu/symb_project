An Escherichia coli strain with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems was isolated from a hospitalised patient in Athens, Greece. The strain was resistant to all beta-lactams, including aztreonam, whereas the MIC of imipenem and meropenem was 0.5 mg/L. A positive EDTA-disk synergy test suggested the production of a metallo-beta-lactamase. PCR experiments revealed the presence of the bla(VIM-2), bla(IBC-1), and bla(TEM-1) genes. Resistance to beta-lactams was not transferable by conjugation. This is the first report of a clinical isolate of E. coli producing VIM-2, and the first report of the coexistence of bla(VIM-2) and bla(IBC-1) in a single clinical isolate.
