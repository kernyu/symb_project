In B-CLL, non-proliferating B cells accumulate due to defective apoptosis. Cytotoxic therapies trigger apoptosis and deregulation of apoptotic pathways contributes to chemoresistance. Loss of the apoptosis-promoting Bax has been implicated in resistance to cytotoxic therapy. We therefore evaluated ex vivo drug sensitivity of CLL, producing chemoresponse data which are prognostic indicators for B-CLL, in particular in the case of purine nucleoside analogs. To analyze the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance, we compared endogenous Bax and Bcl-2 expression to ex vivo response to eight drugs, and to survival in 39 B-CLL patients. We found that reduced Bax levels correlated well with ex vivo resistance to traditional B-CLL therapies - anthracyclines, alkylating agents and vincristine (all P < 0.04). Surprisingly, no such relationship was observed for the purine nucleoside analogs or corticosteroids (all P > 0.5). Mutational analysis of p53 could not explain the loss of Bax protein expression. Levels of Bcl-2 were not associated with sensitivity to any drug. In contrast to the ex vivo data, neither Bax or Bcl-2 expression nor doxorubicin sensitivity were associated with increased survival whereas sensitivity to fludarabine correlated with better overall survival (P = 0.031). These findings suggest that the resistance to purine nucleoside analogs and corticosteroids in B-CLL is due to inactivation of pathways different from those activated by anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids and alkylating agents and may be the molecular rationale for the efficacy of purine analogs in this disease.
