In search of functions involved in the regulation of gene amplification, and given the relevance of chromosome breakage in initiating the process, we analyzed the gene amplification ability of cells hypersensitive to inducers of DNA double-strand breaks and defective in cell cycle control: two human fibroblast strains derived from patients affected by ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and two hamster mutant cell lines belonging to complementation group XRCC8 of the rodent X-ray-sensitive mutants. These mutants are considered hamster models of AT cells. To measure gene amplification, the frequency and the rate of occurrence of N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate resistant cells were determined. In both hamster mutants, these two parameters were increased by about an order of magnitude compared with parental cells, suggesting that amplification ability was increased by the genetic defect. In primary AT fibroblasts, as in normal human fibroblasts, gene amplification was undetectable and a block in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle was induced upon PALA treatment. These results suggest that in AT fibroblasts, where only the ATM gene is mutated, ATM-independent mechanisms prevent gene amplification, while, in the immortalized hamster cell lines, which are already permissive for gene amplification, the AT-like defect increases the probability of gene amplification.
