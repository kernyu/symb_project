Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated in pigs at slaughterhouse. The nasal cavities of 304 pigs from 54 herds were screened. Eighty-nine percent of the farms harbored pigs that were colonized with S. aureus. Among them, no MRSA were found, indicating a low prevalence. However, pigs were found to harbor S. aureus, which displayed resistance to penicillin (blaZ) (62.5%), tetracycline [tet(M)] (33.3%), streptomycin (strpS194) (27%), clindamycin [erm(B)] (4.1%), erythromycin [erm(B)] (4.1%), kanamycin (4.1%), chloramphenicol (catpC194) (2%) and gentamicin [aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia] (2%). The S. aureus isolates mainly belong to Ridom spa type t034 (31.3%), t208 (14.6%) and t899 (12.5%). These pig-associated spa types have not yet been detected in hospitalized human patients in Switzerland. Surveillance programs are now necessary at both inland and import levels to rapidly detect and suppress the emergence of MRSA in pigs in Switzerland.
