Risk factors for primary Helicobacter pylori resistance in 186 children with gastroduodenal diseases (44 from villages/small towns and 130 from large towns/cities) in 2000-2003 were tested. Susceptibility was tested by a limited agar dilution method. Overall resistance rates to metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline and both metronidazole and clarithromycin were 14.5, 11.9, 3.3 and 4.3 %, respectively. No amoxycillin resistance was observed. Tetracycline resistance was found in six children aged 7-18 years. Clarithromycin resistance was more common in children from small towns/villages (22.7 %) than in those from large towns/cities (8.5 %, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in resistance rates between children from northern Bulgaria and those from southern regions. Resistance rates in duodenal ulcer patients and other children were, respectively, 10.5 and 15 % (P > 0.20) for metronidazole and 10.5 and 12 % (P > 0.20) for clarithromycin. No combined resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin was found in 22 children aged 1-7 years and in 34 children living in northern Bulgaria. There were no significant associations of resistance with sex and age group (1-7- versus 8-18-year-old children) for all antibacterial agents tested. In conclusion, primary H. pylori resistance was absent (for metronidazole + clarithromycin) or low (4.5 % for clarithromycin) in children aged 1-7 years. Place of residence was associated with clarithromycin resistance rates.
