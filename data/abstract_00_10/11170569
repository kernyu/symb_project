In view of the essential role of phenolic compounds in the development of pathogen resistance in plants, and given the influence that fungicides exert over phenolic metabolism, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of the application of different rates of fungicide on the metabolism of phenolic compounds in tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Tennessee 86). The fungicide applied was carbendazim, with a purity of 100%, at three different rates: 1.3 mM (carb(1)), 2.6 mM (this being the recommended concentration, carb(2)), and 5.2 mM (carb(3)). The control treatment was without carbendazim. The results in relation to control plants indicate that the application of carb(1) in tobacco plants not afflicted by damaging biotic and abiotic agents boosts phenolic accumulation. Therefore, in the case of carbendazim, the application of 50% less (carb(1), 1.3 mM) than the recommended dosage (carb(2), 2.6 mM) of this fungicide could be more effective, because the foliar accumulation of phenolics presented at carb(1) may imply an increased resistance of plants to pathogen infection. On the other hand, we found an inhibition of the phenolic oxidation by the application of carbendazim, principally at carb(3). These results suggest that the excessive application of carbendazim (5.2 mM) could be harmful for healthy plants, because, on inhibiting phenolic metabolism (biosynthesis and oxidation), such treatment would also sharply reduce the capacity of these plants to respond against pathogen attack.
