Antimicrobial agents are used to treat patients with infectious diseases. Initial antimicrobial compounds originated from natural sources and were generally deemed to be narrow in spectrum. Today, we are in the era of designer drugs that have been specifically developed with current issues in infectious diseases in mind. For example, some new compounds require once daily dosing, have minimal side effects, are active against resistant pathogens and, for some, have a lower propensity for selecting for antimicrobial resistance during patient therapy.
