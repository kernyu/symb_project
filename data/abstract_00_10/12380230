A total of 413 clinical specimens (pus, blood, urine, and stool) collected from patients admitted to Jimma Hospital were cultured for isolation and identification of aerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Out of these, 124 specimens yielded one or more Gram-negative bacilli strains. Frequent Gram negative bacterial isolates were Proteus species 34(27%), Klebsiella species 26(21%), Enterobacter species 24(19%), and E. coli 24(19%). Antimicrobial susceptibility test results showed that all E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species were resistant to ampicillin. Ninety-two percent of Enterbacter sp., 85% of Klebisiella and 79% of E. coli were resistant to tetracycline. Almost all the isolates were found to be multi-resistant to the commonly used antimicrobials, ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria are increasing and may contribute to spread of serious infectious diseases in Jimma Hospital and elsewhere in the country. Therefore, if we are to prevent and control infections by emerging antimicrobial resistant bacterial strains, measures such as strengthening clinical microbiology laboratory, increased emphasis on effective infection control, emphasis on hygienic practices in hospital, and prudent use of existing antimicrobial agents is recommended.
