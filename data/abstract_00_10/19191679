BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a serious health problem worldwide. The current standard treatment of HCV infection is pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, but this is clearly not sufficiently effective and tolerable. OBJECTIVE: To review current HCV treatment strategies and future options. METHODS: Review of major clinical trials or observational studies when no trial is available. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Rates of sustained virologic response are widely variable, approximately 40-80%, depending on genotype, and even lower when HIV coinfection occurs. New agents, like small molecules that specifically target the HCV life cycle, may improve response rates; but safety is a concern.
