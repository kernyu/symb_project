Genotypic patterns associated with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance in the absence of well-characterized resistance mutations were identified using a database (n > 47,000) of phenotype-genotype data. Among samples with no known NNRTI mutations, the most resistant samples contained K101P (n = 35) or a combination of K103R and V179D (n = 41). Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of these mutations.
