Using a reference microdilution method, we studied the antifungal susceptibility to voriconazole and fluconazole of 304 clinical isolates from four species of onychomycosis-causing dermatophytes, 196 isolates of dermatophytes not related to nail infection as well as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Fusarium spp. and Scytalidium dimidiatum. Results showed a high antifungal activity of voriconazole against dermatophytes (geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)=1.14 microg/mL; MIC for 50% of the organisms (MIC(50))=0.062 miccrog/mL; MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=0.25 microg/mL). For S. brevicaulis, the in vitro activity of voriconazole was considerably lower (geometric mean MIC=8.52 microg/mL; MIC(50) and MIC(90)=16 microg/mL). Although voriconazole is not among the drugs recommended for the management of onychomycosis, it can be a useful alternative for recalcitrant infections.
