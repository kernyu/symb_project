OBJECTIVE: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metastasis is the most difficult type of retinoblastoma metastasis to cure, even with bone marrow transplant. Most metastatic retinoblastoma cells express P-glycoprotein causing multidrug resistance (MDR). P-glycoprotein-rich blood vessels form blood-brain and blood-eye barriers, inhibit drug entry into central nervous system (CNS) and eyes. High-dose craniospinal radiation is too morbid for treatment of young children. To cure CSF metastasis without radiation, we designed an intensive multimodality chemotherapy regimen. METHOD: After left eye enucleation, a 4-month-old boy with bilateral International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification Group E eyes and CSF metastasis was treated with 7-cycle high-dose carboplatin and etoposide, standard-dose vincristine, and high-dose/short-infusion cyclosporine to inhibit P-glycoprotein. Intraventricular drugs, non-substrate of P-glycoprotein (cytarabine), or less susceptible to MDR (topotecan), contributed to treatment of the metastasis. On achieving complete response, he was consolidated with supralethal-dosage carboplatin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide, and his bone marrow rescued with autologous cord blood stem cells. RESULTS: Following 1-cycle systemic chemotherapy and 2-dose intraventricular chemotherapy, the CSF metastasis cleared. The right eye tumor regressed completely. The patient remains in remission 8.3 years after diagnosis and 7.8 years post-transplant. CONCLUSION: Intensive multimodality chemotherapy can cure CSF metastasis in retinoblastoma without incurring extreme morbidity from craniospinal radiation.
