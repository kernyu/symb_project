Numerous studies have revealed that a part of the cellular response to chronic oxidative stress involves increased antioxidant capacity. However, another defense mechanism that has received less attention is DNA repair. Because of the important homeostatic role of mitochondria and the exquisite sensitivity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to oxidative damage, we hypothesized that mtDNA repair plays an important role in the protection against oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis mtDNA damage and repair was evaluated in normal HA1 Chinese hamster fibroblasts and oxidative stress-resistant variants isolated following chronic exposure to H2O2 or 95% O2. Reactive oxygen species were generated enzymatically using xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine. When treated with xanthine oxidase reduced levels of initial mtDNA damage and enhanced mtDNA repair were observed in the cells from the oxidative stress-resistant variants, relative to the parental cell line. This enhanced mtDNA repair correlated with an increase in mitochondrial apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity in both H2O2- and O2-resistant HA1 variants. This is the first report showing enhanced mtDNA repair in the cellular response to chronic oxidative stress. These results provide further evidence for the crucial role that mtDNA repair pathways play in protecting cells against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species.
