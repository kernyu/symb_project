Resistance of transgenic cultivars based on the expression of one or more resistance genes is sooner or later broken by pathogens whose race-producing rates are high. Thus, combining transgenesis with elicitor-induced resistance is a promising approach. The elicitor-induced resistance is based on the expression of multiple resistance genes, which can prevent the adaptation of pathogens to transgenic races, maintain the stability of cultivars, and increase their lifespan. In this work, we used transgenic potato cultivars Temp and Superior transformed with Bacillus thuringiensis delta-endotoxin gene and Lukyanovskii transformed with leukocyte alpha-interferon gene. Arachidonic acid (10(-8) M) and soluble chitosan (5 kDa, 100 micrograms/ml) were used as elicitors for tuber treatment. Our data showed that pretreatment with elicitors causes a 15-25% increase in both the systemic prolonged resistance of potato tubers to Phytophthora infestans and their ability to repair mechanical damage.
