Antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin (GFLX) and other antibacterial drugs against various fresh clinical strains (800 isolates) isolated from specimens of patients in 2002 were compared. GFLX was more active than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. For these isolates, clarithromycin and azithromycin were less active (MIC90; > 16- > 64 micrograms/mL), GFLX was more active than cefdinir. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter species, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, three quinolones including GFLX were potently active (MIC90; < or = 0.06-0.5 microgram/mL). Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infections were resistant to three quinolones including GFLX (MIC90; 32-64 micrograms/mL), however P. aeruginosa isolated from respiratory and otolaryngological infections were more susceptible (MIC90; 0.5-2 micrograms/mL). Quinolones were less active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae as compared with the cephem antibiotics tested, but GFLX was the most active against N. gonorrhoeae among the quinolones tested. In this study, we investigated activity of GFLX against fresh clinical strains isolated early in 2002, GFLX is widely and potently active against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and various Gram-negative bacteria.
