The acquisition of the mec gene complex by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in the community and the increased spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from the health care setting to the community underscore a need to monitor the resistance phenotypes likely to be encountered among outpatient MRSA. Data from the LEADER 2004 surveillance program were analyzed to evaluate current resistance profiles among outpatient MRSA. Outpatient MRSA exhibited 26 different resistance phenotypes; the 4 most common were resistance to erythromycin only (40.8%), multidrug resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and levofloxacin (21.5%), double drug resistance to erythromycin and levofloxacin (11.3%), and double drug resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin (5.1%). These phenotypes were also the most common among inpatient MRSA (n = 946), but multidrug resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and levofloxacin (43.7%) was most common. Fifty percent (256) of the outpatient MRSA were resistant to 2 or more agents, whereas resistance to either vancomycin or linezolid was not encountered. The extensive similarities in resistance profiles between inpatient and outpatient MRSA have important implications for establishing outpatient management and treatment guidelines for staphylococcal infections.
