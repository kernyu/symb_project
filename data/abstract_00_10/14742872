Cross talk between salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defense signaling has been well documented in plants, but how this cross talk is executed and the components involved remain to be elucidated. We demonstrate that the plant-specific transcription factor WRKY70 is a common component in SA- and JA-mediated signal pathways. Expression of WRKY70 is activated by SA and repressed by JA. The early induction of WRKY70 by SA is NPR1-independent, but functional NPR1 is required for full-scale induction. Epistasis analysis suggested that WRKY70 is downstream of NPR1 in an SA-dependent signal pathway. Modulation of WRKY70 transcript levels by constitutive overexpression increases resistance to virulent pathogens and results in constitutive expression of SA-induced pathogenesis-related genes. Conversely, antisense suppression of WRKY70 activates JA-responsive/COI1-dependent genes. The effect of WRKY70 is not caused by subsequent changes in SA or JA levels. We suggest that WRKY70 acts as an activator of SA-induced genes and a repressor of JA-responsive genes, integrating signals from these mutually antagonistic pathways.
