Nationwide monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter isolated from food-producing animals on farms was performed in Japan. A total of 468 Campylobacter isolates were obtained during the period from June 1999 to March 2001. Campylobacter species showed high frequencies of resistance to oxytetracycline and dihydrostreptomycin. The frequencies of resistance in Campylobacter coli to aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracycline and quinolones were higher than those in Campylobacter jejuni to the same drugs. All of the C. jejuni isolates were susceptible to macrolide antibiotics, whereas 48.4% of the C. coli isolates were resistant to macrolides. Resistance to fluoroquinolones was observed in C. jejuni isolates from broilers (12%) and layers (2.6%), indicating that the level of fluoroquinolone resistance in Japan could be ranked as low.
