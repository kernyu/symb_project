BACKGROUND: Patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) infections are usually treated with intravenous (IV) vancomycin and remain hospitalized for the duration of IV therapy. Oral linezolid has excellent bioavailability and activity against MRSA and MR-CoNS and offers the potential for outpatient treatment of MRSA and MR-CoNS infections. OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential for early switch (ES) from IV vancomycin to oral linezolid and subsequent early discharge (ED) in hospitalized, adult patients treated for an MRSA or MR-CoNS infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at the Veterans Administration Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System from January 1 through December 31, 2000. Potential reductions in vancomycin use, hospital length of stay (LOS), and economic savings were determined. RESULTS: A total of 103 of 177 (58%) treatment courses for MRSA or MR-CoNS infections were potentially eligible for ES, with annual and mean decreases in vancomycin use of 535 defined daily doses and 5.2 days per event. Of the ES cohort, 55 of 103 (53%) courses were potentially eligible for ED, with an annual and mean reduction in LOS of 181 days and 3.3 days per event. The total potential savings was $220,181, at an average of $3,478 per event. CONCLUSION: Early switch to oral linezolid for treatment of MRSA or MR-CoNS infections could reduce vancomycin use, hospital length of stay, and economic costs.
