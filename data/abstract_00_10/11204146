A symposium was held on May 8, 2000 to discuss the management of deep infections with Candida species. Among the findings discussed were the following. Candiduria is most often benign, though it occurs in patients with serious underlying diseases. Candida species are now the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections, usually arising from an intravenous catheter. Candida albicans represents only 50-60% of the isolates. There has been no change in the frequency of fluconazole resistance in C. albicans but some of the other species now being isolated from blood are constitutively more resistant to this drug. Nevertheless, for most non-neutropenic patients with candidemia, fluconazole is a reasonable choice for initial therapy. In the neutropenic patient, candidemia is now uncommon. Deep candida infections in neutropenic patients are usually being treated empirically with an amphotericin B formulation. Hepatosplenic candidiasis is usually detected only after recovery from neutropenia but can be suspected by imaging techniques. Improved diagnostic techniques for deep candidiasis in the neutropenic patient remain a critical requirement.
