A patient with chronic granulomatous disease developed brain abscesses with Scedosporium prolificans. In vitro susceptibility revealed a synergistic effect of terbinafine and voriconazole. He received therapy with both these antifungals which resulted in disappearance of the brain abscesses. This is the first reported cure of a CNS S. prolificans infection in an immunocompromised host.
