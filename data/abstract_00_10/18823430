BACKGROUND: CYP2C19 polymorphism plays an important role in the metabolism of proton pump inhibitors. The multidrug resistance (MDR)1 genotype is associated with the successful eradication of Helicobacter pylori. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of CYP2C19 and MDR1 genotypes on the eradication rate of H. pylori using a pantoprazole-based triple therapy. METHODS: A total of 210 patients infected with H. pylori were treated with 40 mg pantoprazole, 500 mg clarithromycin and 1000 mg amoxicillin twice daily for 7 days. The CYP2C19 genotype was determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The MDR1 C3435T polymorphism was identified by PCR-based allele-specific amplification (PCR-ASA). RESULTS: Of the 210 patients who completed the study, 174 (82.9%, 95.0% confidence interval [CI], 77.8-88.0%) achieved successful eradication after the first cycle of therapy. The eradication rates for H. pylori were 86.7%, 81.1% and 82.1% in the homozygous extensive, heterozygous extensive and poor metabolizer groups, respectively (P = 0.65). Moreover, the cure rates in the CC, CT, and TT groups were 82.7%, 84.4% and 76.9%, respectively (P = 0.66). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that endoscopic diagnosis was a significant independent risk factor for treatment failure. CONCLUSION: The eradication rates of H. pylori by pantoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin were not significantly different among the CYP2C19 and MDR1 genotypes. Hence, the cure rate of H. pylori in the Korean population was no different for the CYP2C19 and MDR1 genotypes.
