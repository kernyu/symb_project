Investigating new possibilities for the application of 1% (v/v) iodophors, povidone-iodine (PVP-I) was better tolerated in the HET-CAM or explant test than 1% (w/v) silver nitrate or tetracycline. After application to the eye, at least 2.6% of used iodine were adsorbed. Therefore PVP-I is more effective than silver nitrate or erythromycin, meaning a possible alternative for the prevention of ophthalmia neonatorum. PVP-I is more active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a human ex vivo skin model, which results in a complete eradication of S. aureus in the nasal cavity of volunteers after 2 daily applications and will be better tolerated by human nasal cilial epithelium than chlorhexidine. Having the same clinical tolerance as mupirocin, PVP-I is a useful alternative for the antiseptic therapy of germ carriers of MRSA. The synthesis of proteoglycans in articular cartilage of bovine sesamoid bones was increased after application of 5% (v/v) PVP-I without any increase in catabolism revealing possibilities for the use as irrigation solution in the joint.
