We had shown that virus resistance to ADS-J1 was associated with amino acid changes in the envelope glycoprotein, mostly located in the gp120 coding region. Time-of-addition and endocytic virus transfer assays clearly demonstrated that ADS-J1 behaved as a gp120 inhibitor. ADS-J1-resistant virus was cross-resistant to the polyanion dextran sulfate, and recombination of gp120 recovered only the ADS-J1-resistant phenotype. In summary, ADS-J1 blocks an early step of virus entry that appears to be driven by gp120 alone.
