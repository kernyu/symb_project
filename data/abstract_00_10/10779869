Shuttle vectors with new or improved features were constructed to enable facile genetic manipulations in the plant pathogen Ustilago maydis. Sets of plasmids selectable in media containing geneticin, carboxin, nourseothricin, or hygromycin, able to replicate autonomously, to transform U. maydis by integration, and to express foreign genes under control of the homologous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter, were built upon a common pUC19 vector backbone. This permits a large number of choices for a cloning site, blue/white screening for recombinant plasmids, rapid transfer of a cloned DNA fragment between plasmids, and choice of several dominant drug-resistance markers for selection in U. maydis.
