Microarray analyses reveal global changes in gene expression in response to environmental changes and, thus, are well suited to providing a detailed picture of bacterial responses to antibiotic treatment. These responses are represented by patterns of gene expression, termed expression signatures, which provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibiotics as well as the general physiological responses of bacteria to antibiotic-related stresses. The complexity of such signatures is challenging the notion that antibiotics act on single targets and this is consistent with the concept that there are multiple targets coupled with common stress responses. A more detailed knowledge of how known antibiotics act should reveal new strategies for antimicrobial drug discovery.
