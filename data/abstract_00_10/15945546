Activity of 16 antibacterial agents against human isolates of Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 serogroups (P-5879, 4990, 143/23, and MO-45, P- 16065 respectively) was studied in vitro. The efficacy of the agents was studied in a model of generalized cholera in albino mice. Susceptibility of Vibrio cholerae P-5879 (used as the control) in the in vitro experiments with respect to the antibacterial agents correlated with their in vivo efficacy. The strains of Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 serogroups isolated within the recent years had transmissive markers of resistance to streptomycin, trimethoprime/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and not transmitted by conjugation markers of resistance to rifampicin, furazolidone, nalidixic acid. The specific feature of the experimental infection due to such strains was the failure not only of the antibacterials of the resistance spectrum of the pathogen but also of the antibiotics showing in vitro susceptibility (betalactams, fluoroquinolones) that required additional bacteriological control on the 2nd or 3rd day of the etiotropic therapy for early replacement of the antibacterial agent.
