The serogroups and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of V. cholerae isolated in Hubli, India during the years 2000 to 2004 were monitored. A total of 256 V. cholerae isolates were obtained during the study period, of which 129 (50.4%) belonged to serogroup O1 while the O139 and non-O1, non-O139 serogroups constituted 61 (23.8%) and 66 (25.8%) isolates, respectively. V. cholerae O1 Ogawa was the predominant isolate during the first 2 years of the study. However, this was replaced by V. cholerae non-O1, non-O139 serogroups in the following years. The V. cholerae, which was susceptible to most enteric antimicrobials in 2000, was found to be multidrug resistant in subsequent years, with the development of fluroquinolone resistance since 2002. Surveillance of the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of V. cholerae provides useful information for managing cholera cases. The V. cholerae non-O1, non-O139 serogroups coupled with multiple antimicrobial resistance may form a group of emerging diarrheal pathogens in the tropics.
