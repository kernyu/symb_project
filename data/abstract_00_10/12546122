The MTT method for rifampicin and isoniazid susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was developed by using bacterial suspension prepared from colonies on solid media. The MTT tube assay in 1 ml Middlebrook 7H9 broth was completed within 4 days for rifampicin (RMP) and within 7 days for isoniazid (INH). When MTT assay results with 279 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates were compared with those of the conventional proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium, high specificity and sensitivity values of 100% and 94.1%, respectively, for RMP susceptibility testing, and 99.5% and 89.2%, respectively, for INH susceptibility testing were obtained. The accuracy of the MTT method for RMP and INH was > 0.97 concordance with the proportion method. The MTT method is simple, inexpensive and rapid. The high level of agreement with the conventional proportion method suggests a potential to rapidly detect drug-resistant M. tuberculosis in developing countries, as only basic microbiological equipment is need.
