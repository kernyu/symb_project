The feeding and reproductive habits of non-biting synanthropic flies make them important mechanical vectors of human pathogens. Synanthropic flies are major epidemiologic factors responsible for the spread of acute gastroenteritis and trachoma among infants and young children in (predominantly) developing countries. House flies are involved in mechanical transmission of nosocomial infections with multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospital environments.
