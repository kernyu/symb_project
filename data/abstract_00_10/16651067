Bacteria have adapted a variety of different ways to acquire antibiotic resistance, fostering the rapid development of resistance within a short evolutionary time. The general genetic basis of events leading to and promoting antibiotic resistance formation in bacteria are presented and exemplified by showing the evolution of methicillin, glycopeptide, linezolid, and ketolide resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
