BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that short-cycle structured intermittent therapy (SIT; 7 days without therapy followed by 7 days with antiretroviral therapy [ART]) with a ritonavir-boosted, indinavir-based, twice-daily regimen maintained suppression of plasma HIV viremia while reducing serum levels of lipids. Adherence to such a regimen may be problematic for certain patients. METHODS: Eight patients with a history of receiving combination ART that maintained suppression of plasma HIV RNA to <50 copies/mL received a once-daily SIT regimen of didanosine, lamivudine, and efavirenz. RESULTS: For 7 patients, suppression of plasma HIV RNA to <50 copies/mL was maintained for 60-84 weeks. Four patients with adequate samples had no evidence for an increase in plasma viremia for up to 72 weeks, by use of an assay with a limit of detection of <1 copy/mL. The lack of rebound viremia may be the result of the persistence of efavirenz in plasma on day 7 of the no-therapy period, as was detected in 7 of 7 patients. There was no significant change in CD4(+) T cell counts or serum hepatic transaminase or lipid levels. CONCLUSION: A once-daily short-cycle SIT regimen maintained suppression of plasma HIV RNA while preserving CD4(+) T cell counts. Such a regimen may have importance in resource-limited settings where the monetary cost of continuous ART is prohibitive.
