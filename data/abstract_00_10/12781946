The aim of this study was to characterize the antagonism of a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) produced by Carnobacterium piscicola L103 against Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from salmon and human samples. The inhibitory effect of the BLIS was evaluated in Tryptic soy agar (TSA) during different growth phases of L. monocytogenes at 5 degrees C, using the well diffusion method. Also, the type of inhibition, either bacteriostatic or bactericidal of the BLIS in Tryptic soy broth (TSB), was studied and the development of resistant cells investigated. Results showed an antagonistic effect of the BLIS on all the strains of L. monocytogenes. Four selected strains presented a higher sensitivity to the BLIS in the exponential growth phase and were more resistant in the stationary phase. In TSB, the inhibitory substance showed a partially bactericidal effect on L. monocytogenes. After inactivation of the BLIS with a protease, however, a regrowth of L. monocytogenes was found. The isolate most affected by the action of the BLIS was one of salmon origin. From the 86 isolated colonies that grew in the presence of the BLIS, 93% showed total resistance and 7% partial resistance, which was maintained through five consecutive culture cycles in the absence of the BLIS.
