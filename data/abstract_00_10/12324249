The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections is increasing. Ketolides, semi-synthetic derivatives of erythromycin, overcome the macrolide resistance mechanisms found in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, two key pathogens. They also have improved potency and longer post-antibiotic effects, while maintaining the antibacterial spectrum of the macrolide class. The new ketolides cethromycin (ABT-773) and telithromycin have overall antibacterial properties that suggest they will be clinically useful new antibiotics and are undergoing clinical development and regulatory review.
