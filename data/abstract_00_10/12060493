Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is resistant to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in some patients. The mechanism of this resistance is unknown. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is induced by IFN-alpha and is a good indicator of IFN activity. In the current study, we compared IL-1Ra levels in rapid virologic responders and flat responders who showed resistance to IFN. Three groups of patients were examined, including those who received a single dose of consensus IFN (IFN-con1), patients who received daily IFN-con1 for 1 week, and patients who received IFN-con1 daily for 24 weeks. Serum IL-1Ra, IL-6, and HCV RNA were measured serially in all groups. Serum IL-1Ra levels increased rapidly in all patients with hepatitis C after IFN-alpha administration, irrespective of their virologic response. IL-1Ra levels remained elevated at 1 week but were similar to baseline by week 2 of treatment in patients receiving continuous therapy. IL-6 levels also increased acutely but rose more slowly than IL-1Ra levels. The increase in IL-1Ra and IL-6 observed in both flat and rapid virologic responders indicates that IFN receptors are functioning in patients with IFN-resistant hepatitis C and that the lack of response is related to other virologic or immunologic factors.
