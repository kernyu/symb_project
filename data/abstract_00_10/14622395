Geomyces pannorum var. pannorum is an ubiquitous saprophytic fungus frequently isolated from the soil and from air samples. It has rarely been reported as an animal or plant pathogen and it is an occasional aetiological agent of superficial infection of skin and nails in humans. Here, we report a case of superficial infection of the skin due to this fungus in a healthy man. The patient was treated orally with terbinafine 250 mg daily and topic bifonazole with complete resolution in 2 months.
