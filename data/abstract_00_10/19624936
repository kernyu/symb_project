Using geographic information system and molecular tools, we characterized a possible outbreak of tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strain in 17 patients in Cotonou, Benin, during July 2005-October 2006. Most patients lived or worked in the same area and frequented the same local drinking bar. The isolates were streptomycin resistant.
