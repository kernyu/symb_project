We report our experience, using mycophenolate mofetil (MyM) as an adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy in patients with severe, refractory and high dose steroid-dependent myasthenia gravis (MG). Five patients were commenced on MyM in addition to other immunosuppressive therapies. All had significant clinical improvement and no subsequent myasthenic crisis requiring intensive care unit admission. MyM was well tolerated and no serious adverse effects were observed. MyM is an effective adjunctive therapy for the treatment of severe, refractory and steroid-dependent MG in our experience.
