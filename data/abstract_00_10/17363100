A total of 744 Escherichia coli strains isolated from 830 fecal samples of healthy cattle and pigs in all provinces of Korea were examined for resistance to 16 antimicrobials. The most frequently observed resistance in cattle isolates was to tetracycline (30.5%), followed by resistance to streptomycin (20.4%), ampicillin (12.0%) and chlorampenicol (6.9%). Prevalences of resistance to the same four antimicrobials in swine isolates were 96.3%, 66.8%, 66.1%, and 47.6%, respectively. The prevalence of resistance in pigs was much higher than that in cattle, with 98.3% of pig isolates and 37.1% of cattle isolates showing resistance to one or more of the antimicrobial agents tested.
