The most economically significant Chinese cotton cultivar (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Zhongmian 35) was transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated DNA transfer. The aroA-M1 gene that confers resistance to the glyphosate was fused with a chloroplast-transit peptide of Arabidopsis thaliana 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthase (ASP) and expressed in cotton plants under the control of a CaMV35S promoter. Transgenic plants were directly selected on medium containing glyphosate. Thirty-four independent transgenic lines were obtained after selection, giving a maximal 1.9% transformation frequency. The integration and expression of the aroA-M1 gene in T(0) plants and T(1) progeny were confirmed using DNA hybridization, Western blot and PCR techniques. An increased resistance of T(0) and T(1 )transgenic plants towards glyphosate was also observed.
