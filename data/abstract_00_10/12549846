The authors report a case of relapse in a lepromatous patient 6 years after he had been cured by MDT/WHO/24 doses. The atypical aspect emphasized in this case is the bacterial load increase in a short period of time of 1 year after the smear count was negative, and the case reinforces the importance of patient education on release. No leprosy cases were identified in the patient's close contacts. It seems that relapse was a result of bacillary persistence, since a significant improvement was noted in relapsed lesions after two doses of MDT/WHO.
