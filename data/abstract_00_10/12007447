Oxacillin resistance was examined in 258 coagulase-negative staphylococci from Greek hospitals. mecA DNA was detected in 168 isolates, which were also resistant to oxacillin by agar dilution and disk diffusion, according to the current NCCLS breakpoints. Both methods exhibited a relatively low specificity misclassifying 21 and 19 of the 90 mecA-negative isolates respectively as oxacillin resistant. In contrast, an anti-PBP 2a latex agglutination test, applied after induction by oxacillin, correctly classified 163 mecA-positive (sensitivity 97%) and 88 mecA-negative isolates (specificity 97.7%).
