Antimicrobial therapy plays an integral role in the management of intra-abdominal infections. Recent developments include increased prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus species) coupled with general decline in the antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobes and gram-negative organisms, new antibiotics and dosing regimens, and better understanding of the role of various microbial pathogens and of prophylactic antimicrobial agents. Therapeutic approaches to intra-abdominal infections, such as the various forms of peritonitis, cholecystitis, cholangitis, and diverticulitis, are reviewed here. Specific recommendations for antimicrobial therapy in various clinical settings are provided, with special emphasis on recent trends and developments that reflect changes in understanding or therapy.
