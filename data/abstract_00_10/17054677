The effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) alone, or combined with low-dose cytarabine or etoposide, on the proliferation of acute myeloid leukaemia blast cells in vitro was investigated. GO alone induced a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation although an increase in apoptosis was only seen in a minority of patients. A correlation was found between PgP function and GO sensitivity but not between CD33 or PgP expression and GO. Combinations of GO with varying concentrations of cytarabine or etoposide were additive in inhibiting proliferation, reducing cell viability and increasing apoptosis.
