The actual use of antibiotics includes, not just its therapeutic cases, but also for disease prevention and as a growth promoter in animals. These practices have resulted in the propagation of resistance to antibiotics, representing a threat for Public Health. In this work, the antibiotic sensibility pattern of 20 Listeria monocytogenes and 40 Salmonella spp. strains, isolated from foodstuff was studied and compared with the antibiotic sensibility patterns of 20 L. monocytogenes and 100 Salmonella strains of clinical origin. 95% of the L. monocytogenes strains isolated from food were sensible to ampicillin, compared with the 65% of the clinical origin strains. Same way, 100% of food strains were sensible to gentamicin, compared with 85% of clinical origin strains. 95% of both showed sensibility to trimethoprim sulfametoxazole and 100% to ciprofloxacin. For Salmonella spp., the sensibility patterns for trimethoprim sulfametoxazole, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and amoxicilin/clavulanic acid from both origins were similar. Nevertheless, food origin strains showed a 97.5% and 82.5% sensibility for tetracycline and cephalosporin respectively, compared with a 83 and 90% sensibility shown by clinical origin strains. The results obtained demonstrate the potential risk that bacterial strains isolated from food represent in the transmission of antibiotics' resistance.
