Q145M, a mutation in a conserved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) region, was reported to decrease susceptibility to multiple RT inhibitors. We report that Q145M and other Q145 mutations do not emerge with RT inhibitors nor decrease RT inhibitor susceptibility. Q145M should not, therefore, be considered an RT inhibitor resistance mutation.
