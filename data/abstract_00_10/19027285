Utilizing the ultra sensitivity of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor to examine drug resistance of bacteria was studied in this research. Susceptible and resistant strains of Escherichia coli JM109 to ampicillin and those of Staphylococcus epidermidis to tetracycline, served as a blind test, were examined. The bacteria adhered on the Au thin film was treated by the injection of antibiotic flow. The optical property change of the bacteria responded to antibiotics were recorded through SPR mechanism. As a result, the susceptible strain of E. coli generally revealed more than three times of SPR angle shift when compared to the resistant one; the susceptible strain of S. epidermidis revealed irregular SPR angle shift while the resistant strain kept the SPR angle almost unchanged. The new SPR method took less than 2h of antibiotic treatment time to complete the antimicrobial susceptibility test. Different from conventional applications of SPR, specific antibodies is not required in this method. As compared to the conventional assays, Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion and variations of broth microdilution usually take 1 day to weeks to issue the report. Using this SPR assay can greatly reduce the waiting period for laboratory tests, and can therefore benefit patients who need proper antibiotic treatments to control bacterial infections. The sensitivity of the SPR biosensor built for the application is around 1.4 x 10(-4) on the refractive index.
