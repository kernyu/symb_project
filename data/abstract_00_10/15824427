In previous studies with strains of the Shigella dysenteriae provisional serovars E22383 and E23507 from diarrhoeal stools from patients in Bangladesh, two strains of Shigella species were identified as Shigella boydii provisional serovar E16553 by a reference laboratory. Further tests with an antiserum to an international type strain of the provisional serovar E16553 identified an additional 15 isolates. None of the isolates reacted with antisera to the established Shigella serovars or any other provisional serovars reported so far and all showed biochemical reactions typical of S. boydii. All of the isolates harboured the 140 MDa invasion plasmid, had the ipaH gene and produced keratoconjunctivitis in the guinea pig eye. All isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and mecillinam but eight strains were resistant to tetracycline. A single PFGE type (type A) was shown for all 17 clinical isolates, indicating a common source of origin. The pulsotype of the Bangladeshi isolates was closely related to that of a Japanese strain but was different from that of the type strain. On the basis of these biochemical, serological and virulence markers, and diverse geographical origin, it is recommended that the provisional status of serovar E16553 be changed and that it be included in the international serotyping classification scheme as S. boydii 19.
