Candida biofilms display increased resistance to most antifungal agents. We have evaluated the efficacy of combinations of fluconazole (FLC), amphotericin B, and caspofungin (CSP) against Candida albicans biofilms in vitro. Indifference was observed for all the combinations of paired antifungal agents when a checkerboard titration method was used. Time-kill experiments revealed an antagonistic effect of high FLC doses with CSP.
