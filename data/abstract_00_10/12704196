In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, addition of the 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) moiety to the phosphate group(s) of lipid A is required for resistance to polymyxin and cationic antimicrobial peptides. We have proposed previously (Breazeale, S. D., Ribeiro, A. A., and Raetz, C. R. H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 2886-2896) a pathway for l-Ara4N biosynthesis that begins with the ArnA-catalyzed C-4" oxidation and C-6" decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid, followed by the C-4" transamination of the product to generate the novel sugar nucleotide UDP-l-Ara4N. We now show that ArnB (PmrH) encodes the relevant aminotransferase. ArnB was overexpressed using a T7lac promoter-driven construct and shown to catalyze the reversible transfer of the amino group from glutamate to the acceptor, uridine 5'-(beta-l-threo-pentapyranosyl-4"-ulose diphosphate), the intermediate that is synthesized by ArnA from UDP-glucuronic acid. A 1.7-mg sample of the putative UDP-l-Ara4N product generated in vitro was purified by ion exchange chromatography, and its structure was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. ArnB, which is a cytoplasmic protein, was purified to homogeneity from an overproducing strain of E. coli and shown to contain a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, as judged by ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry. The pyridoxal phosphate was converted to the pyridoxamine form in the presence of excess glutamate. A simple quantitative radiochemical assay was developed for ArnB, which can be used to assay the enzyme either in the forward or the reverse direction. The enzyme is highly selective for glutamate as the amine donor, but the equilibrium constant in the direction of UDP-l-Ara4N formation is unfavorable (approximately 0.1). ArnB is a member of a very large family of aminotransferases, but closely related ArnB orthologs are present only in those bacteria capable of synthesizing lipid A species modified with the l-Ara4N moiety.
