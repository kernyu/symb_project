The present study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of ertapenem-nonsusceptible (ETP-NS) Escherichia coli in a Taiwanese university. A total of 9,722 isolates collected in 1999, 2003, 2005, and 2007 were examined. Overall, 1.0% of all isolates from 66 patients were interpreted as ETP-NS on the basis of the disk diffusion test result. Most of these isolates were clonally unrelated and showed low-level ertapenem resistance, the production of CMY-2 cephalosporinase (86.4%), and decreased expression of the OmpF (97.0%) and/or OmpC (56.1%) porins. No carbapenemase was detected. The decreased porin expression was associated with disruptions of ompF or ompC in only about one-third of the ETP-NS isolates. During the study period, the prevalence of ETP-NS strains increased from 0.1 to 1.7%, accompanying an increase (0.8 to 17.6%) in the prevalence of CMY-2 producers. Coexistent or pre-existing clonally related ertapenem-susceptible (ETP-S) E. coli isolates were identified in 47.0% of all case patients, and almost all of the ETP-S isolates had the same beta-lactamases as the ETP-NS isolates. Our study results suggest the restricted use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins to hinder the emergence and prevalence of carbapenem resistance in E. coli, which may arise by the accumulation of multiple resistance determinants.
