Previous studies have shown that expression of c-Jun protein, as well as the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) group of mitogen-activated protein kinases, may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of glutamate neurotoxicity. In order to define the molecular cascade that leads to c-Jun activation following excitotoxic injury and delineate whether induction of protein synthesis is related to cell death signaling cascades or those changes associated with increased seizure activity, we examined the expression of JNK-1, as well as its substrate, c-Jun and N-terminal phosphorylated c-Jun following kainic acid (KA) administration in two strains of mice. In the present study, we assessed the immunohistochemical expression of these proteins at time points between 2 h and 7 days, in excitotoxic cell death-resistant (C57BL/6) and -susceptible (FVB/N) mouse strains that were systemically injected with saline or kainic acid. No strain-related differences in the immunohistochemical expression of any of the proteins were observed in intact control mice. However, following KA administration, the magnitude and period of induction of JNK-1 protein was associated with impending cell death, while increased phosphorylation of c-Jun protein was associated with resistance to cell death. In contrast, expression of c-Jun protein does not appear to be a reliable indicator of impending cell death, as it was expressed in resistant and vulnerable subfields in mice susceptible to kainate injury. These results provide the first evidence that JNK-1 expression may be involved in producing the neuronal cell death response following excitotoxin-induced injury.
