At Morioka Yuai Hospital, the Infection Control Division was set up 5 years ago, and it has made efforts to actively control infections. In particular, the division succeeded in increasing the frequency of general round table discussions for patients with infections. We strongly recommend to frequently gargle with Isodine at operations. Recently, we have followed up patients with infections caused by MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia or carriers of these bacteria, and determined the drug sensitivities of clinical isolates. In addition, because of the current highly aged society, a high percentage of inpatients has various underlying diseases. In particular, there are quite a few cases in which pneumonia occurs as an opportunistic infection. From studies in these patients and patients of the dental department, it has been shown that oral microorganisms clearly decrease in count by careful tooth brushing and gargling with Isodine, with prevention of pneumonitis caused by oral microorganisms. As we consider that antisepsis with povidone-iodine is useful for the prevention of nosocomial and opportunistic infections, we would like to report the findings of our study currently under way.
