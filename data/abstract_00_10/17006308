Antibiotic resistance is a continually increasing problem that has, to a greater or lesser extent, affected virtually every area of the world. The scientific literature is abundant with papers related to antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Many excellent papers and reviews have been published during the past few years, and the literature base continues to expand at rapid speed. This review is meant to provide a recent update on antibiotic resistance among respiratory and enteric pathogens, with a focus on infections in children. Not a small task, but this paper is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, the intention is to highlight the key antibiotics and antibiotic resistance mechanisms that are currently the most relevant to pediatrics. The most recently published literature is used wherever possible, and the reader is encouraged to explore specific topics of interest further by reviewing the referenced literature.
