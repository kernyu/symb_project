A foodborne outbreak of salmonella infection at a private hospital in London in 1994 was found to be associated with eating turkey sandwiches prepared by a food handler. One patient, nine staff, and a foodhandler's baby were confirmed to have Salmonella enterica serotype virchow, phage type 26 infection. The attack rate was estimated to be 5% among the approximately 200 patients and staff at risk. A food handler reportedly became ill days after, but her baby days before, the first hospital case. Although it appeared to be a single outbreak, antibiogram analysis, supplemented by plasmid profile typing, demonstrated that there were two strains of S. virchow involved, one with resistance to sulphonamides and trimethoprim and a second sensitive to these antimicrobial drugs. Mother and child had different strains. The investigation demonstrated the importance of full phenotypic characterization of putative outbreak strains including antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Outbreaks of foodborne infection in hospitals are preventable and are associated with high attack rates and disruption of services. There is a need for good infection control policies and training of all staff involved in patient care as well as in catering services. Consultants in Communicable Disease (CCDCs) should include private hospitals in their outbreak control plans. Good working relations between Infection Control Doctors (ICDs) in the private health sector and their local CCDCs are important if outbreaks are to be properly investigated.
