In Thailand, 51% (36/70) Campylobacter jejuni isolates from humans and 68% (47/69) isolates from poultry were classified into 10 Penner serotypes (serotype B, C, R, E, G, A, K, D, I, and L) and 9 serotypes (serotype A, C, I, K, B, E, S, D, and L), respectively. The rate of antimicrobial drug resistance to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin shown by human isolates were 96%, 96%, 29%, 57%, and 14%, while that shown by poultry isolates were 77%, 77%, 22%, 26%, and 17%, respectively. All quinolone-resistant strains contained a mutation in the gyrA gene (T(86)-->I(86)), suggesting that the strains were already widespread in Thailand.
