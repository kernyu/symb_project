The effects of increased air pressure in a culture of the thermophilic microorganism Thermus sp. RQ-1 were investigated. Cell growth dependence on oxygen supply was investigated in a fermenter at atmospheric pressure. Total oxygen depletion from the medium for low values of kLa was observed during the exponential growth phase. It was possible with this strain to enhance the oxygen transfer rate by increasing the air pressure. Cell productivity was improved by pressurisation up to 0.56 MPa for batch cultivation; and an induction of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase and catalase, was observed with the rise in pressure. Cell pre-cultivation under pressurised conditions conferred to the cells more resistance to an exposure to hydrogen peroxide and more sensitivity to paraquat (methyl viologen). The usefulness of bioreactor pressurisation on the cultivation of Thermus sp. RQ-1 was demonstrated for fed-batch operation, with the attainment of higher cell densities. A two-fold increase in cell mass productivity was obtained by the use of hyperbaric air (0.5 MPa). With the pressurisation of the head-space in the reactor, it was also possible to eliminate the loss of liquid by evaporation, which amounted to more than 10% at 70 degrees C and atmospheric pressure.
