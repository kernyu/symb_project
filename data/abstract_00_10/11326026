A line probe assay (INNO-LiPA HBV DR) detecting drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains was evaluated. Results concordant with sequence analysis were obtained with 48 of 56 serum samples from HBV-infected patients undergoing lamivudine therapy. In eight cases, additional minor subpopulations could be identified by the line probe assay.
