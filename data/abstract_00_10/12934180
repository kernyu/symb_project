Our objective was to accurately predict, from complex mutation patterns, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 resistance to the protease inhibitor lopinavir, by use of artificial intelligence. Two neural network models were constructed: 1 based on changes at 11 positions in the protease that were previously recognized as being significant for lopinavir resistance and another based on a newly derived set of 28 mutations that were identified by performing category prevalence analysis. Both models were trained, validated, and tested with 1322 clinical samples. A procedure of determining the optimal neural network parameters was proposed to speed up the training processes. The results suggested that the 28-mutation set was a more accurate predictor of lopinavir susceptibility (correlation coefficient, R2=0.88). We identified potentially significant new mutations associated with lopinavir resistance and demonstrated the utility of neural network models in predicting phenotypic susceptibility from complex genotypes.
