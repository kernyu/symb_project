BACKGROUND: Pancreas transplantation involves a set of procedures that, in some cases, lead to different complications and outcomes. The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term effects of pancreas transplantation regarding carbohydrate and lipid metabolism parameters to determine differences between simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation and pancreas transplantation alone (PTA). METHODS: Sixty-four patients (46 SPK and 18 PTA), with an immunosuppression protocol based on tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone, were evaluated for at least 1 year after transplantation. No patient made use of any hypoglycemic or hypolipidemic drugs. Comparisons were performed between SPK and PTA patients using the chi-square test, Fischer's exact test, and unpaired Student's t test, as appropriate. RESULTS: Patients were 39.8+/-9.3 years old, predominantly male (60.9%), with a mean follow-up of 25.4+/-10.4 months after transplantation. The PTA group exhibited worse renal function and higher tacrolimus levels than the SPK group. Fasting glucose, 2 hr plasma glucose after overload, C-peptide, and HbA1C were within the normal range, with no statistically significant differences between the PTA and SPK groups. Insulin (INS) and the homeostasis model assessment of INS resistance index were above the normal range in both the groups. Lipids were also similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with long-term functioning pancreas transplant achieved good glucose control without use of exogenous INS or oral antidiabetic drugs, although they were hyperinsulinemic. There were no significant differences concerning glucose and lipid parameters between the SPK and PTA groups, even though the PTA patients exhibited higher tacrolimus levels and worse renal function.
