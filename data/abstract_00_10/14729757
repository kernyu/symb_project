OBJECTIVES: Prior to the renewal of spectinomycin licensing for veterinary uses in Germany, 154 Pasteurella multocida and 148 Mannheimia haemolytica strains from respiratory tract infections in cattle were investigated for their MICs of spectinomycin and other antimicrobial agents. The data obtained should serve as a baseline from which to judge the future development of resistance. Moreover, the in vitro activity of spectinomycin in comparison with other antimicrobials should be assessed. METHODS: MIC determination for all 302 strains was performed by the broth dilution method and evaluated according to NCCLS standards. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were calculated. Strains resistant to spectinomycin were subjected to PCR assays for genes known to mediate spectinomycin resistance in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: With the exception of resistance to sulfamethoxazole in P. multocida and M. haemolytica, and resistance to ampicillin in M. haemolytica, an overall low level of resistance was detected. A total of 93.5% of the P. multocida and 98.6% of the M. haemolytica strains were susceptible to spectinomycin, with MIC(90)s of 32 mg/L. PCR analysis showed that none of the spectinomycin-resistant strains carried any of the aadA gene subtypes, nor the genes spc or aad(9). CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the renewal of spectinomycin, only a small number of spectinomycin-resistant strains was detected among bovine P. multocida and M. haemolytica. The genes responsible for spectinomycin resistance in these strains seemed to be different from those so far known to occur in other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
