New water-soluble antiviral chemical agents, containing 10 to 30% of adamantane derivatives (amino-, aminopropyl-adamantane-, aminomethyl- and rimantadine), which were conjugated with polycarboxylic matrixes of the divinyl ether and maleic anhydride copolymers (DIVEMA), were developed. The polymeric drugs exhibited a low cytotoxicity (4 to 10 times less than rimantadine) and a wide spectrum of antiviral activity against influenza viruses, including both the remantadine-resistant strains of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and the B/Saint-Petersburg strain/71/77 as well as against herpes viruses of type 1, parainfluenza viruses of types 1 and 3 and RS-virus. A reduction of the viral infection titer in their reproduction in sensitive cells' cultures was more than 2.0 Ig ID50. Complete inhibition of viral-specific syntheses, registered by immune-enzyme assay (IEA) and by hemagglutination test was observed at low infection doses ranging from 1 to 100 ID50. The efficiency of the antiviral effect depends on a drug's molecular weight and a structure of chemical bonds between the adamantane nucleus and the polymeric matrix.
