There are relatively few classes of antifungal drugs. This restricts clinicians' therapeutic choices and these choices are further reduced by the emergence of drug resistance. Exposure to antifungal drugs represents an environmental stress for the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. The immediate response of C. albicans to antifungals may be drug tolerance, which can lead to drug resistance. This article examines C. albicans drug resistance from the perspective of it being a stress response and investigates how commonality with other stress-response pathways gives insights into the prospects for overcoming, or preventing, drug resistance.
