One hundred twenty-one extended-spectrum beta-lactamse-producing enterobacterial clinical isolates were screened for the qepA gene. A single CTX-M-15-positive Escherichia coli isolate (0.8%) that produced the putative pump QepA2 was identified. This qepA2 gene was located onto a 90-kb mobilizable plasmid that conferred reduced susceptibility to hydrophilic fluoroquinolones.
