A total of 170 Campylobacter jejuni strains isolated from the stool of children with clinical gastroenteritis, aged from 3 months to 14 years, were collected during a two-year period (2004-2005). From the 170 strains 30% were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC > or = 4 microg/ml), 55% to tetracycline (MIC > 8 microg/ml), 13% to clindamycin (MIC > or = 8 microg/ml), 4% to ampicillin (MIC > 16 microg/ml), 6% to erythromycin (MIC > or = 8 microg/ml), 4% to coamoxiclav (MIC > or = 16/8 microg/ml) and 0% to gentamicin. Compared to previous reports from Greece, the antimicrobial resistance rates to erythromycin, ampicillin and coamoxiclav remain low, while they are still high for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. Considering similar reports from many other countries and the high incidence of Campylobacter gastroenteritis worldwide, the value of ciprofloxacin as a first choice drug in the empiric treatment of the infection is questionable.
