Two isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (IleRSs) encoded by two distinct genes (ileS1 and ileS2) were identified in pseudomonic acid (mupirocin)-producing Pseudomonas fluorescens. The most striking difference between the two IleRSs (IleRS-R1 and IleRS-R2) is the difference in their abilities to resist pseudomonic acid. Purified IleRS-R2 showed no sensitivity to pseudomonic acid even at a concentration of 5 mm, 105 times higher than the Ki value of IleRS-R1. The amino acid sequence of IleRS-R2 exhibits eukaryotic features that are originally found in eukaryotic proteins. Escherichia coli cells transformed with the ileS2 gene exerted pseudomonic acid resistance more than did those transformed with ileS1. Cells transformed with both genes became almost as resistant as P. fluorescens. These results suggest that the presence of IleRS-R2 could be the major reason why P. fluorescens is intrinsically resistant to the antibiotic. Here we suggest that the evolutionary scenario of the eukaryotic ileS2 gene can be explained by gene acquisition and that the pseudomonic acid producer may have maintained the ileS2 gene to protect itself from pseudomonic acid.
