Characterization of base substitutions in rRNAs has provided important insights into the mechanism of protein synthesis. Knowledge of the structural effects of such alterations is limited, and could be greatly expanded with the development of a genetic system based on an organism amenable to both genetics and structural biology. Here, we describe the genetic analysis of base substitutions in 16S ribosomal RNA of the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus, and an analysis of the conformational effects of these substitutions by structure probing with base-specific modifying agents. Gene replacement methods were used to construct a derivative of strain HB8 carrying a single 16S rRNA gene, allowing the isolation of spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutants and subsequent genetic mapping of mutations by recombination. The residues altered to give streptomycin resistance reside within the central pseudoknot structure of 16S rRNA comprised of helices 1 and 27, and participate in the U13-U20-A915 base triple, the G21-A914 type II sheared G-A base pair, or the G885-C912 Watson-Crick base pair closing helix 27. Substitutions at any of the three residues engaged in the base triple were found to confer resistance. Results from structure probing of the pseudoknot are consistent with perturbation of RNA conformation by these substitutions, potentially explaining their streptomycin-resistance phenotypes.
