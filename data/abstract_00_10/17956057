OBJECTIVE: The aim of our studies was to isolate haemophili rods and S. aureus from children with mucoviscidosis and to assess antimicrobial agent susceptibility of the isolates. METHODS: Sputa and nasopharynx swabs from 12 children with mucoviscidosis were screened for the prevalence ofHaemophilus sp. and S. aureus. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was performed by agar diffusion method using appropriate media. Beta-lactamase activity was determined with the nitrocefin discs, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance using D-test. MAIN OBSERVATIONS: Of 12 mucoviscidosis-positive patients, 7 (58.33%) were colonisated by haemophili rods (a total of 8 H. parainfluenzae, 2 H. influenzae or 2 Haemophilus sp. isolates) and by S. aureus (8 isolates), in these species were isolated alone or in mixed cultures. Two ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus sp. but without beta-lactamases production were obtained. Also two methicillin resistant S. aureus with constitutive phenotype of resistance to macrolides-lincosamides and streptogramins B isolates and two methicillin-sensitive (with constitutive and inducible resistance to macrolides-lincosamides and streptogramins B) were isolated.
