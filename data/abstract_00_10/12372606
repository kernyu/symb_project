To investigate acquired resistance to oxaliplatin, we selected two resistant clones from the HCT116 cell line. We found that the resistant phenotype was associated with resistance to oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis as demonstrated by FACS analysis and by Western blotting of caspase 3 activation. In addition, the resistant phenotype showed a concomitant resistance to lonidamine and arsenic trioxide which are inducers of mitochondrial apoptosis. Furthermore, a complete loss of Bax expression due to a frameshift mutation was observed in the most resistant clone. Taken together, these findings suggest that altered mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis could play a role in oxaliplatin resistance.
