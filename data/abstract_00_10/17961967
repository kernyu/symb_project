We report a case of pulmonary and bloodstream infection due to multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii six days after a severe trauma. Clinical condition transiently improved following antimicrobial treatment with ticarcillin-clavulanate and rifampicin. However, a septic shock developed on the fourth day due to the emergence of a strain only sensible to cotrimoxazole, colistin and tigecycline. Cure was achieved after a two week treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam, cotrimoxazole and tigecycline. This case shows that combined antimicrobial therapy including tigecycline can be relevant in some severe pulmonary infections due to multiresistant A. baumannii.
