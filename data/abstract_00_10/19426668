A laboratory strain of Schistosoma mansoni subjected to repeated in vivo praziquantel (PZQ) treatments for several generations has been previously found to have lesser sensitivity to the drug than the original unselected strain. In this study we have collected evidence on the mode of inheritance of the partial insensitivity exhibited by the PZQ-selected schistosomes. A single male and a single female worm of the two strains, assorted in the four possible combinations, were introduced into the mesenteric veins of mice and the eggs produced by each pair were used as the source of the F(1) progeny. PZQ sensitivity was assessed using both in vivo and in vitro methods. In the first approach, the PZQ ED(50) was determined by infecting mice with cercariae of the strains to be tested, treating at seven weeks with different drug doses and counting the number of surviving worms three weeks later. For the in vitro approach, adult schistosomes kept in culture were exposed overnight to different PZQ concentrations and their survival was monitored during the subsequent 7 days. Results from both approaches lead to the conclusion that hybrid schistosomes of the F(1) generation have a drug sensitivity intermediate between those of the two parental strains and are thus suggestive of a pattern of partial dominance for the trait under study.
