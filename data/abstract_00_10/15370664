A retrospective study was conducted between July 1990 and July 2002 to investigate the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and the outcome of Salmonella bacteraemia in children. A total of 148 episodes of bacteraemia were identified in 144 children. The annual incidence ranged from 1.6 to 8.3 cases per 100,000 children < or = 14 y of age, and higher numbers of cases occurred in summer than in winter months. In 22 children the bacteraemia was caused by S. typhi and in 122 by S. non-typhi. S. enteritidis was the most common serotype isolated. Resistance to ampicillin was exhibited by 28.5% of Salmonella isolates, whereas all S. typhi isolates were susceptible to commonly used antibiotics. The mean age was 40.3 months (range 50 d to 14 y). Children with S. typhi bacteraemia were significantly older than children with S. non-typhi bacteraemia (7.8 vs 2.4 y, p < 0.01). 11 children were immunosuppressed. The immunosuppressed children had longer duration of fever, longer hospitalization stay, and higher relapse rates compared to normal children (p < 0.05). Four children developed complications and 1 died. Although the incidence of S. typhi bacteraemia is decreasing, the non-typhi species continue to cause significant morbidity in our geographical region.
