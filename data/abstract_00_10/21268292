The authors have determined blood parameters reflected condition of the non-specific immunologically-mediated resistance (NIR) in workers of the oil industry, including persons directly participated in oil wells exploration and exposed for long period of time to low doses of ionizing radiation. The article presents obtained results of the percentage of neutrophils and natural killer cells as well as the level of alpha-interferon in the blood serum. Obtained results demonstrated that parameters of NIR of oil industry workers were not substantively different from analogous parameters of healthy person living in the same region.
