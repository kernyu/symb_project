BACKGROUND: There has been a steady increase in the number of cases of ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) otorrhea; this is a growing medical concern. For otological surgery in children, octylcyanoacrylate can be an alternative method of closure for surgical incisions. Recent in vitro studies have shown that octylcyanoacrylate is effective as an antimicrobical barrier. To date, there have been only rare reports on the antibacterial effect of octylcyanoacrylate against CRPA. The purpose of this study is to determine the antimicrobial effects of octyl-cyanoacrylate against the CRPA that was isolated from patients with chronic suppurative otitis media. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical CRPA (n=20) bacteria and ciprofloxacin-sensitive PA (CSPA) (n=20) were obtained from patients. The susceptibilities to various antibiotics were determined by disk diffusion method. RESULT: Both CSPA and CRPA were resistant to octylcyanoacrylate. CONCLUSION: Results demonstrated that octylcyanoacrylate has no antibacterial activity against CSPA and CRPA.
