This study aims to investigate the treatment of paper mill effluents using electrocoagulation. Removal of lignin, phenol, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) from paper mill effluents was investigated at various current intensities by using different electrodes (Al and Fe) and at various electrolysis times (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5min). It was observed that the experiments carried out at 12V, an electrolysis time of 2min and a current intensity of 77.13mA were sufficient for the removal of these pollutants with each electrode. The removal capacities of the process using an Al electrode were 80% of lignin, 98% of phenol, 70% of BOD, and 75% of COD after 7.5min. Using an Fe electrode the removal capacities were 92%, 93%, 80% and 55%, respectively. In addition, it was found that removal of lignin, phenol, BOD and COD increased with increasing current intensity. In the experiments carried out at different current intensities, higher removal can be explained through a decrease in intra-resistance of solution and consequently an increase at the transfer speed of organic species to electrodes. It was also found that Al electrode performs higher efficiency than Fe electrode except for COD removal. However, the time required for removal of BOD was more than that of COD. The results suggest that electrocoagulation could be considered as an effective alternative to paper mill effluents treatment.
