We describe 3 previously healthy Costa Rican children who had Listeria monocytogenes meningitis, an uncommon cause of bacterial meningitis beyond the newborn period in normal subjects. Two of them had initial normal brain computed tomography, but all 3 developed acute hydrocephalus at days 7, 3, and 5, respectively. All required immediate ventriculostomy placement and only 1 of 3 survived. L. monocytogenes should be considered among the etiologies of bacterial meningitis in children who do not respond initially to conventional antimicrobial treatment or who deteriorate rapidly.
