AIM OF THE STUDY: Since Tephrosia purpurea (Linn.) Pers. (Fabaceae) has traditional use in curing different types of wounds including gastroduodenal ulcers, it was of interest to evaluate the in vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori activity profile of the plant extract and its fractions with a view to examining its therapeutic potential, if any. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Employing clinical isolates and standard strains of Helicobacter pylori, the extract and fractions were bioevaluated in terms of MIC and MBC values, acid stability, time-kill kinetics, drug resistance, and synergistic potential. RESULTS: The methanolic extract showed promising activity against clinical isolates and standard strains of Helicobacter pylori, including metronidazole-resistant strains. Fractionation of the extract revealed the n-hexane and chloroform fractions to possess marked activity. The extract and the less polar fractions remained functionally active in acidic condition similar to stomach environment, exhibited consistent bacteriostatic activity during repeated exposure, and demonstrated synergism, complete or partial, even with antibiotic-resistant strains. CONCLUSION: Apolar fractions of Tephrosia purpurea may have therapeutic potential in combating Helicobacter pylori mediated gastroduodenal disorders.
