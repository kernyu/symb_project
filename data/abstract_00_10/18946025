Cell-cell fusion in animal development and in pathophysiology involves expansion of nascent fusion pores formed by protein fusogens to yield an open lumen of cell-size diameter. Here we explored the enlargement of micron-scale pores in syncytium formation, which was initiated by a well-characterized fusogen baculovirus gp64. Radial expansion of a single or, more often, of multiple fusion pores proceeds without loss of membrane material in the tight contact zone. Pore growth requires cell metabolism and is accompanied by a local disassembly of the actin cortex under the pores. Effects of actin-modifying agents indicate that the actin cortex slows down pore expansion. We propose that the growth of the strongly bent fusion-pore rim is restricted by a dynamic resistance of the actin network and driven by membrane-bending proteins that are involved in the generation of highly curved intracellular membrane compartments.
