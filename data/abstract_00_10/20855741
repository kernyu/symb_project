The in vitro susceptibilities of 46 Leptospira isolates from rats to 14 antimicrobial agents were tested. All of the strains were found to be sensitive to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, and streptomycin. In contrast, the tested isolates showed resistance to amphotericin B, 5-fluorouracil, fosfomycin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, neomycin, and vancomycin. These findings will help in selecting effective and ineffective antimicrobials for treatment of leptospirosis and for the development of new selective media, respectively.
