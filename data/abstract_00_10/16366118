Campylobacter jejuni is an important cause of acute bacterial diarrhoea. In developing countries like India, children gain immunity early during infancy. However, the incidence is higher in non-immune hosts. Antibiotic use destabilizes the gut flora and can inhibit the local immune responses, thereby compromising resistance to a variety of infections. It is not yet known whether antibiotic intake can also precipitate C. jejuni enteritis as the infectious dose is low and attack rates are high. We made a preliminary study to determine the prevalence of C. jejuni in hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics for various ailments. One hundred and thirty eight stool samples submitted for Clostridium difficile toxin assay were additionally cultured for C. jejuni in blood-free campylobacter selectivity agar. All suspected colonies were subjected to Gram staining, oxidase, catalase and nalidixic acid sensitivity tests. Confirmation of C. jejuni was done by the hippurate hydrolysis test. Of the 138 faecal samples investigated, 14 (10.1%) grew C. jejuni and 11 of them belonged to adults. Two of these 14 samples were also positive for C. difficile toxin. Though not as yet reported, C. jejuni may also be involved in antibiotic associated diarrhoea due to lowered immunity in the host. It may cause enteritis either by itself or in synergy with C. difficile infection.
