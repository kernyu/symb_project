One of the multiresistant pathogens is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),which was increasingly found in the 1980's. In the USA, the ratio of MRSA rose from 2% in 1975 to 29% in 1991. A similarly steep rise was seen in Germany, with the Paul Ehrlich Society for Chemotherapy reporting a rise from 1.7% in 1990 to 15.7% in 1998. In order to control MRSA, the Clinic and Polyclinic of Technical Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation at the University Clinic Munster, Germany,has set up a comprehensive hygiene management programme for early detection and treatment of nosocomial infections. In addition to addressing the usual problems of MRSA carriers (e.g., higher mortality, longer hospital stays, stigmatisation), these preventive measures are also aimed at combating MRSA-caused cost increases.
