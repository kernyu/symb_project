The purpose of this study is to undertake a nationwide survey on bacterial resistance in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients hospitalized in Argentina. A 2-month point prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (April-May and October-November) from 1997 to 2003 by 36 Argentinean centers. Antimicrobial susceptibility data of the potential pathogens recovered from the BAL (samples containing <1% of squamous epithelial cells and bacterial counts >or=10(4) CFU/mL) of inpatients (i.e., >or=48-h hospital length of stay) with suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) were collected on a computerized system (SIR) described previously. The survey was split into 2 periods for comparison purposes, 1997 to 2000 and 2001 to 2003. A total of 752 organisms were included. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent species, followed by Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In both periods, more than a half of the Klebsiella pneumoniae strains displayed a phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer. A doubling of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter frequency was shown from the 1st period to the 2nd one (25-48%). More than two-thirds of the S. aureus strains proved to be methicillin resistant in both periods, and a pronounced decrease of resistance rates to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and rifampin was shown in the 2nd period. The present study shows the worrisome increasing bacterial resistance in BAL samples to most available antimicrobial options for treating patients with suspected HAP. Variations over time support the need for systematic tailored surveillance and compel us to establish a rational usage of antimicrobial agents in our country.
