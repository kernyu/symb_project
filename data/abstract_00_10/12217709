OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of treating patients without culture confirmation of tuberculosis, with a regimen of two months of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol followed by four months of isoniazid and rifampicin (2HRZE/4HR) in a setting with a rate of isoniazid resistance of 7.5% in culture confirmed cases. SETTING: Tuberculosis patients treated in the Blackburn, Hyndburn and Ribble Valley districts of the UK between 1996 and 2000 inclusive. METHODS: Patients from a detailed prospective clinical and epidemiological data base for all tuberculosis patients were studied for the years 1996-2000. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen cases, all but two of Indian subcontinent ethnic origin, without culture confirmation had received 2HRZE/4HR. Twenty had pulmonary, 55 other respiratory and 39 non-respiratory tuberculosis. There was no bacteriologically confirmed relapse, 1 case was retreated as a clinical relapse. CONCLUSION: The treatment of tuberculosis cases without culture confirmation with a regimen of 2HRZE/4HR gives highly acceptable results. The clinical relapse rate was 0.85% (1/114), and the cure rate 99.15%.
