The study was done to determine the drug resistance pattern of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) isolated from different clinical specimens at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh during the period from July 2007 to June 2008. A total of 32 Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from 200 different clinical specimens by standard microbiological techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility of all the isolates was carried out by disk diffusion method as per recommendation of Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute 2007. Out of 32 Staphylococcus epidermidis 18(56.25%) were detected as Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) by disk diffusion method. In this study, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis showed multidrug resistance. Resistant to penicillin, amoxycillin, oxacillin and cloxacillin was 100% followed by gentamycin (56%), erythromycin (50%), doxycycline (44%), cephradine (44%), ciprofloxacin (39%), fucidic acid (33%), cefuroxime (33%) and ceftriaxone (28%). All isolates of MRSE were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin.
