The aim of the study was to determine susceptibility of ureaplasmas for selected antimicrobials belonging to 3 groups, which are applied clinically. Study was conducted on 39 U. parvum and 26 U. urealyticum clinical isolates. Doxycyclin, azithromycin and levofloxacin were applied during the study. In case of azithromycin U. urealyticum strains were more susceptible; MIC90 = 1 microg/ml and MIC range for both species mean that only a few strains are resistant (only U. parvum). In case of doxycyclin U. parvum strains were more susceptible and MIC ranges mean that there are no resistant strains in both species. In case of levofloxacin wide MIC range with values signifying resistance was found. Doxycyclin is a good choice for empirical treatment of infections with ureaplasma aetiology. In case of macrolides higher dosage is indicated, because there is a risk of clinical failure at lower doses. Quinolones should not be used in empirical treatment of ureaplasma infections.
