Traditional approaches to antimicrobial management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) focus on courses of therapy of at least 10 days duration. The rationale for this length of therapy originated from studies in tonsillopharyngitis. Short-course antibiotic therapy for ABRS with 3-5 days of azithromycin has proved equally effective. Potential added benefits of short-course therapy include improved compliance, fewer adverse events as well as reduced risk of treatment failure, bacterial resistance and cost. Single-dose therapy is now possible with a novel microsphere formulation of azithromycin, which permits administration of a higher 2.0 g oral dose. This has proved as effective and well tolerated as 10 days levofioxacin 500 mg/day in patients with uncomplicated ABRS. High single-dose therapy has the potential to maximize adherence to prescribed therapy and thus to help in the battle to control rising antibiotic resistance among respiratory pathogens.
