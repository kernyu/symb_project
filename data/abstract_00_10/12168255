Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of invasive and non-invasive infections in children of less than two years. The high level of resistance to penicillin and other antimicrobial agents observed particularly in France is responsible of the difficulties concerning the treatment of acute otitis media and meningitis due to S. pneumoniae. Potential positive consequences of the implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may include prevention of invasive diseases and prevention of spread of the drug resistant-strains.
