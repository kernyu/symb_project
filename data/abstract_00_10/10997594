European isolates collected in 1998 for the Alexander Project were tested for their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and a novel fluoroquinolone, gemifloxacin, which has a spectrum of activity including common and atypical respiratory pathogens. MIC90s of gemifloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were 0.03, 0.06 and 0.015 mg/L, respectively. On the basis of MIC90s, gemifloxacin was the most potent antimicrobial tested against S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. Against H. influenzae, gemifloxacin was one tube dilution more potent than ofloxacin and one tube dilution less potent than ciprofloxacin. As resistance to currently available antimicrobial agents increases, gemifloxacin offers potential as a promising new agent for the treatment of respiratory tract infection.
