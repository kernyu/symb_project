BACKGROUND: Macrolide resistance among Streptococcus pyogenes strains is increasing in many European countries. Greece was not considered a country with high prevalence of macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes strains, and until now the genetic mechanism of resistance was unknown. METHODS: During the 25-month period from December, 1998, to December, 2000, pharyngeal cultures for S. pyogenes were performed on 743 Greek children with the clinical diagnosis of pharyngitis. The children were 1 to 16 years old (median age, 7 years) and were living in Central and Southern Greece. S. pyogenes isolates were tested for their susceptibility to erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, clindamycin, penicillin G, amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefprozil. The erythromycin-resistant isolates were further studied for their genetic mechanism of resistance by means of PCR. RESULTS: Of a total of 275 S. pyogenes isolates recovered, 105 (38%) were erythromycin-resistant (MIC > or = 1 microgram/ml) [corrected], with 54, 45 and 1% of them carrying mef(A), erm(A) [subclass erm(TR)] and erm(B) gene, respectively. The prevalence of erythromycin-resistant strains was 29 and 42% during the time periods December, 1998, to December, 1999, and January, 2000, to December, 2000, respectively. All erythromycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin. The isolates carrying the erm(A) gene were inducibly resistant to clindamycin. The 275 S. pyogenes isolates had ceprozil MICs < or = 0.032 microgram/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The current high (38%) prevalence of erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes in Central and Southern Greece requires continuous surveillance and careful antibiotic policy.
