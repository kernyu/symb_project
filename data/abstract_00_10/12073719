OBJECTIVE: A retrospective study to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern seen in respiratory tract pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All sputum samples received during one year period (2000) were cultured by standard laboratory technique and antibiotic sensitivity was performed by Kirby Bauer disc method. RESULT: A total of 238 respiratory pathogens were isolated. All three isolates (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pnuemoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis) were highly resistant against Trimethoprim Sulfamethoxazole. Strep. pnuemoniae was not resistant to Penicillin. Rest of the antibiotics showed good response. CONCLUSION: Strep. pnuemoniae is still very sensitive to Penicillin and all three pathogens were resistant to Timethoprim Sulfamethoxazale.
