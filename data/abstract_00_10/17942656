We describe the development and validation of an agar dilution method for the detection of inducible clindamycin resistance by using 227 previously characterized erythromycin-resistant, clindamycin-susceptible Staphylococcus sp. isolates. Mueller-Hinton agar with defibrinated horse blood containing a range of erythromycin concentrations (1 to 8 mg/liter) combined with clindamycin at 0.5 mg/liter was used to determine the optimal concentration that produced growth of inducible isolates while inhibiting that of isolates without the inducible phenotype. A concentration of clindamycin of 0.5 mg/liter with erythromycin at 1 mg/liter was the optimal combination for detection of inducible resistance and resulted in a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 97.9 to 100) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 93.0 to 100). Attention must be paid to ensuring that a sufficient inoculum has been used, since an inoculum below the standard 10(7) bacteria/ml may result in false-negative results. This method has been incorporated into routine use in our laboratory.
