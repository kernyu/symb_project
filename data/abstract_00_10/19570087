BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. Depending on the parasite species and host response, the disease presents itself in different clinical forms. The cutaneous form of the disease is most common in the Old World. Pentavalent antimonials in the form of an injection represent the most widely used therapy for all clinical forms of the disease. As a result of reports on the development of resistance from various parts of the world, we thought it pertinent to determine its response in our region. METHODS: Two hundred and seven military personnel with cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania major, were treated with glucantime according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended protocol. All patients were nonindigenous to the area and had moved from a nonendemic area to a highly endemic area. RESULTS: Thirty-seven per cent of patients were cured within 15 days. The cure percentage reached 81% when 20 mg/kg/day was continued to 20 days. Twenty-five patients who failed to respond were subjected to a further course of glucantime injection. Sixteen responded by the 10th day of treatment, and the remaining nine were cured by completion of the second course, i.e. within 40 days. The drug was administered intramuscularly. The common side-effects noted were vertigo, headache, anorexia, temperature, and joint pain. CONCLUSION: Glucantime is still effective against Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis when used in the doses recommended by WHO.
