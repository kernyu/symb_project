TRAP-1 is a mitochondrial heat shock protein (HSP), recently identified in Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells adapted to mild oxidative stress induced by diethylmaleate (DEM). TRAP-1 mRNA expression is increased in DEM-adapted cells as well as in tumor cells resistant to 5-fluorouracil and to platin derivatives. Since a strong decrease of TRAP-1 protein levels, upon cisplatin treatment, is observed only in controls but not in the DEM-adapted counterpart, a possible role for this protein in the development of resistant phenotypes could be hypothesized. To characterize the protective role of TRAP-1 against oxidative stress and apoptosis, stable transfectants were generated and characterized for their response to different stress types. These stable clones expressing constitutively high TRAP-1 levels: (i) are more resistant to H2O2-induced DNA damage and to apoptosis by cisplatin; (ii) contain higher reduced glutathione (GSH) levels than control cells; and (iii) do not release the apoptosis-inducing factor into the nucleus upon cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, high TRAP-1 levels interfere with caspase 3 activation. These results confirm the anti-apoptotic role of TRAP-1, and suggest that increased expression of this mitochondrial HSP in DEM-adapted and chemoresistant cells could be part of a pro-survival signaling pathway aimed to evade toxic effects of oxidants and anticancer drugs.
