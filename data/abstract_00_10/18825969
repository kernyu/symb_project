Heat shock (45 degrees C) and the effect of oxidants (H2O2) resulted in a decrease of the respiratory activity of yeast cells and their survival rate. Increased resistance to stress effects after mild heat treatment (37 degrees C) or treatment with a nonlethal dose of oxidants (0.5 mM H2O2 for 60 min) was accompanied by appearance of an alternative (cyanide-resistant) oxidative pathway in the mitochondria, which promotes survival due to retention of the capacity for ATP synthesis in the first coupling point at the level of endogenous NADH dehydrogenase. The alternative oxidative pathway is more resistant to the effect of stressors that disrupt electron transfer in the cytochrome site of the respiratory chain.
