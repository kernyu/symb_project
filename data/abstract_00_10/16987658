The synthesis, structure, and biological evaluation of a series of novel rifamycin derivatives, Rifastures (RFA) with potent anti-tuberculosis activity are presented. Some of these derivatives showed higher in vitro activity than rifabutin and rifampicin against not only Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains but also against MAC and Mycobacterium kansasii.
