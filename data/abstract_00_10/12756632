Thirty-one ears (16 dogs) with otitis externa originating from bacterial or yeast infections were enrolled in a study to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of an ear cleanser containing 2.5% lactic acid and 0.1% salicylic acid for the treatment of infectious otitis externa. The affected ears were treated with the ear cleanser twice daily for 2 weeks and evaluated after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment. The ear cleanser was effective in resolution of infection in 67.7% of the ears, and clinical signs of infectious otitis externa were significantly reduced within 2 weeks.
