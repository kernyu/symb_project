Fourteen quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas putida isolates were recovered from imported frozen shrimp sold in the United States. Two isolates harbored plasmids with qnrA and qnrB genes. PCR and DNA sequencing of quinolone resistance-determining regions identified novel substitutions in GyrA (His139-->Glu and Thr128-->Ala) and GyrB (Thr442-->Asn, Gly470-->Ala, and Ile487-->Pro) and previously reported substitutions in GyrB (Asp489-->Glu) and ParC (Thr105-->Pro).
