Human nontyphoidal Salmonella infections are the primary cause of foodborne disease in developed countries, resulting in considerable morbidity and occasionally death, especially in immunocompromised patients. Strains of Salmonella that are resistant to antimicrobial agents have become a world-wide health problem. Fluoroquinolones are drugs of choice for treatment of human invasive salmonellosis, and have been useful for the treatment of infections caused by multi-resistant strains. However, strains resistant to ciprofloxacin have been noted. A random sample of 378 Salmonella strains of human origin was collected during 1998. Their susceptibility to 11 antimicrobial agents was determined by the agar dilution method according to NCCLS standards. In total, 38 serotypes were represented of which S. Enteritidis (20.4%), S. Typhimurium (20.4%), S. Hadar (9.0%), S. Brandenburg (7.9%), S. Infantis (7.7%), and S. Virchow (5.3%) were the most common. All strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. For nalidixic acid the rate of resistance was 19.0%. Of the 72 strains resistant to nalidixic acid, 31 were S. Hadar, and thus 91.2% (31/34) of the S. Hadar isolates showed resistance to nalidixic acid. Most of the S. Hadar strains were also resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulphamethoxazole, and an elevated MIC50 (0.25 microgram/ml) and MIC90 (1 microgram/ml) was observed for ciprofloxacin. The high rate of resistance to nalidixic acid can be a first step towards the development of resistance to ciprofloxacin.
