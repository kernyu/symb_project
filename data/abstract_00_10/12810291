From 1995 to 2001, Enterococcus faecium isolates were collected from broiler flocks at slaughter and broiler meat products at retail outlets and were tested for susceptibility to classes of antimicrobials used for growth promotion in broilers in Denmark, namely: evernimicin, glycopeptide, macrolide and streptogramin. By February 1998, all antimicrobial growth promoters (AGPs) were withdrawn from the Danish broiler production. The present study investigates, by logistic regression analyses, the (1) changes in the occurrence of AGP resistance among E. faecium from broilers and broiler meat from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 2001 and (2) relations between the occurrence of AGP resistance among E. faecium isolates from Danish broilers and AGP resistance among E. faecium isolates from the broiler meat of Danish and unknown origin collected in the same quarter within the year. In the present study, we showed that after the AGP withdrawal, a significant decline in resistance to avilamycin, erythromycin, vancomycin and virginiamycin was observed among E. faecium from broilers and broiler meat. In addition, a decline in the occurrence of AGP resistance among E. faecium from Danish broilers was associated with a decrease in the predicted probability of isolating an AGP-resistant E. faecium isolate from a randomly selected broiler meat product. In the analyses "relations between the occurrence of AGP resistance among E. faecium isolated from broilers and broiler meat collected in the same quarter" errors in the explanatory variable were expected. Therefore, a simulation study was performed to validate the results from logistic regression analyses. The results obtained by the two methods were similar.
