OBJECTIVES: We described clinical features of pulmonary Mycobacterium scofulaceum disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We described 15 cases of pulmonary Mycobacterium scrofulaceum infection admitted to National Hospital Organization Omuta National Hospital from 1989 to 2003 and reviewed the clinical feature, the findings of chest radiograph, and clinical course. RESULTS: Sex ratio was 8 male cases and 7 female cases, and the average age was 65.9 years old. Smoking history was found in 8 patients and occupational history of the dust inhalation was found in 7 patients with pulmonary M. scrofulaceum infection. There were 11 cases of tuberculosis-like form and 4 cases of nodular-bronchiectasis form according to the NTM Research society classification based on the findings of chest radiography. Improvement of the findings of chest radiography was seen in 4 patients by therapy, while no change or aggravation in 11 patients. Five patients died and among them, 3 died due to aggravation of pulmonary M. scrofulaceum infection. DISCUSSION: Cases showing tuberculosis-like form were dominant, and most of them showed extensive lesions when they were diagnosed, and these facts were considered to be major factors of difficulty in the treatment of this infection. The facts that 7 cases had occupational exposure to the dust, obstructive pulmonary disease in 3 cases, and 6 cases showed sputum culture positive for other nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, suggest that local resistance of lung might be attenuated, and this could be one of factors of onset and development of this infection. Only 4 cases showed improvement, while 5 cases died (primary disease death in 3 cases) and it was thought that the prognosis of the disease was in general poor.
