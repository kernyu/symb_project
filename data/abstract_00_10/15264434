The management of antiretroviral-experienced and -naive HIV-infected patients is becoming increasingly complex with the emergence of multidrug-resistant viruses and with the inter-relationships between numerous virological, immunological and therapeutic factors. In addition to standard surrogate markers of peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts and plasma viral loads, viral resistance phenotype, replication capacity and genotype assays serve as objective measures of viral properties, which presumably reflect, to a certain degree, what is occurring in vivo. This review explores the principles behind, and the basic science and clinical evidence supporting the application of viral resistance phenotypic assays and replication capacity assays in the therapeutic management of HIV disease.
