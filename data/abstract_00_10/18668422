The in vitro antifungal activities of micafungin in comparison to caspofungin, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B were evaluated against 93 Candida and 23 Aspergillus isolates recovered from pediatric patients with fungal infections. MICs were determined by the CLSI M27-A2 and M38-A for Candida and Aspergillus species, respectively. Micafungin showed potent activity against Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata with a MIC range of <= 0.002 to 0.015mug/ml. In contrast, micafungin demonstrated higher MIC levels against Candida parapsilosis with a MIC range of 0.12 to 2 mug/ml. Micafungin showed potent antifungal activity against Aspergillus species tested with a MIC range of 0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml. Overall, micafungin had excellent in vitro antifungal activities against Candida and Aspergillus species recovered from pediatric patients with fungal infections.
