This study evaluated the effect of a (4.5 kV/cm, 50 Hz) static electric field (SEF) on pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with multiple antibiotic resistance. The bacteria were grown overnight at 37 degrees C in a nutrient broth medium, then inoculated in 5 mL fresh nutrient broth medium and incubated for 2 h at 25 degrees C with continuous shaking at 190 rpm. 10 x colony-forming units/mL of these bacteria were subjected to a 4.5 kV/cm, 50 Hz, SEF for various time periods. The effects of 5 different SEF exposure times (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min) on the bacteria were evaluated by the plate count agar method. The growth percentages of SEF treatment groups were significantly less than that of the control group. Inactivation significantly increased with the duration of SEF exposure. The results indicate that growth inhibition by SEF in the Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, was greater than that in the Gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus. This study has demonstrated the antimicrobial effects of SEF treatment on 2 important pathogens, suggesting its potential for application as a method for controlling microbial population growth within in a variety of environments.
