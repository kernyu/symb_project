Chronic periodontitis is the most common type of periodontitis and it is associated with various species of microorganisms. Enteric rods, Pseudomonas, Staphyloccocus and Candida have been retrieved from periodontal pockets of patients with chronic periodontitis and correlated to cases of superinfection. Local or systemic antibiotic therapy is indicated to reinforce the effects of the conventional mechanical therapy. Minocycline has been suggested as one of the most effective drugs against periodontal pathogens. The aim of this work was to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of minocycline on superinfecting microorganisms isolated from the periodontal pocket and the oral cavity of individuals with chronic periodontitis. Isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 25), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 9) and Candida spp. (n = 25) were included in the study. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of minocycline were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar dilution method. Staphylococcus spp. isolates were the most sensitive to minocycline with a MIC of 8 microg/mL, followed by Enterobacteriaceae with a MIC of 16 microg/mL. The concentration of 16 microg/mL inhibited 96% of Candida spp. isolates. The MIC for 88.8% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 128 microg/mL. A concentration of 1,000 microg/mL was not enough to inhibit 100% of the tested isolates.
