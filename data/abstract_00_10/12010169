Recent studies have highlighted the emergence of infections involving multiresistant Acinetobacter clinical isolates. Sulbactam offers direct antimicrobial activity against Acinetobacter species. Accordingly, co-administration of sulbactam with ampicillin or cefoperazone offers the potential of effective empirical therapy against Acinetobacter and other bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae in institutions in which they are susceptible. Many in vitro studies have indicated that Acinetobacter remains fully susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam or cefoperazone-sulbactam. Furthermore, ampicillin-sulbactam has proven clinically effective and well tolerated in the treatment of severe acinetobacter infections, including bacteremia. Therefore, ampicillin-sulbactam is a sensible option for the treatment of life-threatening acinetobacter infections.
