Growth inhibitors are an integral part of the regulatory mechanisms involved in the growth and differentiation of cells and tissues. Aberration in the response to growth inhibitors leads to the escape of the cell from the cell cycle control mechanisms and may lead to the development of malignancies. The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, activation of oncogenes leads to the acquisition of an invasive and increasingly malignant immunophenotype and secretory profile by transformed cells. The commencement of the complex process of carcinogenesis, and subsequent, rapid tumor growth and progression of mammalian neoplasms depends upon the continuous de novo formation of capillaries (angiogenesis). The generation of a malignant, invasive cellular immunophenotype (CIP) and distant metastases, as aspects of tumor progression, are also NRA-dependent processes. Specific molecules with cytostatic/cytotoxic growth inhibitory effects represent a very diverse group of factors. Growth inhibitors may regulate the cell cycle at various levels, and growth inhibitors comprise a heterogeneous group of agents including cytokines, growth factors, steroid hormones, etc. The phenomenon of multidrug resistance to a wide spectrum of cytostatic/cytotoxic agents has posed a major difficulty in the effective chemotherapeutical treatment of cancer patients. The development of novel therapeutic regimens should be based on the observations of the growth inhibitory profile of the particular malignancy, in addition to its immunophenotype and genotype, and the devisement of 'individualized' combinations of factors, including gene and immuno-therapeutical options, targeting different aspects of the malignant disease.
