Lipophilic species of Corynebacterium are increasing problem in hospital infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate occurrence of these microorganisms in the materials taken from patients in the day of admission and during the hospitalization as well as comparison of their antibiotic sensitivity. The investigation included 65 strains isolated from hospitalized patients and 48 strains isolated from unchanged skin. Using Api Coryne test 5 species were identified. C. urealyticum dominated, the other were C. subsp. lipophilum and C. jeikeium. Among strains isolated from unchanged diseased skin the most C. jeikeium and C. accolens occurred. All strains were sensitive to glycopeptide, quinupristin/dalphopristin. The strains isolated from hospitalized patients were usually sensitive to fuside acid, doxycycline as well as tetracycline. Strains isolated from unchanged skin were sensitive to almost all tested antibiotics. In the group of 65 strains isolated from hospitalized patients 99.0% were multiresistant. In the group of strains isolated from unchanged skin only two strains were multiresistant. Differences in antibiotic sensitivity among analysed Corynebacterium sp. were confirmed. Majority of the "hospital strains" were characterized by multiresistance. Basing on these results it is possible to suppose, that multiresistance is main factor that favours lipophilic Corynebacterium species in the process of colonization of mucous membranes, skins as well as developing infections.
