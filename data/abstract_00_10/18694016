Antimicrobial resistance is an important patient safety issue related to inappropriate antibiotic use. As part of the Infobutton project, we examined antibiotic prescribing-related information needs of clinicians using CPOE. During 3 hours of observation, 20 information needs were observed, 74% were met. Understanding the information needs of clinicians related to antibiotic prescribing may help identify methods to meet information needs via the Infobutton manager and thereby improve the judicious use of antibiotics.
