Emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem and a public health threat. New drugs must be designed with emerging needs in mind: specific resistant and hard-to-treat organisms. But the difficulty to find real new drugs is a major problem. Only the oxazolidinones, the cationic peptides and the lipopeptide antibiotics can be truly regarded as structurally novel drugs, although the peptide deformylase inhibitors and, possibly, the pleuromutilins can be considered a potential advancement in the field. Obviously, these antibiotics must be reserved only to cases of documented ineffectiveness of the common antimicrobial agents.
