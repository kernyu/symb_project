We analyzed Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in Gifu prefecture between September and October 2004. We conducted antimicrobial susceptibility test for 266 strains isolated from 8 medical institutes and 1 clinical laboratory, based on broth microdilution method. The MIC50 and MIC90 of piperacillin, amikacin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin were 4 and 64, 4 and 8, 1 and 16, 0.25 and 8 microg/mL, respectively. The strains isolated from urine had higher MIC level in comparison with from sputum, which was remarkable in penicillins, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. We isolated 7 strains of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP), in which 3 strains showed under 16 microg/mL in MIC against anti-MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) drug arbekacin. Continuous surveillance would be needed for antimicrobial resistance on P. aeruginosa in Gifu prefecture.
