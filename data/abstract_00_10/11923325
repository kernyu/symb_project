We characterized baseline and repopulating stool isolates recovered during a phase II trial of ramoplanin for the treatment of patients with stool carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Repopulation with a strain with a related genotype was found in 74, 60, and 53% of individuals in groups treated with placebo, 100 mg of ramoplanin, and 400 mg of ramoplanin, respectively. All ramoplanin-treated patients with a culture positive for VRE at day 7 had a relapse caused by a genotypically related isolate. In ramoplanin-treated patients, antibiotics with activities against anaerobic organisms were associated with positive cultures on day 7 (relative risk [RR] = 8.8; P = 0.004), and the avoidance of such antibiotics was significantly associated with culture negativity through day 21 (RR = 0.16; P = 0.02).
