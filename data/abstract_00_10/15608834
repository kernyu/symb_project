INTRODUCTION: To determine the oropharyngeal carriage rates and serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis in primary school children in Manisa, Turkey as well as the prevalence and penicillin resistance of N. meningitidis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Throat swabs obtained from 1128 children were cultured and recovered organisms were tested by disk diffusion method and the E-test for antimicrobial susceptibilities. RESULTS: The carriage rate of N. meningitidis in our region was 6.2% (71 strains) and the serogroups identified were serogroups A (28.1%), B (22.5%), C (35.2%), D (2.8%) and W-135 (11.2%). Penicillin resistance was found in 16 strains (22.5%), while beta-lactamase activity was found in none. CONCLUSIONS: The carriage rate of N. meningitidis and serogroups are similar to the rates reported in other countries. Continued surveillance of meningococci for antimicrobial resistance will allow early detection of changes in susceptibility patterns that might affect recommendations for chemoprophylaxis as well as for treatment.
