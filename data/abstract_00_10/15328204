Resistance to cytotoxic nucleoside analogues is a major problem in cancer treatment. The cellular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon have been studied for several years, and some factors have been identified. Various strategies to overcome resistance have been suggested, but none has yet shown efficacy in vivo. We developed a gemcitabine-resistant cell line (L1210 10K) from the murine leukemic L1210 strain (L1210 wt) by continuous exposure to increasing concentrations of gemcitabine. L1210 10K is highly resistant to gemcitabine (14,833-fold), 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C; 2,100-fold), troxacitabine (>200-fold), and cladribine (160-fold) and slightly resistant to trimidox (7.22-fold), but does not display cross-resistance to fludarabine or nonnucleoside anticancer drugs. Deoxycytidine kinase mRNA was not detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR in L1210 10K cells, whereas expression of thymidine kinase 1 and ribonucleotide reductase subunit R2 gene was moderately reduced. L1210 10K cells also demonstrated in vivo resistance to nucleoside analogues: gemcitabine- or ara-C-treated mice carrying L1210 10K had significantly shorter survival than gemcitabine- or ara-C-treated mice carrying L1210 wt (P < 0.05). UA911, a mononucleotide prodrug (pronucleotide) of ara-C was found to significantly sensitize L1210 10K cells in vitro. These results suggest that reduced deoxycytidine kinase expression is a mechanism of resistance to gemcitabine that is relevant in vivo and can be circumvented by a prodrug approach.
