We determined the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance among the isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 605 pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Shanghai, China. Mutations in gyrA were found in 81.5% of phenotypically fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates and were used as a molecular marker of fluoroquinolone resistance. gyrA mutations were detected in 1.9% of strains pan-susceptible to first-line drugs and 25.1% of multidrug-resistant strains. Fluoroquinolone resistance was independently associated with resistance to at least one first-line drug and prior tuberculosis treatment.
