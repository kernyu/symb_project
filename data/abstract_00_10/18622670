Any increase in beta-lactam-resistant Haemophilus influenzae is a serious problem in respiratory and otolaryngology medicine. In this study, we examined the antibiotic susceptibility and genotype of 457 clinical Haemophilus influenzae strains isolated in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. Strains with beta-lactam-resistant mutations in gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 3 were more frequently found in lower respiratory tract specimens (sputa) than in upper respiratory tract specimens, such as rhinorrhea. The existence of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase gene occurred more frequently in adult patients than in pediatric patients. The results suggest that beta-lactam-resistant or nonsusceptible strains are more prevalent in adult patients with respiratory diseases. We observed only a very few strains which were nonsuscpetible to third-generation cephalosporins (CEPs) and carbapenems. However, 12%-13% of the strains were shown to be resistant to penicillins and second-generation CEPs, and approximately 4% of the strains were shown to be nonsusceptible to fourth-generation CEPs. In addition, we identified tetracycline-resistant (2.8%), chloramphenicol-resistant (0.6%), clarithromycin-resistant (2.6%), and fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible (approximately 2%) H. influenzae strains.
