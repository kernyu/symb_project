Immunomodulating activity of panaxanes--polysaccharides isolated from the roots and culture of Panax ginseng was studied. Effects of both preparations were analogous. Profilaxy use of panaxanes provided increased resistance to coli-sepsis in mice, increased neutrophiles and macrophages phagocytosis, stimulated humoral and cell immune factors and induced important regulating cytokins--interferone gamma and tumor necrosis factor.
