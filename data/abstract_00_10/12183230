Chryseobacterium gleum (previously included in the Flavobacterium IIb species) is a gram-negative aerobe that is a source of nosocomial infections. An Ambler class B beta-lactamase gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli from reference strain C. gleum CIP 103039 that had reduced susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems. The purified beta-lactamase, CGB-1, with a pI value of 8.6 and a determined relative molecular mass of ca. 26 kDa, hydrolyzed penicillins; narrow- and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins; and carbapenems. CGB-1 was a novel member of the molecular subclass B1 of metallo-enzymes. It had 83 and 42% amino acid identity with IND-1 from Chryseobacterium indologenes and BlaB from C. meningosepticum, respectively. Thus, in addition to the previously characterized clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase CGA-1 of Ambler class A, C. gleum produces a very likely chromosome-borne class B beta-lactamase.
