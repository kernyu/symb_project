The paper presents the results of determination of sensitivity of 154 gonococcal strains isolated from the patients, who were treated at the clinic of the Urals Research Institute of Dermatovenereology and Immunopathology and the Sverdlovsk Regional and Yekaterinburg City Dermatovenereological Dispensaries in 2001-2003, to penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, sparfloxacin, and moxifloxacin. It also shows the preponderance of moderately penicillin-resistant gonococci (75.3%) and their trend towards their transformation to resistant strains, tetracycline-resistant (74.0%), ciprofloxacin-sensitive (89%), and ceftriaxone-sensitive (82.5%) strains, as well as the absence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistant to spectinomycin, sparfloxacin, and moxifloxacin.
