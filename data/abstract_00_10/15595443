The total synthesis of the polyene (-)-stipiamide has enabled the design and synthesis of new multi-drug resistance (MDR) reversal agents. MDR is a common clinical condition caused by overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transport protein that can dramatically lower the cellular concentration of antitumor drugs. Various non-toxic, truncated 6,7-acetylene analogs of stipiamide have been synthesized individually and in solution-phase libraries, and as a result potent compounds have been identified for MDR reversal, and P-gp-binding and inhibition. Potency and P-gp inhibition have also been explored using polyethylene glycol-linked polyene homodimers.
