We tested the activity of anidulafungin against 30 Candida albicans isolates. The planktonic MICs for 50 and 90% of the isolates tested (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) were < or =0.03 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively (MIC range, < or =0.03 to 2 microg/ml). The sessile MIC(50) and MIC(90) were < or =0.03 and < or =0.03 microg/ml, respectively (MIC range, < or =0.03 to >16 microg/ml).
