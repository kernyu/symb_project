A panel of 388 salmonellas of animal and human origin, comprising 35 serotypes, was tested for resistance to cyclohexane and to a range of antibiotics, disinfectants and dyes. Cyclohexane resistance was detected in 41 isolates (10.6%): these comprised members of the serovars Binza (1 of 15), Dublin (1 of 24), Enteritidis (1 of 61), Fischerkietz (4 of 5), Livingstone (9 of 11), Montevideo (1 of 32), Newport (4 of 23), Saint-paul (1 of 3), Senftenberg (10 of 24) and Typhimurium (9 of 93). Most (39 of 41) of the cyclohexane-resistant isolates were from poultry. Statistical analysis showed that the cyclohexane-resistant strains were significantly more resistant than the cyclohexane-susceptible strains to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, trimethoprim, cetrimide and triclosan. The multiresistance patterns seen were typical of those caused by efflux pumps, such as AcrAB. The emergence of such resistance may play an important role in the overall antibiotic resistance picture of Salmonella, with particular effect on ciprofloxacin.
