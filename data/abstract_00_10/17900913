Our structure-based design strategies which specifically target the HIV-1 protease backbone, resulted in a number of exceedingly potent nonpeptidyl inhibitors. One of these inhibitors, darunavir (TMC114), contains a privileged, structure-based designed high-affinity P2 ligand, 3(R),3a(S),6a(R)-bis-tetrahydrofuranylurethane (bis-THF). Darunavir has recently been approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients harboring multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants that do not respond to previously existing HAART regimens.
