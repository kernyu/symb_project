We report the first 2 cases of bacterial keratitis resistant to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). The first patient had Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis after PRK despite treatment with moxifloxacin. The second patient was on gatifloxacin post-LASIK when she had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) keratitis diagnosed. In both cases, culture susceptibilities showed isolates resistant to moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, and treatment with topical aminoglycosides and surgical intervention was necessary to effect a cure. These cases show the potential limitations in the coverage of these antibiotics.
