Among 55 preserved isolates collected in northern Taiwan from 1999 through 2003, ciprofloxacin resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration, >or=1 microg/mL) was found in 1 (25%) of 4 isolates obtained in 1999-2000 and in 27 (93.1%) of 29 isolates obtained in 2003. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that several clones predominated among the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates.
