OBJECTIVES: The application of Central Venous Catheters (CVC) is associated with increased risk of microbial colonization and infection. The aim of present study was to assess the frequency of pathogens colonizing CVC and to determine their susceptibility pattern to various antimicrobial agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 253 samples of CVC from intensive care units (ICU) patients were received for culture during 2003. All microorganisms were identified by standard microbiological methods and the susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was determined according to NCCLS recommendations. RESULTS: A total of 184 (72.7%) cultures were positive and 223 pathogens were isolated. Coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) were the dominant isolates (24.7%), followed by Enterobacter spp. (12.1%), Pseudomonas spp. (11.7%), Enterococcus spp. (9.9%), Klebsiella spp. (8.6%), Candida spp. (7.6%), Acinetobacter spp. (7.6%), other Gram negative nonfermentative bacilli (5.8%), Serratia spp. (4.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (2.2%), E. coli (1.8%) and Citrobacter spp. (0.9%). Meropenem (84.5%) and vancomycin (100%) remain the most effective antimicrobial agents against Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, respectively. CONCLUSION: Gram negative bacilli and CNS are the commonest microorganisms colonizing CVC from ICU patients. The increasing resistance of the bacteria to antimicrobial agents is the major problem in spite of restricted policy of using antimicrobial agents in ICU.
