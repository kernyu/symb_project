OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dentists' prescription writing patterns and their appreciation of the characteristics of antibiotics. DESIGN: Evaluation of drug prescriptions written over a six-month period. SETTING: Dental Hospital, Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Retrospective analysis of 313 prescriptions written by dentists attending to outpatient dental patients. RESULTS: The total number of drugs on one prescription ranged from one to seven with Penicillins being the most commonly prescribed drug. Some prescriptions were found to be incorrect with regards to dose, frequency, and duration. Instructions as to the best time of administering drugs with regards to meals were not stated in any prescription. CONCLUSION: Improvement through continuing education is desired on the part of prescribers to ensure a good standard of care and avoid practices that may increase antimicrobial resistance. Drug information services including side effects and drug interactions for professionals and consumers at the hospital is highly desirable.
