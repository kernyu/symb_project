OBJECTIVE: A multicenter study was conducted to obtain "in vitro" chloramphenicol and colistin susceptibility data on multiresistant hospital bacterial pathogens in Slovak Republic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the period of April-June 2001, 628 clinical bacterial multiresistant isolates from patients with serious infections were selected in 10 hospitals and tested to a large scale of antibiotics by means of a microdilution method. The strains expressed either a significant resistance phenotype (ESBL, MRSA, CoNMRS, MLSB/c, efflux in Ps. aeruginosa), or were resistant to one or more preparations in at least half of reliable unrelated antibiotic groups (beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolons, macrolides). RESULTS: Both chloramphenicol and colistin retained significant "in vitro" activity against many multiresistant hospital bacterial pathogens. The highest activity of chloramphenicol was documented for isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (76,5 % susceptible, MIC50 = 4 mg/L, MIC90 = 16 mg/L) and of Staphylococcus aureus (76,2 % susceptible, MIC50 = 8 mg/L, MIC90 = 16 mg/L). In tested Pseudomonas aeruginosa (82,5 % susceptible, MIC50 = 2 mg/L, MIC90 = 16 mg/L) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (88,2 % susceptible, MIC50 = 1 mg/L, MIC90 = 8 mg/L) isolates colistin represented the most "in vitro" effective antibiotic. Colistin was the only "in vitro" effective antimicrobial in four of 120 multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested in our study. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed a good "in vitro" susceptibility of many multiresistant hospital bacterial pathogens to chloramphenicol and colistin in Slovak Republic. The clinical application of chloramphenicol and colistin might be reconsidered in infections caused by extremely resistant bacteria with prooved susceptibility to these antibiotics. It is important to consider, that the infection danger has to exceed the risk of antibiotic toxicity.
