OBJECTIVE: To determine the status of programs to improve antimicrobial prescribing at select US hospitals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Pharmacy and infection control staff at all 47 hospitals participating in phase 3 of Project Intensive Care Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology. RESULTS: All 47 hospitals had some programs to improve antimicrobial use, but the practices reported varied considerably. All used a formulary, and 43 (91%) used it in conjunction with at least one of the other three antimicrobial-use policies evaluated: stop orders, restriction, and criteria-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). CPGs were reported most commonly (70%), followed by stop orders (60%) and restriction policies (40%). Although consultation with an infectious disease physician (70%) or pharmacist (66%) was commonly used to influence initial antimicrobial choice, few (40%) reported a system to measure compliance with these consultations. CONCLUSIONS: In most hospitals surveyed, practices to improve antimicrobial use, although present, were inadequate based on recommendations in a Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and Infectious Disease Society of America joint position paper. There is room to improve antimicrobial-use stewardship at US hospitals.
