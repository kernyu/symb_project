Forty-three patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at National Chiba-Higashi Hospital were studied retrospectively. TB cases excreting tubercle bacilli which are resistant to both 0.1 microgram/ml of isoniazid and 50 micrograms/ml of rifampicin were defined as multidrug-resistant cases. From 1993 to 1997, we experienced 1627 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, and among them 43 patients (23-79 years old, 35 males and 8 females) were proved to be multidrug-resistant. Six cases were initially treated cases and other 37 cases had been treated previously. On admission, 40 out of 43 cases (93.0%) were smear positive by sputum examination of mycobacteria and 38 out of 43 cases (88.4%) had cavitary lesions on chest X-ray. Six patients were complicated with diabetes mellitus, two with cancer, one with alcohol dependence, one with chronic hepatitis, and others did not have prominent complications. Three operated patients were cured, the fact shows that the surgical treatment is still a useful measure for cases with the indication. Sixteen patients were cured, eight were still under treatment, and thirteen were died of tuberculosis. One of reasons of poor prognosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is that multidrug-resistant tubercle bacilli are usually resistant to other drugs, too. In case of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, patients were obliged to be treated in a hospital long-term to prevent the spread of tubercle bacilli. Therefore, it is very important to find out new tuberculosis cases as an early as possible, treat them with proper regimen and prevent dropout by directly observed therapy, thus preventing the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Development of new antituberculous agents is strongly expected.
