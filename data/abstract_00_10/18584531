Prophylaxis and treatment with antiretroviral drugs, a consequent low viral load, and the use of elective Caesarean section, are factors that radically decrease the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child during pregnancy and delivery. The availability of new antiretroviral drugs, updated general treatment guidelines and increasing knowledge of the importance of drug resistance, have necessitated recurrent revisions of the recommendations for 'Prophylaxis and treatment of HIV-1 infection in pregnancy'. For these reasons, The Swedish Reference Group for Antiviral Therapy (RAV) has, at an expert meeting on May 4, 2007, once more updated the treatment recommendations of 1999, 2002 and 2005, which were defined in cooperation with the Swedish Medical Products Agency (Lakemedelsverket). This new text takes the recently updated general HIV treatment recommendations into account. Furthermore, the very low risk of HIV transmission when the mother is treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, has undetectable levels of viraemia and no obstetric risk factors, has been considered in the recommendations concerning the mode of delivery. Finally, the recommendations for monitoring of infants born to HIV-infected mothers have been modified. The recommendations are evidence graded in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, 2001 (see http://www.cebm.net/levels_of_evidence.asp#levels).
