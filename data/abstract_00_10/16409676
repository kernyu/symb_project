Quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (QRNG) have not been reported from Pakistan to date. This is the first report of the presence of QRNG in Pakistan. The study was performed at a tertiary care hospital laboratory in Karachi, Pakistan. Antimicrobial susceptibility data on all N. gonorrhoeae isolated between 1992 and 2002 were retrieved and analysed. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of QRNG isolated in year 2002 were performed, and clinical information was collected. QRNG was first noted in 1999 and its proportion increased to 42% in 2002. MICs of the 12 isolates tested in 2002 showed a high level of resistance to ofloxacin with MIC of more than 4 microg/mL. Clinical information from patients with QRNG showed treatment failure. Emergence of QRNG in developing countries is alarming as there is no proper surveillance of increase in resistance. We strongly urge the need of detection and documentation of the resistant gonococcal isolates, as in vitro resistance is associated with clinical failure.
