Five sequential Cryptococcus neoformans isolates recovered from an AIDS patient with recurrent meningitis were analyzed. Four isolates were fluconazole susceptible, while the fifth isolate developed fluconazole resistance. Analysis of the 14-alpha lanosterol demethylase gene (ERG11) showed a point mutation in the resistant strain responsible for the amino acid substitution G484S.
