OBJECTIVE: To analyze drug resistance status of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the two-drug regimens in laboratory and clinical settings for more appropriate application of antibiotics. METHODS: The laboratory data of drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified with Biomerieux Vitek 32 system were collected. The clinical two-drug regimen data corresponding to anti-microbial sensitivity test were investigated, and the resistance rate of the clinical two-drug regimen was analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with multi-drug resistance increased steadily in recent years, and the resistance rate to 6 widely used antibiotics increased by over 20%. Two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to all the 6 drugs were identified in January 2004, and till June 2005, totally 18 panresistant strains had been isolated with dramatic increases in MIC value. In the clinical two-drug regimen, sulbactam/amikacin, sulbactam/ciprofloxacin, tazobactam/amikacin, and imipenem/amikacin still had low resistant rates. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to the antibiotics is a serious problem. A two-drug regimen based on anti-microbial susceptibility test should be chosen.
