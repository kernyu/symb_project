BACKGROUND: YM-215389 and YM-228855 are thiazolidenebenzenesulfonamide (TBS) derivatives and novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) that inhibit not only wild-type, but also the K103N- and Y181C-substituted reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV type-1 (HIV-1). METHODS: To characterize the binding modes of the TBS derivatives in detail, the anti-HIV-1 activities of YM-215389 and YM-228855 against various NNRTI-resistant clones were examined. Docking studies with HIV-1 RT were also performed. RESULTS: YM-215389, which effectively inhibits various NNRTI-resistant clones, interacted with L100, K103, V106 and Y318 through the benzene ring and with E138, V179, Y181, Y188 and W229 through the thiazole ring. A single amino acid substitution confers only moderate resistance to YM-215389; indeed, four amino acid substitutions (V106L, V108I, E138K and L214F) were necessary for high-level resistance. Although the activity of YM-228855, a derivative of YM-215389 that has two bulky and rigid cyano-moieties on the benzene ring, was 10x more potent against HIV-1 than YM-215389, its anti-HIV-1 activity was readily reduced with single substitutions as with Y181I and K103N. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide structural information for optimizing the TBS derivatives in an attempt to construct ideal NNRTIs that maintain anti-HIV-1 activity to various HIV-1 variants.
