A total of 342 imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates (IRABs) were collected from 16 Chinese cities. Six predominant clones had spread widely, and four clones were detected in distant hospitals. The majority of the IRABs contain bla(OXA-23), with ISAba1 upstream of the gene. These results suggested that clonal spread played an important role in the outbreak of IRABs in China.
