Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus aureus is an emerging pathogen world-wide, causing necrotizing lung infections in otherwise healthy individuals. We describe 2 episodes of patient-to-patient transmission of Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing S. aureus, resulting in acute, life-threatening pulmonary complications in patients with cystic fibrosis. Appropriate infection control measures may be warranted to prevent similar episodes.
