Aim of the study is to evaluate the anti-ulcer efficacy of the boswellic acids (BA), a triterpenoid known as anti-inflammatory/anti-arthritic agent, which is in clinical use. The reason for the study is that, the known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are full of side effects especially ulceration which is at the top. BA, although, used as an anti-arthritic agent yet it is not only devoid of ulcer production but protective also. The activity evaluation was done by the following universally accepted animal models viz., pyloric ligation, ethanol-HCl, acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin and cold restrained stress-induced ulceration in rats. Results of the present study revealed that BA possess a dose dependent antiulcer effect against different experimental models. It showed different degree of inhibition of the ulcer score towards different ulcerogenic agents. The ulcer score against various ulcer inducing agents viz., pyloric ligation, ethanol/HCl, (acute and chronic) acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin and cold restraint stress, was inhibited by 39%, 38%, 51%, 31%, 37% and 42% respectively at 250mg/kg. From the data it is concluded that BA inhibited ulcer production non-specifically in all the experimental models, whereby, it is not possible to propose a single specific mechanism. Nevertheless it is possible that BA might be acting by increasing the gastric mucosal resistance and local synthesis of cytoprotective prostaglandins and inhibiting the leukotriene synthesis.
