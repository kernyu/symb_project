OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and to provide guidance for clinical antimicrobial strategy. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients in ICU from 2000 to 2003 was monitored by Epsilometer test E (E-test) methods, and at the same time Whonet 5.1 was used to analyse the results. RESULTS: Imipenem had the highest antimicrobial efficiency rate(90.8%), followed by cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, amikacin and ceftazidime. On the other hand, the efficiency rate of the third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone was as low as 42.8%. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing strains accounted for 36.0% in E.coli and 25.0% in K. pneumoniae. Significant difference was found between the resistant rate of ESBLs positive and that of negative strains, except imipenem (all P<0.005). CONCLUSION: Bacterial resistance against antibiotics is still a serious clinical problem among ICU patients, therefore, surveillance of antimicrobial resistance should be strengthened, and the use of the third-generation cephalosporins should be restricted.
