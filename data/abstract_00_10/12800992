The transfer of bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobial agents or resistance genes from animals to humans via the food chain is increasingly a problem. Therefore, it is important to determine the species and the numbers of bacteria involved in this phenomenon. For this purpose, 148 strains of microstaphylococci were isolated from three types of Italian dry fermented sausages. Eight of 148 strains belonged to the genera Kocuria and Micrococcus. The remaining 140 strains belonged to 11 different species of the genus Staphylococcus. The species most frequently isolated was Staphylococcus xylosus, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic resistance levels differed among the species and depended on the strain origin. Microstaphylococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but 12 strains were resistant to methicillin, 8 were resistant to oxacillin, and 9 were resistant to penicillin G. No resistance was observed for aminoglicosides and cephalosporines. Many strains were resistant to sulfonamide, colistin suphate, tetracyclin, and bacitracin. Two strains of S. aureus, four strains of S. xylosus, and one strain of Staphylococcus sciuri were able to grow in the presence of 8 microg of vancomycin per g, but all strains were susceptible to teicoplanin. Twenty-two microstaphylococci were resistant to at least five of the tested antibiotics. The multiresistant strain S. aureus 899 was unaffected by eight antibiotics, including vancomycin and methicillin, indicating that a more prudent use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and better hygienic conditions during production should be encouraged because they can play a major role in reducing the incidence of such multiresistant microorganisms and the possible spread of the genetic elements of their resistance.
