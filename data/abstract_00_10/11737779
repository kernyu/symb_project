Plants activate disease resistance responses when they recognize pathogen-derived molecules (elicitors). Frequently, recognition results in a hypersensitive response (HR), which is characterized by local host cell death at the infection site. Here we describe a genetic engineering approach to generate an HR in plants, whether or not an invading micro-organism produces a recognized elicitor. To that aim we created transgenic tobacco plants in which the pathogen-inducible promoter of the hsr203J gene from tobacco controls the expression of the popA elicitor gene from Ralstonia solanacearum. Because PopA itself also induces the hsr203J promoter, transgenic plants rapidly accumulate the bacterial elicitor in the pathogen infection sites. The elicitor becomes converted in plant tissues into its fully active derivatives PopA1-PopA3, showing that the previously observed processing events are not dependent on the bacterial type III secretion system. The outcome of induced PopA accumulation is a localized HR and a high degree of resistance of the transgenic plants to an oomycete pathogen. The system is functional in hybrids between different tobacco varieties, and we show that the engineered resistance, but not the associated cell death, is dependent on the salicylic acid signalling cascade. Although the approach is powerful in generating oomycete resistance, the induced HR might affect plant health. Its application thus requires a careful selection of individual transgenic lines and trials with various pathogens.
