The drugs currently available for Chagas'disease treatment are unsatisfactory due to limited efficacy and toxic side effects, making the search for more specific pharmacological agents a priority. The components of the Trypanosoma cruzi trypanothione-dependent antioxidant system have been pointed out as potential chemotherapeutic targets for the development of more specific drugs. To work properly, this system must have a current supply of NADPH, provided by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD). Here, we compare two T. cruzi strains, Tulahuen 2 and Y, regarding growth rate, cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase (TcCPX) concentration and pentose phosphate pathway dehydrogenases activities. Tulahuen 2 cells show higher values as compared to the Y strain when the following parameters are compared: TcCPX concentration, resistance to H2O2, growth index and G6PD activity. Different patterns of G6PD and 6PGD activities were observed among strains along the growth curve and when cells were challenged with H2O2. These data reinforce the heterogeneity within T. cruzi populations and also the importance of G6PD in protecting the parasite against reactive oxygen species.
