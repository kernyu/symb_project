A new plasmid-mediated TEM-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, TEM-91, was identified in a ceftazidime-resistant (MIC, >128 microg per ml) Escherichia coli strain isolated in 1996 in Japan. TEM-91 has three amino acid substitutions, R164C, M184T, and E240K, compared with TEM-1 penicillinase. The isoelectric point (pI), K(m), and k(cat) of TEM-91 for ceftazidime were 5.7, 179 microM, and 29.0 s(-1), respectively. The K(i) of clavulanic acid for ceftazidime hydrolysis was 30.3 nM.
