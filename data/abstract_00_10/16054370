The increasing resistance of the malarial parasite to antimalarial drugs is a major contributor to the reemergence of the disease and increases the need for new drug targets. The two aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, from Plasmodium falciparum have recently emerged as potential targets. In an effort to inhibit these hemoglobinases, a series of inhibitors encompassing a basic hydroxyethylamine transition state isostere as a central fragment were prepared. The synthesized compounds were varied in the P1' position and exhibited biological activities in the range of 31 to >2000 nM. To try to rationalize the results, molecular docking and 3D-QSAR analysis were used.
