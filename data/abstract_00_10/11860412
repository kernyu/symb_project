AIM: To evaluate Helicobacter pylori primary resistance and its clinical impact on the efficacy of two lansoprazole-based eradication triple therapies. METHODS: H. pylori-positive patients (n=228) were randomized to receive one of the 1-week regimens: lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxicillin 1 g (LAC), or lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg (LMC), each given twice daily. H. pylori status was assessed by 13C-urea breath test and culture at diagnosis and by 13C-urea breath test 6 weeks after therapy. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by E-test (n=98). RESULTS: The eradication rates with per protocol/ intention-to-treat analyses were: LAC (n=95/114) 83%/69% and LMC (n=96/114) 85%/72%. Primary resistance was 11% for clarithromycin, 41% for metronidazole and 0% for amoxicillin. Eradication in metronidazole-susceptible/-resistant strains was 85%/82% in LAC and 83%/63% in LMC. Significantly lower cure rates were observed in clarithromycin-resistant patients treated with LAC (95% vs. 0%, P < 0.001) and LMC (86% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: One-week LAC and LMC are similarly effective therapies. Clarithromycin resistance significantly affected H. pylori eradication in both regimens.
