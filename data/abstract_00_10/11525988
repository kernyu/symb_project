Pyridine-2,6-dithiocarboxylic acid (pdtc) is a metal chelator produced by Pseudomonas spp. It has been shown to be involved in the biodegradation of carbon tetrachloride; however, little is known about its biological function. In this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of pdtc and the mechanism of its antibiotic activity. The growth of Pseudomonas stutzeri strain KC, a pdtc-producing strain, was significantly enhanced by 32 microM pdtc. All nonpseudomonads and two strains of P. stutzeri were sensitive to 16 to 32 microM pdtc. In general, fluorescent pseudomonads were resistant to all concentrations tested. In competition experiments, strain KC demonstrated antagonism toward Escherichia coli. This effect was partially alleviated by 100 microM FeCl3. Less antagonism was observed in mutant derivatives of strain KC (CTN1 and KC657) which lack the ability to produce pdtc. A competitive advantage was restored to strain CTN1 by cosmid pT31, which restores pdtc production. pT31 also enhanced the pdtc resistance of all pdtc-sensitive strains, indicating that this plasmid contains elements responsible for resistance to pdtc. The antimicrobial effect of pdtc was reduced by the addition of Fe(III), Co(III), and Cu(II) and enhanced by Zn(II). Analyses by mass spectrometry determined that Cu(I):pdtc and Co(III):pdtc2 form immediately under our experimental conditions. Our results suggest that pdtc is an antagonist and that metal sequestration is the primary mechanism of its antimicrobial activity. It is also possible that Zn(II), if present, may play a role in pdtc toxicity.
