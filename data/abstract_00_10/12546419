A series of 7-aminothiadiazolylcephalosporins having a 1-(substituted)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinium group at the C-3' position of the cephem nucleus were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities. Among the cephalosporins prepared in this study, 7beta-[2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl)-2(Z)-ethoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[1-(3-methy laminopropyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridinium-4-yl]methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylate sulfate (S-3578) showed extremely potent broad spectrum activity against both gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and good water solubility.
