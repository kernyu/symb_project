Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) 3-producing Escherichia coli was isolated from a carrier of KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae. The KPC-3 plasmid was identical in isolates of both species. The patient's gut flora contained a carbapenem-susceptible E. coli strain isogenic with the KPC-3-producing isolate, which suggests horizontal interspecies plasmid transfer.
