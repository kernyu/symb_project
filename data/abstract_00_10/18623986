The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of RAPD-PCR and antibiotic susceptibility tests in differentiation of S. typhimurium isolates in Iran. Thirty isolates of S. typhimurium, selected based on animal source; place and time of the isolation and a reference strain of the bacterium were used in this study. Serotyping of the isolates was performed by reliable antisera and confirmed with a multiplex PCR. Genomic DNAs were extracted and subjected to an optimized RAPD-PCR, using two previously reported arbitrary primers (P1254 and 23L). Bacteria were also examined for resistance against 8 antibiotics, using a standard antibiotic susceptibility test. While the antibiotic susceptibility test resulted in the identification of 13 profiles of R-type among the bacterial isolates, application of primers P1254 and 23L in the RAPD-PCR could discriminate the isolates only in four and six profiles respectively. However, combination of the two methods could differentiate the 30 isolates in 20 different profiles. The results of this study indicate that the discriminatory power of RAPD-PCR for S. typhimurium is low but a combination of this method with antibiotic susceptibility test could be considered an easy and relatively reliable discriminatory approach in differentiation of S. typhimurium for epidemiologic purposes in Iran.
