Pyoktanin, a triphenylmethane dye, is known to have a potent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We used pyoktanin for irrigating wounds in 2 cases of mediastinitis and prosthetic graft infection following thoracic aortic surgery. Case 1 is mediastinitis and prosthetic graft infection due to Staphylococcus epidermidis following Cabrol procedure. After irrigating the anterior mediastinum with 0.1% pyoktanin solution twice a day for 8 days, omental transposition was performed, which let to cure of the infection. Case 2 is mediastinitis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis following ascending aortic and aortic arch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. After irrigating the wound with 0.1% pyoktanin solution twice a day for 14 days, the wound was closed primarily, which resulted in cure of the infection of the wound. Using pyoktanin at low concentrations for irrigating wound for a short period of time is considered permissible and effective for mediastinitis and prosthetic graft infection due to Gram-positive bacteria including MRSA.
