Antibiotic resistance and mechanisms involved were studied in Escherichia coli isolates from fecal samples of healthy children. Fifty fecal samples were analyzed, and one colony per sample was recovered and identified by biochemical and molecular tests. Forty-one E. coli isolates were obtained (82%). MIC testing was performed by agar dilution with 18 antibiotics, and the mechanisms of resistance were analyzed. Ampicillin resistance was detected in 24 isolates (58.5%), and blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaOXA type genes were studied by PCR and sequencing. The following beta-lactamases were detected (number of isolates): TEM (20), SHV-1 (1), and OXA-30 (1). The number of aminoglycoside-resistant isolates detected was as follows: streptomycin (15), tobramycin (1), gentamicin (1), and kanamycin (4). The aac(3)-IV gene was detected in the only gentamicin-resistant isolate. Nine (22%) and 2 (5%) isolates showed nalidixic acid (NALR) and ciprofloxacin resistance (CIPR), respectively. Mutations in GyrA and ParC proteins were shown in both NAL(R)-CIP(R) isolates and were the following: (1) GyrA (S83L + D87N), ParC (S801); and (2) GyrA (S83L + A84P), ParC (S80I + A108V). A single mutation in the S83 codon of the gyrA gene was found in the remaining seven NAL(R)-CIP(S) isolates. Tetracycline resistance was identified in 21 isolates (51%) and the following resistance genes were found (number of isolates): tetA (12), tetB (5), and tetD (1). Chloramphenicol resistance was detected in five isolates (12%). These results show that the intestinal tract of healthy children constitutes a reservoir of resistant bacteria and resistance genes.
