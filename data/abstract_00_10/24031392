The study aimed to determine the etiology and antimicrobial resistance of staphylococci isolated from canine pyoderma. Samples were obtained from dogs with pyoderma and isolates were identified by biochemical reactions and tested for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials. Thirty nine staphylococci isolates were obtained, and S. pseudintermedius was the most frequent (47.4%). All isolates showed resistance to at least one drug and 77.1% were multiresistant. The most effective drug was oxacillin. The study reports the alarming antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus isolated from canine pyoderma samples.
