AIM: To evaluate the diversity and antifungal susceptibilities of Candida isolates from wounds and blood of burn victims, and the associated mortality rates compared with those of controls without candidaemia. METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study within a database of clinical data for all patients admitted to our burn unit from January 2001 to December 2005. Each candidaemic patient was compared with two matched controls. Bloodstream cultures were performed if the core temperature was >39 degrees C, and three sites were cultured weekly for fungal identification (burn wound, pharynx, urinary tract). RESULTS: At least one episode of candidaemia was diagnosed among 20 of 851 persons admitted during the study period. Isolates in bloodstream infection were Candida albicans (65%), C. parapsilosis (25%) and C. tropicalis (10%). The median time between admission and onset of candidaemia was greater with C. albicans infection (42.6+/-31 days) than with infection by other yeasts (18+/-12 days). Candidaemia was associated with more extensive burn and longer duration of hospital stay but with similar mortality, compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Candidaemia in burn cases is mostly due to fluconazole-susceptible C. albicans and is not associated with increased mortality.
