The study aimed at specifying the value of two traditional methods of typing, using the collection of 241 strains of Salmonella Enteritidis isolated from people and animals in the Lublin area in 1994-1995 from the occasional cases of infections. There were 8 phage types identified among the examined strains. Phage types PT 6 (40.24% of strains) and PT 7 (29.46%) were the most numerous ones. Salmonella Enteritidis was numbered among 38 profiles on the basis of the analysis of resistance to 15 antimicrobial agents. It was found that nitrofurantoin had the lowest efficacy in vitro in relation to the examined collection of Salmonella isolates. High percentage of strains were characterized by lack of susceptibility to streptomycin, neomycin, cefixime, tetracycline and canamycine. While analyzing the profiles of resistance to chemiotherapeutics and the expression of phage type of the examined strains it was observed that only 14.1% of all strains showing resistance to nitrofurantoin represented at the same time phage type PT 6, whereas 10.8% of strains belonging to the same resistance profile indicated PT 7 phage type. In correlated analysis of resistance to chemiotherapeutics and phage type expression of the examined collection of 241 isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis, 18.3% of strains showed distinct and unique set of these two features, which can be used in epidemiological investigations for the preliminary characterization of the bacterial population.
