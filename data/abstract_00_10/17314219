Amplified fragment length polymorphism genotypes, antibiotic resistance profiles, and toxin profiles of Clostridium difficile strains from Warsaw were determined. The isolates segregate in six major genotypes, coinciding with toxin profiles. Most of the toxin A-negative toxin B-positive toxin CDT-negative strains possess ermB, and several strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Resistograms and toxin types of C. difficile strains are epidemicity determinants.
