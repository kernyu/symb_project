CMY-2 plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (CMY-2) was detected in 21 isolates from two hospitals located in different geographical regions of Spain between October 1999 and December 2000. The isolates comprised two Salmonella enterica serovars (Mikawasima and Montevideo), 16 Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Klebsiella oxytoca and one Proteus mirabilis. In addition to the expected resistance to beta-lactams, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cefoxitin, all isolates showed a broad spectrum of associated resistance. All were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and all but two were also resistant to gentamicin. Five isolates were studied in detail and all transferred CMY-2 and other resistance determinants by conjugation. Genomic DNA restriction pattern analysis of the E. coli isolates excluded the dissemination of a single clone. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that CMY-2 has been detected in P. mirabilis, K. oxytoca and S. enterica serovars Mikawasima and Montevideo. It is also the first time that CMY-2 has been described in Spain.
