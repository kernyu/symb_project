Antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria have become an increasing problem in the last two decades. In order to evaluate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in staphylococcal bloodstream isolates in Germany, 2,042 staphylococci collected in 21 tertiary-care hospitals were investigated during a 3-year period (March 1996 to March 1999). Altogether, 1,448 S. aureus isolates and 594 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) that comprised 13 different species were included. Furthermore, the antistaphylococcal activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin were compared with those of eight other compounds by the broth microdilution method. The rates of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and other CoNS were 13.5, 69, 90, and 34%, respectively. In oxacillin-resistant strains high rates of resistance (up to 100%) to erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were also observed. However, no strain appeared to be resistant to vancomycin or quinupristin-dalfopristin. The streptogramin combination exhibited excellent in vitro activity against all staphylococcal species tested, regardless of the patterns of resistance to other drug classes. In terms of MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited, quinupristin-dalfopristin was 2 times more active against S. aureus isolates, 4 to 16 times more active against S. haemolyticus, and 8 to 32 times more active against S. epidermidis than vancomycin or teicoplanin.
