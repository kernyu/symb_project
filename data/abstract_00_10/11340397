PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of isopropyl unoprostone (referred to as unoprostone) ophthalmic solution on the barrier function of cultured rabbit corneal epithelium grown on permeable supports. METHODS: Rabbit corneal epithelial cells cultured on collagen-coated filter inserts were administered one of the following for 30 min: unoprostone in vehicle solution (polysorbate 80), unoprostone in vehicle solution with a preservative (benzalkonium chloride), preservative only or vehicle only. For a control, no chemicals were added to the medium. After administration, the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) measurement, a sensitive method by which to investigate the barrier function, and morphological observation using phase-contrast microscopy were performed before exposure and at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after exposure. The transmission electron-microscopic observation was performed before and 72 h after exposure in all experimental conditions. RESULTS: The cells exposed to unoprostone with the preservative showed a significant decrease in the TER, although no morphological changes were observed. The corneal epithelial cells exposed to unoprostone without preservative, the vehicle only or the preservative only did not show any differences from the control group at any measurements. CONCLUSION: The corneal barrier function is damaged by a combined solution of unoprostone and preservative, but not by a single solution of unoprostone, in vitro.
