During 1999-2005 we treated 15 patients with linezolid for relevant infections of locomotion apparatus (7 cases with endoprosthesis infection, 5x osteomyelitis and 3x another infection). With the exception of one case the antibiotic therapy was always combined with appropriate surgical intervention. Average period of linezolid administration was 26 d; linezolid was applied from the beginning intravenously on average for 10 d, and then orally for 16 d (average). There were no undesirable effects in the file. Success rate reached 86.6%. MRSA strains were proved by standard methods: growth on Mueller-Hinton agar with increased concentration of NaCl and 2 mg/L of oxacilline, and measuring inhibitory zones around cephoxitine disk. The sensitivity to other antibiotics was specified by disk-diffusion test; that to linezolid was verified by E-test. Linezolid represents a medical reserve for the treatment of multiresistant Gram-positive infections or for emergencies, when allergy onset, high toxicity risk, intolerance, etc. do not allow to use other, in vitro effective, antibiotics.
