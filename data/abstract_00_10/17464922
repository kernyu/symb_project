We sought to develop an infection-resistant urinary catheter. We evaluated 3 types of catheters for their efficacy against uropathogens in an in vitro model of the urinary tract. The catheter impregnated with chlorhexidine and triclosan suppressed the growth of uropathogens, including Proteus mirabilis, for 20-30 days or longer.
