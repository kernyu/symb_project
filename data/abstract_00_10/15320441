THE RISK FACTORS FOR BACTERIAL RESISTANCE: These are recent history of hospitalization and/or antibiotics, notably levofloxacine or macrolides, an increase in severity of the disease, prolonged hospitalization in intensive care before the diagnosis and the existence of decubitus bed sores. THE IMPACT OF MRSA INFECTIONS: Is clinical to start, with a greater mortality rate in MRSA bacteremias than in staphylococcal sensitive, in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections than in enterococcal sensitive infections, and in acquired pneumonia under mechanical ventilation. From an economical point of view, the progression in bacterial resistances in intensive care units has consequences not only on the patients and the hospital but also on the whole of society. TO FIGHT AGAINST NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS: Three measures should be taken: means of prevention must be used, appropriate antibiotic treatments must be administered early and days of hospitalization must be reduced.
