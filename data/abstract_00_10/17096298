Despite advances in pharmaceutical science, considerable unmet medical needs exist in the field of anti-infective therapies. While pharmaceutical companies have focused research efforts on a few selected areas of the field, new microbial diseases have steadily increased in prevalence. Three emerging areas in the field of anti-infectives now represent large commercial opportunities: Gram-negative infections, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Dedication and extensive investment by pharmaceutical companies is required to battle against these emerging and deadly microbial infections.
