OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated, in vitro, the fracture resistance of bovine roots restored with five different intraradicular post systems. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Seventy-five bovine roots of similar dimensions were assigned to five groups (n = 15), according to the intraradicular post system used: cast post and core; titanium post; carbon-fiber post; glass-fiber post; and zirconium-oxide post. Following post cementation, the roots were embedded in polystyrene resin composite and submitted to fracture-resistance testing, with a compressive load at an angle of 135 degrees in relation to the long axis of the root at a speed of 0.5 mm/min. All data were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance and Sidak test. RESULTS: The titanium posts presented higher mean values of fracture resistance when compared to glass-fiber posts and zirconium-oxide posts and similar values compared to carbon-fiber posts. Also, roots treated with cast posts and cores presented similar results when compared to roots treated with prefabricated posts. CONCLUSION: All prefabricated intraradicular post systems evaluated presented similar resistance to fracture when compared to cast posts and cores, and among the prefabricated ones, titanium and carbon-fiber posts could be best indicated.
