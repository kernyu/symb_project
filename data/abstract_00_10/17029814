INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determinate the frequency of candidemia, the species encountered and their susceptibility to antifungal agents in French hospitals in 2004. METHODS: A prospective survey of septicaemia, including candidaemia was conducted among 193 non teaching French hospitals during October 2004. All bloodstream infections were reported and the bloodstream isolates sent to two coordinating centers. Species identification and susceptibility were performed by biologists as usual, and further confirmed by use of alternative methods, including Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) determination. RESULTS: The survey was effective in 93 hospitals, where 2013 bloodstream infections were noticed, including 46 candidaemia (2.3%). Candida sp. Is the 7th pathogen responsible for bloodstream infection, without concern of the origin of the infection. Candidaemia was hospital acquired in 80.4% of cases (N=37/46). Candidaemia represents 0.7% (N=9/1211) of community-acquired bloodstream infections but 4.5% (N=37/802) of nosocomial cases, placing Candida sp. at the 5th row of frequency in this last group. No mistakes were noticed during identification, but two strains were not named. After confirmation of identification, species are distributed as follows: 23 C.albicans (50%), 13 C.glabrata (28.3%), 5 C.tropicalis (10.9%), 3 C.parapsilosis (6.5%), 1 C.krusei (2.2%), and 1 C.kefyr (2.2%). The overall susceptibility is 97.7% for amphotericin B, 93.2% for 5-fluorocytosin, 88.6% for fluconazole, 70.5% for itraconazole, 95.5% for voriconzole and 100% of strains had very low MIC for caspofungin. Concerning the two main species isolated, 95.5% of C.albicans strains remain susceptible to fluconazole, but only 69% of C.glabrata strains. Two strains, 1 C.albicans and 1 C.glabrata exhibit cross resistance to azoles. The majority of amphotericin, fluconazole, and itraconazole decreased susceptibility strains are found into C.glabrata strains, but susceptibility to 5-fluorocytosin and very low MCI to caspofungin remained in this species. CONCLUSION: Our survey allowed us to get data from French non-teaching hospitals in 2004 about frequency of candidaemia among septicaemia. Candida species distribution and in vitro susceptibility patterns of the strains isolated. Candidaemia is not a rare event, specially when septicaemia is nosocomially acquired. C.albicans is the main species isolated and remains highly in vitro susceptible to antifungals. One important feature is the frequency of C.glabrata in our survey. Considering its decreased susceptibility to azoles, this finding confirms the need for rapid identification of yeast isolated from bloodstream samples, and antifungal susceptibility testing each time it is available.
