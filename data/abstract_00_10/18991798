Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is a global problem worldwide due to the lack of an effective therapy (the current standard of care treatment is effective in about 40-50% of the cases), and the difficulties in developing a protective vaccine. Chronic infection progresses to end-stage liver disease and liver failure in a considerable number of infected individuals. Once liver function is compromised, the only reliable therapeutic intervention is liver transplantation. Unfortunately, re-infection of the graft is unavoidable, and a new chronic hepatitis is early established in transplant recipients, that can result in graft loss. Thus, there is an urgent need for new, specifically targeted therapies for the treatment of HCV chronic infection. Among the viral proteins, the NS3/4A protease and the NS5b RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, essential for the virus life cycle, have concentrated the efforts in the development of new antivirals, and some promising ones have already entered clinical trials. In particular, inhibitors of the HCV NS3/4A protease are the most advanced in clinical development. This review summarizes the available data for the most important HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors in development, the most recent patents of these type of compounds, the envisioned options for future HCV therapies, and the eventual impact of HCV genetic variability on resistance to new NS3/4A protease inhibitors.
