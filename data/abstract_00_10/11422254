OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides among all clinical isolates collected consecutively in two French hospitals between November 1998 and April 1999. METHODS: Methicillin-resistant and -susceptible S. aureus isolates were screened on vancomycin- or teicoplanin-supplemented agar plates. Glycopeptide MICs were determined by the E test procedure with a high inoculum and by an agar dilution technique. Glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus isolates were identified as homogeneously or heterogeneously resistant to vancomycin by performing population analysis. RESULTS: Of the 640 isolates recovered from 518 patients, three from the same patient and two from two different patients showed homogeneous or heterogeneous intermediate resistance to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The incidence of glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (homogeneously or heterogeneously resistant) in a non-selected patient population, i.e. regardless of predisposing factors and glycopeptide therapeutics, remains low in the two French hospitals involved in the study, representing 0.6% of isolates.
