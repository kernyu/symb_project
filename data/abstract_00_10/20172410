The pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis in HIV-infected patients is complex. Both patient-related cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) established for the general population and those related to highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and HIV infection per se are involved. Some traditional CVRF are more frequent in HIV infected patients than in the general population. In developed countries, HIV infection is more frequent among men and, due to HAART, their life expectancy has significantly increased. The prevalence of smoking (37-72%) is higher than in the general population, as is that of diabetes mellitus (17%), insulin resistance (17-51%), dyslipidemia (22-49%) and hypertriglyceridemia (34%). The higher prevalence in these patients is probably due to lifestyle and length of exposure to HAART, especially to certain antiretroviral drugs. Although overall cardiovascular risk in patients with HIV remains low, CVRF established for the general population become more important with increasing age. Longitudinal cohort studies indicate the magnitude of the association of these risk factors with cardiovascular disease in patients with HIV infection. In view of all the factors that intervene in HIV infection, specific mathematical models should be designed for this population that would allow individual cardiovascular risk to be calculated in each patient and measures for cardiovascular prevention to be established.
