Hospital cleaning is a neglected part of infection control. Due to financial constraints and lack of clinical evidence it has been cut down to the bare minimum and currently-used methods are unfit for the removal of microorganisms. Recent studies indicate that MRSA and other important pathogens may be transmitted to patients from the hospital environment. Furthermore, studies suggest that intensified cleaning may lower the risk of transmission. There is an urgent need for more clinical evidence and for development of standards and methods which focus on the removal of pathogens from the hospital environment.
