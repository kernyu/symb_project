AIMS: In this study, mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and genetic relatedness among resistant enterococci from dogs and cats in the United States were determined. METHODS AND RESULTS: Enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, lincomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and tetracycline were screened for the presence of 15 antimicrobial resistance genes. Five tetracycline resistance genes [tet(M), tet(O), tet(L), tet(S) and tet(U)] were detected with tet(M) accounting for approx. 60% (130/216) of tetracycline resistance; erm(B) was also widely distributed among 96% (43/45) of the erythromycin-resistant enterococci. Five aminoglycoside resistance genes were also detected among the kanamycin-resistant isolates with the majority of isolates (25/36; 69%) containing aph(3')-IIIa. The bifunctional aminoglycoside resistance gene, aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, was detected in gentamicin-resistant isolates and ant(6)-Ia in streptomycin-resistant isolates. The most common gene combination among enterococci from dogs (n = 11) was erm(B), aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, aph(3')-IIIa, tet(M), while tet(O), tet(L) were most common among cats (n = 18). Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), isolates clustered according to enterococcal species, source and antimicrobial gene content and indistinguishable patterns were observed for some isolates from dogs and cats. CONCLUSION: Enterococci from dogs and cats may be a source of antimicrobial resistance genes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Dogs and cats may act as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes that can be transferred from pets to people. Although host-specific ecovars of enterococcal species have been described, identical PFGE patterns suggest that enterococcal strains may be exchanged between these two animal species.
