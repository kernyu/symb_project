OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to ascertain the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of patients with nosocomial or community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus bacteremic pneumonia. METHODS: A prospective study of 134 cases diagnosed between January 1990 and December 1995 was performed. RESULTS: Fifty cases involved primary bacteremic pneumonias, of which 80% were nosocomial (the majority, 72%, in intensive care unit patients, of whom 57% were post-surgery). Of the 84 cases of secondary pneumonia, 36 were non-intravenous drug users (78% nosocomial, of whom 43% were in the intensive care unit), and 48 cases were intravenous drug users (98% community-acquired). CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial S. aureus bacteremic pneumonia was especially frequent in intensive care unit patients (68.1%), and community-acquired pneumonia in intravenous drug users (72.3%). In non-intravenous drug users, clinical outcome and mortality were similar for nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia.
