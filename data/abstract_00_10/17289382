In this study, a series of novel phenyl- and benzimidazole-substituted benzyl ethers were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Candida krusei. Compound 6g exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with lowest MIC values of 3.12 and 6.25 microg/mL against S. aureus and MRSA, respectively.
