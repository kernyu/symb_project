Low and high levels of resistance to the benzimidazole fungicides benomyl and thiophanate-methyl were observed in field isolates of Monilinia fructicola, which is the causative agent of brown rot of stone fruit. Isolates that had low levels of resistance (hereafter referred to as LR isolates) and high levels of resistance (hereafter referred to as HR isolates) were also cold and heat sensitive, respectively. Results from microsatellite DNA fingerprints showed that genetic identities among the populations of sensitive (S), LR, and HR isolates were very high (>0.96). Analysis of DNA sequences of the beta-tubulin gene showed that the LR isolates had a point mutation at codon 6, causing a replacement of the amino acid histidine by tyrosine. Codon 198, which encodes a glutamic acid in S and LR isolates, was converted to a codon for alanine in HR isolates. Based on these point mutations in the beta-tubulin gene, allele-specific PCR assays were developed for rapid detection of benzimidazole-resistant isolates of M. fructicola from stone fruit.
