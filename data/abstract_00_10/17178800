A Klebsiella pneumoniae strain resistant to third-generation cephalosporins was isolated in the eastern Netherlands. The strain was found to carry a novel extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, namely, SHV-31. The combination of the two mutations by which SHV-31 differs from SHV-1, namely, L35Q and E240K, had previously only been described in association with one or more additional mutations.
