KatG Ser3 15Thr mutation is one of the main reasons of resistance to isoniazid in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. The frequency rate of the above mutation among isoniazid-resistant isolates made 94% in Novosibirsk Region and 93% in Kemerovo Region. The use of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) can be regarded as an adequate method for rapid screening of isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated in the West-Siberian Region.
