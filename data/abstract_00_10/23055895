OBJECTIVES: Appropriate antimicrobial dosing maximizes therapeutic benefit while minimizing development of antimicrobial resistance. Common pediatric references recommend vancomycin dosing of 40 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours for non-central nervous system infections, while some clinicians report utilizing higher initial doses to optimize efficacy. This study compares vancomycin serum concentrations following traditional dosing of 10 mg/kg/dose every 6 to 8 hours versus 15 to 20 mg/kg/dose every 6 to 8 hours. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database review of vancomycin serum concentrations in pediatric patients. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-seven patients were analyzed. The mean peak concentration of the 10 mg/kg groups every 6 and every 8 hours were below 25 mg/L, whereas the mean peak concentrations of the 15 mg/ kg groups every 6 and 8 hours were within the 25-40 mg/L range (p < 0.001). The mean trough concentration of the 10 mg/kg group every 6 hours was within the 5-15 mg/L range while the 10 mg/kg group dosed every 8 hours was below target. However, the mean trough concentrations of the 15 mg/kg group dosed every 6 and 8 hours were both within the 5-15 mg/L range (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin doses of 15 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours produce peak and trough serum concentrations within target range more often than 10 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours.
