BACKGROUND: Resistant bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the primary causative organisms of bacterial respiratory tract infections and meningitis in children. METHODS: This study was carried out over 4 years. Specimens from the pharynges and sputum of children were collected. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were cultured, and the sensitivity to antibiotics were measured. The dosages of major antibiotics for children were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 920 samples of H. influenzae and 128 samples of S. pneumoniae collected from the specimens from the pharynges and sputum were cultured. The level of non-sensitive H. influenzae for cefaclor decreased from 62.1% to 50.3% (P= 0.0398). The level of non-sensitive S. pneumoniae for amoxicillin decreased sharply from 31.6% to 0.0%. Finally, the total amount of antibiotics was reduced to 40.5% of the first period. CONCLUSION: It is possible to reduce the levels of non-susceptible bacteria by limited usage of antibiotics for daily treatment.
