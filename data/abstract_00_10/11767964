It has been generally recognized that the prevalence of bacterial resistance among bacteria is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and is positively linked to the overall use of antibacterial drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of antimicrobial usage and to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance at three different hospital settings in Croatia: a clinical hospital, a general hospital and a specialized clinic for infectious diseases. In this survey the antimicrobial drug consumption and antimicrobial susceptibility test results were analyzed for the first 6 months of 1997 in three different hospitals in Croatia: the University Hospital Center (UHC), Rijeka, the Clinic for Infectious Diseases 'Dr Fran Mihaljevic', Zagreb and the Dubrovnik General Hospital. The data were collected from corresponding hospital pharmacy records and microbiology laboratories. Antimicrobial drug utilization was expressed in number of defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 bed days. High antimicrobial utilization and high resistance rates were found in all three hospitals. At the Clinic for Infectious Diseases, the most frequently used antimicrobials where those of narrow spectrum while at the UHC Rijeka and the Dubrovnik General Hospital the broad spectrum antimicrobials were mostly used. The highest antimicrobial consumption was noted at the Susak locality of the UHC, Rijeka, where the highest resistance rates of bacteria to antimicrobials were also found. Results of this observational study indicate that attempts should be made to reduce the influence of factors that may lead to emergent resistance. The most effective approach to the prevention of transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens is preventing the initial emergence of resistance. A rational and strict antibiotic policy is thus of great importance for the optimal use of these agents.
