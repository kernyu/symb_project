BACKGROUND: Wound healing is a complex process, with many potential factors that can delay or complicate healing. Bacterial infection is one of the most dangerous complications once the skin barrier is destroyed. The search for optimal treatment of chronic and infected wounds is an ongoing challenge for healthcare professionals. METHODS: This article discusses recent findings in the field of wound antiseptics, its antibacterial efficacy, cell toxicity, and compatibility with wound dressings. RESULTS: Skin antiseptics are daily used for wound cleansing to reduce the bacterial burden. However, there is little evidence concerning the antimicrobial efficacy, cytotoxicity of host cells, and compatibility with commonly used wound dressings. Recent findings show high toxicity and significant incompatibilities with wound dressings for some antiseptics. CONCLUSION: Antiseptics are widely used in hospitals worldwide to reduce, inactivate, or eliminate potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Current studies show that widely used wound antiseptics show relevant cytotoxicity and cross-reactivity with certain wound dressings. Future research should particularly focus on cytotoxicity, mechanisms of bacterial resistance toward skin antiseptics and wound irrigants, as well as compatibility and cross-reactivity with wound dressings.
