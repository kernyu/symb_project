Ovarian cancer is more fatal than all the other gynaecological malignancies combined. Although most patients respond to first-line combination chemotherapy, the vast majority (50-75%) of patients with advanced disease will relapse. The management of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer is based on their response profile to platinum: patients with platinum-sensitive disease can be rechallenged with platinum-based chemotherapy, whereas the management of patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory disease remains an area of active investigation. In this review, the data for second-line therapy in this latter group of patients will be summarised and recommendations for their optimal management will be made.
