A 28-year-old man developed five episodes of meningitis, all due to multiresistant Gram-negative rods during his 7-month hospitalisation after head trauma. This patient's recurrent meningitis was solved only when colistin and amikacin were given by the intraventricular in addition to the intravenous route for a long period of time, specifically 6 weeks.
