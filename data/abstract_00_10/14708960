Bacterial infections are the major cause of illness and death in the intensive care unit (ICU). In general, each unit is in itself a high risk environment for infections, simultaneously containing many diverse factors that favor the spread of clinically evident and generally serious infections: the constant presence of serious concomitant diseases, the frequent use of invasive diagnostic methods and procedures, the elevated selective pressure caused by multiple and prolonged antibiotic treatment on endogenous and environmental microbial flora. Notwithstanding the fact that the bacterial epidemiology of the ICU varies slightly in different countries and in different ICUs, in the last 15 years a general and progressive increase in the etiology of Gram-positive aerobic bacteria has been observed. Currently, Staphylococcus aureus is the etiologic agent most frequently responsible for infections in the ICU; S. aureus + coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) + Enterococcus are responsible for more than 60% of infections. More recent data confirm that next to modifications in bacterial etiology in the ICU, the most alarming phenomenon is the methicillin-resistance of S. aureus (MRSA). The high percentage of multi-resistance compels us to reconsider therapy relative to the choice of antibiotics to use and, in particular, raises the question of possibly selecting the class of glycopeptides, alone or in combination, as the choice of treatment every time that an infection is caused by a Gram-positive microorganism. The use of glycopeptides, as with all antibiotics, must be evaluated in a suitable manner with the objective of limiting the selective pressure on resistant bacterial flora caused by their use. It is widely understood that inappropriate use of antibiotics, such as selecting an antibacterial agent with an inadequate spectrum that is thus ineffective, determines an increase in the mortality rate compared to using an agent with an appropriate spectrum of activity.
