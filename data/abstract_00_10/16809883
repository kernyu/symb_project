Multiple myeloma is a clonal disorder of plasma cells which is considered incurable with currently available therapies. Substantial advances have been achieved in the past decade with the identification of cellular mechanisms that confer drug resistance. This has resulted in newer agents such as arsenic trioxide (Trisenoxt), lenalidomide (Revlimid) and bortezomib (Velcade) with promising activity in this disease. In this review article we will outline the history, mechanisms of action, pharmacology, and clinical trials of arsenic trioxide in multiple myeloma.
