The interpretive reading of the antibiogram is routinely performed in the microbiology laboratory as a complement of the clinical categorization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. This process consists in the phenotypic recognition of resistance mechanisms allowing the inference of the initial resistance phenotype. Moreover, it assists in the modification of clinical categories and in the deduction of susceptibility of antimicrobials not included in the antibiogram. It is also useful in the quality control and validation of susceptibility results. This process is facilitated with the automatic susceptibility testing devices and the corresponding software. The current review of breakpoints with Pk/Pd (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) criteria and correlation of MIC values with clinical outcomes will make clinical category modifications unnecessary. It is an essential tool to establish epidemiological measures, correct antimicrobial treatments and implementation of antimicrobial policies. The interpretive reading of the antibiogram transcends the microbiologist's clinical role and is essential for clinical decisions.
