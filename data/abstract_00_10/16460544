This study assessed the effects of throat and gut surveillance, combined with enteral vancomycin, on gut overgrowth, transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), infections and mortality in patients admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). A 4-year prospective observational study was undertaken with 1241 children who required ventilation for >or=4 days. Patients identified as MRSA carriers following surveillance cultures of throat and rectum received enteral vancomycin. Twenty-nine (2.4%) children carried MRSA, 19 on admission and nine during treatment in the PICU; one patient was not able to be evaluated. Overgrowth was present in 22 (75%) of the carriers. Ten (0.8%) children developed 21 MRSA infections (15 exogenous infections in eight children at a median of 8 days (IQR 3-10.5); five primary endogenous infections at a median of 3 days (IQR 1-25) in three children when they were in overgrowth status; one child developed both types of infection). Enteral vancomycin reduced gut overgrowth significantly, completely preventing secondary endogenous infections. Transmission occurred on nine occasions over a period of 4 years. Four patients died, two (5.9%) with MRSA infection, giving a mortality (11.8%) similar to the study population (9.8%). No emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci or S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin was detected. A policy based on throat and gut surveillance, combined with enteral vancomycin, for critically-ill children who were MRSA carriers was found to be effective and safe, and challenges the recommended guidelines of nasal swabbing followed by topical mupirocin.
