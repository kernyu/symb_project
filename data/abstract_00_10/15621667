In the present study, we have evaluated prophylactic role of various immunomodulators viz. lipopolysachharide, protein A and tuftsin to impart protection against experimental candidiasis in leukopenic mice. Both free as well as liposomised form of nystatin was not effective enough in offering complete cure against less susceptible isolate of Candida albicans (JNMCR) infection in immunodebilitant mice. Interestingly, the pretreatment of leukopenic mice with immunomodulators before challenging them with C. albicans increased therapeutic efficacy of the nystatin against systemic candidiasis. Efficacy of the treatment was evaluated on the basis of survival of the animals as well as fungal load in systemic circulation and various organs viz. liver, kidney, spleen and lungs of the treated animals.
