The level of susceptibility of 90 different Staphylococcus aureus strains to chosen quaternary ammonium compounds: cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride as well as to chlorhexidine digluconate were examined. The examined strains consist of three groups: hospital originated MRSA, hospital originated MSSA and non-hospital MSSA. The significant differences between these groups were observed in they susceptibility to the investigated disinfectants. The obtained MIC values showed that the most resistant were hospital MRSA strains, where 55% was estimated as resistant to cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, 72% were resistant to benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride and 7% were resistant to chlorhexidine digluconate. Among hospital originated MSSA 3% of strains were resistant to cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide and 6% were resistant to benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride. 14% non-hospital S. aureus strains were resistant to benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride. None were resistant to chlorhexidine digluconate or cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide.
