Despite progress in the diagnosis, prevention and therapy for hospital-acquired infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) continues to complicate the course of a significant proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Mortality rates among patients with VAP have been reported to be as high as 72%, and the morbidity associated with VAP is also considerable, adding days to the hospital stay and increasing health care costs. Appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy for patients with VAP has been shown to reduce mortality rates and improve outcomes; therefore, rapid identification of infected patients and timely, accurate selection of effective antimicrobial agents are important clinical goals. The primary organisms responsible for VAP include Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. However, aetiologies differ considerably between intensive care units, and the increase in antibiotic resistance and nosocomial outbreaks worldwide have presented clinicians with a serious dilemma with respect to selecting appropriate empirical therapy. To date, no optimal antimicrobial regimen for the treatment of VAP has been identified, largely because none of the currently marketed antibiotics has a sufficiently extended spectrum of activity to cover all of the potential key pathogens. More active, less toxic antibacterial agents are still needed, in particular to combat problematic pathogens such as multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli and resistant Gram-positive organisms (e.g. methicillin-resistant S aureus).
