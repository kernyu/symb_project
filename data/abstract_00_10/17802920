Long-term-care facilities (LTCFs) comprise a heterogeneous group of institutions that provide a wide variety of services to diverse groups of patients, most of whom are elderly. Infections are common in LTCFs and these are complicated by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. The residents in LTCFs have a high frequency of colonization with antimicrobial-resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, extended spectrum P-lactamase-producing gram-negative organisms, and fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative organisms. Although several control programs have been published, up to now there still is a long way to go in this area of health care. This review will briefly touch upon the clinical relevance of antimicrobial resistance in LTCFs.
