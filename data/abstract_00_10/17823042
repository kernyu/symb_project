Despite refinements in surgical techniques, routine antibioprophylaxis, and anesthesiology, vascular prosthetic infections remain a serious complication of reconstructive vascular surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the healing, the toxicity, and the antibiotic delivery of a new vascular graft, preloaded with rifampin and tobramycin. Sixteen dogs underwent infrarenal aortic bypass. They were divided into three groups. In test group 1 (n = 8), dogs received grafts loaded with a standard concentration of antibiotics. In test group 2 (n = 4), dogs received grafts loaded with twice the standard concentration of antibiotics. A control group (n = 4) received a commercial gelatin-sealed graft. Grafts were harvested after different periods of time and submitted to histological evaluation and antibiotic dose determination. Liver and kidney toxicities were evaluated from dosages performed on serum samples taken at different time periods between graft implantation and harvesting. The healing of antibiotic-loaded grafts was similar to that of commercial grafts, without any signs of toxicity. These results suggest resistance to infection of these prebonded grafts in an animal model.
