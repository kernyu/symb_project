We analyzed the presence of Listeria spp. in oyster, fish, and seawater samples and tested isolates for antibiotic sensitivity. Listeria monocytogenes was found in 4.5% of fish samples and 8.3% of seawater samples and was not recovered from oysters. Multiresistant environmental strains were found, representing a potential threat to human health.
