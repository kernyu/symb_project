In an ongoing project to evaluate natural compounds isolated from plants from the Brazilian biodiversity as modulators of antibiotic resistance, kaempferol-3-O-beta-d-(6''-E-p-coumaroyl) glucopyranoside (tiliroside), isolated from Herissantia tiubae (Malvaceae) was investigated using the strain SA-1199B of Staphylococcus aureus, which overexpresses the norA gene encoding the NorA efflux protein which extrudes hydrophilic fluorquinolones and some biocides, such as benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide, acriflavine and ethidium bromide. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antibiotics and biocides were determined by the microdilution assay in the absence and in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentration of tiliroside. Although tiliroside did not display relevant antibacterial activity (MIC = 256 microg/mL), it modulated the activity of antibiotics, i.e. in combination with antibiotics a reduction in the MIC was observed for norfloxacin (16-fold), ciprofloxacin (16-fold), lomefloxacin (four-fold) and ofloxacin (two-fold), and an impressive reduction in the MICs for the biocides (up to 128-fold). The results presented here represent the first report of a kaempferol glycoside as a putative efflux pump inhibitor in bacteria. The present finding indicates that H. tiubae (and broadly Malvaceae) could serve as a source of plant-derived natural products that modulate bacterial resistance, i.e. a source of potential adjuvants of antibiotics.
