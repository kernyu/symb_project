To understand the resistance mechanisms present in 75 isolates of Salmonella typhimurium derived from clinical infections in Turkey, antimicrobial resistance patterns and associated plasmids were investigated. Among the 22 strains that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), 20 were resistant to aminoglycosides and 12 to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Strains that did not produce ESBL did not express aminoglycoside or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance, although 27 of them were ampicillin resistant. None of the strains were resistant to imipenem or fluoroquinolones. Nineteen strains producing ESBL carried a plasmid of >100 MDa. Seven ESBL-producing strains conjugally transferred their ESBLs and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazok resistance. No correlation was found between the resistance patterns and plasmids in non-ESBL-producing strains.
