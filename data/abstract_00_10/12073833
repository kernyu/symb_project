The number of drug-resistant forms of pulmonary tuberculosis increases every year. The diagnosis of drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) is rather difficult, up-to-date (molecular-and-genetic) methods should be applied. 236 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and massive bacterial excretion were investigated in Central Military Clinical Tubercular Hospital. 97 (41.1%) of them had drug resistant MBT (1 drug resistance was revealed in 15.5%, two drugs--in 28.8% and three and more drugs--in 55.7%). Rifampicin resistance was the highest one (40%). The authors propose the complex schemes of drug resistance prophylaxis and decrease in the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.
