We evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline using the Etest and disk diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as for CTX-M-9 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and SHV ESBL-producing E. coli. All isolates were susceptible to tigecycline according to US Food and Drug Administration cut-off points. There were no differences in the activity of tigecycline between MSSA and MRSA isolates or between the presence of either type of ESBL. For each type of microorganism studied, we established the equation relating the minimum inhibitory concentration to the diameter of the zone of inhibition.
