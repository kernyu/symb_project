The in vitro activity of rifaximin against 84 diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and 11 Shigella sonnei causing traveler's diarrhea was evaluated. The MIC of rifaximin ranged between <0.007 and 32 mg/L; other agents tested had an MIC of >256 mg/L in most cases. The results showed the potential use of rifaximin to treat these infections.
