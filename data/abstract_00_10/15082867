An increase in endogenous central histamine concentrations, after loading with histamine precursor L-histidine or inhibition of histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) activity, produces the reversal of critical hypotension with improvement in survival of haemorrhage-shocked rats. In the present study, the involvement of proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides in central histamine-induced resuscitating action was examined in male anaesthetised Wistar rats subjected to a haemorrhagic hypotension of 20-25 mmHg resulting in the death of all control animals within 30 min. HNMT inhibitor metoprine (20 microg) administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) at 5 min of critical hypotension produced a long-lasting pressor effect with a 100% survival rate at 2 h. The action was accompanied by 34.5% and 28.9% higher plasma concentrations of ACTH and alpha-MSH, respectively, in comparison to concentrations in the saline-injected group as measured 20 min after treatment. Melanocortin type 4 (MC(4)) receptor antagonist HS014 (5 microg; i.c.v.) inhibited metoprine-induced increase in mean arterial pressure, which resulted from decreased regional vascular resistance, however, it did not affect the heart rate and the survival at 2 h. On the other hand, glucocorticoid type II receptor blocker mifepristone (30 mg/kg; sc) had no effect. In conclusion, POMC-derived peptides, acting centrally via MC(4) receptors, participate in endogenous central histamine-induced resuscitating effect in rats.
