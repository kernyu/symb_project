Three new 10-membered macrolides (1-3) have been isolated from the entomopathogenic fungus Cordyceps militaris BCC 2816, together with six known compounds, cepharosporolides C (4), E (5), and F (6), 2-carboxymethyl-4-(3'-hydroxybutyl)furan (7), cordycepin (8), and pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid. The structures were determined by analysis of NMR data, and an X-ray analysis was performed to confirm the structure of 1. The antimalarial activity of 1-4 and 8 against Plasmodium falciparum K1 was evaluated.
