This study included 676 surgery patients with signs and symptoms indicative of wound infections, who presented over the course of 6 years. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 614 individuals. A single etiologic agent was identified in 271 patients, multiple agents were found in 343, and no agent was identified in 62. A high preponderance of aerobic bacteria was observed. Among the common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (191 patients, 28.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (170 patients, 25.2%), Escherichia coli (53 patients, 7.8%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (48 patients, 7.1%), and Enterococcus faecalis (38 patients, 5.6%).
