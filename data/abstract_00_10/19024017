We developed a method of identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with simultaneous evaluation of the sensitivity to fluoroquinolones on a biological microchip array. The method of multiplex two-staged PCR followed by hybridization of a biochip makes it possible to detect 8 mutant variants of gyrA gene occurring in fluoroquinolone-resistant strains (approximately 85% all resistant forms) within 1 day. Using this method we analyzed 107 cultures isolated from patients with tuberculosis and 78 sputum samples. Mutations in gyrA gene were detected in 48 (92%) resistant strains. Natural S95T polymorphism in gyrA gene was detected in all resistant and in 76% sensitive strains. The sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method calculated on the basis of the analysis of sputum samples (n=78) were 94 and 100%, respectively.
