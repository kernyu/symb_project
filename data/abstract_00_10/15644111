AIMS: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate mutants of Flavobacterium columnare, the causative agent of columnaris disease in fish. METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial passage on ampicillin (beta-lactam) enriched modified Hsu-Shotts medium resulted in a F. columnare mutant that differed from the parent strain in colony morphology, whole cell proteins, adhesion and virulence. The mutant differed from its parent in virulence during immersion challenge, but not during injection challenge or generation of antibodies. CONCLUSION: Flavobacterium columnare exposure to ampicillin produces both resistance to that antibiotic and produces mutants that lack or have reduced adhesion characteristics and modified ability to adhere to fish tissue. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of an adhesion-defective mutant of F. columnare and the effects of altered adhesion on columnaris disease. This mutant has considerable potential as a tool to study the role of adhesion in columnaris disease.
