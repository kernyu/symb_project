With increasing antibiotic resistance in gram-negative pathogens, dosing strategies that optimize pharmacodynamic parameters of currently available antibiotics play an important role in treatment. The likelihood of success with piperacillin/tazobactam, a widely used broad-spectrum antibiotic, can be manipulated by increasing the amount of time that unbound drug concentrations remain above the pathogen's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). However, this success depends greatly on knowing the MIC value as well as accurately estimating the individual's pharmacokinetic parameters. Clinicians should carefully factor these variables into their decision-making process when considering prolonged infusion strategies with piperacillin/tazobactam.
