The detection of resistance by HIV drug resistance assays has become an important management tool for use in the HIV-infected patient. Because of its important role in management of HIV disease, it is important for the nurse to understand the mechanism of HIV resistance, the appropriate use of resistance tests, and how to use this information to improve or maximize patient outcomes. The purpose of this review is to increase the nurse's awareness of the problem of resistance, to describe the available resistance tests, and to develop a model whereby the patient collaborates with the health care team in understanding, implementing, and monitoring resistance-related actions.
