We recently reported a simple new in situ diffusion assay, developed as a kit, to visualize DNA fragmentation in single bacterial cells. Use of this assay in a collection of 95 genetically unrelated Escherichia coli clinical strains resulted in correct identification of all of the isolates as resistant or susceptible to ciprofloxacin, consistent with the MIC results. This relevant information is obtained in 80 min.
