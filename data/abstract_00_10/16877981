BACKGROUND: Poor compliance to therapy and antibiotic resistance are the main causes for failure of anti-Helicobacter pylori therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of esomeprazole-based triple therapy directed by susceptibility testing. METHODS: Symptomatic children with H. pylori infection, who underwent successful susceptibility testing and were colonized by no double-resistant strain, received 1-week triple therapy with esomeprazole, amoxicillin and either clarithromycin or metronidazole. Success of eradication was investigated by C-urea breath test. RESULTS: Fifty-eight children (median age, 11.4 years; range, 2.2-17.7 years; 81% immigrants) were included. Helicobacter pylori was resistant to clarithromycin in 5 (9%) and to metronidazole in 9 children (16%). Eradication was successful in 49 (92%) of 53 children receiving esomeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin and in all 5 children treated with metronidazole instead of clarithromycin, resulting in an eradication rate of 93% (95% confidence interval, 83%-98%, intention-to-treat analysis). All 4 treatment failures occurred in immigrants with language problems; 2 of them were obviously noncompliant. CONCLUSION: Esomeprazole-based 1-week triple therapy directed by susceptibility testing is highly effective for eradication of H. pylori infection in children.
