The purpose of this study was to characterize the antibiotic resistance profiles of Enterococcus species isolated from fresh produce harvested in the southwestern United States. Among the 185 Enterococcus isolates obtained, 97 (52%) were Enterococcus faecium, 38 (21%) were Enterococcus faecalis, and 50 (27%) were other Enterococcus species. Of human clinical importance, E. faecium strains had a much higher prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and nitrofurantoin than E. faecalis. E. faecalis strains had a low prevalence of resistance to antibiotics used to treat E. faecalis infections of both clinical and of agricultural relevance, excluding its intrinsic resistance patterns. Thirty-four percent of the isolates had multiple-drug-resistance patterns, excluding intrinsic resistance. Data on the prevalence and types of antibiotic resistance in Enterococcus species isolated from fresh produce may be used to describe baseline antibiotic susceptibility profiles associated with Enterococcus spp. isolated from the environment. The data collected may also help elucidate the role of foods in the transmission of antibiotic-resistant strains to human populations.
