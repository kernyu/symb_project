The new oral neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor A-322278 was evaluated in mice infected with influenza A/H1N1 wild-type virus or the oseltamivir-resistant (H274Y mutant) virus. A-322278 decreased mortality rates and lung virus titers significantly more than oseltamivir in mice infected with the NA H274Y mutant when therapy was started 4 h before or even 48 h after infection.
