Antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance genes of 135 strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis isolated from poultry in Kagoshima were examined. One strain (0.7%) was resistant to ampicillin (A), 97% to streptomycin (S), 95.6% to sulphamethoxazole (Su), 96.3% to oxytetracycline (T), 11.1% to kanamycin (Km) and 36.3% to ofloxacin (O). Multiresistant phenotypes identified were ASSuT-Km, SSuT-Km, SSuT-O and SSuT. Class 1 integrons were detected in 94.8% of isolates. Approximately 89% of oxytetracycline-resistant strains carried the tetA gene and all of the 131 streptomycin-resistant isolates carried the aadA1a gene. Forty-percent of kanamycin-resistant isolates carried the aphA1-Iab gene. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Recognition of TEM-type beta-lactamase in a S. Infantis strain from chickens is a recent rare finding in Japan.
