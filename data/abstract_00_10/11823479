In Drosophila, the response against various microorganisms involves different recognition and signaling pathways, as well as distinct antimicrobial effectors. On the one hand, the immune deficiency pathway regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides that are active against Gram-negative bacteria. On the other hand, the Toll pathway is involved in the defense against filamentous fungi and controls the expression of antifungal peptide genes. The gene coding for the only known peptide with high activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Defensin, is regulated by both pathways. So far, survival experiments to Gram-positive bacteria have been performed with Micrococcus luteus and have failed to reveal the involvement of one or the other pathway in host defense against such infections. In this study, we report that the Toll pathway, but not that of immune deficiency, is required for resistance to other Gram-positive bacteria and that this response does not involve Defensin.
