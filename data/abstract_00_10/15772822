Since Turkey currently lacks a national reference center for Salmonella infections, the present study was conducted to document the distribution of serotypes and antimicrobial resistance patterns among Salmonella enterica isolates recovered from clinical samples in ten Turkish provinces over a 2-year period. Among the 620 Salmonella enterica isolates recovered between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2002, strains belonging to the serotypes Enteritidis (47.7%), Typhimurium (34.7%), Paratyphi B (6.0%), Typhi (2.9%), Paratyphi A (0.2%) and serogroup C (8.5%) were found. Resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents was particularly high among Salmonella Typhimurium isolates (76.7%), and resistance or decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC> or =0.125 mg/l) was demonstrated in Salmonella Paratyphi B, Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis strains. All of the Salmonella Typhi isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The results indicate that decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin is an emerging problem in Salmonella enterica in Turkey, particularly in multiresistant strains.
