BACKGROUND: In Mexico giardiosis is the most prevalent parasitic disease in children. Treatment with antiparasitics derived from: nitroimidazoles, benzimidazoles and nitrofuranes have been used; but, some of them have undesirable side effects. Recently nitazoxanide (Ntz) was introduced in Mexico; however, there are few studies on Giardia duodenalis susceptibility to Ntz. OBJECTIVE: To determine G. duodenalis sensitivity to Ntz and compare it to tinidazole (Tnz). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Assays were performed in four G. duodenalis isolates: INP231087MM, INP210897-AXA1 obtained from humans infections, INP170693HG8, INP300693-CP5 from a cat and a dog, respectively. Half million trophozoites were exposed to different Ntz or Tnz concentrations in TYI-S-33, for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Trophozoite viability was tested by the colorimetric method of MTT-tetrazolium salts reduction to MTT-formazan. To analyze ultrastructural damage, control and experimental samples were processed by standard electron microscopy methods. Experiments were carried out, in a double blind in triplicate and repeated four times. Results were analyzed by variance analysis. RESULTS: Susceptibility at 100% were in a Ntz concentration ranging from 1 microgram to 7 micrograms and in a Tnz concentration ranging from 1 microgram to 4 micrograms. There were significant differences when sensitivities to Ntz were compared between them (P < 0.001). The ultrastructural analysis showed changes in trophozoite volume, loss of characteristic shape and swelling. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of G. duodenalis susceptibility to Ntz performed in isolates from different hosts. G. duodenalis isolates were more susceptible to Tnz than Ntz.
