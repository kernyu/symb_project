The in vitro combination effects of pazufloxacin (PZFX) with an anti-MRSA drug such as vancomycin (VCM), teicoplanin (TEIC), arbekacin (ABK), minocycline (MINO), rifampicin (RFP) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) were investigated against 26 strains of beta-lactam antibiotic induced vancomycin-resistant MRSA (BIVR) by the checkerboard method. The additive and synergistic effects were observed with the combination of PZFX and VCM (50%, 13/26 strains), PZFX and TEIC (96%, 25/26 strains), PZFX and ABK (65%, 17/26 strains), PZFX and MINO (46%, 12/26 strains), PZFX and ST (54%, 14/26 strains). The synergistic effects were observed with the combination of PZFX and TEIC (4%, 1/26 strains), PZFX and ABK or MINO (15%, 4/26 strains). The antagonistic effects were observed with only PZFX and MINO (12%, 3/26 strains), others were all indifference.
