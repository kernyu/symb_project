The Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube, a reliable system for detection of mycobacterial growth, was compared with the reference proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium for antibiotic susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A total of 62 clinical strains and four reference strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were tested for susceptibility to streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol. Of these, 36 were susceptible to all four antibiotics and 30 were resistant to at least one of them. Tests were repeated in cases of discrepant results. When each drug/strain combination was considered separately, the overall agreement between the two methods was 96.5% (98.4% for streptomycin, 95.3% for isoniazid, 96.9% for rifampicin and 95.3% for ethambutol) with regard to the initial testing and 98.8% (100, 98.5, 98.5 and 98.4%, respectively) after repeated testing. When the results were considered strain by strain, the agreement was 86% after the initial testing and 95% after repeated testing. The results were obtained after a mean time of 9.5 days. These results suggest that the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube is a reliable method for testing susceptibility of mycobacterial strains to first-line antituberculous drugs.
