The data available in the literature concerning Cryptococcus gattii in vitro antifungal susceptibility are contradictory. We have analyzed the activity of eight antifungal agents against 23 C. gattii clinical isolates and compared the susceptibility profiles with those of C. neoformans. MIC analysis (mg/L) revealed that C. gattii isolates were more susceptible to amphotericin B and flucytosine than were C. neoformans isolates. Fluconazole and other azole compounds showed high MIC values for C. gattii. Posaconazole displayed good activity. Further studies are required to ascertain the predictive value of the in vitro data presented here.
