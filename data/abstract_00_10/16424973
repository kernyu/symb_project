In order to gather more data on the use of teicoplanin for reducing MRSA infections in high-risk populations, the present study was conducted. At a hospital in Barcelona, Spain, there was a high prevalence of MRSA infections among patients who underwent surgery for femoral neck fracture during the first 5 months of 2002 (period A) when cefuroxime was the antibiotic prophylaxis. During the following 12 months (period B) 600 mg of teicoplanin was added to cefuroxime. The rates of overall and MRSA infection during period A were 5.07 and 2.73%, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated there was no clonal relationship among MRSA strains. No nasal carriers of MRSA were detected among health workers. During period B the rates of overall and MRSA infection were 2.36 and 0.19%, respectively. Both rates were statistically significantly lower than those in period A (p<0.05). These results suggest teicoplanin may be useful in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery when the prevalence of MRSA is high.
