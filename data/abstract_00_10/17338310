We analyzed the clinical and bacterial backgrounds of 120 patients with pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI). Escherichia coli was the main pathogen recovered from 98 patients (81.7%). All causative agents isolated from 50 uncomplicated UTI cases were E. coli. Of 98 cases of E. coli UTI, 71 were treated with second-generation cephems, whose therapeutic effect was equal to that of third and fourth-generation cephems. MIC50 and MIC90 (microg/mL) for E. coli were as follows: cefazolin :2, 4; cefmetazole: < or = 0.5, 2; and ceftazidime: < or = 0.25, < or = 0.25. Yearly decline in susceptibility was not observed, but MIC elevation for third generation cephems (< or = 2 microg/mL) including ceftazidime was seen in six isolates. Careful monitoring of susceptibility trends is therefore necessary for appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
