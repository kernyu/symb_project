To assess the molecular basis of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance in Helicobacter pullorum, the gyrA gene of H. pullorum CIP 104787T was sequenced. In addition, 9 isolates (2 susceptible to ciprofloxacin and resistant to nalidixic acid, 3 susceptible and 4 resistant to both antibiotics) were selected from 44 poultry isolates and the nucleotide sequences of their quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) were compared. The 2490 bp gyrA gene showed an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 829 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of gyrA showed>or=72% identity to Helicobacter hepaticus, Helicobacter pylori and Wolinella succinogenes. Moreover, >or=98% amino acid sequence identity was found comparing the QRDR of the H. pullorum type strain with the QRDRs of the aforementioned bacterial species. All ciprofloxacin-resistant poultry isolates showed an ACA-->ATA (Thr-->Ile) substitution at codon 84 of gyrA, corresponding to codons 86, 87 and 83 of Campylobacter jejuni, H. pylori and Escherichia coli gyrA genes, respectively. This substitution was functionally confirmed to be associated with the ciprofloxacin-resistant phenotype of poultry isolates. This is the first report describing the complete 2490 bp nucleotide sequence of H. pullorum gyrA and confirming the involvement of the Thr84Ile substitution of GyrA in ciprofloxacin resistance of H. pullorum.
