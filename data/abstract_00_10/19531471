Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid signal transmitter present in blood. Blood plasma S1P is supplied from erythrocytes and plays an important role in lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs. However, the S1P export mechanism from erythrocytes to blood plasma is not well defined. To elucidate the mechanism of S1P export from erythrocytes, we performed the enzymatic characterization of S1P transporter in rat erythrocytes. Rat erythrocytes constitutively released S1P without any stimulus. The S1P release was reduced by an ABCA1 transporter inhibitor, glyburide, but not by a multidrug resistance-associated protein inhibitor, MK571, or a multidrug resistance protein inhibitor, cyclosporine A. Furthermore, we measured S1P transport activity using rat erythrocyte inside-out membrane vesicles (IOVs). Although the effective S1P transport into IOVs was observed in the presence of ATP, this activity was also supported by dATP and adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate. The rate of S1P transport increased depending on S1P concentration, with an apparent K(m) value of 21 microm. Two phosphorylated sphingolipids, dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate and ceramide 1-phosphate, did not inhibit S1P transport. Similar to the intact erythrocytes, the uptake of S1P into IOVs was inhibited by glyburide and vanadate but not by the other ABC transporter inhibitors. These results suggest that S1P is exported from the erythrocytes by a novel ATP-dependent transporter.
