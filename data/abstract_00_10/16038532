The aim of this study was to determine the antifungal susceptibility profile and to detect resistant strains of yeast species isolated from neonates in Intensive Care Units. 92 strains isolated from 25 bloodstream cultures, 20 venous catheters, 23 suprapubic aspirations and 24 rectal swabs were studied. A Candida glabrata strain resistant to fluconazole was detected. Candida krusei appeared with its inherent resistance to fluconazole and showed cross-resistance to itraconazole. Two Candida albicans strains were resistant to azoles, one to itraconazole and the other to fluconazole with a high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for itraconazole. All Candida tropicalis strains were susceptible to fluconazole but two of them showed resistance to itraconazole. The detection of resistant strains in neonates whom had not received previous antifungal therapy is noteworthy. The variations in the epidemiology of fungal infections observed and the antifungal resistance detected emphasize the importance of performing a regular surveillance to observe and to assess them.
