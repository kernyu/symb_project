Forty-three Shigella sonnei isolates from adult patients with diarrhoea in Dakar were analysed for the presence of integrons. Isolates were resistant to sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline, streptomycin and spectinomycin. A high prevalence of class 2 integrons (93%) was found. These integrons showed three distinct structures: a class 2 integron, part of the Tn7 family and its derivatives, carrying four cassettes in the order dfrA1-sat-aadA1-orfX; a truncated class 2 integron, without orfX; and a third type ca. 4 kb in size. These class 2 integrons probably play a role in the spread of multiresistance in S. sonnei isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first description of class 2 integrons in S. sonnei isolated in sub-Saharan Africa.
