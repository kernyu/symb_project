We investigated the enzymatic efficiency and inhibition by quinolones of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA gyrases carrying the previously described GyrA G88C mutation and the novel GyrA G88A mutation harbored by two multidrug-resistant clinical strains and reproduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Fluoroquinolone MICs and 50% inhibitory concentrations for both mutants were 2- to 43-fold higher than for the wild type, demonstrating that these mutations confer fluoroquinolone resistance in M. tuberculosis.
