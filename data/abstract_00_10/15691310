BACKGROUND: Previous reports revealed no resistant strains of amoxicillin (AMPC), which is usually used in eradication therapy for H. pylori infection. However, the frequency and evolution of natural AMPC-resistant strains in the Japanese population remains unknown. AIM: To assess the prevalence of H. pylori resistance against AMPC in the Tokyo area, a collection of 648 H. pylori strains isolated from patients with GI diseases from 1985 to 2003 was tested for their sensitivity to AMPC. METHODS: The susceptibility of the strains was assessed by determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the E-test and/or the Dry-plate method. The susceptibility breakpoints of AMPC for H. pylori were: sensitive (AMPC-S); MIC < 0.04 microg/ml, intermittent resistance (AMPC-I); 0.04-1, resistant (AMPC-R); > 1. RESULTS: No AMPC-R strains were detected in the strains isolated between 1985 and 1996, while the rate of resistance was determined to be 1.1%, 2.1%, 5.4%, 5.6%, 0%, 8.8%, and 1.5% every year, respectively, from 1997 to 2003. The percentage of AMPC-I strains increased from 2000 to 2003. The total eradication rate of H. pylori in the patients who received triple therapy containing AMPC was 81.4% (214/263). Classified as above, the rates of AMPC-S, AMPC-I, and AMPC-R were 84.6%, 77.8%, 25%, respectively. CONCLUSION: H. pylori resistance to AMPC is still rare in Japan, although the percentage of AMPC-I strains has increased over the last 4 years. The frequency of isolation of strains showing true resistance to AMPC may increase in the future, along with an increase in the frequency of isolation of AMPC-I strains.
