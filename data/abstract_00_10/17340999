Upper respiratory tract consists resident and transient bacterial microflora, which in appropriate condition can cause infection. Bacteriological study was performed among 201 patients with upper respiratory tract infections treated in ambulatory. From nasal and pharyngeal swabs Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococci group A, B, C, G were isolated. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of isolated strains was performed using CLSI criteria. All isolated strains of streptococci were susceptible to penicillin; some of them demonstrated resistance to macrolides and lincosamides. Few isolated strains of H. influenzae demonstrated resistance to penicillin and cotrimoxazole. Azitromycin resistant strains were not detected. All isolated strains of M. catarrhalis were beta-lactamase positive and demonstrated resistance to penicillin. Strains of methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) were isolated most frequently from pharyngeal swabs (35.4%) and S. pneumoniae (33.3)--from nasal swabs.
