A chromosomal gene (mdrL) was found in Listeria monocytogenes L028, showing a high degree of similarity with multidrug efflux transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (family 2). An allele-substituted mutant of this gene failed to pump out ethidium bromide and presented lower minimal inhibitory concentrations of macrolides, cefotaxime and heavy metals. This is the first multidrug efflux pump described in Listeria.
