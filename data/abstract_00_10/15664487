A dose-decreasing immunocompetent sepsis mouse model was used to evaluate the in vivo effect of levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, using a ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin susceptible serotype 6B strain (ciprofloxacin MIC: 1 mg/l) and two resistant serotype 14 and 19F strains with gyrA and parC point mutations (ciprofloxacin MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively). Significant higher in vivo activity was found for moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin than for levofloxacin against strains 1 and 2, and for gemifloxacin versus moxifloxacin or levofloxacin against strain 3. Gemifloxacin treatment resulted in 100% survival against strains 1 and 2(AUC0-24 h/MIC of 30 and 62) but against strain 3, survival was 60-80% (AUC0-24 h/MIC of 93). Similar AUC0-24 h/MIC values produced different therapeutic results suggesting that in vitro parameters other than the MIC could influence efficacy predictions based on in vitro susceptibility tests (MICs) or pharmacodynamic parameters (AUC0-24 h/MIC).
