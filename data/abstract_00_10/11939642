The need for strategic planning for antimicrobial use has reached a critical point. The rise in resistant nosocomial and community gram-positive bacteria mandates appropriate antibiotic selection and dosing. The development of new compounds is not the answer, because many are based off existing structures to which bacteria have already developed resistance. New antimicrobial agents are falling to the resistant mechanisms developed by the bacteria, after only limited clinical exposure. Judicious use of antimicrobial agents and applying pharmacokinetic principles when dosing can help slow the rate of resistance.
