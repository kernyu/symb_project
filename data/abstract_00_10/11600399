BMS-284756, a novel des-fluoro(6)-quinolone, was used to select for in vitro mutants of Staphylococcus aureus ISP794. Step mutants were obtained, and the quinolone resistance-determining regions of four target genes, gyrA, gyrB, grlA, and grlB, were sequenced. The data suggest that DNA gyrase is the primary target for BMS-284756 in S. aureus.
