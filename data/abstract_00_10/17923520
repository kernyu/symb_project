A 2.9-kilobase pair locus in Neisseria meningitidis was identified as containing transcriptionally linked open reading frames encoding TolC- and HlyD-like proteins. Although the meningococcal TolC protein was required for extracellular production of the repeats-in-toxin (RTX) FrpC toxin, it could not functionally replace the MtrE protein as the outer membrane protein channel for drug export by the MtrC-MtrD-MtrE efflux pump.
