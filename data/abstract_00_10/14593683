Treatment of hospital infections caused by multidrugresistant pathogens like Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella needs microbiological monitoring from the beginning of therapy. Inadequate antimicrobial therapy decreases the possibility of positive outcome. Risk of resistance development should be monitored for every new antimicrobial agent. Cefepime is a new, parenteral, broad-spectrum, fourth-generation cephalosporin, an effective agent in the treatment of bacterial infections. Modification of the cefepime molecule gives rapid penetration into the bacterial cell, resulting in rapid bactericidal effect. Cefepime does not have the propensity to provoke septic shock due to bacterial endotoxins. It is also one of the three available antimicrobials (carbapenems, piperacylin/tazobactam, cefepime) with very good activity against many resistant nosocomial pathogens. Combination of cefepime with amikacin is thought as the most effective treatment of infections due to multidrugresistant Pseudomonas spp.
