AIM: To determine the prevalence of diabetic foot according to severity of disease, causing microorganism, resistance pattern of microorganism, and blood glucose level of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients at Koja Regional General Hospital, to provide additional information to improve patient follow-up. METHODS: This study is designed as a descriptive cross-sectional study. The population in this study consists of patients with diabetes mellitus patients admitted and treated at the internal medicine outpatient clinic of Koja Regional General Hospital from January 1999 to December 2004. RESULTS: We obtained a prevalence of diabetic foot according to the causal microorganisms as follows: Pseudomonas (40.9%), followed by Staphylococcus (29.5%). The prevalence of diabetic foot according to the blood glucose groups were: 9.5% having random blood glucose concentration of 150-200 mg/dl, 9.3% 201-250 mg/dl, 30% 251-300 mg/dl, and 30% >300 mg/dl. According to Wagner classification, most cases were classified as 0 degree, highly effective antibiotics treatment followed by fifth degree at 13.5%. In addition, the Pseudomonas were Cefotaxim 53.8% and Ceftriaxon 41.5%. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, the most common cause of diabetic foot is Pseudomonas, and the effective antibiotics treatment is Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxim. The prevalence of diabetic foot has increased along with increased blood glucose level, and according to Wagner classification, 0 degree was the most common, but fifth degree was also higher than 2nd to 4th degree.
