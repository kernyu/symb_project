The in vitro susceptibility of 29 clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans to fluconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, flucytosine, nystatin and amphotericin B was tested by broth and colorimetric microdilution methods. Most of the isolates showed uniform patterns of susceptibility to the used antifungal agents. Only three isolates exhibited resistance [fourfold or greater rise in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)] to the tested antifungal drugs. The MIC50 and MIC90 were 0.5-8 mg l(-1) for 5-flucytosine, 0.2-8.25 mg l(-1) for nystatin, 0.5-16 mg l(-1) for fluconazole and 0.2-12.5 mg l(-1) for miconazole. However, MIC50 and MIC90 were in narrow range for the clinical yeast isolates in both methods used and showed 0.5-1 mg l(-1) for amphotericin B and 0.016-0.25 mg l(-1) for both ketoconazole and itraconazole. The combination of fluconazole plus flucytosine showed greater synergistic and fungicidal activity compared with that of fluconazole plus amphotericin B or the use of individual drugs.
