OBJECTIVES: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are frequently colonized by macrolide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a result of maintenance macrolide therapy. As transmission of S. aureus between household contacts is common, we examined the prevalence of macrolide-resistant S. aureus colonization in CF patients on maintenance azithromycin therapy and their household contacts and compared this with the S. aureus macrolide resistance prevalence in the community. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five CF patients on maintenance macrolide therapy and 194 household contacts were screened for S. aureus colonization by culturing sputa, cough swabs and nasal swabs. Resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and methicillin was determined by disc diffusion tests. The prevalence of macrolide-resistant S. aureus colonization in both groups was compared with figures from a nationwide study into S. aureus carriership and resistance. To assess possible transmission, genotyping of S. aureus was performed using the spa-typing method. RESULTS: Macrolide resistance among CF patients with S. aureus colonization was 69.6%; 75% of these isolates displayed lincosamide resistance too. Among household contacts, macrolide resistance prevalence did not differ significantly from resistance prevalence in the community (9.6% versus 6.3%; P = 0.358). No methicillin resistance was observed. No identical (macrolide-resistant and -susceptible) S. aureus genotypes were observed between CF patients and their household contacts except for one household, suggesting a probable transmission. CONCLUSIONS: No significant increase in macrolide-resistant S. aureus colonization was observed among household contacts of CF patients on long-term azithromycin therapy. Transmission of macrolide-resistant S. aureus could not be proved by genotyping in the majority of households.
