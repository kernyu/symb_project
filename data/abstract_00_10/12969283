AIMS: The aim of this study is to determine the in vitro activity of allicin against Staphylococcus epidermidis and to evaluate the influence of allicin on biofilm formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro activity of allicin (diallyl thiosulphinate) against 38 strains of S. epidermidis was investigated. The activity of allicin was similar against S. epidermidis methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant strains [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90=8 mg l(-1)]. In general, subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MIC) of allicin diminished biofilm formation in the five strains analysed. CONCLUSION: The results confirm the antibacterial effect of allicin. Sub-MICs of allicin also diminished the biofilm formations by S. epidermidis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study shows that allicin is active in vitro against S. epidermidis and that sub-MICs of allicin may play a role in the prevention of adherence of this bacteria to medical devices.
