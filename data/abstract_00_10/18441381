The 15th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections maintained its place as the premier meeting for presentation of the state of the art of antiretroviral therapy. This year brought together data on new antiretroviral agents in the pipeline, updated our knowledge base of agents approved in the past year (eg, maraviroc, raltegravir, etravirine), delineated approaches to management of treatment-naive and -experienced patients and the use of drugs for prevention of maternal-to-child transmission, and refined our expanding knowledge of drug resistance. A particular highlight of this year's conference was the progress made in antiretroviral treatment and research in resource-limited settings as reflected in both the number and quality of presentations emanating from the developing world.
