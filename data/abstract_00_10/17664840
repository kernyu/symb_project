Resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents is emerging in bacterial pathogens throughout the world. Since the accuracy of the antimicrobial susceptibility data is associated with the performance standard of the test, strict adherence to the standard procedures is essential. The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion susceptibility test, performed in accordance to NCCLS method gives reliable results and hence predicts clinical efficacy of the antibiotic tested. To assess the standard of performance of the antimicrobial susceptibility test, a survey was conducted by National Institute of Biologicals during 1999-2000. The findings indicated an urgent need of setting up a national quality control laboratory to provide the performance standards, reference Q.C. strains and quality antibiotic discs to ensure reproducible and reliable results.
