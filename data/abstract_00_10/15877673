BACKGROUND: Peritonitis has a significant impact upon morbidity and mortality of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Gram-positive organisms account for the majority of infections and vancomycin is a cost effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment for PD peritonitis, but this may lead to the emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant organisms. The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate the efficacy of a non-vancomycin-based protocol comprising cephazolin and gentamicin, which was introduced in the present PD population as empirical treatment for peritonitis. METHODS: The study involved 82 peritonitis episodes over a 4-year period in 58 patients, excluding those with previous methicillin-resistant staphylococcal peritonitis. RESULTS: With cephazolin and gentamicin there was no apparent difference in response or relapse rates in comparison to reported studies using vancomycin-based first-line therapy protocols. CONCLUSION: We advocate initial treatment of PD peritonitis with non-vancomycin-based therapy given similar efficacy and the potential for reduction of resistant organisms.
