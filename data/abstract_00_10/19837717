OBJECTIVES: Erythromycin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae is still increasing worldwide. All 78 erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates collected from blood cultures in our hospital (2000-07) were studied and the population structure was analysed by using different mathematical diversity indexes. METHODS: Erythromycin resistance determinants were screened by PCR. The population structure, including multilocus sequence typing, was analysed by using quantitative clonal diversity (diversity ratio, Simpson, Selander-Levin and Shannon mathematical indexes). RESULTS: The leading resistance gene was erm(B) (74.3% of the isolates), followed by the erm(B) plus mef(A) combination (17.9%) and mef(A) alone (7.7%). The most frequent serotypes were 14 (18%), 19A (15.4%) and 6B (11.5%). A polyclonal structure was detected in resistant strains, including the Spain(9V)-3, Spain(6B)-2 and Denmark(14)-32 international clones. Both genetic diversity and genetic distribution were high, particularly among clones containing erm(B) and erm(B) plus mef(A) determinants. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance determinants erm(B) and the combination of erm(B) plus mef(A) were observed within multiple S. pneumoniae bacteraemic clones. The preservation of a polyclonal structure might provide a suitable background for further evolution of antibiotic resistance.
