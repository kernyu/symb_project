There is no special signs of neutropenia therefore it is usually diagnosed due to an acute infection or laboratory control. Infections acquired during chemotherapy induced myelosuppression may further deteriorate the neutropenia in cancer patients. There are many possible cause of fever in cancer patients but in case of neutropenia infection is the most likely reason. If febrile neutropenia occurs immediately broad spectrum intravenous antibiotic treatment should be initiated. Recently introduced aggressive chemotherapy protocols further increased the number of neutropenic patients. Therefore it would be important to prevent febrile neutropenia. Unfortunately the available data still insufficient to make any conclusions regarding the efficacy of short or long term prophylactic treatment. While there are generally accepted recommendations of empiric antibiotic therapy no such options are available regarding prophylactic treatments. The decision regarding prophylactic treatment (similarly to empiric therapy) should be based on the resistance of the dominant pathogens in a therapeutic unit. Several study had been conducted regarding prophylactic administration of antibiotics the results however contradictory. Considering the advantages and disadvantages, the prophylactic antibiotic treatment of neutropenic patients could be suggested only in certain cases.
