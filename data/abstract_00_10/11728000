The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is perhaps the best-studied eukaryotic organism. Its experimental tractability, combined with the remarkable conservation of gene function throughout evolution, makes yeast the ideal model genetic organism. Yeast is a non-pathogenic model of fungal pathogens used to identify antifungal targets suitable for drug development and to elucidate mechanisms of action of antifungal agents. As a model of fundamental cellular processes and metabolic pathways of the human, yeast has improved our understanding and facilitated the molecular analysis of many disease genes. The completion of the Saccharomyces genome sequence helped launch the post-genomic era, focusing on functional analyses of whole genomes. Yeast paved the way for the systematic analysis of large and complex genomes by serving as a test bed for novel experimental approaches and technologies, tools that are fast becoming the standard in drug discovery research
