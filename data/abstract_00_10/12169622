Mutations causing rifampin resistance in vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis 168 have thus far been mapped to a rather restricted set of alterations at either Q469 or H482 within cluster I of the rpoB gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. In this study, we demonstrated that spores of B. subtilis 168 exhibit a spectrum of spontaneous rifampin resistance mutations distinct from that of vegetative cells. In addition to the rpoB mutations Q469K, Q469R, and H482Y previously characterized in vegetative cells, we isolated a new mutation of rpoB, H482R, from vegetative cells. Additional new rifampin resistance mutations arising from spores were detected at A478N and most frequently at S487L. The S487L change is the predominant change found in rpoB mutations sequenced from rifampin-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The observations are discussed in terms of the underlying differences of the DNA environment within dormant cells and vegetatively growing cells.
