The aim of this study was to assess colonisation and transmission of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) from patients in 16 intensive care units. A prospective, repetitive point prevalence survey was performed over 6 months, involving samples from 1851 patients. CRE were isolated from 186 (10%) patients, with Enterobacter spp. being the most common. Mean point prevalence rates were significantly higher for paediatric wards (22.5%) compared to surgical (8.1%) and medical (5.5%) units. All CRE isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Non-outbreak nosocomial transmission rates of these pathogens were calculated as 12.8% for paediatric patients, compared to 6.8% for adult patients, which may reflect differences in sensitivity to overgrowth with resistant bacteria and contact with health care workers.
