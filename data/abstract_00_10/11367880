Anthelmintic resistance of nematodes to benzimidazoles and ivermectin was suspected from field observations in an Angora goat herd in northern Hesse. Larvae of the caprine trichostrongyle isolate were used for artificial infections of helminth-naive sheep. Groups of the lambs were treated with albendazole (3.8 mg/kg p.o.) or ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) four weeks after infection or remained untreated as controls and were necropsied one week later. Albendazole reduced the mean faecal egg counts by 82% and the mean worm counts of Haemonchus contortus by 22%, Ostertagia circumcincta by 10% and Trichostrongylus colubriformis by 41% as compared with the controls. Ivermectin was 100% effective. This is the first report from Germany of multispecific resistance to benzimidazoles in a trichostrongyle population of goats.
