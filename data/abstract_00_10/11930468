Antimicrobial resistance is not a new concept. For over half a century, health care providers have been faced with this problem. The overuse and misuse of antimicrobial therapy by health care providers has contributed largely to the problem, but several other factors have also been associated with antimicrobial resistance. This article reviews current literature regarding antimicrobial resistance in an effort to educate health care providers to make judicious decisions in the treatment of bacterial infections and stem the rise of antibiotic resistance by carefully scrutinizing prescribing practices. Contributing factors to antimicrobial resistance and recommendations for the control of antimicrobial resistance will be reviewed. Treatment recommendations for common health ailments (i.e., acute otitis media, rhinitis, sinusitis, and pharyngitis) are provided.
