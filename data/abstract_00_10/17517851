This work identifies an ISCR1-related bla(CTX-M-14) gene, which has never been reported before, from a clinical isolate of Escherichia coli. The bla(CTX-M-14) gene was preceded by an ISCR1 element that was followed by a class 1 integron containing three different insert gene cassettes, i.e., dfrA12, orfF, and aadA2.
