The aims of this study were to gain insight into the dynamics of the rectal flora during prolonged ICU stay, with a particular focus on colonization and cross-transmission with resistant pathogens, and to evaluate methods for the rapid isolation of relevant bacteria from rectal swabs. Patients admitted to a general intensive care unit (GICU) or a cardiothoracic ICU (TICU) at the University Hospital of Linkoping, Sweden, between 1 November 2001 and January 2002 with a length of stay > 5 d were included (n = 20). Chromogenic UTI agar medium was used for discrimination of different species, and appropriate antibiotics were added to detect resistance. Direct plating was compared to enrichment broth for a subset of specimens. The study showed an early alteration in rectal flora, with a dramatic decrease in Gram-negative rods in favour of Gram-positive bacteria. An ampicillin- and high-level gentamicin resistant clone of Enterococcus faecium was found in 6 of 10 patients in the GICU and 2 of 11 patients in the TICU. Enrichment broth did not enhance the detection of Gram-negative bacteria compared to direct plating on Chromogenic UTI medium, but enrichment broths were needed for optimal detection of resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
