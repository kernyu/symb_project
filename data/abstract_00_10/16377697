Streptococcus pneumoniae M22 is a multidrug-resistant mutant selected after exposure of capsulated wild-type S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 (strain M4) to ciprofloxacin. DNA microarray analysis comparing the gene expression profiles of strain M22 with those of strain M4 showed that strain M22 constitutively expressed 22 genes at levels higher than those observed in strain M4 under all conditions studied. These included the genes encoding the enzymes involved in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis and two genes (patA and patB) with sequences suggestive of ABC transporter proteins. Expression of the patA and patB genes was induced by ciprofloxacin in both strains, but in strain M4 it only reached the levels observed in strain M22 after long incubation with high concentrations of ciprofloxacin. The altered expression profile observed with strain M22 suggested that the mutation or mutations acquired during resistance selection bring the cell into a state in which the expression of critical genes is preemptively altered to correct for the potential effects of ciprofloxacin on gene expression in the parent strain.
