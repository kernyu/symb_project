OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a new scoring system to differentiate high-risk hydatidiform mole (H-mole) and initiate early selective postmolar chemotherapy. STUDY DESIGN: According to Kim's scoring system, 262 patients were identified as high-risk H-mole patients. Fifty (19.1%) received early chemotherapy, and the rest constituted the control group. Salvage therapy with etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D/etoposide, cisplatin (EMA/EP) and taxol, cisplatin/taxol, etoposide (TP/TE) was applied in 21 cases of ultra-high-risk GTT. RESULTS: None of the 50 cases in the early chemotherapy group progressed to persistent GTT. However, 58.9% in the control group developed GTT with 8.0% drug resistance. Of those receiving salvage therapy in the 21 ultra-high-risk GTT cases resistant to EMA/CO, 10 of 14 (71%) receiving EMA/EP and 4 of 7 (57.1%) receiving TP/TE achieved remission. CONCLUSION: Early postmolar chemotherapy for high-risk H-mole is effective in preventing progression to persistent GTT and treatment failure. Ultra-high-risk GTT should be approached with multimodal treatment, including EMA/EP and TP/TE regimens.
