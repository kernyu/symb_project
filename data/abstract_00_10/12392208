Since malignant glioma displays moderate resistance to conventional therapy, a new treatment modality is needed to improve the outcome of patients with these tumors. In this study, we examined whether combination stimulation with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and retinoic acid (RA) affected proliferation of the glioblastoma cell line GB 12 in vitro. Stimulation with IFN-alpha alone inhibited the GB 12 cell proliferation in a dose/time-dependent fashion, as assessed by WST-1 assay and uptake of 3H-thymidine, while RA limited it only slightly. The anti-proliferative action of IFN-alpha against glioblastoma cells was enhanced by the addition of RA. The IFN-alpha/RA combination also induced apoptosis in a substantial portion of the cells, compared with either reagent alone. Bcl-2 family proteins, regulating apoptosis, were altered by these stimuli: Bcl-2 was down-regulated, while Bax-alpha was up-regulated, especially by the combination. These findings suggest that the IFN-alpha/RA combination would synergistically affect glioblastoma cell growth, probably through apoptosis induction as well as a decreased cellular DNA synthesis.
