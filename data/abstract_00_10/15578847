Using NMR inversion recovery experiments and XPLOR distance restraint calculations, we recently deduced the structure of ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FPIX) heme mu oxo dimer-antimalarial drug complexes for chloroquine (CQ), quinine (QN), and quinidine (QD) at atomic resolution [A. Leed et al., Biochemistry 2002, 41, 10245-55]. Using similar methods, we now report an unexpected structure for the complex formed between FPIX and the related drug amodiaquine (AQ). The deduced structure is further supported by comparing AQ chemical-shift data to restricted Hartree-Fock calculations. The structure further highlights the critical nature of quinoline drug side-chain composition in stabilizing noncovalent association to FPIX. Heme Fe-AQ proton distances are longer, relative to those of the CQ complex, and the AQ aromatic side chain seems to have a significant role in stabilizing the complex. Relative to the FPIX-CQ complex, a similar 2:1 stoichiometry was determined for the AQ complex, in contrast to a 4:1 stoichiometry previously suggested from calorimetry data. These solution structures add to our rapidly growing understanding of the mechanism of quinoline antimalarial drug action and will help elucidate the mechanism(s) of quinoline antimalarial drug resistance phenomena.
