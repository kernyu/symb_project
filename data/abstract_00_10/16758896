The content of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) genes, coding the synthesis of staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C (sea, seb, sec) and the toxin of the toxic shock syndrome (tst-H) which was classified with pyrogenic toxins of superantigens (PTSAgs), was studied with the use of PCR amplification. The study revealed the specific features of the content of genes sea and sec, detected in epidemic strains, identified earlier and found to circulate in Russian hospitals. Among the isolates, genetically related to international epidemic strain EMRSA-1, isolates containing no gene sea were detected, while among the isolates genetically related to strain EMRSA-2, isolates containing not only gene sea, but also gene sec were detected, which was indicative of the tendence of this epidemic strain in the direction of further acquisition of pathogenicity genes. As revealed in further studies, among the cultures obtained in bacteriemia, 88% contained gene sea. Two out of three isolates obtained from patients with the symptoms of toxic shock also contained this gene. The differences in the content of genes PTSAgs (sea, seb, sec and tst-H) could serve as a genetic criterium for the differention of isolates circulating in a hospital, as well as for a more complete characterization of the epidemic strains MRSA. The determination of the given genetic markers in genetic strains in circulating strains will make it possible to prognosticate the structure, severity and outcomes of hospital infections. The conditions of PCR amplification for the determination of genes sea, seb, sec and tst-H, as well as multiplex PCR for the determination of genes sea and seb, were developed.
