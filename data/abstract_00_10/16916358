AIM: To evaluate the influence of immersion in NaOCl on resistance to cyclic fatigue fracture and corrosion of ProTaper NiTi Rotary instruments. METHODOLOGY: A total of 120 new ProTaper NiTi Rotary files (F2) were randomized and assigned to three different groups of 40 each. Group 1 was the control group; 20 mm (excluding the shaft) of group 2 instruments were immersed in 5% NaOCl at 50 degrees C for 5 min; instruments in group 3 were completely immersed in 5% NaOCl at 50 degrees C for 5 min. All instruments were then tested for cyclic fatigue, recording the time in seconds to fracture. Data were analysed by the Kruskall-Wallis test and post-hoc multiple comparisons (P < 0.05). Micromorphological and microchemical analyses were also completed by means of a field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on those instruments in group 3 that had undergone early fracture. RESULTS: Instruments in group 3 had a significantly lower resistance to fracture because of cyclic fatigue than those in groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.001). In some instruments in group 3, early fracture occurred after only a few seconds of fatigue testing. SEM observations revealed evident signs of corrosion of the fractured instruments. CONCLUSION: Group 3 had significantly reduced resistance to cyclic fatigue compared with instruments in groups 1 and 2. The phenomenon of early fracture may be attributed to galvanic corrosion induced by the presence of dissimilar metals, where one acts as the cathode of a galvanic couple, established when the instrument is immersed in NaOCl solution. The NiTi alloy may acts as the anode and thus undergoes corrosion.
