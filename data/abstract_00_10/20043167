The phenotypic and genetic characteristics of resistance to macrolides and lincosamides among 72 Ureaplasma urealyticum clinical strains isolated in Guangzhou, China were investigated in this study. Strains were studied by resistance phenotyping, detection of resistance genes (ermB, msrA, msrB, msrC, and msrD), and determining the significance of an association between the presence of resistance genes and the int-Tn gene (a genetic marker of transposon). The ermB, msrA, msrB, msrC, and msrD genes were obtained in 21, 1, 12, 0, and 24 strains, respectively. The msrB and msrD genes were detected in strains of macrolides (M) or macrolides-streptogramin B (MS) resistance phenotype, and the ermB gene was detected in strains of M or macrolide-lincosamide (ML) phenotype in U. urealyticum. Statistical analysis revealed that only the ermB gene was closely associated with the int-Tn gene. It was concluded that U. urealyticum harbored the ermB, msrA, msrB, and msrD genes which confer resistance to macrolides and (or) lincosamides. The ermB gene may be located in the U. urealyticum transposon.
