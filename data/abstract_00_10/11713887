A casual association between Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis remains unresolved but plausible. Evidence comes from sero-epidemiological data, pathological specimen examinations, animal models and in vitro experiments. A number of prospective antibiotic intervention trials targeted against C. pneumoniae infection in patients with coronary heart disease are now underway. We remain wary that C. pneumoniae infection can persist in cell lines (associated with atherosclerosis) despite antibiotic therapy and also that reactivation of infection can occur. Issues such as delineating the patient group that could be targeted for treatment, choice of optimal antibiotic regimens, duration of therapy and effective methods of monitoring treatment response remain controversial and, as yet, unresolved. The relevance of persistence of C. pneumoniae infection and potential antimicrobial resistance will require equal consideration.
