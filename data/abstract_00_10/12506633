Salmonella infection in children caused by polyresistant S. typhimurium strains is characterized by a highly severe course with possible complications. In the treatment of young children with salmonellosis the use of the locally manufactured biologically active additive Bektit-M, possessing adsorption capacity, is recommended. The use of this preparation in complex treatment has made it possible to establish its clinical effect and positive influence on the biochemical characteristics of the blood.
