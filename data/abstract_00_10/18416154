The susceptibility of 47 antibiotics including 16 clinically important antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method for 58 enterococcal strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of long-livers in 1978-1981. Among the isolates tested, no resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics was found in 9% of strains, 12% of strains demonstrated intermediate susceptibility to 1-6 clinically important antibiotics, and 79% of strains demonstrated resistance to 1-7 therapeutically important antibiotics.
