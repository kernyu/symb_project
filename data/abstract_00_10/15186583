This study examines the utility of HIV genotypic resistance testing (GT) in pregnant women at their initial pregnancy evaluation. A retrospective medical record review of 50 consecutive HIV-infected pregnant women in whom GT was obtained in the Bronx, New York was conducted. Twenty-eight (56%) were antiretroviral experienced, including 12 on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at time of GT. Major mutations were found in 11 (24%) of 45 amplifiable GTs. Major resistance mutations were identified against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in six (13%) patients; against non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in eight (18%) patients, and against protease inhibitors in two (4%) patients. Duration of ART exposure was significantly associated with identification of resistance mutations by GT for NRTIs and NNRTIs (P < or =0.05). Results of this study indicate that GT at presentation may have implications on the initial choice of ART in up to one-quarter of HIV-infected pregnant women, especially with current or prior antiretroviral use.
