PURPOSE: To test whether exposure to an extremely low frequency magnetic field (60 Hz, 5 mT) affects hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death in human leukaemia HL-60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were treated with H2O2 with or without exposure to an extremely low frequency magnetic fields. Viable cells, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined by annexin V flow cytometry assay. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3, caspase-7, Bcl-2 and Bax) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were detected using Western blotting. RESULTS: Simultaneous treatment with exposure to the magnetic field and H2O2 (85 or 100 microM) for 24 h increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells significantly, and significantly decreased the number of viable cells compared with cells treated with H2O2 alone. The protein levels of Bax and Bcl-2 showed no differences between H2O2-treated cells and those treated with both H2O2 and an extremely low frequency magnetic field. Exposure to the magnetic field also had no effect on H2O2-induced caspase-3 activation. However, the protein levels of active caspase-7 in cells simultaneously exposed to an extremely low frequency magnetic field and H2O2 for 2 and 8 h was higher than that of H2O2 treatment alone. In addition, simultaneous exposure to an extremely low frequency magnetic field and H2O2 caused poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and induced early inactivation at 2 h, while H2O2 treatment alone did not produce this effect until 4 h. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that although the magnetic field itself cannot induce apoptosis and necrosis, it exerts a promoting effect on H2O2-induced cell death, and it demonstrates that caspase-7 as well as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase might be involved in this process.
