Development of resistance is an increasing problem for antimalarial chemotherapy because resistance against most available drugs has developed in the majority of world-wide parasite populations. Therefore, several strategies to counteract resistance-development are in place. From the pharmaceutical side, identification of new targets and compounds, development of structural relatives of known antimalarials, and fixed combination therapy are pursued. On the other hand, clinical studies focus on novel regimens, distribution schemes and drug combinations. A third possibility to diminish progression of resistance is the application of evolutionary concepts to design new strategies for validation, monitoring and interference with the selection-process that leads to the spread of multidrug-resistance. Since the pharmacologic and clinical side of antimalarial chemotherapy is covered by recent reviews we refer to the newest developments only and lay our focus on determinants of selection for drug resistance in human malaria.
