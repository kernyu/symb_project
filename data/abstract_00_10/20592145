Detection of the bla(VIM-12) gene within the originally described Inh12 integron in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae is reported for the first time worldwide. Integron Inh12 was carried on a conjugative plasmid of approximately 85 kb which also conferred resistance to aztreonam, likely due to AmpC production.
