Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) is a type of Staphylococcus that is resistant to certain antibiotics. These antibiotics include methicillin and other more common antibiotics such as oxacillin, penicillin and amoxicillin. Staphylococcus infections, including MRSA, occur most frequently among persons in hospitals and healthcare facilities. The present study was performed to investigate the in vitro activity of oxacillin and other antimicrobial agents against S. aureus strains obtained from nursing personnel. The study included 56 hospital personnel of Universitary Policlinic of Messina. S. aureus strain was isolated in 14 samples (25%); resistent patterns have been studied and results have demonstrated: none methicillin resistant, while 14% oxacillin and tetraciclin resistant. The incidence of methicillin sensitive was 100%, while 86% proved to be sensitive to oxacillin and tetraciclin. In conclusion, the usually hygienic methods (disposable gowns, hygienic hand disinfection after each patients contact, masks use when is a risk of aerosolization of MRSA) are indicate for significantly reducing of these strains. Continuing education programmes can help to increase awareness among hospital staff.
