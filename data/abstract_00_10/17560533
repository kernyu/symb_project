Twenty-two nitrate nonutilizing (nit) mutants were recovered from five wild-type isolates of Fusarium graminearum and fifty nit mutants were recovered from three JS399-19-resistant mutants of F. graminearum cultured on MMC medium. Some biological properties were compared between nit mutants and their parental isolates. The results showed that there were no significant differences in growth rate, cultural characters or pathogenicity between JS399-19-resistant nit mutants and their parental isolates. But the conidial production and the sexual reproduction ability changed to some extent. There was no cross resistance toward chlorate and JS399-19 in F. graminearum and the resistance could be stable through 20-time subcultures. Therefore, the nit could be used as a genetic marker for studying the genetics of JS399-19 resistance in F. graminearum which was used to study JS399-19 resistance transferability in hyphal fusion. Resistance in JS399-19 could not be transferred by hyphal fusion or could be transferred with low chance between two compatible isolates, which would delay the development of JS399-19 resistance in the field.
