PURPOSE: To report a case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sclerokeratitis after pterygium excision. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 72-year-old woman who had undergone pterygium excision 6 months ago was referred for severe pain and decreased visual acuity. Although infectious scleritis caused by Pseudomonas was diagnosed clinically, and intravenous amikacin and ceftazidime and topical ciprofloxacin were started, there was no improvement. MRSA was grown in a cultured test, and topical and systemic vancomycin was applied and resolved the corneoscleral inflammation. Scleral patch graft and sliding conjunctival flap were performed, and no complications or recurrences were found through 14 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA should be considered as a possible organism in infectious scleritis after pterygium excision, especially when beta-lactam antibiotic therapy is ineffective.
