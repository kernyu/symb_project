Diseased plants often display phenotypes consistent with hormone perturbations. We review recent data that have revealed roles in plant-microbe interactions for cellular components and signaling molecules that previously were associated only with hormone signaling. A better understanding of cross-talk between hormonal and defense signaling pathways should reveal new potential targets for microbial effectors that attenuate host resistance mechanisms.
