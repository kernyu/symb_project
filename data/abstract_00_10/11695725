One hundred children aged 0-60 months, 63 males and 47 females, were studied prospectively over a period of 9 months to determine the effect of persistent malaria parasitemia on their packed cell volume (PCV) levels. Thick and thin blood films for parasite identification and counts were done. Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: 62 patients received chloroquine, while 38 patients received fansidar. Mean parasite count (2789.2+/-1809.6) and mean temperature (36.83 (0.66 degrees C) in the fansidar group at day 7 were found to be significantly lower than at enrollment (p < 0.05). This also corresponded with significantly higher mean PCV values of 33.85+/-4.72 (p < 0.05). In the chloroquine group it was only by day 21 that a significant reduction in parasite count and associated increase in PCV levels were noted. A negative correlation between mean parasite counts and PCV levels was observed (r = -0.9512). The hematological recovery time for chloroquine was longer at 21 days compared to fansidar which was 7 days. RII level of parasite resistance was found in 81 patients, 32 in the fansidar group, and 49 in the chloroquine group. The level of resistance to the used first-line antimalarials was found to be rather high in Enugu, south-east Nigeria. This calls for more extensive community-based studies and probable changes in drug policies.
