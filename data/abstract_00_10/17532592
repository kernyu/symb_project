Between 2002 and 2003, 736 nonduplicate Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from blood cultures were collected from 7 of 10 Canadian provinces (10 tertiary care centers). Microdilution broth susceptibility testing was performed using the method prescribed by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Of the isolates, 16.85% were nonsusceptible to penicillin and 5.4% were highly resistant. Of the S.pneumoniae, 14.1% had reduced susceptibility to erythromycin and 47% had been accounted for by the M phenotype. No isolates were recovered that were resistant to telithromycin. Only 6 isolates were resistant to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin. Of these, 5 strains had intermediate susceptibility to moxifloxacin and 1 was considered susceptible. The rates observed in this study are in keeping with previous surveillance studies among noninvasive isolates.
