The susceptibilities of 24 Helicobacter pylori isolates, which were originated from clinical materials, to 5 beta-lactam antibiotics [benzylpenicillin (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), cephalothin (CET), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotiam (CTM) and imipenem (IPM)], two macrolides [clarithromycin (CAM) and rokitamycin (RKM)], two aminoglycosides [amikacin (AMK) and gentamicin (GM)], two new quinolones [ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and levofloxacin (LVFX)], two tetracycline [tetracycline (TC) and minocycline (MINO)], rifampicin (RIF) and chloramphenicol (CP) were tested. All of the isolates showed similar susceptibilities against beta-lactam antibiotics. However, MICs of CTM and CAZ were two- to four-fold higher than those of PCG, ABPC, CET and IPM, MICs of rokitamycin for the tested strains were higher than those of clarithromycin. MICs of CPFX and LVFX showed two-modal distributions. The first peak of distributions was observed between 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml and second one was between 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. These distributions suggested that MIC values of 4 to 16 micrograms/ml could result from the expression of a resistance mechanism. In addition, some of H. pylori strains were observed drug resistances between CP and AMK, new quinolones and AMK respectively. From the molecular epidemiological study, cryptic plasmids were detected from the 3 isolates among 24 strains tested.
