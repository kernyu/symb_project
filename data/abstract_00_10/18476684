3,7-Bis(dialkylamino)phenoxazinium salts were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro activities against Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi, T. brucei rhodesiense, and Leishmania donovani. Notably, the compounds showed potent antiprotozoal activities, especially against P. falciparum and T. cruzi. The compounds with alkyl side chains less than three carbons in length possessed good activities with high selective indices.
