An extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-M-15 type)-producing Escherichia coli persisted in the intestinal tract for >5 months in a pediatric patient after cord blood stem-cell transplantation and caused 2 episodes of sepsis. The bla(CTX-M-15) is carried by a large plasmid of approximately 130 kb in size. The prolonged shedding of the highly resistant E. coli posed a great challenge to infection control and public health.
