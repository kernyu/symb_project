This study was done to evaluate the in vitro activity of a new ketolide telithromycin in comparison with clarithromycin, erythromycin, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 67), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 139), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 46)collected between January and June 2003 in Hong Kong. Among the H. influenzae isolates, 25.2% produced beta-lactamase, while 97.8% of M. catarrhalis isolates produced beta-lactamase. Half of the S. pneumoniae isolates were nonsusceptible to penicillin, and 90.9% of these strains were resistant to clarithromycin and erythromycin. One (1.5%) S. pneumoniae strain was resistant to levofloxacin (MIC = 8 mg/l) and all isolates were sensitive to moxifloxacin and telithromycin with MIC <1 mg/l. H. influenzae isolates were sensitive to all fluoroquinolones tested and 2.2% of H. influenzae were resistant to clarithromycin. M. catarrhalis isolates were sensitive except 1 strain which was resistant to levofloxacin (MIC = 4 mg/l) and moxifloxacin (8 mg/l). All M. catarrhalis strains were sensitive to telithromycin with MIC90 = 0.5 mg/l. Telithromycin demonstrated high activity and no resistance was found in all these major respiratory tract pathogens.
