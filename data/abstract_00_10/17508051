CASE REPORT: We report a case of community-acquired bleb-related endophthalmitis caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in a 79-year-old woman. COMMENTS: VRE has usually been considered a nosocomial infection of immune-compromised patients, but ophthalmologists should be alert to the possibility of community-acquired eye infections caused by VRE, particularly in those countries with a high VRE community reservoir.
