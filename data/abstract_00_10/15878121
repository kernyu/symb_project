BACKGROUND: Photodynamic killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria may be an alternative to the systemic application of antibacterial drugs used in the treatment of periodontal diseases. Even though the method is still in the experimental stage, increasing bacterial resistance problems may promote the introduction of photodynamic therapy (PDT) into periodontal practice. AIM: In this review a literature survey is given of PDT as seen from a periodontal perspective. METHODS: In this review, the present knowledge and experience of PDT is summarized. Literature data are presented on drawbacks of conventional antibiotics, the mechanism of PDT, bactericidal effects of PDT as well as results of clinical efforts. The future prospects of the method are discussed. RESULTS: The application of photosensitizing dyes and their excitation by visible light enables effective killing of periodontopathogens. Encouraging studies using PDT in periodontitis and in peri-implantitis are known. CONCLUSION: Even though PDT is still in experimental stages of development and testing, the method may be an adjunct to conventional antibacterial measures in periodontology. Clinical follow-up studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of the procedure.
