We report a case involving a 75-year-old lady who presented to our department of ophthalmology complaining of a 1 day history of ocular pain and reduced vision in the right eye, associated with rigors and diarrhoea. This patient, who had undergone a right carotid endarterectomy (CEA) 4 days previously, was subsequently confirmed to have developed endogenous endophthalmitis. To our knowledge, endogenous endopthalmitis has not previously been described as a postoperative complication of CEA, and should be considered in patients presenting with ocular complaints after this type of surgery.
