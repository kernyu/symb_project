BACKGROUND: New antibiotics efficacious in infections caused by resistant Gram-positive microorganisms and with acceptable costs for national health systems per unit of effectiveness are needed. OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to summarize all available evidence regarding the pharmacoeconomics of linezolid. METHODS: A systematic review of pharmacoeconomic analyses through a non-restricted literature search was conducted. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid, as compared to vancomycin and teicoplanin, results in a reduction of the necessary resources for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive microorganisms. These benefits are attributable to clinical outcomes and to savings associated with the ease of switching from intravenous to oral administration, the shorter duration of intravenous therapy and earlier hospital discharge. Likewise, linezolid, compared to vancomycin and teicoplanin, is a cost-effective treatment.
