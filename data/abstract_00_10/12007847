The main object of this study was to describe the evolution of antibiotic resistance in pneumococci from adults, in eight French counties of France between 1995 and 1997. Despite the high and increasing prevalence (23-35%) of pneumococci with diminished susceptibility to penicillin G (PSDP), resistance to amoxycillin (0.8-0.5%) and to cefotaxime (0-0.3%) was rare in both 1995 and 1997 respectively. The percentage of pneumococci resistant to penicillin G (PRP, minimum inhibitory concentration >1 mg/l) remained stable between the two periods. PSDP showed increased resistance to macrolides (30-41%), to cotrimoxazole (28-34%) and to tetracycline (19-25%). These figures are lower than those obtained over the same periods and the same regions in children. The distribution of PSDP serotypes isolated in adults was the same as that seen in children: by descending order serotypes 23, 14, 9 and 6. This study by the Regional Pneumococcal Observatories confirms the high prevalence and the main characteristics of antibiotic resistance among pneumococci with variations in levels of resistance with the age of patients, with the site of sampling and from one Observatory to another.
