We evaluated the effect of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor saquinavir on the imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines. Saquinavir, which is also a proteasome blocker, showed dose- and time-related anti-proliferative activity, particularly on the imatinib-resistant lines and a pro-apoptotic effect. Association with imatinib caused a significant increase of activity.
