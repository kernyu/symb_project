Hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) secreted by the liver during inflammation that plays a central role in mammalian iron homeostasis. But the function of hepcidin in fish is still not completely understood. We recently described three different hepcidins (named tilapia hepcidin (TH)1-5, TH2-2, and TH2-3) from tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus, the cDNA sequences were determined, the predicted peptides were synthesized, and the TH2-3 peptide showed antimicrobial activity against several bacteria. We hypothesized that TH2-3 may have a biological function like an AMP in fishes and can be used as a transgene to boost resistance against bacterial infection. To examine the antimicrobial effects of TH2-3, we produced and engineered the overexpression of TH2-3 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the convict cichlid (Archocentrus nigrofasciatus). The microinjected plasmid also contained a green fluorescent protein (GFP) which was used as an indicator to trace germline transmission. In vivo, transgenic TH2-3 fish (of the F3 generation) were challenged with Vibrio vulnificus (204) and Streptococcus agalactiae (SA). Results showed significant clearance of bacterial numbers of V. vulnificus (204) but not of S. agalactiae in transgenic TH2-3 fish. A gene expression study using a real-time RT-PCR revealed that transgenic TH2-3 zebrafish showed increased endogenous expressions of Myd88, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and TRAM1 in vivo. After transgenic TH2-3 zebrafish were infected with V. vulnificus (204), interleukin (IL)-10, IL-26, lysozyme, toll-like receptor (TLR)-4a, and Myd88 were upregulated, but IL-1beta (at 12-24 h) and IL-15 (at 1-12 h) were downregulated post-infection. After transgenic TH2-3 zebrafish were infected with S. agalactiae, IL-1beta (at 1-24 h), IL-15 (at 6 h), IL-22 (at 1-6 h), and TLR3 (at 1-24 h) were downregulated, but TLR4a (at 6-12 h) and c3b (at 12 h) were upregulated post-infection. Our findings identify the TH2-3 transgene in transgenic fish as an active component of the host response to bacterial pathogens. These results suggest that using TH2-3 as a transgene in zebrafish can effectively inhibit bacterial growth, specifically the V. vulnificus (204) strain for up to 24 h.
