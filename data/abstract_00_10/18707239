AIMS: This study aimed to describe the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) among pulmonary TB patients in rural China and to determine the extent of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) circulating in areas with varied duration of Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) implementation. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two rural counties in eastern China: Deqing with over 10 years' DOTS implementation and Guanyun under its second year of DOTS. The subjects were all culture-positive pulmonary TB patients newly diagnosed or re-treated during 12 months of 2004-2005. The proportion method was used for drug susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Among the 399 subjects, 283 were new TB cases and 116 were previously treated. The rates of overall resistance (i.e., resistance to at least one drug) in new cases were 50.4% (67) and 63.4% (95), respectively, in Deqing and Guanyun (p = 0.028), and 67.3% (33) and 83.6% (56), respectively, in previously treated cases (p = 0.0410). The rates of MDR-TB in new cases were 3.8% (5) in Deqing and 14.7% (22) in Guanyun (p = 0.0018), and 16.3% (8) and 34.3% (23) in previously treated cases (p = 0.0305). CONCLUSIONS: Newly diagnosed and previously treated TB patients from the short-term DOTS-covered county were at higher risk for overall drug-resistance TB and MDR-TB. Standardized diagnosis and treatment strategies for drug-resistant TB are urgently needed for effective control of MDR-TB in rural China.
