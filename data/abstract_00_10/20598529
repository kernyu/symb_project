A new series of 6-(4'-aryloxy-phenyl)vinyl-1,2,4-trioxanes 10a-d, 11a-d, and 12a-d have been synthesized and evaluated for their antimalarial activity against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium yoelii in Swiss mice by oral route. Trioxanes 10b and 10c, the two most active compounds of the series, provided 100% protection to the infected mice at 48 mg/kg x 4 days. Clinically useful drug beta-arteether provided 100% and 20% protection at 48 mg/kg x 4 days and 24 mg/kg x 4 days, respectively, in this model.
