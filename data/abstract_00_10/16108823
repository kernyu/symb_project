HLA-B27/beta2 microglobulin transgenic (TG) rats spontaneously develop T-cell-mediated colitis when colonized with normal commensal bacteria, but remain disease-free under germ-free conditions. We investigated regulation of in vitro T-cell responses to enteric bacterial components. Bacterial lysates prepared from the caecal contents of specific pathogen-free (SPF) rats stimulated interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by TG but not non-TG mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells. In contrast, essentially equivalent amounts of interleukin-10 (IL-10) were produced by TG and non-TG cells. However, when cells from MLNs of non-TG rats were cocultured with TG MLN cells, no suppression of IFN-gamma production was noted. Both non-TG and TG antigen-presenting cells (APC) pulsed with caecal bacterial lysate were able to induce IFN-gamma production by TG CD4+ cells, although non-TG APC were more efficient than TG APC. Interestingly, the addition of exogenous IL-10 inhibited non-TG APC but not TG APC stimulation of IFN-gamma production by cocultured TG CD4+ lymphocytes. Conversely, in the presence of exogenous IFN-gamma, production of IL-10 was significantly lower in the supernatants of TG compared to non-TG APC cultures. We conclude that commensal luminal bacterial components induce exaggerated in vitro IFN-gamma responses in HLA-B27 TG T cells, which may in turn inhibit the production of regulatory molecules, such as IL-10. Alterations in the production of IFN-gamma, and in responses to this cytokine, as well as possible resistance of TG cells to suppressive regulation could together contribute to the development of chronic colitis in TG rats.
