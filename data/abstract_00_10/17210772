The frequency of tetracycline resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in Poland is one of the highest in Europe. The aim of this study was to analyze the clonal diversity and resistance determinants of tetracycline-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae isolates identified in Poland and to investigate the effect of tetracycline resistance on their susceptibilities to tigecycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. We have analyzed 866 pneumococcal isolates collected from 1998 to 2003 from patients with respiratory tract diseases, and 242 of these (27.9%) were found to be resistant to tetracycline. All of the resistant isolates were characterized by testing of their susceptibilities to other antimicrobials, serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and identification of tetracycline resistance genes and transposons. Selected isolates representing the main PFGE types were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing. Among the isolates investigated, 27 serotypes and 146 various PFGE patterns, grouped into 90 types, were discerned. The most common PFGE type, corresponding to serotype 19F and sequence type 423, was represented by 22.3% of all of the tetracycline-resistant isolates. The tet(M) gene was the sole resistance gene in the group of isolates studied, and in over 96% of the isolates, the Tn916 family of tet(M)-containing conjugative transposons was detected. Several isolates contained specific variants of the transposons, the Tn1545-like, Tn3872-like, or Tn2009-like element. The correlation between the MICs of tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline was revealed, whereas no cross-resistance to tetracycline and tigecycline was observed.
