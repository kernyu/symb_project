BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant HIV mutants have been reported after prolonged dual antiretroviral therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and resistance pattern in HIV-infected children treated with dual NRTIs. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Records of HIV-infected children treated with dual NRTIs at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Thailand, were reviewed for baseline data and their consensually-stored plasma were checked for the occurrence of HIV mutants by genotyping. RESULTS: Fifty-seven HIV-infected children were treated with dual NRTI regimens (27 males; 30 females). The median age and median CD4+ T-lymphocyte at genotypic testing were 83.5 months and 10.9%, respectively. The median duration of ARV therapy was 22 months. More than half the children (42) were on zidovudine and didanosine. A set of three or more nucleoside analog mutations (NAMs), conferring multi-dideoxynucleoside resistance, was found in 60% of the cases. CONCLUSION: High percentages of NAMs were found in HIV-infected children previously on dual ARV therapy for long periods. Genotypic testing was helpful in designing the second antiretroviral regimen.
