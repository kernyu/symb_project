Between May 1996 and February 1997, 27 horses and a veterinary student at a veterinary teaching hospital developed apparent nosocomial Salmonella Typhimurium infection. The source of the multiple-drug resistant Salmonella Typhimurium was a neonatal foal admitted for treatment of septicemia. A high infection rate (approx 13% of hospitalized horses) coupled with a high case fatality rate (44%) for the initial 18 horses affected led to a decision to close the hospital for extensive cleaning and disinfection. Despite this effort and modification of hospital policies for infection control, 9 additional horses developed nosocomial Salmonella Typhimurium infection during the 6 months after the hospital reopened. Polymerase chain reaction testing of environmental samples was useful in identifying a potential reservoir of the organism in drains in the isolation facility. Coupled with clinical data, comparison of antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella Typhimurium isolates provided a rapid initial means to support or refute nosocomial infection. Although minor changes in the genome of these isolates developed over the course of the outbreak, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis testing further supported that salmonellosis was nosocomial in all 27 horses.
