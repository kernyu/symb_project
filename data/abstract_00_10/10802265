In 1995 the American Thoracic Society issued an official consensus statement on the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Classes of antimicrobials included in the list of antimicrobials deemed to be suitable for the empiric treatment of severe HAP were the aminoglycosides, quinolones, antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Aztreonam, a monobactam, was also listed and is unique among these agents based on its spectrum of activity being limited to the gram-negative bacillary bacteria combined with an excellent safety profile. This review focuses on the role of aztreonam in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill patient.A review of the literature was performed using PubMed and secondary literature sources as to the clinical efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections as well as its pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. An analysis of aztreonam's potential pharmacoeconomic advantages compared with other agents was also performed. Numerous studies have documented that aztreonam has effectiveness that is equal or superior to that of other suitable antibiotics in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. Its excellent safety profile makes it a particularly attractive agent compared with the aminoglycosides. Considering the potential costs of bacterial resistance from the use of broader-spectrum alternatives, a case can be made that aztreonam is a pharmacoeconomically sound choice as well.
