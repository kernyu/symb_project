We carried out complex genetic analysis of clinical samples containing N. gonorrhoeae DNA, the genotype and profile of drug resistance of this agent were evaluated. Changes in genes responsible for the formation of N. gonorrhoeae resistance to penicillins, fluoroquinolones, and spectinomycin were detected during minisequencing with subsequent MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The sensitivity of gonococcus was evaluated directly in the clinical sample without culturing.
