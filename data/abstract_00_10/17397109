Cell integrity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is ensured by a rigid cell wall whose synthesis is controlled by a highly conserved MAP kinase signal transduction cascade. Stress at the cell surface is detected by a set of sensors and ultimately transmitted through this cascade to the transcription factor Rlm1, which governs expression of many genes encoding enzymes of cell wall biosynthesis. We here report on a number of versatile reporter constructs which link activation of a hybrid, Rlm1-lexA, by the MAP kinase Mpk1/Slt2 to the expression of the bacterial lacZ gene. This system was adapted to automated microwell screening and shown to be activated by a number of compounds inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis or interfering with plasma membrane function. In addition, we tested tea tree oil and two of its purified constituents (alpha-terpineol, terpinen-4-ol) for their effects on growth and on cell integrity signalling using such reporter strains. Tea tree oil was found to inhibit growth of wild-type and slg1/wsc1 mutant cells at a threshold of approximately 0.1% v/v, with the purified compounds acting already at half these concentrations. A mid2 deletion displayed hyper-resistance. Tea tree oil also induces the signalling pathway in a dose-dependent manner.
