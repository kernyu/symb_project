The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein localizes in the nucleus both in the nucleoplasm and in matrix-associated multiprotein complexes known as nuclear bodies (NBs). The number and the intensity of PML NBs increase in response to interferon (IFN). Overexpression of PML affects the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus. However, PML has a less powerful antiviral activity against these viruses than the IFN mediator MxA. Here, we show that overexpression of PML, but not that of Mx1 or MxA, leads to a drastic decrease of a complex retrovirus, the human foamy virus (HFV), gene expression. PML represses HFV transcription by complexing the HFV transactivator, Tas, preventing its direct binding to viral DNA. This physical interaction requires the N-terminal region of Tas and the RING finger of PML, but does not necessitate PML localization in NBs. Finally, we show that IFN treatment inhibits HFV replication in wild-type but not in PML-/- cells. These findings point to a role for PML in transcriptional repression and suggest that PML could play a key role in mediating an IFN-induced antiviral state against a complex retrovirus.
