Planktonic and attached cells of strains of Candida albicans, C. glabrata and C. krusei with varied susceptibilities to fluconazole (FCZ) were compared for their relative susceptibilities to Ag+ via cell recovery and flow cytometric analyses. All strains lost membrane permeability and were non-recoverable upon culture after 1h exposure in morpholino-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer fortified with <or= 2.0 microg/ml Ag+. Cells attached to silicone over a 2-h period demonstrated enhanced tolerance to FCZ and to a lesser degree to Ag+. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of Ag+ in defined media increased in the order C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. albicans. Susceptibilities to Ag+ did not correlate with tolerance or resistance to FCZ.
