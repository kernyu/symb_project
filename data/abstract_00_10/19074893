Locally produced transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) promotes tumor-induced immunosuppression and contributes to resistance to immunotherapy. This article explores the potential for increased efficacy when combining immunotherapies with TGF-beta suppression using the TGF-beta type I receptor kinase inhibitor SM16. Adenovirus expressing IFN-beta (Ad.IFN-beta) was injected intratumorally once in established s.c. AB12 (mesothelioma) and LKR (lung cancer) tumors or intratracheally in a Kras orthotopic lung tumor model. Mice bearing TC1 (lung cancer) tumors were vaccinated with two injections of adenovirus expressing human papillomavirus-E7 (HPV-E7; Ad.E7). SM16 was administered orally in formulated chow. Tumor growth was assessed and cytokine expression and cell populations were measured in tumors and spleens by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. SM16 potentiated the efficacy of both immunotherapies in each of the models and caused changes in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of SM16 and Ad.IFN-beta increased the number of intratumoral leukocytes (including macrophages, natural killer cells, and CD8(+) cells) and increased the percentage of T cells expressing the activation marker CD25. SM16 also augmented the antitumor effects of Ad.E7 in the TC1 flank tumor model. The combination did not increase HPV-E7 tetramer-positive CD8(+) T cells in the spleens but did induce a marked increase in the tumors. Tumors from SM16-treated mice showed increased mRNA and protein for immunostimulatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as endothelial adhesion molecules, suggesting a mechanism for the increased intratumoral leukocyte trafficking. Blockade of the TGF-beta signaling pathway augments the antitumor effects of Ad.IFN-beta immune-activating or Ad.E7 vaccination therapy. The addition of TGF-beta blocking agents in clinical trials of immunotherapies may increase efficacy.
