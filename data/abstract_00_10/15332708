A Providencia rettgeri strain resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and intermediate to aztreonam was isolated from the urine of a patient hospitalized in the urology clinic of SSK Educational Hospital in Ankara. Clavulanic acid restored the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, suggesting that the strain was harboring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Since the PER-1 enzyme is widespread in Turkey, and had been already detected in a related species such as Proteus mirabilis, the Providencia strain was suspected of harboring a PER-1 enzyme, which was indeed detected by PCR. This is the first description in a P. rettgeri isolate of a PER-1 enzyme which is widespread among Acinetobacter baumanni and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in Turkey.
