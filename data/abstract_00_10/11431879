We treated 510 elderly case (over 65 years old) among 1,017 patients with community-acquired pneumonia and 60 similar cases among 112 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Kawasaki Medical School Kawasaki Hospital during approximately the past 15 years. These were compared with non-elderly cases (below 65 years old). In the elderly cases with community-acquired pneumonia, atypical clinical symptoms or physical signs were frequent and the mortality rate was high because of severe underlying diseases, and poor general and nutritional conditions. Regarding a prospective study of 84 elderly cases with community-acquired pneumonia during the past two years, S. pneumoniae, Respiratory virus, Gram-negative bacilli, H. influenzae, M. Tuberculosis were frequently isolated. In addition, mixed viral and bacterial infections, which were frequently noted during the winter, were significantly related to the increased frequency of community-acquired pneumonia. In treating elderly cases with community-acquired pneumonia, immunization therapy (e.g., influenza vaccine), second cephalosporin and/or macrolide antimicrobial agents for outpatients with mild pneumonia, and carbapenem and/or macrolide antimicrobial agents for hospitalized patients with moderate or severe pneumonia were most effective. The number of elderly cases with pulmonary tuberculosis has recently increased and the recognition of 10 cases was delayed because of a low percentage of positive smears, but no resistance to antituberculosis drugs have been observed. Regarding the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, fluoroquinolone and rifamycin derivative antibiotics have been developed as antituberculosis drugs with strong antituberculous activity. However, due to the high percentage of adverse effects in elderly patients, careful treatment with desensitization therapy for antituberculosis drugs is considered important.
