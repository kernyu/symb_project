PURPOSE: To evaluate the economic impact and the bacterial resistance rates after 2 years of a rationalized antibiotic prescription program in a 502-bed hospital. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Prescribing protocols were established by consensus in 1998 and were reinforced a year later by nominative dispensing of the most costly antibiotics. The impact of the program was assessed in terms of changes in the overall cost of antibiotics and in the pattern of bacterial resistance among pathogens isolated in the institution, during the period prior to the onset of the program (1997) and its realization (1998 and 1999). FUTURE AND PROJECTS: The expenses for antibiotic drugs decreased by 46% in 2 years. Resistance rates among the different pathogens studied have remained stable. No increase of mortality was observed. Our rational policy in antibiotic therapy had a positive economic impact. However, new additional measures should be encouraged to prevent antimicrobial resistance.
