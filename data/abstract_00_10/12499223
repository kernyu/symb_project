Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were exposed to linezolid (MIC of 2 mg/liter) under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model. Drug concentration and half-life were adjusted to simulate clinical dosing (600 mg twice daily) of linezolid. Linezolid produced a 2-log(10) killing at 24 h, and rates of killing against each of these facultative organisms as measured by mean survival time appeared similar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
