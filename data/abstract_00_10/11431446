PURPOSE: To determine the antiviral resistance of three cidofovir (CDV)-resistant variants of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) and their ability to replicate in the New Zealand White rabbit ocular model. METHODS: Rabbits were inoculated topically in both eyes with the CDV-resistant variants R1, R2, and R3, and the Ad5 parental strain. On day 1, rabbits from each virus inoculation were divided into two topical treatment groups: 0.5% CDV and PBS control. Treatment was administered twice daily in both eyes for 7 days. All eyes were cultured for virus on days 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14. Using viral outcome parameters, CDV resistance was determined for each virus by comparing each CDV-treated virus group to its respective PBS control, and altered pathogenesis was assessed by comparing viral replication in the PBS control groups of the Ad5 parent and the three resistant variants. RESULTS: Topical 0.5% CDV treatment demonstrated significant antiviral inhibitory activity in the Ad5 parental group (e.g., reduced total Ad5-positive cultures, reduced daily Ad5-positive cultures on days 5, 9, 11, and 14, and duration of ocular shedding), but had no effect on the three CDV-resistant variants. There were no significant differences in pathogenicity between the Ad5 parent and the CDV-resistant variants. CONCLUSIONS: The Ad5 variants R1, R2, and R3 were resistant to topical treatment with 0.5% cidofovir in the rabbit ocular model. However, the acquisition of CDV resistance did not alter the replication of the three Ad5 CDV variants on the rabbit eye.
