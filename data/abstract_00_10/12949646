Antitumor activity of ultralow doses of cytostatic lonidamine and effects of various biological preparations in ultralow doses (chemosensitizer, immunomodulator, and antioxidant) on the efficiency of adriamycin and cisplatin were studied in animals with transplanted tumors. High efficiency of this method was demonstrated. Nitrotriazole chemosensitizer in ultralow doses increased the sensitivity of leukemia P388/rn substrain with multiple drug resistance phenotype to mitomycin C during combination therapy.
