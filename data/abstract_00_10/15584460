UNLABELLED: As a nosocomial (NI) infection we describe this one acquired in hospital due to proper conditions for spreading of virulent microbes. This is old problem with new vision in the field of use of powerful antibiotics and fast growth microbial resistance. AIM OF THE STUDY: To make an retrospective clinical investigation about the rate, type and etiology of NI as well as duration and outcome of treatment in our clinic and to compare the data with these quoted in literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We use hospital charts about the period of 1990-1999. Distribution of NI types was according to CDC criteria. RESULTS: For the period were operated on 14 932 patients. In 918 (6.15%) of them a NI was diagnosed. Sex ratio was 56% (514) man and 44% (404) women with a mean age of 56 years. After the treatment of patients with NI 86.48% (805) of them got better. 13.52% (102) were with unsuccessful treatment and got lethal exit. In 78 (76.47%) of death patients a pneumonia NI was developed. 633 antibiograms were received with 63.03% monoinfections and 22.59% polyinfections. In 91 cases smears were sterile. CONCLUSIONS: NI are one of the reasons for prolonged hospital stay and death of patients although fast development of pharmacy and new antimicrobial agents. It was centered on their prophylaxis.
