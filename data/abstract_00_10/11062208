We evaluated the in vivo activity of levofloxacin alone or in combination with imipenem or amikacin in a mouse model of Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia using a susceptible strain and one with low-level resistance (MIC/MBC of levofloxacin: 0.06/0.06 and 4/4 mg/L, respectively). As demonstrated previously with other pathogens, the AUC/MIC ratio predicted the efficacy of fluoroquinolones against A. baumannii. This parameter correlated with bactericidal effect and survival. Combination therapy did not enhance the efficacy of levofloxacin.
