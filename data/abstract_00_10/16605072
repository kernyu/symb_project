We report the impact of the free access to health facilities on malaria morbidity in children from two to 15 years old, during a malaria transmission season in Niakhar, Senegal. Between July and December 2002, 227 malaria attacks occured in 566 children. Only one case of severe malaria was observed and no death has been reported. Our results demonstrate furthermore that easier access to health facilities and to early treatment is playing a key role in malaria control.
