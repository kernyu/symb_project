Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a commonly isolated organism from human clinical specimens and is gaining significance as a pathogen in immunocompromised patients and nosocomial infections. In most cases it is difficult to establish the source of human infections. In veterinary medicine, S. maltophilia is not generally considered a primary pathogen. In the present study, we report the occurrence of 16 cases of caprine abscess from which S. maltophilia was isolated in pure culture from 15 animals. In six animals, the abscesses were confined to the pre-scapular lymph nodes but in the remaining nine, the cutaneous abscesses were multiple and extended from the neck to the inguinal area. The possibility is suggested that goats in Oman, which often live in close proximity to humans, might potentially serve as a reservoir of infection.
