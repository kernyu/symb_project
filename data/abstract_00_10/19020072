During 6 months, we obtained Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients with gram-negative bacteremia at a 1,250-bed teaching hospital in St. Louis, MO, and compared carbapenem susceptibilities with the presence of bla(KPC), a transferable carbapenemase gene. Three (1.2%) out of 243 isolates were bla(KPC) positive. Ertapenem nonsusceptibility had a low positive predictive value.
