The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model system for studying pathways regulating responses to cocaine. We describe a new method for delivering cocaine to Drosophila. Freebase cocaine dissolved in ethanol is sprayed onto cold-anaesthetized flies using a graphic arts airbrush modified to reproducibly control the drug dosage. Cocaine dose response curves were generated to characterize the behavioral responses of flies using the airbrush method or the established cocaine smoke method of drug delivery. The stereotypic responses observed with the airbrush showed a dose-dependent increase and were qualitatively similar to those elicited by cocaine smoke. The variation in behaviors of flies dosed with the airbrush was smaller than that of the smoke-dosed flies, indicating that the airbrush method gives better reproducibility. Since flies are exposed to alcohol as well as cocaine in the airbrush behavioral paradigm, it was important to control for possible effects of ethanol. Control experiments indicated that none of the stereotypies elicited with cocaine were caused by vehicle alone and very little ethanol remains in the flies following this protocol. The utility of the airbrush method was demonstrated by its use in a pilot genetic screen that identified a cocaine resistant mutant.
