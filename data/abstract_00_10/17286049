A novel 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene of 1.35 kb was cloned from a cosmid library of Halomonas variabilis HTG7, inserted into vector pET-28a (+) and transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). EPSPS was over-expressed in soluble form after induction with IPTG at 30 degrees C and it showed a single band in SDS-PAGE, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 51 kD. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis showed that there is little homology with the aroA genes which encode glyphosate-tolerant EPSPS in known sources, such as E. coli K12 and Agrobacterium sp. CP4. The over-expressed EPSPS was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and detected by Western blotting analysis. Enzyme activity measurements demonstrated that there were 4.27 units/mg in cell extract, compared with 0.049 units/mg of the control. There is an 87-fold increase in specific activity for EPSPS.
