Rhodococcus equi is a facultative, intracellular, gram-positive coccobacillus increasingly reported as an opportunistic pathogen in patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). An HIV-positive man developed R. equi pneumonia and sepsis. He failed to improve despite surgical drainage of localized infection and many empiric antibiotics. Time-kill studies of R. equi isolated from the patient were performed against various antimicrobial agents to optimize therapy. Levofloxacin seemed to offer excellent in vitro bactericidal activity. Antagonism was observed with certain antibiotic combinations. Our anecdotal case report suggests that fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin may offer superior efficacy to standard therapy in rhodococcal infections; their clinical utility deserves further investigation. In view of potential antagonism, prospective susceptibility testing for various drugs and drug combinations should be considered when clinically indicated.
