The in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of amikacin, cefepime, and imipenem was studied using a high inoculum of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strain. An in vitro susceptibility test at the standard inoculum predicted the in vivo outcome of amikacin or imipenem while it did not do so for cefepime due to the inoculum effect.
