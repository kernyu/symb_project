The aim of this work was to evaluate the prevalence mutations in the rpoB, katG, inhA, ahpC gene of rifampicin and isoniazid resistant M. tuberculosis (Tb) isolates from Kyrgyz Republic using OA Biochip MDR. In the rifampicin-resistant strains, the mutations were identified in the codons 531, 526, 516, 511, 513, 512, 533, and 522. The most prevalent point mutations were Ser531RLeu at the codon 531 (59.7%). Resistance to INH was associated with mutations found in the katG gene (94.5%), inhA gene (3.5%), and ahpC gene (1.0%). The most prevalent mutations were SerRThr at the codon 315 (93.0%). The rifampicin and isoniasid resistance of the M. Tb strains isolated in Kyrgyzstan is associated mostly with Ser531RLeu mutation of the rpoB gene, Ser315RThr mutation of the katG gene, and InhT15 mutation.
