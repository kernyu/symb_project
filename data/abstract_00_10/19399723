INTRODUCTION: Currently, one of the most serious problems in medicine is the increasing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antimicrobial drugs. Bacterial resistance may potentially be solved in particular by decreasing the consumption of antibiotics and increasing the quality of their use. Equally important, however, is the development of new antimicrobial drugs and their use in clinical practice. One of the new antibiotic agents is tigecycline of the glycylcycline group. The presented work aimed at assessing its in vitro effect on selected multiresistant bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical samples were collected from patients hospitalized in the University Hospital Olomouc to isolate ESBL- and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In the isolates, susceptibility to tigecycline was determined by the standard microdilution method. RESULTS: A total of 350 isolates were tested (100 MRSA, 10 0 VRE, 100 ESBL-positive and 50 AmpC-positive enterobacteria). In the cases of VRE and MRSA, no resistance to tigecycline was detected and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) did not exceed 0.25 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. In ESBL-positive enterobacteria, 97% susceptibility (MIC range = or <0.06 to 4 mg/l) was detected; in AmpC-positive enterobacteria, the MIC range was = or <0.03-2 mg/l and susceptibility reached 98 %. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline may be considered a suitable alternative in the treatment of infections caused by the above-mentioned multiresistant strains.
