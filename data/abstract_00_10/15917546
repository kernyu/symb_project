Partial sequence analysis of a tet(O) plasmid from a multiple-drug-resistant clinical isolate of Campylobacter jejuni revealed 10 genes or pseudogenes encoding different aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes, transposase-like genes, and multiple unknown genes from a variety of pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The plasmid could be mobilized by a P incompatibility group plasmid into Escherichia coli, where it apparently integrated into the chromosome and expressed high-level resistance to multiple aminoglycoside antibiotics. This work provides new information about both the nature of drug resistance in C. jejuni and the ability of C. jejuni to exchange genes with other bacterial species.
