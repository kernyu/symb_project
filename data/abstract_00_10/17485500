Six tetraoxanes had 50% inhibitory concentrations in the range of 10 to 100 ng/ml against Plasmodium falciparum, whereas the corresponding hexaoxonanes had minimal antimalarial activity. The lack of iron-mediated reactivity of the hexaoxonanes may explain their low activity compared to the tetraoxanes, the latter of which are able to undergo iron(II)-mediated activation.
