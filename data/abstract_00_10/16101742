Accruing evidence indicates that gap junctions are involved in neuronal survival after brain injury. The present study was aimed at clarifying the contribution of the neuronal gap-junction protein connexin36 (Cx36) to secondary cell loss after injury in the mouse retina. A focal retinal lesion was induced by infrared laser photocoagulation. Remarkably, this model allowed spatial and temporal definition of the lesion with high reproducibility. Moreover, Cx36 is abundantly expressed in the retina and plays an essential role in the visual transmission process. Taking advantage of these features, cell death was assessed using TUNEL assay and light and electron microscopy, and the extent of Cx36 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, in situ hybridization and real-time RT-PCR. Secondary cell loss was most prominent between 24 and 48 h after lesioning. This peak was accompanied by an increase in Cx36 expression. When cultured explanted retinas were subjected to gap-junction blockers a significant increase in the extent of secondary cell loss after laser photocoagulation became evident. Using the same experimental paradigm we compared the incidence of cell death in wild-type and Cx36(-/-) mice. A significant increase in total number of TUNEL-positive cells occurred in the Cx36(-/-) mice compared to controls. From these data we conclude that Cx36 contributes to the survival and resistance against damage of retinal cells and thus constitutes a protective factor after traumatic injury of the retina.
