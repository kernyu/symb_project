In Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, efflux provides efficient extrusion of antibiotics and contributes to the multidrug resistance phenotype. One of the alkoxyquinoline derivatives studied here, 2,8-dimethyl-4-(2'-pyrrolidinoethyl)-oxyquinoline, restores noticeable drug susceptibility to resistant clinical strains. Analyses of energy-dependent chloramphenicol efflux indicate that this compound inhibits the efflux pump mechanism and improves the activity of structurally unrelated antibiotics on multidrug-resistant E. aerogenes and K. pneumoniae isolates.
