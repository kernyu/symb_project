Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been implicated in a variety of serious therapeutic problems in clinical environments. Among the 968 P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from two hospitals in Daegu, Korea, we acquired 17 isolates that were resistant to all available tested antimicrobial agents, with the exception of colistin (colistin-only sensitive). We characterized the antimicrobial susceptibilities, metallo-beta-lactamases, and epidemiological relatedness among the colistin-only sensitive P. aeruginosa isolates. All colistin-only sensitive isolates were positive in the modified Hodge test and imipenem-EDTA synergy test, thereby indicating the production of metallo-beta-lactamases. 11 isolates from the secondary hospital and six isolates from the tertiary teaching hospital harbored blaVIM-2 and blaIMP-1, respectively. The pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis of the SpeI-digested DNA from P. aeruginosa isolates indicated that two different clones of colistin-only sensitive P. aeruginosa originated from each hospital, and had spread within the hospital environment. Overall, colistin-only sensitive P. aeruginosa was detected in Korea for the first time, but no pan-drug resistant bacteria were identified. Nationwide surveillance is required in order to monitor the emergence of colistin-only sensitive or pan-drug resistant bacteria.
