The stability of a plastid transgene has been evaluated in soybean transformants over six generations. These transformants had integrated the aadA selection cassette in the intergenic region between the rps12/7 and trnV genes. Three independent homoplasmic T0 transformation events were selected and ten plants from each event propagated to generation T5 in the absence of selection pressure. No transgene rearrangement nor wild-type plastome were detected in generation T5 by Southern blot analysis. All tested progenies were uniformly resistant to spectinomycin. Therefore, soybean transformants of generations T0 and T5 appear to be genetically and phenotypically identical.
