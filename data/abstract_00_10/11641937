The results of the authors' investigations demonstrate that sandimmun in mean therapeutic doses given to patients with chronic glomerulonephritis produces nephrotoxic complications in rare cases even when nephroprotective vasodilators are not used. However, administration of the latter (nifedipin, tenziamin, etc.) improves renal hemodynamics that is increases effective renal plasm and blood flow to normal values, lowers renal vascular resistance after 2-3 months of therapy. In patients who have not received vasodilators normalization of renal hemodynamics occurs by the treatment month 6.
