The effect of topically applied retapamulin ointment was evaluated using various dosing regimens in the Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes wound infection model. Retapamulin (1%, wt/wt) was efficacious using twice-daily (b.i.d.) applications for 4 or 5 days. These data underpinned the decision to evaluate 1% retapamulin b.i.d. in clinical trials.
