In the two decades since AZT was first approved for clinical use in 1987, 24 additional antiretroviral agents have been approved. They include 7 nucleoside analogs, a nucleotide analog and 4 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 10 protease inhibitors, 2 entry inhibitors and an integrase inhibitor. More than 20 investigational agents are currently being studied in clinical trials. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which involves a combination of anti-HIV-1 drugs, is extremely effective in suppressing HIV-1 replication and increasing CD4+ number and results in substantial reductions in HIV-1-related morbidity and mortality. In last 20 years, much has been learned about resistance to antiretroviral drugs, drug interactions and metabolic complications of antiviral drug use. Drugs are now selected on the basis of resistance tests and on the risk of specific drug complications in individual patients. As a result, decisions about the therapy of HIV/AIDS have become personalized and are made on a patient-by-patient basis. With appropriate medical management, a person with HIV-1 now has the possibility of a nearly normal life expectancy.
