UNLABELLED: The frequency of invasive mycosis caused by Candida sp has increased significantly in immuno-compromised patients and in those under medical/surgical treatment; along with it, the use of azoles has fostered resistance. OBJECTIVE: To compare in vitro susceptibility techniques, susceptibility to fluconazol was determined by the M27-A2 method of CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute), the disk diffusion technique in 90 invasive Candida sp isolated species (49 C albicans, 30 C. tropicalis, 5 C parapsilosis, 4 C . guilliermondii and 2 C. lusitaniae) and the E-test in 16 isolated. RESULTS: Over 90% of strains were susceptible to fluconazol. A straight correlation between disk-diffusion technique and the E-test was observed regarding the reference method (0.944 and 0.938, respectively). CONCLUSION: In our institution the use of fluconazol for invasive candidiasis is recommended, as well as the routine use of the disk-diffusion or E-test techniques in high complex hospitals in Colombia.
