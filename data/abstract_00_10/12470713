N-Methylthio beta-lactams represent a novel family of antibacterial agents for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The structure-activity functions and mechanism of action of these compounds, although still largely undefined, differ dramatically from those of all previously reported beta-lactam antibiotics. Prior work has established that the N-alkylthio moiety is required for antibacterial activity, and that a variety of unsaturated groups can be tolerated at C(4) of the lactam ring. This report describes the effect that unsaturation within the C(4) substituent has on antibacterial activity of these interesting new N-thiolated beta-lactams.
