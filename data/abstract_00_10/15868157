For many years, device-associated infections and particularly device-associated nosocomial infections have been of considerable concern. Recently, this concern was heightened as a result of increased antibiotic resistance among the common causal agents of nosocomial infections, the appearance of new strains which are intrinsically resistant to the antibiotics of choice, and the emerging understanding of the role biofilms may play in device-associated infections and the development of increased antibiotic resistance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans are consistently identified as some of the more important agents of nosocomial infections. In light of the recent information regarding device-associated nosocomial infections, understanding the nature of P. aeruginosa and C. albicans infections is increasingly important. These two microorganisms demonstrate: (1) an ability to form biofilms on the majority of devices employed currently, (2) increased resistance/tolerance to antibiotics when associated with biofilms, (3) documented infections noted for virtually all indwelling devices, (4) opportunistic pathogenicity, and (5) persistence in the hospital environment. To these five demonstrated characteristics, two additional areas of interest are emerging: (a) the as yet unclear relationship of these two microorganisms to those species of highly resistant Pseudomonas spp and Candida spp that are of increasing concern with device-related infections, and (b) the recent research showing the dynamic interaction of P. aeruginosa and C. albicans in patients with cystic fibrosis. An understanding of these two opportunistic pathogens in the context of their ecosystems/biofilms also has significant potential for the development of novel and effective approaches for the control and treatment of device-associated infections.
