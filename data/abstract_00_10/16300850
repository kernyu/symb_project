Of 45 Escherichia coli O157 isolates from cattle feces, which were collected between May 2000 and September 2003 in Korea, 32 were resistant to at least 1 antibiotic and 28 were resistant to 4 or more antibiotics, with 32, 30 and 30 of the isolates being resistant to streptomycin, tetracycline and sulfisoxazole, respectively. Two isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to 10 or more of the 22 other antimicrobial agents that were tested. Thirteen antimicrobial resistant patterns were observed. The most frequent resistance type, which was found for 11 isolates, was streptomycin-tetracycline-kanamycin-ampicillin-piperacillin-cephalothin-sulfisoxa zole-ticarcillin. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the isolates for E. coli O157 virulence markers revealed that 25 of the resistant E. coli O157 isolates tested positive for stx2 or both stx1 and stx2 genes. These findings suggest that many of the resistant E. coli O157 isolates might cause disease in humans.
