Osteomyelitis is the inflammation of bone secondary to infection with pyogenic organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is usually associated with nosocomial infections and due to its ability to acquire resistance to almost all antibiotics, infections with Pseudomonas pose a great challenge to the physicians. A number of new synergistic combinations have been used in order to treat these organisms and one of the methods is to combine chemicals with systemic antibiotics. In this case we represent a successful eradication of multidrug resistant Pseudomonas using a combination of acetic acid and systemic antibiotics.
