The in vitro susceptibility profile of Borrelia burgdorferi is not yet well defined for several antibiotics. Our study explored the in vitro susceptibility of B. burgdorferi to mezlocillin, meropenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ribostamycin and fusidic acid. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal borreliacidal concentrations (MBCs) were measured using a standardised colorimetric microdilution method and conventional subculture experiments. MIC values were lowest for mezlocillin (MIC(90), < or =0.06 mg/l) and meropenem (MIC(90), 0.33 mg/l). Vancomycin (MIC(90), 0.83 mg/l) was less effective in vitro. Borreliae proved to be resistant to aztreonam (MIC(90), >32 mg/l), teicoplanin (MIC(90), 6.6 mg/l), ribostamycin (MIC(90), 32 mg/l), and fusidic acid (MIC(90), >4 mg/l). The mean MBCs resulting in 100% killing of the final inoculum after 72 h of incubation were lowest for mezlocillin (MBC, 0.83 mg/l). This study gathered further data on the in vitro susceptibility patterns of the B. burgdorferi complex. The excellent in vitro effectiveness of acylamino-penicillin derivatives and their suitability for the therapy of Lyme disease is emphasised.
