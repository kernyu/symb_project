OBJECTIVE: To prepare norA gene probe for studies on the mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones mediated by norA gene in S. aureus. METHODS: The Dig-labeled norA gene probe was made by PCR. RESULTS: This method is simple and feasible. We have got a lot of probes in a short time. The sensitivity of norA gene probe is high; the probe is secure, easy to use and can be stored for a long time. CONCLUSION: The probe is applicable to further studies on the mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones mediated by norA in S. aureus.
