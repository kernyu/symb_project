The study of sensitivity to antibiotic substances of different chemical structure and the mechanism of the antimicrobial action of hemolytic bacteria Bacillus sp., Corynebacterium sp. and Escherichia coli under the condition of high iron content in bacterial cells was carried out. An increase in antimicrobial resistance of iron-loaded Gram-positive bacteria, in contrast to Gram-negative ones, was shown.
