A total of 65 U. urealyticum cultures isolated from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases of the urogenital tract after their prolonged persistence of in the human body, were studied for sensitivity to medicinal preparations of different groups: tetracyclines (tetracycline and doxycycline), macrolids (erythomycin, clarithromycin, midecamycin, josamycin), quinolon (pefloxacin), amino glycoside (gentamicin), lincoamides (lincomycin, clindamycin). The majority of isolated U. urealyticun were highly sensitive to josamycin, clacide, doxycycline (89.2, 84.6, 76/9% respectively), and somewhat lesser number of these organisms were highly sensitive to midecamycin and pefloxacin (51.3 and 44.4% respectively). Among U. urealyticum strains circulating in the Moscow region some strains which persisted in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases of the urogenital tract for a long time were found to be resistant to erythromycin (23.1%), tetracycline (19.5%), and in very rare cases (1.6%) they were found to multiple drug resistance to all preparations under study. In view of the varying sensitivity of the clinical isolates of U. urealyticum to medicines and the presence of resistant forms in their population, the sensitivity of the isolated U. urealyticum should be determined in vitro prior to drug therapy.
