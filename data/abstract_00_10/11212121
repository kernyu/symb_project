New anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) agents endowed with H2-antagonists properties were obtained by combining the lamtidine derived pharmacophoric group with the antibiotic calvatic acid. All the compounds were tested for their irreversible H2-antagonist properties and for their ability to inhibit 20 H. pylori strains, two of them metronidazole resistant. The most active derivative (compound 4) displayed antimicrobial activity similar to metronidazole.
