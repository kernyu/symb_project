By now most clinically significant bacterial species have resistance mechanisms against almost all accessible antibiotics. One of the most significant nosocomial pathogens is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its antibiotic resistance directly correlates with higher morbidity, mortality and longer hospital stay. An essential condition for preserving the antibiotic efficacy against this pathogen is the exploration of its resistance mechanisms. To protect itself against the action of antibacterials, P. aeruginosa uses the cellular wall, which prevents the drug from entering the bacterium, as also an active efflux from the cell. It is also capable of modifying the molecule of the antimicrobial. The bacterium can effectively combine all these mechanisms and the result are multiresistant bacterial clones. The paper describes some diagnostic methods that reveal the resistance mechanisms of the species Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
