In vitro activity of caspofungin and voriconazole against 184 clinical isolates of Candida and other medically important yeasts in comparison with that of fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole and amphotericin B was determined by using a disk diffusion method (Neo-Sensitabs) standardized according to the recommendations of the CLSI documents M44-A and M44-S1 (same medium: Mueller-Hinton plus methylene blue; inoculum and minimal inhibitory concentration/zone breakpoints). Seventy-two percent of clinical isolates were susceptible to caspofungin, 23.6% showed an intermediate susceptibility (most of them were Candida parapsilosis) and 4.3% were resistant (values for Candida spp. were 71.2, 23.8 and 5%, respectively). For voriconazole, 96.7% of clinical isolates were susceptible and 3.3% were resistant (Candida spp.: 96 and 3.8%, respectively). Both caspofungin and voriconazole showed high activity against a wide variety of clinically important yeasts.
