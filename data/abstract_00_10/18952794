Early studies of the Bacteroides mobilizable transposon NBU1 established that excision, the first step in NBU1 transfer, requires exposure of the cells to tetracycline. More recently, we found that excision is also associated with growth phase; even after exposure to tetracycline, excision is detectable only after the cells enter late exponential phase. The tetracycline effect is mediated by a two-component regulatory system, RteA and RteB, which is provided in trans by an integrated self-transmissible element, CTnDOT. The rteA and rteB genes are part of a three-gene operon that also contains the tetracycline resistance gene tetQ. We report here that neither transcription nor translation of the tetQ-rteA-rteB operon is affected by growth phase. Moreover, RteA is not required for the growth phase effect, because a mutant form of RteB that does not require phosphorylation by RteA did not make excision independent of growth phase. Two conditions made NBU1 excision independent of growth phase. One was reducing the tetracycline concentration from an inhibitory concentration (1 microg/ml) to a subinhibitory level (0.05 microg/ml). Independence of growth phase also occurred when rteA and rteB were placed under the control of a heterologous maltose-inducible promoter, P(susA). Our results suggest that at low concentrations of tetracycline, ribosomes are capable of translating enough RteA and RteB for excision to occur. At higher tetracycline concentrations, however, TetQ is needed to protect enough ribosomes to allow the translation of excision genes, and this protection takes time to develop. Thus, subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline may increase the probability of gene transfer because, in contrast to inhibitory concentrations, excision can occur at all phases of growth.
