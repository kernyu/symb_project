In 1994, the Austrian Federal Ministry for Labour, Health and Social Affairs initiated a nationwide survey of the prevalence of methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Austrian hospitals. A questionnaire had to be filled out by the medical directors of participating hospitals. During the five years of surveillance (1994-1998), a total of 9385 MRSA and 71510 MSSA episodes of infection/colonization were reported. The rate of MRSA decreased from 15.8% in 1994 to 8.2% in 1998. However, the frequency per 1000 hospital admissions increased from 0.85 to 1.29 with a maximum of 2.42 MRSA episodes per 1000 admissions in 1997. Overall, in 53.6% of 5020 S. aureus episodes, signs and symptoms of an infection were reported, of these 9.3% (251/2692) were due to MRSA. For large hospitals with more than 1000 beds, 20.9% of reported MRSA episodes were associated with infection, 54.9% of MRSA episodes from hospitals with 301-1000 beds, 60.1% from hospitals with 101-300 beds, and 80.0% from small hospitals with less than 100 beds. Our data do not support the hypothesis of higher virulence of MRSA compared with MSSA. Indeed, in this survey, MSSA episodes were more frequently associated with signs and symptoms of infection (OR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.12-1.62, P<0.001).
