Here we report the results of the Sentinel Project 2000 and give the susceptibility to selected antibiotics of 108 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 108 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. In P. aeruginosa, susceptibility to aztreonam and ciprofloxacin was lower than 50%. The resistance rate to beta-lactams was up to 25% and to amikacin 15.7%. Blood isolates showed 80-90% susceptibility to all antibiotics tested except for aztreonam and tobramycin. Overall, oxacillin resistance in S. aureus was 45%, reaching 64.3% among the bronchoalveolar lavage isolates, and 42.9% among the blood isolates. These worrying results confirm the need for continuous monitoring of bacterial resistance trends in the hospitals, mainly in ICUs.
