Three type A influenza viruses, each of which has a distinct neuraminidase-gene mutation and is resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, have been isolated. Previously, in the ferret model, an R292K mutant of a type A (H3N2) virus was not transmitted under conditions in which the wild-type virus was transmitted. This model was used to investigate whether the E119V mutant of a type A (H3N2) virus and the H274Y mutant of a type A (H1N1) virus would be transmitted under similar circumstances. Both mutant viruses were transmitted, although the H274Y mutant required a 100-fold-higher dose for infection of donor ferrets and was transmitted more slowly than was the wild type. Both the mutant and the wild-type viruses retained their genotypic characteristics.
