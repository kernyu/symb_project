During 1997-1999, a total of 70,067 isolates (6631 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates) were analyzed in the SENTRY program by geographic region and body site of infection. The respiratory tract was the most common source of P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa isolation rates increased during the study interval. Europe was the only region to show a significant decline in beta-lactam and aminoglycoside susceptibility rates. There was a reduction in the rates of susceptibility of Canadian isolates to imipenem and of Latin American isolates to meropenem. A total of 218 multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates (MDR-PSA; resistant to piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin) were observed; MDR-PSA occurrence rates (percentages of all isolates) ranged from 8.2% (Latin America) to 0.9% (Canada). No antimicrobial inhibited >50% of MDR-PSA strains. Molecular characterization of selected, generally resistant strains was performed. Isolates showing unique ribogroups were found in Europe, Latin America, and the United States, but clonal spread was documented in several medical centers.
