We analysed 336 non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) isolated from children <13 years of age with bacteraemia admitted to a rural district hospital in Kenya from 1994 to 2005. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine genetic relatedness of strains, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was also performed. Most NTS were either Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (n=114; 33.9%) or S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (n=128; 38.1%), with minimal genotypic diversity over the study period. The NTS showed a remarkable decrease in levels of resistance especially to two commonly available antimicrobials (amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole), from high of 69.2% and 68.4% during 1994-1997 to 11% and 13%, respectively, in 2002-2005 (P<0.01). All NTS remained fully susceptible to cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin. Our findings show that commonly available drugs may still be useful for treatment of invasive NTS infections in this rural population.
