The emergence of the bacterial antibiotic multi-resistance made more and more stringent the developing of new anti-microbial strategies. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of six (6) newly synthesized chemical compounds (derivating from phenantroline and dimethylguanin-copper complex combinations) versus 97 enterobacterial strains isolated from the hospital environment. The qualitative screening of the antimicrobial activity of the chemical compounds was performed by an adapted diffusion method. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the active chemical compounds were established by Mueller Hinton broth microdillution method. The tested chemical compounds were also tested for their ability to inhibit microbial adherence and biofilm development on inert substrata by a simple microtiter method. All six chemical compounds proved to have antimicrobial activity versus the most of the tested strains, the phenantroline derivatives exhibiting higher antimicrobial activity than the dimethylguanidine-copper complex combinations. The subinhibitory concentrations of the tested chemical products slightly inhibited the adherence ability of the bacterial strains to the inert substratum. Our results demonstrated that phenantroline derivatives may represent a new strategy of antimicrobial treatment, simultaneously with the bactericidal effect, the subinhibitory concentrations of these newly synthesized chemical compounds decreasing the adherence ability of bacteria to the inert substratum.
