We describe what we believe to be the first documented case of Mycobacterium goodii infection in Europe. It is also the second documented report of a pacemaker pocket surgical site infection caused by M. goodii. Although rarely involved in such infections, rapidly growing mycobacteria should be recognized during conventional bacteriological investigations and further identified by molecular tools to provide adequate therapy. In the present case, antimicrobial therapy with doxycycline without removal of the pacemaker was successful.
