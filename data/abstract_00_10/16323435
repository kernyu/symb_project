Daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide, was susceptibility tested against clinical bacterial isolates consecutively collected in hospitals located in Europe (4,731 strains) and Latin America (1,007 strains) in 2003 as part of a continuing surveillance program. The bacterial isolates tested were Gram-positive pathogens that included staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci. The isolates were tested for susceptibility using broth microdilution methods (broth with 50 mg/L Ca++ for testing daptomycin). All isolates, except two Enterococcus faecium strains from Europe, were inhibited at daptomycin MIC of < or = 4 mg/L. In addition, 99.4 and 97.3% of isolates were inhibited at daptomycin MIC of < or = 2 and < or = 1 mg/L, respectively. Except for one Staphylococcus aureus and one viridans group streptococci from Europe and one coagulase-negative staphylococci from Latin America, all staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were inhibited by 1 mg/L of daptomycin. Resistance to other compounds (vancomycin, oxacillin, and penicillin) did not influence daptomycin activity. The activity of daptomycin was very similar in both geographic regions evaluated and demonstrated the same MIC distribution as isolates evaluated in studies in the United States. The results of this study showed that daptomycin continues to be very active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci isolated in Europe and Latin America.
