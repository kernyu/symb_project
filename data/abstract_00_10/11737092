Two cases, probably related, of fungemia due to Scedosporium prolificans are described in two patients with acute leukemia. Both were admitted to the hematological ward in nearby rooms, during building work in the hospital. After a previous bacterial sepsis in the neutropenic phase, which improved with antibiotic treatment, the respiratory status in both patients deteriorated presenting acute dypsnea, with a lung infiltrate in one of them. A few hours later both patients died. Blood cultures were positive for S. prolificans. These two new cases of S. prolificans infection stress the importance of awareness of this emerging pathogen in patients who suffer a hematologic malignancy during the neutropenic phase, especially if building work is taking place in the hospital.
