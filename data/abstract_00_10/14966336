With the widespread emergence of antimicrobial resistance, combination regimens of ceftriaxone and vancomycin (C+V) or ceftriaxone and rifampin (C+R) are recommended for empirical treatment of pneumococcal meningitis. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of meropenem (M), we compared various treatment regimens in a rabbit model of meningitis caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). Therapeutic efficacy was also evaluated by the final bacterial concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 24 hr. Each group consisted of six rabbits. C+V cleared the CSF at 10 hr, but regrowth was noted in 3 rabbits at 24 hr. Meropenem monotherapy resulted in sterilization at 10 hr, but regrowth was observed in all 6 rabbits at 24 hr. M+V also resulted in sterilization at 10 hr, but regrowth was observed in 2 rabbits at 24 hr. M+V was superior to the meropenem monotherapy at 24 hr (reduction of 4.8 vs. 1.8 log10 cfu/mL, respectively; p=0.003). The therapeutic efficacy of M+V was comparable to that of C+V (reduction of 4.8 vs. 4.0 log10 cfu/mL, respectively; p=0.054). The meropenem monotherapy may not be a suitable choice for PRSP meningitis, while combination of meropenem and vancomycin could be a possible alternative in the treatment of PRSP meningitis.
