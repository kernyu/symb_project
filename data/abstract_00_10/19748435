Two hundred fifty-seven nalidixic acid-resistant enterobacterial isolates were collected in a Brazilian community from January 2000 to May 2005 to determine the prevalence of plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The bla(CTX-M) genetic environment was determined by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Eleven isolates (4.2%) harbored a bla(CTX-M-2) gene, 3 isolates bla(CTX-M-9), 2 isolates bla(CTX-M-8), and 6 isolates bla(SHV-5). Two novel bla(CTX-M-2) variants, namely, bla(CTX-M-74) and bla(CTX-M-75), were identified.
