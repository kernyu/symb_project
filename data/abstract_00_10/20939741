The objectives of this study were to report an outbreak of highly drug-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Oranienburg in dairy calves, and conduct an epidemiological investigation of Oranienburg identified on a dairy herd during a study to determine whether discontinuing feeding medicated milk replacer to preweaned dairy calves resulted in increased antimicrobial susceptibility in enteric bacteria. Calf fecal samples and swabs of calf and maternity pens were collected monthly over 18 months. Samples were streaked onto XLT-4 agar and characteristic colonies were subjected to biochemical tests to confirm Salmonella. Strain relatedness was examined by Xbal and BlnI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis on 62 randomly selected isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, using automated microbroth dilution, was conducted using a panel containing tetracycline, amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. A total of 190 Salmonella spp. were isolated from 604 calf and 36 pen samples, of which 86% were Oranienburg and 97% were resistant to at least 9 agents. Environmental isolates had lower levels of resistance than fecal isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis identified three strains: the most common strain was consistently present before the outbreak and at its peak. One strain was exclusively an environmental isolate, with little antimicrobial resistance. Multiresistant isolates with resistance to ciprofloxacin appeared early in the outbreak, and were replaced by multiresistant isolates with resistance to cephalothin. The differences in strains and resistance patterns suggest that the strains of Oranienburg found in fecal isolates may have different origins from environmental isolates.
