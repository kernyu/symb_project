The progressive emergence of multi-resistant gram-positive strains has prompted the search for new molecules (quinolones, streptogramins, oxazolidinones, ketolides, glycopeptides, daptomycin) to add to the current therapeutic arsenal. Linezolid, the first commercially available member of the oxazolidinone family, has evidenced activity against multi-resistant gram-positive strains (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus with decreased glycopeptide sensitivity, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae with decreased sensitivity to penicillin and cephalosporins), thereby providing a new option for treating infections by these microorganisms. This work reviews the microbiologic and pharmacologic aspects of this agent in order to establish its position among the available options for antimicrobial chemotherapy.
