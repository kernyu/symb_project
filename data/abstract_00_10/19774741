Multiple new agents are currently being developed in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Most of these agents are now being investigated in patients who have developed resistance to imatinib. Their mechanisms of action are diverse and many may be synergistic with imatinib. These agents will be used soon in different combinations, most likely including imatinib, with the hope of obtaining a complete blockade of the intracellular pathways that are triggered by Bcr-Abl. If this is successful, complete eradication of disease may become a reality for the majority of patients with CML.
