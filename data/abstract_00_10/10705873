Human breast adenocarcinoma cells MCF-7 were selected for resistance to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). Stepwise increments of the concentration of DFMO resulted in selection of MCF-7 cells that were capable of growing in the presence of 1.0 mM DFMO. This capacity was associated with a 10-fold increase in ODC activity and marked enhancement in the synthesis rate of ODC protein as verified by a 2-hr [35S]methionine labeling of cellular proteins followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. The resistant cells had much higher concentration of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine than the control cells. A 25-fold increase in ED50 (effective dose causing 50% inhibition) for the antiproliferative action of DFMO in these resistant cells was observed. The susceptibility of wild-type and resistant cell lines to other inhibitors of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway and adriamycin is also reported.
