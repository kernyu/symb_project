Macrorestriction analysis of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA, using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to type and estimate genetic relationships among 288 Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from 58 Eastern Canadian dairy herds. In addition, a subset of the collection was phage typed and evaluated for sensitivity to 10 antimicrobial compounds. Of 288 isolates recovered, 29 distinct PFGE types were identified. Based on estimates of genetic relationships, the PFGE types were assigned to six lineage groups, designated A through F. Of all of the isolates, ca. 93% were assigned to lineage groups A, D, or F. In 58.6% of herds, only a single PFGE type was recovered, while the remainder had two to four types. Of the 212 isolates evaluated for antimicrobial resistance, 24.5% were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Resistance to penicillin (9.9%) was most common, followed by resistance to sulfadimethoxine (7.5%). Isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics were rare. A total of 63% of isolates responded to phages from groups 1 and 3, and 32.8% could not be typed with any of the phage strains used. The other 4.1% belonged to a variety of phage types. Most of the PFGE lineage group A and F isolates corresponded to phage groups 3 and 1, respectively, and most group D isolates were not typeable. PFGE typing had better discriminatory power than phage typing in defining the relatedness of the S. aureus isolates. Distribution of PFGE types and phage types was independent across regions and within herds.
