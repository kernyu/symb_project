Glyphosate has been used globally as a safe herbicide for weed control. It inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase (AroA), which is a key enzyme in the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms and plants. A Pseudomonas putida strain, 4G-1, was isolated from a soil heavily contaminated by glyphosate in China. Its AroA-encoding gene (aroA) has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this AroA belongs neither to class I nor to class II AroA enzymes. When compared with E. coli AroA, 4G-1 AroA shows similar values for K(m)[PEP], K(m)[S3P], and specific enzyme activity. Moreover, 4G-1 AroA exhibits high tolerance to glyphosate, which indicates a protein with a high potential for structural and functional studies of AroA in general and its potential usage for the generation of transgenic crops resistant to the herbicide.
