Tenofovir is a nucleotide analogue human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor, and its oral prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, has recently been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in the United States. The objective of this study was to characterize the in vitro susceptibility profiles of a large panel of clinically derived HIV-1 isolates for tenofovir. The distribution of tenofovir susceptibilities in over 1,000 antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected individuals worldwide was determined using the Virco Antivirogram assay. In addition, phenotypic susceptibilities to tenofovir and other RT inhibitors were determined in a panel of nearly 5,000 recombinant HIV-1 clinical isolates from predominantly treatment-experienced patients analyzed as a part of routine drug resistance testing. Greater than 97.5% of isolates from treatment-naive patients had tenofovir susceptibilities <3-fold above those of the wild-type controls by the Antivirogram. The clinically derived panel of 5,000 samples exhibited a broad range of antiretroviral drug susceptibilities, including 69, 43, and 16% having >10-fold-decreased susceptibilities to at least one, two, and three antiretroviral drug classes, respectively. Greater than 88% of these 5,000 clinical isolates were within the threefold susceptibility range for tenofovir, and >99% exhibited <10-fold-reduced susceptibilities to tenofovir. Decreased susceptibility to tenofovir was not directly associated with resistance to other RT inhibitors; r(2) values of log-log linear regression plots of susceptibility to tenofovir versus susceptibility to other RT inhibitors were <0.4. The results suggest that the majority of treatment-naive and treatment-experienced individuals harbor HIV that remains within the normal range of tenofovir susceptibilities and may be susceptible to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy.
