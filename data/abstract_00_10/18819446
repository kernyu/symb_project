The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance testing of non-fermentative rods isolated from clinical specimens from patients hospitalized in Korczak Pediatric Center of Lower Silesia in Wroclaw. The susceptibility of bacteria to selected antibiotics was determined. The commonest pathogens were Pseudomonas rods (81.8%) isolated from respiratory system and urine of patients hospitalized in unit intensive care. Variety of resistance patterns were detected in bacteria. ESBL were detected the most of S. maltophilia. Strains of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter resistant to carbapenems were detected with a frequency of 5.5% and 35.9%.
