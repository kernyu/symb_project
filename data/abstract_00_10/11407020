Susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was investigated in Aeromonas spp. Microorganisms were isolated from both, clinical and water creek samples, as well as from processed raw chicken carcasses. Aeromonas like colonies were identified by means of Aerokey II and API 20 E System (Bio-Merieux). A. hydrophila prevailed both of human origin (44%) and water creek samples (41%), while A. caviae ranked first among raw chicken samples (65%). Dilution testing by Agar Method was performed to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), following NCCLS standards. All tested microorganisms were susceptible to third generation cephalosporin, cefepime, imipenem, aztreonam, and resistant to ampicillin. Only with cefepime and aztreonam exceptions, strains of human origin showed higher values of MIC90 than environmental ones. These results suggest that antibiotic resistance is mainly due to a steady environmental pressure, on account of the widely used above mentioned compounds.
