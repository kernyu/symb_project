A total of 57 Vibrio vulnificus isolates from coastal water were characterized for their antimicrobial resistance, plasmid profiles and were typed by the PCR-based techniques: a random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method and the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence (ERIC) method. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Fifty-one isolates were resistant to one or more of the other antibiotics tested. Plasmid analysis indicated that only 18 isolates carried small plasmids of 1.6 to 16 megadaltons. Analysis of the RAPD and ERIC DNA fingerprints of the V. vulnificus isolates with Gel Compare and cluster analysis software revealed significant genetic heterogeneity among these isolates. The combination of RAPD and ERIC analysis allowed us to distinguish all isolates. Thus, the combination of the two techniques is recommended for epidemiological investigation.
