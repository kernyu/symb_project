Oxazolidinone-quinolone hybrids that combine the pharmacophores of a quinolone and an oxazolidinone were synthesised and shown to be active against a variety of resistant and susceptible Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative organisms. The best compounds in this series overcome all types of resistance in relevant clinical Gram-positive pathogens. The nature of the spacer greatly influences the antibacterial activity. The dual mode of action could be demonstrated for compounds having a piperazinyl spacer. Antibacterial activity was higher at acidic pH.
