In this study, the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) in gyrA and gyrB of in vitro fluoroquinolone-resistant Rhodococcus equi mutants was sequenced. These mutants were selected from four R. equi strains on blood agar plates containing ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin. Each mutant became 8- to 64 or greater-fold resistant to fluoroquinolones compared with their parent strains. From the results of sequence analysis of QRDR in gyrA and gyrB, a nucleotide mutation of codon GAC for GGC in gyrA was detected in all mutants, but no mutation was observed in gyrB. This mutation leads to amino acid substitution of Asp for Gly in putative GyrA in R. equi. The position of this substitution corresponds to position 87 of GyrA in Escherichia coli. Our results suggest that the mutation of QRDR in gyrA, which was observed in in vitro fluoroquinolone-resistant R. equi mutants in this study, is closely associated with fluoroquinolone resistance.
