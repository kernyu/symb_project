16 chicken isolates and four clinical isolates of VanB-vanA incongruent vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecium strains without vanS were isolated in 1999. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed only a peripheral relationship between the chicken isolates and clinical isolates, but suggested clonal spread in the chicken isolates.
