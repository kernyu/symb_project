The aim of the study was to determine predictive factors of epidemic extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli acquisition. All patients presenting any type of culture positive for ESBL-producing E. coli between November 2006 and October 2007 were included. An epidemic case was defined as a patient colonized with a clonal strain having epidemiological link with an another patient harbouring the same strain. Clinical and administrative data were recorded. Groups were compared by univariate and multivariate analysis using SAS software. Were included in this study 148 patients: 60 epidemic and 88 sporadic cases. Multivariate analysis showed several predictive factors of epidemic strain acquisition: female gender, high Charlson index, treatment by amoxicillin or ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, admission to emergency unit and hospitalisation in a high number of different care units. Identification of predictive factors of epidemic ESBL-producing E. coli strains acquisition may help to limit cross transmission of such strains.
