A new molecular assay (CytAMP) utilizing isothermal signal-mediated amplification of RNA was evaluated for rapid detection of methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The assay targeted the coa (coagulase) and mecA genes, thereby simultaneously identifying S. aureus and methicillin (oxacillin) resistance. Results were obtained in approximately 3.5 h as a color signal in 96-well microtiter plates. The detection limit was between 2 x 10(5) and 10(6) CFU/assay, equivalent to 4 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(7) CFU/ml in an overnight broth. This level of growth was obtained with an initial inoculum of 10 to 50 CFU. The CytAMP assay and a mecA-femB PCR assay both detected 113 MRSA strains among 396 clinical isolates of bacteria (CytAMP sensitivity and specificity were both 100% relative to those of PCR). Conventional culture detected 109 MRSA strains, but with 19 false-positive and 23 false-negative results relative to both molecular methods. Discrepancies were also observed for 100 enrichment broths containing MRSA screening swabs, with 11 broths culture negative but PCR positive. CytAMP and PCR were more in agreement, but six broths were CytAMP negative and PCR positive. Five of these contained 10(2) to 10(5) CFU/assay (below the CytAMP detection limit of 2 x 10(5) CFU/assay), and the sixth contained 10(6) CFU/assay. Overall, culture and CytAMP had similar sensitivities and specificities relative to those of PCR, but the CytAMP assay enabled swabs to be analyzed as a batch following overnight incubation in enrichment broth, with results reported before 12 noon the next day.
