The rapid detection and reporting of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a challenge for the clinical microbiology laboratory. Molecular-based diagnostic tests can provide data on the presence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in the nares in approximately 1 h, whereas testing for the vanA and vanB resistance genes in enterococci isolated from perirectal samples can be completed in approximately 4 h. Novel pyrosequencing assays can provide data regarding the presence of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis directly from positive mycobacterial broth cultures in <1 day. These data can assist physicians in both therapeutic and infection control decisions.
