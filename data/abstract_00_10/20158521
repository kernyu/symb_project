Streptomyces peucetius self-resistance genes drrA and drrB encode membrane-associated proteins that function like an ABC transporter for the efflux of daunorubicin and to maintain a constant subinhibitory physiological concentration of the drug within the cell. In this study, the drrA and drrB operons were disrupted for investigating drug production, self-resistance and regulation. The drrA-drrB null mutant was highly sensitive to daunorubicin. A 10-fold decrease in drug production was observed in the null mutant compared with the wild-type strain. We propose that the absence of a drug-specific efflux pump increases the intracellular concentration of daunorubicin, which is sensed by the organism to turn down drug production. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the mutant showed a drastic reduction in the expression of the key regulator dnrI and polyketide synthase gene dpsA. However, the expression of regulatory genes dnrO and dnrN was increased. Feedback regulation based on the intracellular daunorubicin concentration is discussed.
