Presented here is the 5-year impact of a national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system in Ireland, which was introduced in accordance with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS). Participation in EARSS began in Ireland in 1999. Initially, 12 laboratories serving a mix of general and tertiary hospitals participated, but by 2003, participation had increased to 28 laboratories with a population coverage of 89%. During 1999-2003, 4,146 episodes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia were reported, and methicillin resistance was detected in 1,709 (41.2%) of these isolates. Over the same period, 1,245 invasive (blood or cerebrospinal fluid) episodes of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection were reported, and 160 (12.9%) isolates were found to be non-susceptible to penicillin, with 23 (1.8%) demonstrating high-level penicillin resistance. By 2003, most Irish hospitals were participating in EARSS, which has been a catalyst for the development of a national antimicrobial resistance surveillance programme.
