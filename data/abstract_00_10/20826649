We isolated 45 Helicobacter pylori strains from 217 child patients. Resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and tetracycline was detected in 27%, 13%, 4%, and 0% of strains, respectively. The A2143G mutation was the most prevalent (67%) among clarithromycin-resistant strains. In addition, strain genotyping revealed a significant association between gastritis severity and the simultaneous presence of cagA, vacA s1m1, iceA2, and babA2 genes.
