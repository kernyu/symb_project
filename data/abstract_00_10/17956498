OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyremethamine (SP) monotherapy and establish the prevalence of mutations in dhfr and dhps in Brazzaville, Congo. METHOD: We recruited 97 patients aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated malaria who attended Tenrikyo public health centre. Eighty-three were followed until day 28. SP efficacy was determined by the WHO 28-day test and analysis of mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes. RESULTS: There were seven (8.4%) early treatment failures, 23 late treatment failures (27.7%), nine (10.8%) late parasitological failures and 44 (53%) adequate clinical and parasitological responses (ACPR). After polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of 64 available samples, the corrected results there were 44 (68.8%) ACPR and 19 recrudescent cases (31.2%). Approximately, 97.5% of samples bore the Asn51Ile mutation, 66.2% the Cys59Arg mutation and 98.8% the Ser108Asn mutation. Mutations of dhps at positions 437 (Ala-Gly) and 436 (Ser-Ala) were found in 85% and 12.5% of samples. Quadruple mutations (pfdhfr triple mutations in codons 51, 59 and 108+ pfdhps mutation in 437) were found in 42 samples (52.5%) and associated with treatment failures. CONCLUSION: This high level of treatment failures and mutations in both genes calls for the urgent application of the new policy for malaria treatment to delay the spread of SP resistance.
