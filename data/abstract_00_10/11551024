We report three pediatric patients with ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis who were successfully treated with foscarnet. The patients were recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from HLA-mismatched donors. Because these patients had developed or experienced progressive CMV retinitis during ganciclovir therapy, they received foscarnet therapy at 60 mg/kg every 8 h. Their retinitis resolved promptly after initiating foscarnet therapy, suggesting foscarnet's effectiveness in treating ganciclovir-resistant CMV infection. The amount of CMV mRNA was quantitatively measured using an NASBA technique, which amplified the beta2.7 transcripts specific for CMV replication. This technique was useful for monitoring disease activity in a more rapid and sensitive manner than the PCR assay for CMV DNA.
