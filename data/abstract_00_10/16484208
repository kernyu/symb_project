The two-component signal-transducing system CiaRH of Streptococcus pneumoniae plays an important role during the development of beta-lactam resistance in laboratory mutants. We show here that a functional CiaRH system is required for survival under many different lysis-inducing conditions. Mutants with an activated CiaRH system were highly resistant to lysis induced by a wide variety of early and late cell wall inhibitors, such as cycloserine, bacitracin, and vancomycin, and were also less susceptible to these drugs. In contrast, loss-of-function CiaRH mutants were hypersusceptible to these drugs and were apparently unable to maintain a stationary growth phase in normal growth medium and under choline deprivation as well. Moreover, disruption of CiaR in penicillin-resistant mutants with an altered pbp2x gene encoding low-affinity PBP2x resulted in severe growth defects and rapid lysis. This phenotype was observed with pbp2x genes containing point mutations selected in the laboratory and with highly altered mosaic pbp2x genes from penicillin-resistant clinical isolates as well. This documents for the first time that PBP2x mutations required for development of beta-lactam resistance are functionally not neutral and are tolerated only in the presence of the CiaRH system. This might explain why cia mutations have not been observed in penicillin-resistant clinical isolates. The results document that the CiaRH system is required for maintenance of the stationary growth phase and for prevention of autolysis triggered under many different conditions, suggesting a major role for this system in ensuring cell wall integrity.
