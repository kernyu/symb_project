Thymidine-sparing triple-nucleoside regimens have exhibited poor virologic response despite apparent phenotypic susceptibility to 2 of 3 regimen components at early time points. Phenotypic resistance masking by wild-type virus may explain this discrepancy.Consistent with this notion were (1) the presence of low level nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-resistant human immunodeficiency virus in subjects receiving failing first-line regimens consisting of tenofovir (TDF), abacavir (ABC), and lamivudine (3TC); (2) lower fold resistance associated with mixtures versus mutants in a clinical-isolate database; and (3) dose dependent changes in susceptibility to ABC, 3TC, TDF, and didanosine on titration of K65R and/or M184V with wild-type virus. These findings underscore the limitations of stand-alone phenotypic susceptibility measures and emphasize the importance of complementary and/or more sensitive techniques.
