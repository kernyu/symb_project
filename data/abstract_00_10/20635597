Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) is being increasingly recognized as an important pathogen of humans. During the year 2007-8, 39 putative BCC isolates were obtained from 21 cases and subjected to recA PCR RFLP. Twenty-four isolates were confirmed as Burkholderia cenocepacia IIIA (nineteen isolates, recA PCR RFLP type G and five isolates, recA PCR RFLP type I), six were confirmed as B. cepacia (recA PCR RFLP type E). BCC were isolated from inpatients of different wards of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh with increased isolation from children admitted to different wards of Advanced Pediatric Centre (11/21 cases). BCC isolates are often resistant to most commonly used antibiotics and an early use of effective antimicrobial therapy can decrease morbidity and mortality.
