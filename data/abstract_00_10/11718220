We evaluated the effect of interferon-alpha2b as a chemosensitiser on HCT-15 cell line in treatment with doxorubicin. Chemosensitivity was determined by [3H]-thymidine incorporation and tetrazolium assays. The levels of expression of P-glycoprotein, Bcl-2 oncoprotein and HLA-ABC complex, and cell cycle/apoptosis analysis were determined by flow cytometry. Dox 50 ng/ml - IFN alpha 2b 500 IU/ml treatment inhibited cell proliferation (47.2 +/- 1.4%, p < 0.0001; MTT assay: 40.6 +/- 1.2%, p < 0.0001) and augmented the expression of P-170, Bcl-2 and HLA-ABC, while it didn't exert apoptosis, producing a slight G2/M arrest. A concentration of IFN-alpha2b, that by itself is not cytotoxic, can potentiate the efficacy of the anticancer drug. This effect is not due to a down-modulation of P-170. The absence of apoptosis and augmented levels of Bcl-2 expression suggests that this could be one of the mechanisms of drug resistance exerted by these cells.
