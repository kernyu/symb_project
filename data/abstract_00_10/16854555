In this study, we examined the prevalence of and mechanisms of decreased susceptibility to either imipenem or meropenem in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. A total of 230 clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae were collected from 13 clinical laboratories from a nationwide distribution. The MICs of imipenem and meropenem were determined by the agar dilution method. To characterize the isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems (MICs of >2 microg/mL), we performed polymerase chain reaction amplification of a variety of beta-lactamase genes, isoelectric focusing, and outer membrane profile analysis using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Three isolates (BD6, BD8, and KN16) exhibited decreased susceptibility to carbapenems with imipenem MICs of 1, 4, and 8 microg/mL and meropenem MICs of 4, 8, and 4, respectively. Isolate BD6 produced bla(TEM-1), bla(SHV-12), and bla(OXA-17); isolate BD8 produced bla(GES-3), bla(SHV-12), and bla(OXA-17); and isolate KN16 produced bla(TEM-11), bla(SHV-12), and bla(DHA-1). In all the 3 isolates, OmpK35 porin was not expressed, and in 1 isolate (KN16), OmpK36 was not expressed either. The prevalence of decreased susceptibility to carbapenems was low (1.3%), and none of them showed overt resistance to carbapenems. Decreased susceptibility to carbapenems can occur in K. pneumoniae when bla(GES-3), bla(TEM-11), bla(SHV-12), bla(OXA-17), and/or bla(DHA-1) are produced in combination with porin loss. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the 1st report of bla(OXA-17) in Enterobacteriaceae.
