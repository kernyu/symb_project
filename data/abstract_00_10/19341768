One-step multiplex PCR was developed for the identification of gonococci and antimicrobial-resistant profiles. From forty Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, the penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG), the high-level tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (TRNG), and the ciprofloxacin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (CRNG) were successfully classified. Our method provides expediency and benefit to epidemiology and antimicrobial-resistance mobility with 100% sensitivity and specificity for gonococcal-detection. The detection limit was 500 CFU/reaction.
