Besifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone that, like other fluoroquinolones, acts by inhibiting the essential bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topical besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% is indicated for use in patients with bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible bacteria. Besifloxacin had in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria that commonly cause ocular infections (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae), including drug-resistant strains. In two randomized, double-blind, multicentre trials, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% administered at the recommended dose for 5 days in patients aged > or =1 year with bacterial conjunctivitis was significantly (p < 0.01) more effective than vehicle in terms of clinical resolution and microbial eradication rates (coprimary endpoints) at study visit two (day 5+/-1) or three (day 8 or 9) [primary timepoints]. Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was noninferior to moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% in patients aged > or =1 year with bacterial conjunctivitis with regard to clinical resolution (58.3% vs 59.4%) and microbial eradication (93.3% vs 91.1%) rates on day 5 +/- 1 of treatment (coprimary endpoints) in a randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial; both drugs were administered at a dosage of one drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily for 5 days. Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with most adverse events being mild in severity. The tolerability profile of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was similar to that of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%.
