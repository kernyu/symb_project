We retrospectively assessed the impact of chloroquine (CQ) resistance in the rural region of Niakhar, Senegal, where resistance to CQ emerged in 1992, from increases in consultations and returns of patients to the health centre following antimalarial treatment. No significant differences were observed between 1992, when chemoresistance appeared, and 2004, when first-line treatment of malaria changed, except in the private centre where practices and follow-up were distinct. In this zone of Senegal, resistance to CQ does not appear to have a high impact on malaria morbidity in health centres.
