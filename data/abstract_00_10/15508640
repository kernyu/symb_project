Although liquid egg white may be subjected to limited heat treatment when it is used in the fabrication of various foodstuffs, pathogenic bacteria such Salmonella Enteritidis could persist in this environment. Liquid egg white is not a favorable medium for Salmonella growth because of its alkaline pH and iron deficiency and the presence of ovotransferrin. Microorganisms adapted to a nonfavorable environment are often more resistant to stresses than are their laboratory-cultured counterparts. The objective of this study was to determine whether Salmonella exposed to an environment mimicking egg white conditions exhibited modified behavior that could have an impact on food safety. A medium resembling egg white (filtrate of egg white with added ovotransferrin) was used as an adaptation treatment to mimic the stress imparted by the egg white environment. There were no changes in resistance to heat and disinfection, in stainless steel adhesion, or in the virulence of Salmonella Enteritidis cultivated in the egg white medium. Egg white conditions do not appear to make Salmonella more virulent or more difficult to inactivate.
