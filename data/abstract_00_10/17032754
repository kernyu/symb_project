Hemiasterlin is a potent antimitotic peptide that interferes with microtubule dynamics at picomolar concentrations in cell culture. The molecule largely eludes P glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux, and an analog is currently being evaluated in clinical trials as cancer chemotherapy. From a nonclonal genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans we isolated eight independent mutants resistant to a synthetic hemiasterlin analog. In one recessive mutant, phb-2(ad2154), a point mutation in prohibitin 2 (E130K) protects worms from drug-induced injury. Data indicate that direct binding of hemiasterlin to prohibitin 2 is unlikely. In fact, C. elegans phb-2(ad2154) was also found to be resistant to numerous other drugs that bind tubulin and to camptothecin, yet this mutant was sensitive to nocodazole and phalloidin. Thus, prohibitin 2 is implicated in a previously uncharacterized pathway of multidrug resistance.
