Chitinase C (ChiC) is the first bacterial family 19 chitinase discovered in Streptomyces griseus HUT6037. In vitro, ChiC clearly inhibited hyphal extension of Trichoderma reesei but a rice family 19 chitinase did not. In order to investigate the effects of ChiC as an increaser of plant resistance to fungal diseases, the chiC gene was introduced into rice plants under the control of the increased CaMV 35S promoter and a signal sequence from the rice chitinase gene. Transgenic plants were morphologically normal. Resistance to leaf blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea was evaluated in R1 and R2 generations using a spray method. Ninety percent of transgenic rice plants expressing ChiC had higher resistance than non-transgenic plants. Disease resistance of sibling plants within the same line was correlated with the ChiC expression levels. ChiC produced in rice plants accumulated intercellularly and had the hydrolyzing activity against glycol chitin.
