To achieve more accurate and rapid detection of macrolidelincosamide- streptogramin B resistance genes, erm(A), erm(B), and erm(C), we developed a TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR (Q-PCR) method and compared it with conventional PCR (C-PCR), which is the most widely using erm gene identification method. The detection limit of Q-PCR was 5 fg of genomic DNA or 5-8 CFU of bacterial cells of Staphylococcus aureus. The utilization of Q-PCR might shorten the time to erm detection from 3-4 h to about 50 min. These data indicated that Q-PCR assay appears to be not only highly sensitive and specific, but also the most rapid diagnostic method. Therefore, the appropriate application of the Q-PCR assay will permit rapid and accurate identification of erm genes from clinical and other samples.
