The preoperative intranasal application of mupirocin significantly decreases the rate of nosocomial S. aureus infections among patients who are S. aureus carriers. However, it remains unclear whether the routine preoperative use of mupirocin would reduce postoperative S. aureus infections, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, and who would benefit from the prophylactic use of mupirocin. Ninety-six consecutive patients who had undergone elective radical esophagectomy with right thoracotomy and laparotomy were evaluated. Fifty-one patients were given 2% mupirocin calcium ointment 3 times daily over 3 consecutive days before surgery. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors affecting the following three issues: postoperative MRSA infection, postoperative pneumonia, and the length of postoperative hospital stay. In univariate analyses, the preoperative application of mupirocin significantly reduced MRSA infection, postoperative pneumonia, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Multivariate analyses indicated significant associations between mupirocin administration and reductions in both MRSA infection and postoperative pneumonia, but not in length of postoperative hospital stay. Radical esophagectomy with right thoracotomy and laparotomy for esophageal carcinoma warranted the preoperative prophylactic administration of mupirocin in order to reduce postoperative infectious complications from MRSA. Its routine use for such a high-risk procedure is entirely reasonable.
