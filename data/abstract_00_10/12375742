In this study, we have investigated the effects of the unicellular-green-algae Chlorella vulgaris on the production of INF-gamma, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 in normal and Listeria monocytogenes infected mice. Our results demonstrated that in normal/non infected mice, CVE administration produced no effects in the levels of all cytokines studied. However, Listeria monocytogenes infection enhanced the production of INF-gamma and IL-2 at 48 and 72 h after the bacteria inoculation. Interestingly, the treatment with five consecutive doses of 50 mg/Kg/day of Chlorella vulgaris given previously to infection, led to further increases in INF-gamma and IL-2 levels at 48 and 72 h in relation to the presence of infection alone. No changes in IL-4 and IL-10 production were observed in Listeria monocytogenes and CVE treated/infected mice. These results are in accordance with the literature, which shows that CVE is a biological response modifier that enhances resistance to Listeria monocytogenes through augmentation of IL-2 and IFN-gamma.
