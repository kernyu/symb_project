Several studies have examined the gender differences in the area of emotion, but few data are available in the field of gustation. Yet, such differences are observed in clinical manifestations of nutritional disorders, such as a greater incidence of carbohydrate cravings in women. The aim of this study was consequently to examine the influence of gender on emotional responses to taste, by comparing autonomic responses and basic emotions associated with primary tastes between men and women. Thirty-four subjects (17 males, 17 females, mean age=28) participated in the experiment. Taste stimuli were solutions of 0.3 M sucrose (sweet), 0.15 M NaCl (salty), 0.02 M citric acid (sour) and 0.00015 M quinine sulfate (bitter). Evian mineral water served as the diluent and control (neutral taste). Five autonomic parameters [skin potential (SP) and resistance (SR), skin blood flow (SBF) and temperature (ST), instantaneous heart rate (IHR)] were simultaneously and continuously recorded when subjects tasted the five solutions. The patterns of autonomic responses, obtained for each primary taste and each subject, were transcribed into one of the six basic emotions defined by Ekman (happiness, surprise, sadness, fear, anger and disgust), according to a previously described method for odorants. Results evidenced that the mean variations of each autonomic parameter did not significantly differ between men and women, even if skin resistance and cardiac responses were stronger in men than in women. Concerning the basic emotions associated with each primary taste, a similar distribution for men and women was obtained for sweet, bitter and control solutions, whereas more differences were observed for salt (P=.02) and sour solutions.
