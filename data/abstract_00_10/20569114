We reviewed the medical records of all the patients who died in our hospital during the period from 2004 through 2008 to determine the contribution of healthcare-associated infections to mortality. Of the 179 unexpected in-hospital deaths during that period, 55 (31%) were related to 69 healthcare-associated infections. The most common healthcare-associated infection was central line-associated bloodstream infection, and the most common organisms identified were members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Overall, 45% of bacterial isolates were multidrug resistant.
