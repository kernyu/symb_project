All though extremely rare 10 years ago, antifungal drug resistance is becoming a major problem in certain populations, especially in those infected with HIV. This study was undertaken to study the resistance of Candida species isolated in our hospital to Fluconazole using Chrom agar Candida. The Candida strains which were routinely isolated from clinical specimens like blood, urine, sputum, pus, fluid and homograft isolates were included in the study. 142 Candida isolates were tested by using Chrom agar Candida incorporated with Fluconazole. 16 strains were found to be resistant to Fluconazole and 126 strains sensitive to Fluconazole. Nine were C. tropicalis, 3 C. krusei, 2 C. guillermondii, 1 Geotrichum candidum and one was an unidentified strain of Candida. The MIC of the 16 strains were done using RPMI 1640 medium by macro broth dilution method. MIC of 9 strains was 64 & > 64 ug/ml of 6 strains 32 ug/ml and 1 strain 16 ug/ml.
