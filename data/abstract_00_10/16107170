We have studied the in vitro antifungal activity of voriconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole against 252 clinical isolates of dermatophytes and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis by a standardized agar diffusion method (NeoSensitabs). Several important factors such as temperature (28 degrees C vs. 35 degrees C) and incubation time (2-10 days vs. 18-74 h) were adapted to dermatophytes and Scopulariopsis requirements. Voriconazole showed an excellent activity against most species of dermatophytes, higher than itraconazole and fluconazole. However, S. brevicaulis isolates were highly resistant to all azoles used in this study. Voriconazole might be an interesting antifungal alternative to refractory superficial mycoses.
