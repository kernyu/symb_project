The aim of the study was to compare effects of three-day N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid or taurine administration on plasma antioxidant status and oxidative damage markers in healthy men after performing muscle-damaging exercise. Fifty-five healthy and trained men were randomly assigned to N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 1.8 g/day, 3 days), alpha-lipoic acid (ALA, 1.2 g/day, 3 days), taurine (TAU, 3 g/day, 3 days) and control group (CON), and exposed to intense resistance exercise. The resistance exercise induced the muscle damage which was observed by significant increase in total creatine kinase (CK) activity at 24 h rest. The administration of NAC and ALA significantly elevated the resting or/and postexercise plasma total antioxidant status (TAS) and total thiols (TT). Uric acid (UA) concentration was decreased by NAC, ALA and TAU at 24 h rest compared with CON. The plasma lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonylation (PC) were considerably reduced by NAC and ALA administration at rest and after exercise. TAU did not have any influence on TAS, TT, TBARS and PC levels. Our study has shown that three-day oral N-acetylcysteine and alpha-lipoic acid administration enhanced plasma total antioxidant status and attenuated oxidative damage whereas taurine did not demonstrate any antioxidant action in healthy men after performing a single muscle-damaging exercise.
