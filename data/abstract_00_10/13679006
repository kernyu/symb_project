Post-burn microbial infections are a major problem in burns, and in cases of third degree burns, the survival of patients can depend not only upon the severity but also upon the extent and the type of infections. If proper measures are not employed, patients may suffer from opportunistic bacterial attacks, which can vary from simple infection, such as those easily treatable by antibiotics, to more complicated types, which may have natural or acquired resistance to drugs. Infection by multiple drug resistant (MDR) bacteria can create further complexity to the treatment. It is proposed that a combination of diluted hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and ferrous sulphate (FeSO(4)), which generates hydroxyl radicals (*OH) via Fenton reaction, can effectively be used for the treatment of post-burns bacterial infections. It should be particularly useful for the ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, known to be notoriously resistant to various antibiotics. This reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced inactivation of the bacterial skin infections may be of particular importance in Third World countries where the incidence of burns and post-burns infections by MDR bacteria (due to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, lack of stringent safety regulations and proper hygiene) may be more prevalent and where cocktails of antibiotics may be less affordable. Also, since the putative lack of development of bacterial resistance to *OH is not known, it provides an added advantage to the treatment. Finally, although this work addresses the control of bacterial infections in burns cases, it is envisaged that this ROS-induced chemotherapy may also be useful in combating other kinds of skin infections particularly those resisting antibiotic treatment.
