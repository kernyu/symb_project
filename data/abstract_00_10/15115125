Although the presence of multi-drug-resistant falciparum malaria has been reported in the Philippines, the distribution of drug-resistant malaria parasites has not yet been determined in Mindanao Island. In vitro susceptibility of P. falciparum to both chloroquine and mefloquine was assessed to forecast the spread of drug-resistant parasites in various foci in southeastern Mindanao Island. Of the 33 isolates of P. falciparum successfully tested, 10 (30%) were susceptible, 12 (36%) showed decreased susceptibility (80 nM < or = IC50 < 114 nM), and 11 (33%) were resistant (IC50 > or = 114 nM) to chloroquine. Ten (91%) of the resistant isolates and 9 (75%) of those with decreased susceptibility were from northern and northwestern Davao del Norte Province. Chloroquine-susceptible isolates were found among patients in the eastern parts of Davao del Norte and Davao Oriental provinces. Seven isolates from several foci in the study area were all mefloquine- susceptible (IC50 < 10 nM). This is the first report indicating the potential emergence of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum on Mindanao Island, which is presently regarded as a drug-susceptible area.
