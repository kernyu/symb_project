We have previously shown that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions which have their own nef gene deleted and are trans complemented to contain HIV-2 or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef become resistant to treatment with cyclosporin A. To expand and confirm these studies, we have tested an HIV-1 isolate in which the HIV-1 nef gene has been replaced by the nef gene from SIV in a multiround infectivity assay using more physiologically relevant cell types. Our results confirm that HIV-1 virions that contain SIV nef can replicate in a cyclophilin-independent fashion.
