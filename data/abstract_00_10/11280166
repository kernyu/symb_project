BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In a kala-azar endemic area in rural Bihar with a large number of patients unresponsive to sodium antimony gluconate and pentamidine, treatment with amphotericin B was tried in a rural set-up with the objective to cure these patients, and to assess whether such a centre could be run successfully in a rural set-up. METHODS: After thorough clinical examination and biochemical investigations, parasitologically confirmed patients who had haemoglobin above 5 g/dl, electrolyte imbalance if any, corrected, and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial damage stabilised after 10 days of bed rest were treated. Amphotericin B deoxycholate was infused at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight, daily for 20 days. The adverse events were closely monitored. RESULTS: All 7 (100%) untreated patients of kala-azar, 258 (97%) of the 266 antimony and pentamidine resistant patients, and 31 (86%) of the 36 patients who had relapsed after a low dose regimen of amphotericin B, were cured with 20 infusions of amphotericin B. Eight (3%) patients of the antimony and pentamidine resistant group and 5 (14%) patients who had relapsed after low dose amphotericin B regimen required 25 infusions of amphotericin B to achieve parasitological cure. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: With some precautions and proper management, all patients of kala-azar could be cured with amphotericin B in a rural set-up. A significant (P < 0.05) percentage of patients of group C relapsing after a low dose amphotericin B regime requiring 25 infusions for cure suggests that an adequate dose regime of amphotericin B should be given during the first course of treatment to prevent emergence of drug resistance.
