We report the isolation of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium phage type DT104 (CCARM 8104) from swine in Korea. The CCARM 8104 isolate was resistant to nalidixic acid and showed reduced susceptibility to quinolones. The CCARM 8104 isolate had a missense mutation, Asp87Asn, in the quinolone resistance-determining region in gyrA and produced PSE-1. The CCARM 8104 isolate carried two different class 1 integrons, and the PSE-1 beta-lactamase gene was inserted into a 1,200 bp class 1 integron. The presence of DT104 with pse-1 in an integron located in a plasmid and reduced susceptibility to quinolone in swine pose a significant threat of possible horizontal spread between swine and humans.
