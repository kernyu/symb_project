BACKGROUND: Infection is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant recipients. The incidence of esophageal and urogenital candidiasis in kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant recipients has not been well documented. Azoles are safe, effective agents to treat esophageal candidiasis. However, resistance to azoles is now becoming common. This study reports the use of caspofungin for the treatment of azole-resistant esophageal and urogenital candidiasis in kidney transplant recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of esophageal and urogenital candidiasis was evaluated among 140 kidney transplantations and four combined kidney-pancreas transplants performed over a 2-year period. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (15.7%) presented with esophageal candidiasis, while seven patients (5%) showed urogenital candidiasis. Thirteen patients with esophageal candidiasis (59%) and four patients (57%) with urogenital candidiasis did not improve after a week of azole treatment. A regimen of caspofungin was started in these patients, who tolerated the treatment. Urogenital candidiasis recurred in two patients 2 and 3 months after the treatment. One patient with esophageal candidiasis did not improve with caspofungin and was switched to amphotericin B therapy. There were no other recurrences of candidiasis among patients treated with caspofungin for a median follow-up of 8 months. CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplant patients remain at high risk for fungal infections. Although the number of patients was limited, the results of this study indicated that caspofungin is an effective, well-tolerated alternative for difficult-to-treat, azole-resistant candida infections in kidney and pancreas transplant recipients. The high costs of the drug limit the use of caspofungin as first-line antifungal therapy, reserving its use to recipients who had undergone unsuccessful azole therapy.
