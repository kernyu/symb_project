OBJECTIVE: To analyze the pathogen profiles and the use of perioperative antibiotics after surgical site infection (SSI) in pancreas operation. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the pathogen profiles and the use of perioperative antibiotics in 48 SSI patients who received pancreas operations from Jan 2001 to Dec 2005. RESULTS: Totally 79 strains of pathogens (74 strains of bacteria) were isolated, including 17 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 17 strains of enterococcus species, 12 strains of Escherichia species, and 5 strains of enterobacteriaceae. Combination of the third generation of cephalosporins and antianaerobic agents were the main prophylactic therapies, with an average duration of (4.7 +/- 1.2) days. Most SSI episodes happened 6-14 days postoperatively (median 9 days). Celiac infections were most common (n=39). Therapeutic antibiotics gave priority to combined-antibiotics of the third cephalosporins and antianaerobic antibiotics, glycopeptides and carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: SSI commonly occurs on the 6-14 postoperative day, with MRSA and enterococci as the common pathogens of SSI after pancreas surgery. Antibiotic resistance should be considered when applying prophylactic therapies.
