Antibiotic resistance among Gram-positive bacteria has increased in recent years, thereby compromising the use of traditional therapies. Reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance is mandatory and requires worldwide cooperation. Complementary to such measures in the management of infectious diseases is the development of novel therapeutic agents. Daptomycin is the first in a new class of antibiotics, the cyclic lipopeptide with a potent and bactericidal activity against Gram-positive pathogens and, due to its in vitro and in vivo characteristics, demonstrates to be an exciting option for the treatment of Gram-positive infections. It has very good pharmacokinetics properties with a long half-life which allows a single intravenous daily dose and is currently approved for treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections at the dosage of 4 mg/kg/die and for treatment of bacteremia and endocarditis at the dosage of 6 mg/kg/die. Its favourable clinical profile together with its bactericidal activity and low potential for development of resistance makes daptomycin a good alternative to currently used agents for treatment of Gram positive infections.
