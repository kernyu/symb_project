Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. infections are becoming an important problem all throughout the world as well as in our country. In this study, we evaluated the drug resistance rates of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in the intensive care units of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital, Izmir, Turkey. Since by the year 2003, antibiotic consumption is started to be controlled by infectious disease and clinical microbiology specialists according to antibiotic policies ruled by the government, the antibiotic resistance rates were evaluated in two periods (2000-2002 and 2003-2006). Seventynine P. aeruginosa and 89 Acinetobacter spp. isolated during January 2000-December 2002 and 66 P. aeruginosa and 48 Acinetobacter spp. isolated during january 2003-December 2006 were included to the study. All the isolates were from deep tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Susceptibilities of the isolates against meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, tobramycine and ciprofloxacin were determined by E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden). The results indicated high antibiotic resistance rates. P. aeruginosa resistance rate for ceftazidime was 84%, cefepime 83%, carbapenemes 73%, ciprofloxacine 87% and piperacillin-tazobactam 88% while these rates were 98%, 95.6%, 87%, 100% and 100% for Acinetobacter spp., respectively. The data obtained in this study indicated that there were no decrease in the antibiotic resistance rates after 2003. In the year 2005, "Antibiotic use guideline" established in our hospital let the antibiotics used without infectious disease and clinical microbiology specialists consultation. The high antibiotic resistance rates may be attributed to the application of this antibiotic guideline leading to the uncontrolled use of antibiotics.
