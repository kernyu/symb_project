A questionnaire survey on the theory of postoperative infection prophylaxis was conducted to obtain the consensus on perioperative antimicrobial use among gynecologists in Japan in the period from April to July 2000. Fifty-six of the 83 gynecologists replied, and the following consensus was obtained. An antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) agent should be chosen based on their efficacy against the pathogens expected to be contaminants, such as Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis group. Use an AMP agent that archives a bactericidal concentrations in both the serum and operating site. Use an AMP agent that has little unfavourable side effects. The newer agents should be considered as a therapeutics for postoperative infections. The therapeutic antimicrobial agents having no cross-resistance to the AMP agents should be used, if postoperative infection is suspected or developed. The most commonly used agent for clean operations are cefazolin (CEZ), followed by cefotiam (CTM) and cefmetazole (CMZ). The most commonly used agent for clean-contaminated operations where low grade level of bacterial invasion expected is CTM, followed by CEZ and CMZ, where as operations where mild grade level of bacterial invasion expected is flomxef (FMOX), followed by CTM and other cephalosporins.
