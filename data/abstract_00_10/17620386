Homodimerization of histatin-derived peptides generally led to improved bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. In vivo, monomers and dimers were equally active in killing bacteria in mice with a soft tissue infection. Altogether, these peptides are promising compounds for the development of novel therapeutics against infections with drug-resistant bacteria.
