Cyclic phosphonomethoxy pyrimidine nucleosides that are bioisosteres of the monophosphate metabolites of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors AZT, d4T, and ddC have been synthesized. The RT inhibitory activities of the phosphonates were reduced for both dideoxy (dd) and dideoxydidehydro (d4) analogs compared to the nucleosides. Bis-isopropyloxymethylcarbonyl (BisPOC) prodrugs were prepared on selected compounds and provided > 150-fold improvements in antiviral activity.
