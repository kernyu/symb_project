CONTEXT: Treating patients with metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas can lead to regression of disease, but the tumor becomes resistant to therapy within a few months. If resistance can be reversed or prevented, the chemotherapeutic benefit may be prolonged. CASE REPORTS: Two patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer progressed on gemcitabine, capecitabine and docetaxel (GTX). When sirolimus was added to this regimen at a dosage to achieve a serum level of at least 10 ng/dL at the time of the gemcitabine and docetaxel infusion, their tumors regressed. CONCLUSION: This demonstrates that the addition of sirolimus to a gemcitabine/docetaxel containing regimen can reverse tumor resistance in the clinical setting.
