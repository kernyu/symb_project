VRS1 is the first isolated strain of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) found to carry the vanA gene complex previously described in Enterococcus. Under vancomycin pressure, VRS1 makes aberrant cell walls consisting of stem tetrapeptide and depsipeptide that lack the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala residues targeted by vancomycin. Previous data have suggested that this aberrant cell wall is not cross-linked by PBP2a, the enzyme responsible for cell wall transpeptidation in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics. We examined the efficacy of treating VRS1 with a combination of vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics in vitro and in vivo. We found that the MIC of oxacillin for VRS1 decreased from >256 microg/ml to <1 microg/ml in the presence of vancomycin. Using the rabbit model of endocarditis, we treated VRS1-infected rabbits with nafcillin alone, vancomycin alone, or a combination of nafcillin and vancomycin. Treatment with nafcillin in combination with vancomycin cleared bloodstream infections within 24 h and sterilized 12/13 spleens (92%), as well as 8/13 kidneys (62%), following 3 days of treatment. Mean aortic valve vegetation counts were reduced 3.48 log(10) CFU/g with the combination therapy (compared to untreated controls) and were significantly lower than with either vancomycin or nafcillin given alone. VRS1 was extremely virulent in this model, as no untreated rabbits survived the 3-day trial. Treatment of clinical infections due to VRSA with the combination of vancomycin and beta-lactams may be an option, based on these results.
