Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) continues to evolve. Thus far, efforts to control the spread of MRSA in the UK have failed, resulting in a great deal of public and political concern. New guidelines advocate a much more active "seek and destroy" policy, but the causes of the epidemic go back 30 years to the start of an extended period of disinvestment in the national health service. Consequently, a multifaceted approach is needed now, one that includes a huge investment in infrastructure and facilities for patient isolation, cleaning and disinfection of equipment, laboratory diagnosis of MRSA, antibiotic stewardship, and training of medical and nursing staff.
