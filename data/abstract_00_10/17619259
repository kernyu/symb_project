The aim of the study was to investigate the rate of Staphylococcus aureus nasal and skin carriage in patients undergoing haemodialysis. The cultured staphylococcal isolates were subsequently characterized by molecular methods. The study group comprised 43 haemodialysed patients from whom nasal and skin swabs from the vascular access sites were collected. The identification of staphylococcal isolates and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed on the basis of conventional diagnostic procedures. The staphylococci were further characterized using Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). S. aureus was cultured from 12 (27.9%) patients. Only one (8.3%) patient was colonized with the microorganism both in the anterior nares and the vascular access site representing a single strain, as evidenced by PFGE analysis. Antibiotic susceptibility testing identified one (7.6%) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain. PFGE typing identified several S. aureus genotypes with the lack of one specific strain responsible for colonization. However, it should be noted that among two (A and D) PFGE patterns genetically indistinguishable and closely related isolates (two isolates for each pattern) were identified. The obtained results revealed a relatively low rate of S. aureus carriage accompanied by low methicillin resistance rate and a significant genetic diversity of cultured isolates with the lack of one predominant strain responsible for colonization.
