Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Treatment of these infections is complicated by the intrinsic and acquired resistance of this bacterium to many commonly used antimicrobial agents. In this article, Drs Hauser and Sriram argue that careful consideration of the mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa resists the activity of antimicrobial agents is essential for optimal treatment decisions. Although many aspects of treatment of severe P. aeruginosa infections remain controversial, the authors suggest specific treatment options for patients both before and after susceptibilities are known.
