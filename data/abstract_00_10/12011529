Ocular infections can have devastating consequences and may lead to blindness. Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) has many potential advantages over the currently used drugs, including a broader antibacterial spectrum, it turns the surface of the eye brown for a few minutes, bacterial resistance has not been seen and it is cheaper than other agents. PVP-I has made a significant contribution to pre- and postoperative ocular surgical prophylaxis, ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Scientific support for these applications includes studies conducted over the past 17 years, which are reviewed.
