Fusarium asiaticum and F. graminearum are the primary causal agents of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat in China. In this study, sensitivities of 159 F. asiaticum and F. graminearum isolates to a benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim (MBC) and to sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) tebuconazole and prochloraz were determined. Among the 159 isolates, 9 were resistant to MBC and designated as MBC-R isolates. Three showed resistance to tebuconazole and prochloraz and designated as DMI-R isolates. There was no cross-resistance between MBC and DMI. Genetic analysis by microsatellite-primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that MBC-R or DMI-R isolates had different genotypes, which indicated that they originated from different wild-type parents. Analysis of two 14alpha-demethylase (cyp51) homologous genes (cyp51A and cyp51B) showed that the F. asiaticum isolates could be distinguished from F. graminearum isolates based on the sequence of cyp51A. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequence of cyp51A and cyp51B suggested that no mutations were associated with DMI resistance. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the DMI resistance was not related to the expression of cyp51A and cyp51B in F. asiaticum and F. graminearum, but expressions of both genes were induced greatly by the tebuconazole. Results of this study indicated that cyp51A would be an informative marker for analysis of population structure of F. asiaticum and F. graminearum, and the existence of homologous cyp51 genes in F. asiaticum and F. graminearum could provide new insights into DMI resistance in phytopathogenic fungi.
