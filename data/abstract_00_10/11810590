The spread of penicillin non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSSP) is an emerging problem for the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM). Attendance of children at day care centers, as well as the spread of PNSSP, is a risk factor for AOM. The status of the spread of PNSSP during the acute infection phase of AOM has not been evaluated. We examined the clonality of samples from seven children in a day care center who simultaneously developed AOM caused by PNSSP. The seven isolates from the children, and six control samples were grouped by serotyping, by determining resistance to antimicrobial agents, and by genotyping, carried out by sequencer-based random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and validated by bootstrap analysis. There was no evidence to indicate the direct dissemination of PNSSP among these patients in the day care center, although the simultaneous occurrence of PNSSP AOM had initially suggested a clonal outbreak. The possible presence of a common ancestral strain suggested the importance of surveillance during the carrier state. The result of RAPD genotyping was highly reproducible, as validated by the high bootstrap score. The use of an automated sequencer, in combination with a careful choice of primers, and commercially established kits, played a significant role in the reproducibility of the studies.
