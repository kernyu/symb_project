N-Carbamoyl D-amino acid amidohydrolase (D-NCAase) that catalyzes the stereospecific hydrolysis of N-carbamoyl D-amino acids to their corresponding D-amino acids is valuable in pharmaceutical industry. Agrobacterium radiobacter D-NCAase is sensitive to oxidative damage by hydrogen peroxide. To investigate the role of methionine residues in oxidative inactivation, each of the nine methionine residues in A. radiobacter D-NCAase was substituted with leucine, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis. Except for two mutants (Met5Leu and Met31Leu) with similar activities, seven mutants (Met73Leu, Met167Leu/Met169Leu, Met184Leu, Met220Leu, Met239Leu, Met244Leu, and Met239Leu/Met244Leu) were found to have reduced activities. In the presence of H(2)O(2), three mutants (Met239Leu, Met244Leu, and Met239Leu/Met244Leu) with substitution of highly solvent-accessible methionines by leucines retained their activities. The other mutants were also considerably resistant to chemical oxidation than was the wild-type enzyme. Thus, substitution of solvent-accessible methionine residues with leucine to enhance oxidative stability of D-NCAase is practical but might be with compromised activity.
