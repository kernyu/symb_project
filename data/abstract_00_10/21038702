OBJECTIVE: assessment of the in hospital death among the patients with healthcare associated infection (HA1) provoked by multi drug resistant strains (MDR) ofP. aeruginosa or A. baumanii. METHODS: enrolled in the study were patients with bloodstream, surgical site and urinary tract HAI infection, reported during 2006-2009 in the ICU for adults and general surgery wards of two large teaching clinics for emergencies in Bucharest municipality. Associations between fatal outcome and relevant demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed both through cohort and also by case-control studies. RESULTS: in the cohort analysis both the severity of the underlying disease and also the presence of HAl with MDR strains of P. aeruginosa or A. baumanii were statistical significant (p < 0.05) and independently associated with fatal outcome; the presence of HAI with MDR strains of P. aeruginosa or A. baumanii remained significant associated with fatal outcome even after controlling of the underlying disease's severity by case-control design (Match OR: 5.89; 95% IC: 1.39-40.77; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: the study's results demonstrate that the precautions to prevent the in hospital transmission of the MDR germs are pertinent because the HAI induced by these bugs is obviously associated with unfavorable clinical outcome of the patient.
