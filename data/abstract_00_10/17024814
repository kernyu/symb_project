A 24-hour pre-treatment of leukemic K-562 cells with busulfan or N-hydroxycarbamide (rather than cytarabine) lowered their resistance to the toxic effect of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Non-linear modulating influence was registered even at low dosage of cytostatics which actually could not affect leukemic cell viability.
