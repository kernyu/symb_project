Broad-spectrum of conventional antibiotics is one of the key factors that cause antibiotics-resistance of many bacteria. Bacteriocins are regarded as the next generation of antibiotics on account of their narrow-spectrum bactericidal activities. Many attentions have been paid to colicins because they are believed to be safe in regard to human body. In this paper, the genes encoding colicin S4 and its immunity protein were cloned into pQE30 to produce colicin S4 expression vector pQE30-Col S4. Colicin S4 was highly expressed as soluble form in gE colig M15 containing pQE30-Col S4. The yields ranged from 30 mg/L to 50 mg/L. The recombinant colicin S4 with an additional 6 His-tag at its N-terminus was found being similar to the natural colicin S4 in antibacterial activity. It only showed bactericidal activity against E. coli strains, thus makig it attractive to develop this protein as a novel antibiotic with narrow spectrum.
