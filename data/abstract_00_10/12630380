In 2000 we used a sensitive technique to examine 9 isolates from malaria patients in Muheza, Tanzania who had failed treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). Three isolates carried, at low levels, the leucine to isoleucine change at amino acid 164 that is associated with clinical failure of SP. Numerous other highly resistant alleles were also observed.
