Palivizumab (PZ) is the only monoclonal antibody currently available for use in humans against an infectious disease. PZ is administered prophylactically for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. RSV selected in cell culture for growth in the presence of PZ develops F gene mutations and can be resistant to PZ prophylaxis in cotton rats. Here, we evaluated the potential for PZ-resistant RSV mutants to arise in vivo. Cotton rats were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, administered PZ, and inoculated intranasally with RSV. Lungs were harvested 12 weeks after RSV infection, reverse transcription-PCR-amplified F gene fragments were cloned into plasmids, and the nucleotide sequences of the cloned cDNAs were determined. Three of the five animals had mixed populations of lung virus, and over 50% of the clones from the three animals revealed F gene mutations associated with resistance to PZ. A virus completely resistant to PZ neutralization was recovered from the lung homogenate of a rat that had received PZ. Thus, prolonged pulmonary replication of RSV in the presence of PZ was followed by the appearance of viruses resistant to PZ. The potential for the development of resistance is a consideration as the antibody is used prophylactically against RSV and as passively administered antibodies are under development for other infections, including emerging viruses and agents of biodefense.
