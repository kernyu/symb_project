This study involved a total of 116 samples, 79 taken from pigeon droppings and 37 of atmospheric air taken close to accumulations of excrement. Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii was isolated from 11 (13.9%) of these samples. Other species of Cryptococcus were also isolated from these samples, such as C. albidus (12.6%) and C. laurentii (8.9%). C. neoformans was not isolated from the air samples, though C. albidus (5.4%) was. All the strains of C. neoformans were found to belong to the A serotype (C. neoformans var. grubii). In regard to the studies with the antifungal agents 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B and voriconazole, by means of the microdilution method (EUCAST), we point out that one sample demonstrated resistance to fluconazole, this being especially significant because this is an environmental strain.
