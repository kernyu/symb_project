We developed a highly sensitive parallel allele-specific sequencing (PASS) assay to simultaneously analyze a large number of viral genomes and detect minor drug-resistant populations at approximately 0.1-0.01% levels. Using this assay on samples from individuals infected with human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), we successfully detected and quantified minor populations of drug-resistant viruses and performed linkage analysis of multiple-drug resistance mutations. This assay may serve as a useful tool to study drug resistance in HIV and other infectious agents.
