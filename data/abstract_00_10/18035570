OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine nasopharyngeal colonization rates and antibiotic resistance patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from Guatemalan children, and to determine risk factors for colonization and antibiotic nonsusceptibility. METHODS: Isolates were obtained from children aged 5 to 60 months attending public and private outpatient clinics and daycare centers during August 2001--June 2002 and outpatient clinics during November 2005--February 2006 in Guatemala City. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS), cefotaxime, and erythromycin were determined using the E-test. RESULTS: The overall nasopharyngeal colonization rate for S. pneumoniae was 59.1%. From 2001/2 to 2005/6 TMS nonsusceptibility increased from 42.4% to 60.8% (p<0.05) in public clinics and from 51.4% to 84.0% (p=0.009) in private clinics, and penicillin nonsusceptibility increased from 1.5% to 33.3% in public clinics (p<0.001). Reported antibiotic use was not strictly associated with nonsusceptibility to that same antibiotic. Resistance to three or four antibiotics increased in public clinics from 2001/2 (0%) to 2005/6 (10.7%; p<0.001). Risk factors for nasopharyngeal colonization with penicillin- or TMS-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae were low family income, daycare center attendance, and recent penicillin use. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing antibiotic nonsusceptibility rates in nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae isolates from Guatemalan children reflect worldwide trends. Policies encouraging more judicious use of TMS should be considered.
