Clostridium difficile should be suspected in patients who present with nosocomial diarrhoea. It is more common in the elderly or in patients with a debilitating underlying condition who have received antimicrobial agents, and up to 20-25% of patients may experience a relapse. The reference method for diagnosis is the cell culture cytotoxin test which detects the presence of toxin B in a cellular culture of human fibroblasts, but recovering C. difficile in culture allows the performance of a ''second-look" cell culture assay that enhances the potential for diagnosis. Oral metronidazole (500 mg tid or 250 mg every 6 hrs) and oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 hrs) administered for 1014 days have similar therapeutic efficacy, with response rates near 90-97%. C. difficile strains resistant to metronidazole and with intermediate resistance to vancomycin have been described. The administration of probiotics such as Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus sp. or brewer's yeast for prophylaxis of CDAD remains controversial.
