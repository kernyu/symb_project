Enterococcus faecalis G1-0247 (vancomycin MIC, 16 microg/ml) was found to harbor a vanG operon 99% identical to the vanG operon in E. faecalis BM4518. E. faecalis N03-0233 (vancomycin MIC, 16 microg/ml) was found to harbor a novel vanG operon, vanG2, on an element in a different chromosomal location than the vanG-harboring elements in G1-0247 and BM4518.
