Selected members of three classes of rhodacyanine dyes, [0,0]-, [1,0]-, and [0,0,0]-rhodacyanines, were synthesized and their in vitro antimalarial activities against Plasmodium falciparum K1 (chloroquine-resistant strain) as well as their in vivo activities against P. berghei in mice were determined. The novel [0,0,0]-rhodacynines, 3e and 3h, possessing a benzothiazole moiety, were shown to have highly promising antimalarial activities in vivo. Moreover, the [0,0,0]-rhodacyanines were found to be orally bioavailable.
