Access to antiretroviral therapy has expanded in many developing countries, including India. The standard first-line regimens consist of a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, in a fixed drug combination. Data regarding resistance to these drugs are scarce, especially in children. We evaluated the pattern of polymorphism and potential drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in HIV-1 isolates from 48 children naive to antiretroviral therapy attending the outpatient clinics of the Tuberculosis Research Center in Chennai. The samples were subjected to genotyping of reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes. All the samples showed significant polymorphisms in both RT and protease genes, but none had major DRMs. The currently recommended generic first-line antiretroviral drug combination is an appropriate treatment strategy for HIV-1-infected children in India.
