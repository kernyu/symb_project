Thirteen fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli (FQREC) isolates from hospitalized patients in the Netherlands were found to represent predominantly (low-virulence) phylogenetic groups A and B1 and to lack extraintestinal virulence traits. These FQREC resemble animal-source E. coli and presumably pose little threat to noncompromised hosts. Similar analysis of other FQREC is needed.
