Resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q/D) among gram-positive cocci has been very uncommon. Two clinical isolates among 8,837 (0.02%) Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were discovered in 2001 to 2002 with Q/D MICs of 4 micro g/ml. Each had a 5-amino-acid tandem duplication (RTAHI) in the L22 ribosomal protein gene (rplV) preventing synergistic ribosomal binding of the streptogramin combination. Similar gene duplication has been reported in Q/D-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
