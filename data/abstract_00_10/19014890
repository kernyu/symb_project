In this study, photodynamic inactivation (PDI) was used to inhibit in vitro growth and adhesion of different Candida isolates to buccal epithelial cells (BEC). Experimental conditions were optimized and 25muM toluidine blue O (TBO) and 15min of irradiation time by light emitting diode (LED) (energy density of 180J/cm(2)) were selected due to higher reductions in cellular viability obtained after treatment. Reduction media of Log(10) 3.41 in viable cellular growth and media of 55% in the inhibition of adhesion to buccal epithelial cells were obtained. Two fluconazole resistant isolates were susceptible to PDI (Log(10) 3.54 in IB05 and Log(10) 1.95 in CG09) and a second session of this treatment for CG09 isolate inhibited cellular viability in 100%, without producing heat. The results permit to conclude that photodynamic inactivation under these experimental conditions would be a possible alternative approach to inhibit Candida spp. cellular growth and adhesion to buccal epithelial cells.
