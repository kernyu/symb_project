BACKGROUND: We wanted to analyze the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of adult meningitis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a period of 5 years (January 1999 to December 2003), 127 cases were identified as having adult culture-proven bacterial meningitis caused by a single pathogen. Of them, 14 cases with CoNS meningitis were enrolled, and their clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The 14 cases (median age 37.5; range 24-77 years old) included nine men and five women. With polynerase chain reaction sequencing of bacterial 16S r-RNA, 10 of the 14 CoNS strains were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis infection, and the other four belonged to Staphylococcus haemolyticus. All 14 cases were in a postneurosurgical state with insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, external ventricular device or intrathecal port A as their underlying conditions, and 12 of the 14 patients contracted the infection nosocomially. Fever (86%), leukocytosis (79%), hydrocephalus (50%), consciousness disturbance (36%), and seizure (7%) were the major clinical manifestations. All the involved CoNS strains showed resistance to oxacillin but retained their susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolid. All 14 CoNS strains had positive mecA gene detection. With the removal of neurosurgical devices and intravenous vancomycin therapy, 86% (12/14) of the patients survived. CONCLUSION: CoNS meningitis accounted for 11% (14/127) of our adult bacterial meningitis. All adult CoNS meningitis patients had a disrupted barrier of the central nervous system as the underlying condition. S. epidermidis was the most common CoNS subtype involved. All involved CoNS strains were oxacillin resistant. The therapeutic result showed that adult CoNS meningitis had a mortality rate of 14% (2/14).
