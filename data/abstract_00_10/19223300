Antibiotic resistance is among the greatest threats to public health. Public and political concerns have been important drivers of a multifaceted strategy to contain and control this problem. The key components include surveillance of resistant pathogens and more accurate measurement of prescribing practice, in addition to adherence to sound hygiene and infection control practices. With the current inadequate supply of new antibiotics, better use of existing agents is fundamental. An educational strategy must involve the public as well as prescribing professionals. Public educational initiatives and campaigns have been increasingly used, often effectively. To this end, an annual Antibiotic Awareness Day (AAD) has been launched by the European Union (EU) under the leadership of the European Centre for Disease Control. Across Europe, a repertoire of events took place with the aim of raising public and professional awareness of the importance of appropriate antibiotic use. Only time will tell whether the annual 18 November EUAAD will have significant impact. The need to sustain the effectiveness of these drugs suggests that every effort should be made to ensure that it is successful.
