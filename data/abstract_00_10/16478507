AIMS: To investigate the activity of seven staphylococcins, bacteriocins produced by staphylococci, against multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) involved in human infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four bacteriocins produced by Staph. epidermidis (Pep5, epidermin, epilancin K7 and epicidin 280) and three produced by Staph. aureus (aureocins A70, A53 and 215FN) were tested. Sixteen Staph. aureus strains, including a representative strain of the endemic Brazilian methicillin-resistant clone (MRSA), and 57 CNS strains were used as indicators. Among the staphylococcins used, Pep5 was able to inhibit 77.2% of the CNS strains and 87.5% of the Staph. aureus strains tested, including the Brazilian MRSA endemic clone, responsible for a large number of hospital-acquired infections in Brazil. On the other hand, aureocin A53 and epidermin presented a high antagonistic activity only against the Staph. aureus strains, being able to inhibit, respectively, 87.5% and 81.3% of them, including also the Brazilian MRSA endemic clone. The remaining bacteriocins inhibited only a low percentage of the nosocomial staphylococcal strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Aureocin A53 and epidermin have potential applications against MRSA, whereas Pep5 seems to be an attractive agent against both MRSA and CNS, including mupirocin-resistant strains and the Brazilian endemic clone of MRSA, which is also found disseminated in other countries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacteriocins may represent alternative agents to control important nosocomial pathogens.
