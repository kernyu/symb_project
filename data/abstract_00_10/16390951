We evaluated the ability of the new VITEK 2 version 4.01 software to identify and detect glycopeptide-resistant enterococci compared to that of the reference broth microdilution method and to classify them into the vanA, vanB, vanC1, and vanC2 genotypes. Moreover, the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing with agents with improved potencies against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci was determined. A total of 121 enterococci were investigated. The new VITEK 2 software was able to identify 114 (94.2%) enterococcal strains correctly to the species level and to classify 119 (98.3%) enterococci correctly to the glycopeptide resistance genotype level. One Enterococcus casseliflavus strain and six Enterococcus faecium vanA strains with low-level resistance to vancomycin were identified with low discrimination, requiring additional tests. One of the vanA strains was misclassified as the vanB type, and one glycopeptide-susceptible E. facium wild type was misclassified as the vanA type. The overall essential agreements for antimicrobial susceptibility testing results were 94.2% for vancomycin, 95.9% for teicoplanin, 100% for quinupristin-dalfopristin and moxifloxacin, and 97.5% for linezolid. The rates of minor errors were 9% for teicoplanin and 5% for the other antibiotic agents. The identification and susceptibility data were produced within 4 h to 6 h 30 min and 8 h 15 min to 12 h 15 min. In conclusion, use of VITEK 2 version 4.01 software appears to be a reliable method for the identification and detection of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci as well as an improvement over the use of the former VITEK 2 database. However, a significant reduction in the detection time would be desirable.
