PURPOSE: Candida glabrata is a rare cause of endophthalmitis after penetrating keratoplasty. Adequate therapy is still under discussion. With respect to severe complications and side effects of antifungal therapy, a substantial knowledge of sensitivity and resistance of the organism is necessary. METHODS: We report on a 26-year-old man with a hyperacute onset of the infection only 10 hours after surgery. A combined therapy for fluconazole and steroids administered over 3 months had shown no effect on intraocular infection. RESULTS: After topical and intracameral application of amphotericin B in combination with topical prednisolone 3 months after the onset of the endophthalmitis, the infection disappeared within 14 days, and the graft remained clear for 2 months. No toxic effects were noticed. CONCLUSION: In the case presented here, topical and intracameral application of amphotericin B was sufficient and safe in the therapy for C. glabrata endophthalmitis after penetrating keratoplasty. Although typically the intraocular infection is first noticed within the first 2 weeks, a hyperacute onset has to be considered.
