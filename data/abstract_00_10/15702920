The oxazolidinone antimicrobial, linezolid, has been approved for the treatment of infections caused by various gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). This is the first report on isolation of a linezolid resistant, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (LRVREF) strain in Poland, from a Haematological Unit patient in the Clinical Hospital in Gdansk. PCR-RFLP analysis of rDNA and allele-specific PCR of the domain V region of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene demonstrated the presence of the G2576U mutation previously reported to be associated with linezolid resistance. Both assays detected heterozygous in this position.
