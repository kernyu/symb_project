A systemic and endemic emerging mycosis in Latin America, paracoccidioidomycosis, is characterised by its chronicity and by the severity of the disseminated form in healthy individuals, as well as in immunocompromised individuals co-infected with HIV, resulting, in the latter, in a mortality rate in the range of 30 - 45%. The long (several years) duration of treatment results from the immunosuppression induced by the disease or from the survival capacity of the fungus in tissue. A few controlled studies and case reports have shown that fast-acting azolic and sulfa derivatives are useful treatment alternatives for patients presenting milder forms of the disease. However, when using such drugs, treatment regimens of longer duration are required for the maintenance of patients with more severe forms. The search for new alternatives for treating the most severe forms is an ongoing challenge. Novel treatments may be found among new classes of drugs, drug combinations, or agents capable of modulating the immune response, such as a peptide derived from the 43-kDa Paracoccidioides brasiliensis glycoprotein.
