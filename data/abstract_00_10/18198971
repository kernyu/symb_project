Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is an infection involving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with onset in the community in an individual lacking established health care-associated MRSA risk factors. A 74-year-old group home resident with a history of hypertension and mental retardation presents with a spider bite-like lesion that rapidly progresses to multiple areas of her body. Culture results reveal MRSA. The patient's advanced age and the severity and rapidity of progression of the condition warranted treatment, and options are discussed. Pharmacists should assist in selecting antibiotics for patients with resistant infections and provide strategies for preventing the spread of resistant organisms. Current and complete medical records are critical in the group home setting. The role of the caregiver and the consultant pharmacist in this setting is discussed.
