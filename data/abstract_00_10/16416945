Fluoroquinolones are important antibiotics for treatment of serious infections. Increased usage has, in many countries, resulted in rapid development of resistance towards this class of antibiotics. Moreover, it has been shown that use of fluoroquinolones is associated with selection of multi-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The risks related to overuse of fluoroquinolones among both humans and animals are reviewed and strict indications for use are suggested.
