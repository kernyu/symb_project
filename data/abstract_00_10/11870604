Mutation and selection for increased resistance to cell-wall synthesis inhibitors led to alterations in the hyphal branching rate of Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2338. Mutants with decreased branching frequency exhibited increased hyphal strength (estimated by in vitro micromanipulation). As the hyphal strength was increased, this led to a greater proportion of hyphal particles in liquid culture with a hyphal fragment diameter of greater than 88 microm. This, in turn, coincided with proportionately increased antibiotic production.
