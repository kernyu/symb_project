Membranotropic amphiphilic chromophore merocyanine 540 sensitized photodynamic inhibition of drug-resistant and sensitive variants of type I herpes simplex virus in cultured Vero cell. Optimal conditions of photodamage to virus particles and infected cells were determined (merocyanine 540 concentration 1 microM, illumination dose 32.5-65.0 kJ/m(2), exposure at early stages of infection). Infected cells actively bind the photosensitizer, which explains their selective photodamage.
