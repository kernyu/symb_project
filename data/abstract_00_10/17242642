INTRODUCTION: Linezolid, a new antistaphylococcal agent for oral or intravenous administration is active against Staphylococcus aureus with limited sensitivity to glycopeptides. The purpose of the present work was to compare data in the literature with practical clinical experience with the use of linezolid for lung infections in adult cystic fibrosis patients with the objective of developing local guidelines for use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective clinical study was conducted in the adult pneumology department of a university hospital. RESULTS: The main clinical signs leading to prescription of linezolid were aggravating cough, bronchial obstruction, and exercise-induced fatigue. Among 42 cystic fibrosis patients, six aged 24+/-3 years were given 22 treatments of linezolid. Two patients were given the drug once and the others 2, 4, 5, and 9 times, 600 mg b.i.d. Mean duration of treatment with linezolid was 16+/-5 days. Among the six patients, two presented meti-R S. aureus infection. For twelve cases, clinical improvement was observed; and in two others the situation worsened leading to interruption of linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: There are few reports in the literature on use of linezolid in cystic fibrosis patients. Writing internal guidelines for our department has enabled standardized use: 600 mg b.i.d. p.o. for 14 days as second-line treatment for bronchial exacerbation of S. aureus infection.
