The aim of this study was to investigate antimicrobial susceptibilities and macrolide resistance mechanisms of beta-hemolytic viridans group streptococci (VGS) in a tertiary Korean hospital. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of seven antimicrobials were determined for 103 beta-hemolytic VGS isolated from various specimens. The macrolide resistance mechanisms of erythromycin-resistant isolates were studied by the double disk test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The overall resistance rates of beta-hemolytic VGS were found to be 47.5% to tetracycline, 3.9% to chloramphenicol, 9.7% to erythromycin, and 6.8% to clindamycin, whereas all isolates were susceptible to penicillin G, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. Among ten erythromycin-resistant isolates, six isolates expressed a constitutive MLS(B) (cMLS(B)) phenotype, and each of the two isolates expressed the M phenotype, and the inducible MLS(B) (iMLS(B)) phenotype. The resistance rates to erythromycin and clindamycin of beta-hemolytic VGS seemed to be lower than those of non-beta-hemolytic VGS in our hospital, although cMLSB phenotype carrying erm(B) was dominant in beta-hemolytic VGS.
