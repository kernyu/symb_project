BACKGROUND: Limited information about the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has been reported from India, the country with the world's highest burden of TB. We conducted a representative state-wide survey in the state of Gujarat (2005 population: 56 million). METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a representative sample of new and previously treated smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) cases were subjected to drug susceptibility testing (DST) against first-line drugs at a World Health Organization supranational reference laboratory. Isolates found to have at least both isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) resistance (i.e., multidrug-resistant TB [MDR-TB]) were subjected to second-line DST. RESULTS: Of 1571 isolates from new patients, 1236 (78.7%) were susceptible to all first-line drugs, 173 (11%) had any INH resistance and MDR-TB was found in 37 (2.4%, 95%CI 1.6-3.1). Of 1047 isolates from previously treated patients, 564 (54%) were susceptible to all first-line drugs, 387 (37%) had any INH resistance and MDR-TB was found in 182 (17.4%, 95%CI 15.0-19.7%). Among 216 MDR-TB isolates, 52 (24%) were ofloxacin (OFX) resistant; seven cases of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) were found, all of whom were previously treated cases. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB prevalence remains low among new TB patients in Gujarat, but is more common among previously treated patients. Among MDR-TB isolates, the alarmingly high prevalence of OFX resistance may threaten the success of the expanding efforts to treat and control MDR-TB.
