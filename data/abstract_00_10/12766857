We describe 2 patients without prior exposure to linezolid who were infected with closely related strains of linezolid- and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (LRVREF) that may have been hospital acquired. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the domain V region of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene demonstrated the presence of the G2576U mutation previously reported to be associated with linezolid resistance. Nosocomial transmission of LRVREF is an ominous sign and underscores the importance of meticulous infection-control measures.
