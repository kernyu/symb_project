The biotechnological and safety properties of the novel enterococcal species of dairy origin, Enterococcus italicus, were investigated. The strains of the species showed technological characteristics related to their use as adjunct cultures in the production of artisanal cheeses. They were susceptible or poorly resistant to several clinical relevant antibiotics. Moreover, E. italicus strains were associated with low virulence profiles, as verified by screening for the presence of 33 different genes encoding antibiotic resistance and known virulence factors in the genus Enterococcus. From the data obtained, we deduce that the presence of E. italicus strains in cheeses results in a low health risk and that within the species new safe adjunct cultures for the dairy industry could be found.
