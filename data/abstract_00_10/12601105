BACKGROUND: MxA is an antiviral protein exclusively induced by type I interferons (IFN) and some viruses, and MxA gene expression is one of the most appropriate markers for measuring the biologic activity of exogenous IFNbeta. METHODS: A new quantitative-competitive PCR method was used to quantify MxA mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 99 treatment-naive and 92 IFNbeta-treated patients with MS (22 Avonex, 17 Betaferon, and 53 Rebif-22). Every 3 months, IFNbeta-induced neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were evaluated in sera using a cytopathic effect assay. Three categories of patients were identified: NAb negative (NAb-), persistent NAb positive (NAb+, >or=2 consecutive positive samples), and isolated NAb+ (one positive sample). RESULTS: Treatment-naive patients expressed detectable MxA mRNA levels (mean = 36 +/- 32 fg MxA/pg glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); range 1 to 160) and an upper normal threshold was established (mean + 3 SD = 132 fg MxA/pg GAPDH). IFNbeta-treated patients exhibited more than 11-fold higher levels (mean = 412 +/- 282 fg MxA/pg GAPDH; range 16 to 1,172). However, 17 patients did not exhibit an increase in MxA mRNA level; 15 of these 17 patients showed a concurrent Nab+ titer. Moreover, 13 were persistent NAb+. Isolated NAb+ patients did not show a decrease in bioavailability of IFNbeta (n = 9; mean = 567 +/- 366 fg MxA/pg GAPDH; range 83 to 1,120). In NAb- patients, bioavailability was comparable among the three different IFNbeta preparations 12 hours after injection. CONCLUSION: During IFNbeta therapy, the presence of NAb reduced or abolished bioavailability in a relevant percentage of patients. These data could be important for the early detection of patients with MS who are not responsive to IFNbeta therapy.
