The anthelmintic resistance status was investigated of nematode parasites of sheep and goats owned by smallholder farmers in communities that received breeding stock from a source where a high level of anthelmintic resistance has been reported. The investigation used the faecal egg count reduction technique, whereby suitable animals within each of eight separate communities were pooled to achieve the numbers required to conduct separate tests for both sheep and goats. Anthelmintics tested were albendazole (ABZ), tetramisole (TET), a combination (ABZ + TET) and ivermectin (IVM), at the manufacturers' recommended dose rates. Results showed that there was no evidence of anthelmintic resistance in nematode parasites of either sheep an goats in any community. This indicates that dilution of resistant parasites imported with introduced breeding stock, and the low selection pressure imposed by the smallholder farmers themselves, has prevented anthelmintic resistance from emerging in nematode parasites of small ruminants in these communities.
