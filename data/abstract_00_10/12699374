Cationic antibacterial peptides have been proclaimed as new drugs against multiresistant bacteria. Their limited success so far is partially due to the size of the peptides, which gives rise to unresolved issues regarding administration, bioavailability, metabolic stability, and immunogenicity. We have systematically investigated the minimum antibacterial motif of cationic antibacterial peptides regarding charge and lipophilicity/bulk and found that the pharmacophore was surprisingly small, opening the opportunity for development of short antibacterial peptides for systemic use.
