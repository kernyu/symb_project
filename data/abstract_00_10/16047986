NOSOCOMIAL SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS (SSIs), especially those caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms, are a major concern for perioperative nurses. Administering the correct antibiotic at its effective dose within the optimal time frame can help prevent SSIs. THE SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP between microbial resistance and overuse of antibiotics justifies an examination of practices and a move away from widespread antibiotic administration. NEW ANTIBIOTIC GUIDELINES and research support recommendations for antibiotic administration for specific cardiac, colorectal, gynecologic, ophthalmologic, orthopedic, and urinary surgical procedures. Perioperative nurses can help protect their patients from nosocomial SSIs by using this clinical evidence.
