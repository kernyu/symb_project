PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes recent advances in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, focusing on the use of antiretroviral treatment strategies in pregnancy, and discusses the emergence of viral resistance following the use of nevirapine to prevent mother-to-child transmission. RECENT FINDINGS: Mother-to-child transmission has been dramatically reduced in developed countries by the use of antiretroviral treatment and avoidance of breastfeeding. Highly active antiretroviral therapy use in pregnancy is recommended for women who require ongoing treatment, and, where available, is also very effective in reducing mother-to-child transmission in women with higher CD4 counts. The addition of a maternal and infant nevirapine dose to antenatal zidovudine can reduce transmission to below 5%, approximately half the transmission rate that can be achieved by single-dose nevirapine alone. The emergence of resistant virus following nevirapine use is a concern, occurring in up to 60% of mothers and 50% of infants following a single dose. Addition of zidovudine and lamivudine for 4-7 days postpartum can reduce the risk of resistance to 10%. SUMMARY: There is broad consensus on an approach to preventing mother-to-child transmission, which provides antiretroviral treatment in pregnancy and beyond to those women who need it, and an effective prophylactic regimen for those who do not yet need treatment, These regimens include highly active antiretroviral therapy, where available, a zidovudine-plus-nevirapine regimen in other settings, or nevirapine alone where this is all that is possible. More work is needed on the impact of nevirapine resistance and on reducing breast-milk transmission.
