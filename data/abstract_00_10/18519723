Tomopenem (formerly CS-023) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with broad-spectrum coverage of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Its antibacterial activity against European clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was compared with those of imipenem and meropenem. The MICs of tomopenem against MRSA and P. aeruginosa at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited were 8 and 4 microg/ml, respectively, and were equal to or more than fourfold lower than those of imipenem and meropenem. The antibacterial activity of tomopenem against MRSA was correlated with a higher affinity for the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a. Its activity against laboratory mutants of P. aeruginosa with (i) overproduction of chromosomally coded AmpC beta-lactamase; (ii) overproduction of the multidrug efflux pumps MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, and MexEF-OprN; (iii) deficiency in OprD; and (iv) various combinations of AmpC overproduction, MexAB-OprM overproduction, and OprD deficiency were tested. The increases in the MIC of tomopenem against each single mutant compared with that against its parent strain were within a fourfold range. Tomopenem exhibited antibacterial activity against all mutants, with an observed MIC range of 0.5 to 8 microg/ml. These results suggest that the antibacterial activity of tomopenem against the clinical isolates of MRSA and P. aeruginosa should be ascribed to its high affinity for PBP 2a and its activity against the mutants of P. aeruginosa, respectively.
