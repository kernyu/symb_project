This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of a high cadmium (Cd)-resistant bacterial strain, and possible exploitation of its Cd-accumulation and Cd-induced siderophore production property to improve plant growth in cadmium-contaminated soil through root colonization. The bacterial strain could tolerate up to 8 mM of Cd and could accumulate Cd intracellularly. The strain showed Cd-induced siderophore production maximally at 1.75 mM of Cd concentration under culture condition. It stimulated the growth of mustard and pumpkin plants in Cd-added soil through its establishment in rhizosphere. Through biochemical characterization and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, the strain KUCd1, as the name given to it, was identified as a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
