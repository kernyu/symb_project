A rapid in-house mycobacteriophage-based assay to identify multidrug resistance by detecting the rifampin susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a microtiter plate format was evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the assay were 100%. This test is rapid to perform and suitable for widespread implementation.
