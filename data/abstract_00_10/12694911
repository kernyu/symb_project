We have characterized the variable region of three integrons found in the multiresistant strain Enterobacter cloacae SCH88040794, using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of amplicons. The first integron has the gene cassette arrangement dfrAI-aadA1 in its variable region and the second aadB-oxa9. The third integron is In40 (aacA4-qacF-cmlB-oxa9), which has recently been described. The multiresistance expressed by this strain to amikacin, gentamicin, trimethoprim, sulfonamides, oxacillin, chloramphenicol and quaternary ammonium compounds is due, at least in part, to these three integrons.
