The undesired growth of biofilms on solid surfaces is often termed biofouling. Biofilms consist mainly of water and microbial cells which are embedded in a biopolymer matrix. Biofouling lowers the water quality and increases the frictional resistance in tubes. Further, biofilms increase the pressure differences in membrane processes and can clog filtration membranes, valves, and nozzles. For investigation and improvement of biocide efficacy and anti-fouling strategies, on-line and in situ monitoring of the biofilm is necessary. In this study, photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) was employed for biofilm monitoring. PAS allows the depth-resolved investigation of growth and detachment processes of biofilms. Strategies based on the oxidant hydrogen peroxide were compared to popular isothiazolinone biocides. Hydrogen peroxide allowed a very fast and efficient removal of attached biofilms, whereas no effect on the biofilm matrix was observed in most cases when isothiazolinone biocides were used.
