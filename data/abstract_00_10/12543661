Many VISA (vancomycin intermediately resistant Staphylococcus aureus) strains are characterized by increased cell wall biosynthesis and decreased cross-linking of the peptide side chains, leading to accumulation of free D-alanyl-D-alanine termini in the peptidoglycan, which act as false target sites for vancomycin. A spontaneous mutant of methicillin-resistant VISA strain SA137/93A (vancomycin MIC [E-test], 8 micro g/ml), called SA137/93G, showed increased resistance to vancomycin (MIC [E-test], 12 micro g/ml). Analysis of the resistance profile of the mutant revealed a loss of beta-lactam resistance with a concomitant increase in resistance to glycopeptides. In both strains, cell wall thickness was 1.4-fold greater than that of control isolates. However, cross-linking of the cell wall was drastically lower in SA137/93A than in SA137/93G. The sensitivity of strain SA137/93G to beta-lactams was due to loss of the beta-lactamase plasmid and a deletion that comprises 32.5 kb of the methicillin resistance cassette SCCmec, as well as 65.4 kb of chromosomal DNA. A spontaneous mutant of SA137/93G with higher sensitivity to vancomycin displayed a cell wall profile similar, in some respects, to that of an fmhB mutant. Results described here and elsewhere show that the only feature common to all VISA strains is a thickened cell wall, which may play a central role in the vancomycin resistance mechanism.
