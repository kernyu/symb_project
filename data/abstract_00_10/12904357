We monitored antimicrobial susceptibility data for Salmonella strains isolated from humans, cattle, pigs, and chickens in The Netherlands from 1984 to 2001 in order to provide insight into the dynamics of resistance over time. The strains were tested for their susceptibilities to seven antimicrobial agents by the agar diffusion method. Resistance was most common in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Among the strains from humans, pigs, and chickens, it was found that the level of resistance of serovar Typhimurium strains to tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased from 1984 to 2001. This increase could be attributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant serovar Typhimurium DT 104. Among the strains from cattle, it was found that the level of resistance of serovar Typhimurium strains, which was already very high in the 1980s, declined during the study period to the same levels as those for the strains from the other species from 1996 to 2001. Serovar Enteritidis isolates remained susceptible during the entire survey period. Among serovar Paratyphi B variation Java strains isolated from chickens, resistance to furazolidone, flumequine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin emerged, although furazolidone was not used after 1990. Together, the data indicate that the levels and patterns of resistance differed considerably between Salmonella serovars isolated from one host species.
