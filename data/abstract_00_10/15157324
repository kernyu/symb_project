To explore the relationship of multidrug resistance formation in K562/A02 cells with the intracellular concentration of [Ca(2+)]i, the cytotoxicities of daunorubicin (DNR) were assayed by MTT method, the variations of [Ca(2+)]i of K562 cells and K562/A02 cells after treatment of Tet, DRL and DNR alone or in combination were detected by using Fura-2/AM. The results showed as follows: (1) The cytotoxicities of DNR to cell line K562/A02 were enhanced by 1 micro mol/L Tet or 5 micro mol/L DRL. Their IC(50) was (7.28 +/- 2.06) micro g/ml and (7.58 +/- 3.44) micro g/ml; multiple of their reversal effect was 2.94 and 2.82, but IC(50) of combined Tet and DRL was (1.66 +/- 0.41) micro g/ml. Its reverse effect distinctly increased by 12.9 times. (2) The [Ca(2+)]i in K562/A02 cells were higher than that in K562 cells. (3) One micro mol/L Tet and 5 micro mol/L DRL alone increased the [Ca(2+)]i in K562/A02 cells time-dependently and there was antagonism when both were used. It is concluded that high [Ca(2+)]i is supposed to be a reason of MDR in K562/A02 cells, the action of resistance modifying agents (RMA) in MDR reverse course, however, needs further research.
