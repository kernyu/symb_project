Over the course of a 20-month period, in a hospital respiratory ward in which ciprofloxacin was often used as empirical antimicrobial therapy for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), 16 patients with chronic bronchitis developed nosocomial LRTIs caused by penicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 23 F). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for all isolates from the first 9 patients was 4 microg/mL, in association with a parC mutation. Isolates from the subsequent 7 patients all had a ciprofloxacin MIC of 16 microg/mL, in association with an additional mutation in gyrA. The MICs for this isolate were 8 microg/mL of levofloxacin (resistant), 2 microg/mL of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin (intermediately resistant), and 0.12 microg/mL of gemifloxacin. This outbreak demonstrates the ability of S. pneumoniae to acquire multiple mutations that result in increasing levels of resistance to the fluoroquinolones and to be transmitted from person to person.
