Seventeen Salmonella enterica serovar Hadar isolates recovered from bison were found to possess a range of virulence genes and resistance to tetracycline, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole, and streptomycin simultaneously. A 1-kb class 1 integron containing the aadA1 gene was identified in all isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis found that all isolates were closely related, indicating the possibility of cross-contamination during processing.
