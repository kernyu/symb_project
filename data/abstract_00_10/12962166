Pathogens implicated in community-acquired respiratory tract infections are becoming increasingly resistant to anti-bacterial therapies. Thus, there is an urgent need for new agents with activity against current resistant respiratory tract pathogens and a low potential to select for resistance or induce cross-resistance to existing antibacterial agents. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial agent to undergo clinical development, has enhanced binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA. Through its unique structure, telithromycin retains activity against resistant respiratory pathogens and has shown high efficacy in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. On the basis of phase 3 clinical trial experience, telithromycin appears safe and well tolerated across various patient populations, including high-risk groups.
