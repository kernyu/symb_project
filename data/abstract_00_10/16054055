The oxidative stress hypothesis of aging predicts that a reduction in the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) will decrease oxidative damage and extend life span. Increasing mitochondrial proton leak-dependent state 4 respiration by increasing mitochondrial uncoupling is an intervention postulated to decrease mitochondrial ROS production. When human UCP2 (hUCP2) is targeted to the mitochondria of adult fly neurons, we find an increase in state 4 respiration, a decrease in ROS production, a decrease in oxidative damage, heightened resistance to the free radical generator paraquat, and an extension in life span without compromising fertility or physical activity. Our results demonstrate that neuronal-specific expression of hUCP2 in adult flies decreases cellular oxidative damage and is sufficient to extend life span.
