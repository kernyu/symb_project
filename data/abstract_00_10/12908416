In 68 C. difficile strains isolated from feacal samples of patients with antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD) investigated presence of ermB gene transferable of high level resistance to clindamycin. The primers set 2980/2981 used for identification of ermB gene amplified a 688 bp segment. We used the Etest to assess all strains for susceptibility to clindamycin. This study demonstrates that 57% of strains isolated from faecal samples of patients with AAD were highly resistant to clindamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clindamycin, 256 mg/L) and possessed the ermB gene.
