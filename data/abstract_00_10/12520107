A total of 713 strains of fecal Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from laboratory animals in the colonies of 4 research laboratories and 4 commercial breeders in Japan in 1994 were examined in regard to resistance to 8 antibacterial agents. The incidence of resistance to sulfadimethoxine (Su), streptomycin (Sm), ampicillin, cephaloridine, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and gentamicin was 99.9%, 32.5%, 6.7%, 0.7%, 7.0%, 2.6%, 6.6% and 0.7%, respectively. These results indicated that Su and Sm resistance are penetrating into normal E. coli strains isolated from laboratory animals.
