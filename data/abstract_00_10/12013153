There is an urgent need for antibiotics that can be used in the therapy of infections caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, the incidence of which is often associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Antibiotics that can interact positively with the immune response and that also possess microbicidal properties might significantly contribute to improving the outcome of S. pneumoniae infections. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effect of clarithromycin, an extended spectrum macrolide currently used in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, on the in vitro interaction between human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) and three strains of S. pneumoniae with different susceptibility or resistance patterns to both penicillin and clarithromycin. At a concentration of one-half the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), clarithromycin significantly enhanced human PMN functions, particularly intracellular bactericidal activity, against all the S. pneumoniae strains, including resistant ones. This finding may help to explain clarithromycin activity in vivo despite apparent resistance in vitro. Preexposure of PMNs to one-half the MIC of clarithromycin had no effect on either phagocytosis or intracellular killing, ruling out a direct antibiotic action on PMNs. Preexposure of streptococci to clarithromycin increased the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to the bactericidal mechanisms of human PMNs compared with untreated bacteria, indicating that this macrolide may partly reduce bacterial virulence via changes in S. pneumoniae.
