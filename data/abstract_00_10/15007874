The bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between September and December, 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined, and the results were compared with those obtained between 1992 and 2000. Comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those in uncomplicated UTIs and those in complicated UTIs (including with or without indwelling catheter). The drug sensitivity of S. aureus in this year was comparable to those in up to the previous year, and S. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin (VCM). E. faecalis showed good susceptibility to ampicillin and imipenem, and the MIC90s were 2 micrograms/mL. The susceptibility of E. faecalis to VCM was also good. E. coli showed good susceptibility to the drugs except penicillins. Among cephems, the susceptibility to cefozopran (CZOP) was better (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microgram/mL). Just as the last report, the decreases in susceptibility of E. coli to quinolones were also observed in the patients with complicated UTIs. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to all the test drugs did not significantly change in 2001 and was generally good but not to penicillins. Among cephems, Klebsiella spp. showed good susceptibility to flomoxef, cefpirome, cefixime, and CZOP with < or = 0.125 microgram/mL of MIC90s either in uncomplicated or complicated UTIs. Although the drug sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was generally low, the detection of the strains that showed good susceptibility to quinolones and carbapenems (MIC: < or = 0.125-2 micrograms/mL) were relatively frequent.
