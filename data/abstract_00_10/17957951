Critical lower limb ischemia is a term used to define those patients with chronic ischemic pain at rest, ulcerations or limb necrosis caused by confirmed atherosclerotic lesions of the arteries. In this paper to evaluate of the clinical usefulness of silver coated prostheses in critical lower limb ischemia was presented. The use of the vascular artificial prostheses (dacron, dacron with velour, dacron albumin coated, polytetrafluoroethylene, dacron gentamicin/ryfampicin coated) in the critical ischemia limbs threatened is her contagion. In cases of potentially threatened a contagion is indicated the use of vascular prostheses about enlarged resistance on the contagion, e.g. the silver/collagen coated prosthesis. A foundation of the use of such prostheses are antibacterial proprieties of polyester fibers salts of the silver. An aim of many works is estimation of healing of the silver prostheses of grafted in lower limb at ill with the critical ischemia where infecting of the synthetic material is extremely probable. The healing of the silver prosthesis rated is most often at the use of the scintigraphy with Technetium 99. One attends that such research will make possible the estimation of the usefulness of the vascular silver prostheses in reconstructive operations in the vascular surgery, particularly in cases threatened with the infection of used synthetic material.
