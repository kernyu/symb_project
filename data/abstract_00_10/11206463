A series of norstatine-based HIV/FIV protease inhibitors incorporating a 15-membered macrocycle as a mimic of the tripeptide (Ala-Val-Phe), a motif with a small P3' residue elective against the FIV protease and the drug-resistant HIV proteases, has been synthesized. It was found that the macrocycle is important to the overall activity of the inhibitors. Certain inhibitors were developed expressing low nanomolar inhibitory activity against the HIV/FIV proteases and they are also effective against some drug-resistant as well as TL3-resistant HIV proteases.
