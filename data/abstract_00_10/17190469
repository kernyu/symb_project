Three new epidithiodioxopiperazine compounds, bionectins A (1), B (2), and C (3), along with a known compound, verticillin D (4), have been isolated from the mycelium of liquid fermentation cultures of the fungus Bionectra byssicola F120. The structures of compounds 1-3 were assigned on the basis of MS and NMR data. Compounds 1 and 2 incorporate a dioxopiperazine moiety with a disulfide bridge in their molecules, while 3 contains a dioxopiperazine ring with two methylsulfanyl groups. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited antibacterial activity against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and quinolone-resistant S. aureus (QRSA), with MIC values of 10-30 microg/mL, while 3 showed no antibacterial activity even at 100 microg/mL.
