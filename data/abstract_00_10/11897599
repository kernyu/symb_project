BMS-247243, a novel cephalosporin inhibitory for methicillin-resistant staphylococci, primarily has activity against gram-positive bacteria. The activities of BMS-247243, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were similar. BMS-247243 inhibits Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. BMS-247243 also inhibits many inherently vancomycin-resistant species (Leuconstoc, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus) and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria.
