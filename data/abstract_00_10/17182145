In the present study, the Campylobacter isolates from retail poultry meat in Estonia were sero- and genotyped, and the antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. Forty-eight chicken (36 Estonian, 12 imported) and 22 turkey (imported) Campylobacter isolates from 580 raw broiler chicken (396 Estonian, 184 imported) and 30 turkey (imported) meat samples were studied. Of the isolates, 64 were C. jejuni, 4 C. coli, and 2 Campylobacter spp. Penner serotyping of 54 C. jejuni isolates revealed 11 different serotypes, and 22% of the isolates were nontypeable by the commercial antisera. The most common serotypes O:1,44; O:21, and O:55 accounted for 28%, 13%, and 13% of the isolates, respectively. Differences in serotype distribution were seen for chicken and turkey isolates. Genotypic characterization of all Campylobacter isolates (n=70) was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). SmaI and KpnI yielded 29 and 34 PFGE types, respectively, revealing high diversity among isolates. The serotype distribution did not show an association with the origin of the sample, but the majority of the isolates sharing a similar PFGE genotype originated from one country. High levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin (66%), nalidixic acid (66%), tetracycline (44%), ampicillin (34%), and erythromycin (14%) were detected among the 70 Campylobacter isolates. The simultaneous resistance to two or three antimicrobial agents occurred in 60% of the isolates. The Campylobacter isolates from turkey meat had higher resistance to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline than those from chicken meat. None of the chicken isolates were resistant to gentamicin, and no turkey isolates to erythromycin or gentamicin.
