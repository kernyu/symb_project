Forty-six cephamycin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates from patients diagnosed with community-acquired urinary tract infection were selected in order to study their resistance mechanism. With the exception of one isolate producing CMY-4, all isolates produced a CMY-2 beta-lactamase. Molecular typing showed that the CMY-2-producing isolates were not related. Cephamycin resistance was plasmid encoded and conjugatively transferred. Plasmid digest profiles suggested that the plasmids were different. Thirty-nine of the 45 CMY-2-producing isolates harboured a plasmid containing a specific DNA fragment, ISEcp1-bla(CMY-2)-blc-sugE, which was identical to those previously published in CMY-2-producing Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis (SCB67) and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (pNF1358) from Taiwan and the USA, respectively. Among the remaining six isolates, insertion of IS1294 and IS1 at different positions was observed in one and five isolates, respectively. The regions surrounding bla(CMY-2) of the six isolates were identical to the other 39 isolates as well as to SCB67 and pNF1358. Since the present identical transmissible bla(CMY-2)-carrying element was observed in food animal sources both in the USA and Taiwan, its possible transmission to humans, as revealed in this study, is of great concern. Awareness of this mobile resistance element is required to prevent introduction into hospitals and to reduce the spread of this emerging resistance within the community.
