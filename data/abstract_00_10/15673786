The stability of fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae was evaluated in laboratory-derived mutants and clinical isolates. Isolates with various genotypes and phenotypes were subcultured for 20 days on antibiotic-free media and were monitored by E-tests to identify any alterations in resistance. Fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms, whether efflux or chromosomally mediated, remained stable in both clinical and laboratory-derived mutants.
