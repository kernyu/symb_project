The launch of generic forms of some of the drugs included in fixed-dose combinations of antiretrovirals (FDCA) raises the potential risk of breaking these combinations in order to allow the administration of the new cheaper generic drug. This could result in a step back in some major advances achieved in simplicity and treatment adherence, resulting in an increased risk of selective treatment withdrawal of some of the drugs administered separately. Due to the mechanism of action of the currently available antiretroviral treatment administration must be life-long in infected individuals, both children and adults. FDCA are a significant advance in antiretroviral treatment simplification, contributing to increase compliance of complex chronic therapies, thus increasing the patient's quality of life. They reduce the risk of treatment errors and can also reduce the possibility of unprescribed monotherapy with selective non-compliance. Hence, they contribute to reduce the risk of selection of HIV-1 clones with antiretroviral resistance, a situation that not only compromises future treatment options of the infected individual, but can also be transmitted and are a situation of Public Health concern. Excluding those cases that require a particular dose adjustment, FDCA are a preferred treatment option and their use must be strongly recommended in all scenarios where the components included in the combination are preferred drugs.
