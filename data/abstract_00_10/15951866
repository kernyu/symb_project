OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to find the prevalence of point mutations conferring resistance to clarithromycin in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the United Arab Emirates. METHODS: Gastric biopsy samples were obtained from 9 dyspeptic patients attending the endoscopy department in Zayed Military Hospital, Abu-Dhabi, UAE during the period from January to September 2004. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for these biopsies to determine the point mutations. RESULTS: Of the 55 (60%) real-time biopsies that were PCR positive for H. pylori, 36 (65.5%) were found to have mutant genes. The A(2142/43)G mutation was more common (63.6%) than the A(2142)C mutation (18.2%). CONCLUSION: Point mutations A(2442/43)G and A(2142)C and the combination of both were common among our patients. Perhaps the highest reported yet. Mutation at A(2142/43)G is far more common than mutation at A(2142)C.
