In investigating the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VREs) in a hospital in China, 338 enterococci were detected by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Eleven VREs were found, including one VanA E. faecalis, one VanB E. faecium, three VanB E. faecalis, five VanC(1) E. gallinarum, and one VanC(2 ) E. flavescens. VITEK 2, microbroth dilution, and E-test were used to determine the susceptibilities of the VREs to certain antimicrobial agents; multiple-drug resistance of the 11 VREs was distinct. Compared with phenotypic methods, multiplex PCR rapidly detected 11 VREs and provided van genotype information. This is the first study that sequenced van genes of VRE isolates in China to date and found type VanB in China. Because of the relatively low isolating rate, early detection of VRE is vital.
