Analysis of 71 ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC > or = 4 microg/ml) Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates revealed only 1 for which the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the parC, parE, and gyrB genes were genetically related to those of viridans group streptococci. Our findings support the occurrence of interspecies recombination of type II topoisomerase genes; however, its contribution to the emergence of quinolone resistance among pneumococci appears to have been minimal.
