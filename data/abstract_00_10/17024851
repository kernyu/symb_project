Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common in obesity. However, weight reduction alone does not prevent the progression of NAFLD to end-stage disease associated with the development of cirrhosis and liver disease. In a previous experiment, 50% ethanol extract of Acanthopanax senticosus stem bark (ASSB) was found to reduce body weight and insulin resistance in high fat diet-induced hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic ICR mice. To evaluate the anti-steatosis action of ASSB, insulin-resistant ob/ob mice with fatty livers were treated with ASSB ethanol extract for an 8 week-period. ASSB ethanol extract reversed the hepatomegaly, as evident in reduction of % liver weight/body weight ratio. ASSB ethanol extract also specifically lowered circulating glucose and lipids, and enhanced insulin action in the liver. These changes culminated in inhibition of triglyceride synthesis in non-adipose tissues including liver and skeletal muscle. Gene expression studies confirmed reductions in glucose 6-phosphatase and lipogenic enzymes in the liver. These results demonstrate that ASSB ethanol extract is an effective treatment for insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice by decreasing hepatic lipid synthesis.
