Plakortin (1) is a remarkably simple 1,2-dioxane derivative, extracted from the marine sponge Plakortis simplex, showing a submicromolar activity against chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Using plakortin as a novel antimalarial hit, we have prepared a series of semisynthetic derivatives in order to gain insights into the structural requirements of simple 1,2-dioxanes for exhibiting antimalarial activity. Their synthesis, spectroscopic and computational analysis, and in vitro antimalarial activity are herein reported. Results obtained, besides confirming the crucial role of the cycloperoxide functionality, revealed other structural features critical for antimalarial activity, namely the "Western" alkyl side chain, the dioxane ring conformation, and the absolute configuration of the stereogenic carbons on the 1,2-dioxane ring, when affecting the bioactive ring conformation.
