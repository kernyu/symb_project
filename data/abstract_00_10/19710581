BACKGROUND: For the last 14 years the Pan American Health Organization has been promoting surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease in Latin American children for better understanding of the disease tendencies regarding capsular types circulation in each country and susceptibility to antimicrobials. METHODS: Laboratory-based surveillance data from 10 Latin American countries collected from 2000 to 2005 were analyzed, including serotype distribution and susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics. RESULTS: Although 61 different capsular types were identified during the 6-year surveillance, 13 serotypes accounted for 86% of all isolates. These were consistently the most prevalent throughout the study period with serotype 14 predominating. Diminished susceptibility to penicillin was detected in 38% of all Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, with the highest prevalence in Dominican Republic and Mexico. Decreased susceptibility to penicillin increased in Brazil and Colombia whereas decreased high resistance rates was recorded in Chile. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that 10 countries of the Region continue to have high quality laboratory-based surveillance for pneumococcal disease thus generating valuable information so that healthcare decision makers may prioritize interventions. The heptavalent vaccine will potentially cover from 52.4% to 76.5% of strains causing invasive pneumococcal disease and the 13 valent from 76.7% to 88.3%.
