The prevalence of Salmonella spp. infection was determined in 67 free-range pig herds in southern Spain. Microbiological assessment was performed on ileocolic lymph nodes collected at slaughter according to ISO 6579:2002 procedures. Overall, 33% of herds were infected and the prevalence of infection was 5.3%. Salmonella spp. serovars most frequently isolated were Anatum and Typhimurium, although uncommon serovars such as Hessarek and Mikawasima were also detected. Isolates were tested against 16 antimicrobial agents and exhibited resistance to streptomycin (46%), tetracycline (30%), sulphonamides (25%) and ampicillin (23%) by the break-point method. Multi-drug resistance, defined as resistance to >/= 4 antimicrobials, was 36%.
