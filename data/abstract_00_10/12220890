In this study, a novel approach for the development of a peptide-based vaccine has been tested. We investigated the possibility of replacing an all-L amino acid peptide sequence corresponding to the protective B-cell epitope hemagglutinin (HA) 91-108 from influenza HA with a retro-inverso analogue encompassing this sequence. Retro-inverso peptides are composed of D-amino acids assembled in a reverse order from that of the parent L-sequence, thus maintaining the overall topology of the native sequence. This explains the observed antigenic cross-reactivity with anti-influenza virus antibodies. Mice immunized intranasally with the ovalbumin-conjugated retro-inverso analogue and cholera toxin as an adjuvant, produced strong systemic (serum IgG) and mucosal (lung IgA) antibody responses, and were protected against intranasal challenge with a lethal dose of influenza virus. The weight loss pattern in the protected group indicated that the vaccinated animals developed a disease of low severity resulting in a quick recovery. Furthermore, splenocytes of the immunized mice cultured in the presence of inactivated influenza virus, secreted high levels of IFN-gamma. The half-life of the retro-inverso analogue in the presence of lung homogenate proteases was at least 700 times greater than that of the parent L-peptide. These results demonstrate that peptidomimetic analogues with high resistance to proteolytic degradation are very effective immunogens when administered via the intranasal route, inducing protective immunity against a viral infection. This approach might be advantageous for vaccine development.
