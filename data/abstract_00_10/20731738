The objective of the present study was to assess the use of salvage chemotherapy using methotrexate, etoposide and actinomycin D (MEA) in men with nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) with a choriocarcinoma component. Nine patients were included. They had initially received bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin, and high-dose ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide as induction chemotherapies. However, they failed to achieve the normalization of ss-human chorionic gonadotropin (ss-HCG). Therefore, MEA therapy (methotrexate: 450 mg/body on day 1, actinomycin D: 0.5 mg/body on days 1-5, etoposide: 100 mg/body on days 1-5) was subsequently administered. After MEA therapy (median: 3 cycles), serum ss-HCG was normalized in five of the nine patients. Of these five, three achieved long-term disease-free survival and one died of disease unrelated to NSGCT, whereas the remaining patient developed disease recurrence and died of disease progression. All four patients who failed to achieve the normalization of ss-HCG died of disease progression. Although several severe toxicities greater than grade 3, which were mainly associated with bone marrow suppression, occurred in all patients, there was no treatment-related death. Considering the current outcomes, MEA regimen could be an attractive option as a salvage chemotherapy for metastatic NSGCT patients with a choriocarcinoma component showing resistance to intensive conventional chemotherapies.
