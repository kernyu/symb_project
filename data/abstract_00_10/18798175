Dalbavancin is a new new semisynthetic teicoplanin-related lipoglycopeptide with activity against gram-positive organisms. We investigated the activity of dalbavancin against faecal enterococci isolates from wild animals, pets, poultry and healthy humans in Portugal. The in vitro activity of dalbavancin was determined by the microbroth dilution method according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines in 589 enterococci of different species and origins. All vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus spp. were inhibited by < or =0.25 mg/l dalbavancin. Although vancomycin-resistant-enterococci (VRE) showed higher dalbavancin MIC values (16 mg/l), the isolates that exhibited the VanC resistance phenotype were inhibited at dalbavancin concentrations < or =0.125 mg/l. Only van A isolates were not inhibited by low concentrations of dalbavancin since van A strains showed higher dalbavancin MIC values (16 mg/l).
