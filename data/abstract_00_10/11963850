A formaldehyde-tolerant bacterium designated as a DM-2 strain was used to biodegrade formaldehyde. The cells, precultivated in the presence of 400 ppm of formaldehyde, were able to degrade formaldehyde in a minimal medium supplemented with up to 400 ppm of formaldehyde in the presence of 3% NaCl. The rate of formaldehyde degradation achieved in this study was 45 ppm/h when the DM-2 culture's optical density at 660 nm was 1.2.
