Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects about 400 million people worldwide. The development of nucleoside analogs that inhibit HBV polymerase provides an important approach for treating HBV infection. The approval of lamivudine, adefovir and entecavir represents a cornerstone of hepatitis B therapy. However, the challenges from the resistance and the off-therapy viral rebound are still unmet, and there is a need of developing new therapeutic agents. This review will discuss the structure-activity relationship of the most significant anti-HBV nucleoside analogs and the latest development in the field.
