Changes in outer membrane proteins (OMP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in cells of strains of Pseudomonas stutzeri sensitive and resistant to chlorhexidine diacetate (CHA) or cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) have been examined. Four of five CHA-resistant strains had alterations in OMP profiles, including the expression of two additional protein bands. All the CPC-resistant strains had altered OMP profiles but the changes varied from strain to strain. Loss of the fastest-migrating bands was observed in the LPS from CHX-resistant strains. In strain JM 302R with high-level CHX resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration 100 mg/l as opposed to 2.5 mg/l in the parent-strain, JM 302), all the fast-migrating bands were lost and the strain showed 'cross-resistance' to polymyxin, gentamicin and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. It is however, possible that the altered LPS patterns reflect a response to alterations in other components rather than being directly associated per se with the enhanced resistance.
