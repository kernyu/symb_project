AIM: To study cyclosporin A (CsA) by aerosol for anti-asthmatic effects in guinea pigs. METHODS: PC200 changes of lung resistance (RL) in the antigen-challenged sensitized guinea pig induced by acetylcholine (ACh) or histamine, and eosinophils changes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and pulmonary histologic section induced by antigen in vivo in sensitized guinea pigs were investigated. RESULTS: Pretreatment with CsA 10 g/L and 20 g/L by aerosol but not with CsA 5 g/L, dexamethasone (DXM) 0.5 mg/kg by ip increased PC200 value and prevented ACh or histamine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. However, CsA 5 g/L also prevented histamine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. CsA 10 g/L, 20 g/L and DXM 0.5 mg/kg reduced markedly eosinophil accumulation in BALF. The lymphocyte accumulation induced by antigen was not changed significantly by CsA and DXM tested. DXM 0.5 mg/kg increased number of neutrophil in the BALF. There was a statistical significance comparison with CsA groups. In the pulmonary histological studies, CsA 20 g/L and DXM 0.5 mg/kg also inhibited eosinophil infiltration in the epithelium and subepithelial connective tissue of bronchi and bronchioles. CONCLUSION: Anti-inflammation and anti-hyperresponsiveness of CsA by aerosol in animal model offered an experimental evidence for airway inhalation of CsA in the treatment of asthma.
