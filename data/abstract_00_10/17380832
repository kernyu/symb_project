OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of topical treatment with gentian violet on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Territorial referral centre. PATIENTS: Patients with discharging ears infected with MRSA alone or MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). INTERVENTION: One percent gentian violet was applied. MAIN OUTCOME: Remission of discharge. RESULTS: Remission was obtained in 44 of 46 ears infected with MRSA, whereas remission was obtained in only 3 of 6 ears infected with MRSA and PA. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of gentian violet for MRSA strains sensitive to topical application of gentian violet and strains resistant to this treatment were 0.03 microg/mL and 0.5%, respectively. The MIC for PA resistant to topical gentian violet treatment was higher than 32 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of gentian violet is a useful option for the treatment of refractory discharging ears infected with MRSA. However, great care must be taken if there is any chance of the gentian violet reaching the middle ear.
