OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of bacteriology and the drug resistance in the patients with chronic obstructive disease (COPD) combined with pneumonia at our respiratory intensive care unit(RICU) in 2001. METHODS: The sputum of 543 patients with COPD combined with pneumonia was collected with a regular method, the bacteria were cultured, and then the drug sensitivity was analyzed with K-B method. RESULTS: There were 181 positive samples in the 543 patients with the positive rate 33.9%. The main bacteria in the G- bacillus were Pseudomonas (21.55%), Haemophilus influenza (14.36%), Enteric bacilli (13.26%), and Klebsiella (11.60%) which were sensitive to impipenem, amikacin, and ceftazidime. The main bacteria in G+ bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (7.18%) and Staphylococcus epidermindis (4.42%) which were sensitive to vancomycin, imipenem, ceftazidime, and amikacin. CONCLUSION: The bacteria in the patients with COPD combined with pneumonia at RICU of the hospital in 2001 are mainly made up of G- bacillus and secondarily of G+ bacteria which are sensitive to imipenem, amikacin, and ceftazidime. The G+ bacteria are highly sensitive to vancomycin.
