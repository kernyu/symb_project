In this study, antibiotic resistance profiles, and the presence of class 1 integrons were determined for 108 Salmonella isolates comprising 37 serotypes cultured from a variety of sources between 1953 and 2004. Antibiogram analyses showed that all isolates were resistant to streptomycin/spectinomycin. Molecular analysis revealed that 50% of the collection contained an integrase-encoding gene (int1) and 25% contained class 1 integrons. A Salmonella Wien isolate possessing a complete class 1 integron with a dfrA5-ereA2 gene arrangement within the variable region was characterized.
