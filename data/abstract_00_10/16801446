Mycobacterium tuberculosis is intrinsically resistant to macrolides, a characteristic associated with expression of the erm(37) gene. This intrinsic resistance was found to be inducible with clarithromycin and the ketolide HMR3004. Furthermore, underlying the phenotypic induction was an increase in erm(37) mRNA levels.
