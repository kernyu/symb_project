In a 28 years old Mongolian woman in whom pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed a poly- and multidrug (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin) resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from sputum in 2002. Since the patient was from a country with high tuberculosis incidence it was conceivable that she had been infected by a strain with primary resistance in Mongolia. In order to confirm the origin of the strain an IS6110-based DNA fingerprint test was performed on the isolate. The assay revealed that the isolated M. tuberculosis strain belonged to the so-called Beijing family which was never detected in Hungary before.
