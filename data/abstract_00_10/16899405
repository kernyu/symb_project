Ceftobiprole medocaril, the most advanced of the anti-MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) beta-lactams in clinical development, has recently completed its first Phase III clinical trial, and has demonstrated non-inferiority to vancomycin. Phase II clinical trials have been initiated with PPI0903, which is, like ceftobiprole medocaril, an injectable pro-drug of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with anti-MRSA activity, and with RO4908643, a carbapenem with more modest activity against MRSA.
