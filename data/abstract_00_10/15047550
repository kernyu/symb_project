The doripenem MICs at which 90% of the tested strains were inhibited ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/ml for 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 351), from 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml for oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (n = 119), from 4 to 32 microg/ml for oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (n = 64), from < or =0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml for penicillin-susceptible streptococci (n = 132), and from 1 to 4 microg/ml for penicillin-resistant streptococci (n = 51). Overall, doripenem demonstrated in vitro activity similar to that of meropenem against gram-negative pathogens and to that of imipenem against gram-positive pathogens.
