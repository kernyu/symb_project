Bioguided phytochemical investigation of Sarcococca hookeriana with respect to the cholinesterase enzyme inhibitory assay yielded two new pregnane-type steriodal alkaloids hookerianamide H (1) and hookerianamide I (2), along with three known alkaloids N(a)-methylepipachysamine D (3), sarcovagine C (4) and dictyophlebine (5). Their structures were determined with the aid of extensive spectroscopic analysis. All compounds showed good inhibitory activities against the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (IC(50) 2.9-34.1 microM) and butyrylcholinesterase (IC(50) 0.3-3.6 microM). These compounds also showed moderate antiplasmodial activity (IC(50) 2.4-10.3 microM) against the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistant W2 strain.
