Susceptibility testing with a variety of structurally unrelated compounds showed that hefC in Helicobacter pylori is involved in multidrug efflux. This efflux was shown to depend on the proton motive force, as demonstrated by ethidium bromide accumulation experiments. Thus, H. pylori contains an active multidrug efflux mechanism.
