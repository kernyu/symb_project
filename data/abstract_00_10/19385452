BACKGROUND: The present study was planned to observe the activity of cefuroxime, a second generation cephalosporin after combining it with a beta-lactamase inhibitor calvulanic acid. The study was conducted to evaluate the restoration or increase in sensitivity of beta-lactamase producing isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus were identified by standard procedures. For beta-lactamase detection chromogenic Nitrocefin impregnated sticks were used. The sensitivity of the bacteria to the antibiotic disks was measured by disk diffusion method using standard zone diameter criteria given by National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: The disks of cefuroxime with clavulanic acid had developed larger zones of inhibition. The activity of cefuroxime against Staphylococcus areus was significantly increased by clavulanic acid. CONCLUSION: Clavulanic acid if used in combination with cefuroxime, can improve the antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime against beta-lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus.
