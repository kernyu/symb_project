Over a period of 7 months, 151 consecutive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus blood isolates were evaluated. None was community acquired. Twenty (13%) were susceptible to four or more antimicrobials, and 95% of these isolates were identified as SCCmec type IV. Molecular typing demonstrated four patterns, with one predominant pattern. Although usually community acquired, SCCmec type IV in our setting is clearly nosocomial.
