Fourteen strains of Gram-negative, anaerobic, fluoroquinolone-resistant, non-sporulating rods were isolated from various infections in cats and dogs, as well as from wounds in humans after cat- or dog-bites. These strains were characterized by sequencing of the 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, 16S rDNA, DNA-DNA hybridization, phylogenetic analysis, and phenotypic tests. The results indicate that the novel strains belong to a distinct species, closely related to Fusobacterium nucleatum. The species Fusobacterium canifelinum sp. nov. is proposed, with strain ATCC BAA 689T as the type strain.
