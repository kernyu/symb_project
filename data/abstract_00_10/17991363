The methodology of the Consensus Conference "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Management of Urinary Tract Infection in Childhood" is presented. The methodology consisted of two phases. In the first phase, a series of documents was drafted, which included an in-depth review of the existing evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection and of epidemiological data on the etiological and resistance profiles of urinary pathogens in Spain. In the second phase, a multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to evaluate all the documentation and to answer a series of questions and to assign a level of evidence and degree of recommendation to each answer. In this article the search strategies used and their results are described. In addition, the bases for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and the validity of the diagnostic tests are presented. Finally, the criteria for hierarchical structuring of the scientific evidence are detailed.
