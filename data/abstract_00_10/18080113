The four overlapping cosmids from the rubradirin producer, Streptomyces achromogenes var rubradiris NRRL 3061, have 58 ORFs within a 105.6 kb fragment. These ORFs harbored essential genes responsible for the formation and attachment of four distinct moieties, along with the genes associated with regulatory, resistance, and transport functions. The PKS (rubA) and glycosyltransferase (rubG2) genes were disrupted in order to demonstrate a complete elimination of rubradirin production. The rubradirin biosynthetic pathway was proposed based on the putative functions of the gene products, the functional identification of sugar genes, and the mutant strains.
