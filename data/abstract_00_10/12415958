UNLABELLED: In this study we assessed the usefulness, healing, as well as the integration to lung tissue of glutaraldehyde preserved at 0.5% bovine pericardium GPBP and lyophilized (GPBPL), after reinforced resection of lung tissue in dogs by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: GPBP and GPBPL were prepared and used to reinforce the suture line of lung resection in 30 mongrel dogs: Group I (n = 6): The GPBP were fixed on the lung with 4-0 polypropylene by thoracotomy. Group II (n = 6): The resection and fixed of the GPBP were performed with an linear stapler by thoracotomy. Group III (n = 6): The resection and fixed of the GPBPL were performed with an linear stapler by thoracotomy. Group IV (n = 6): The resection and fixed of the GPBP strips were performed with a linear stapler by thoracoscopy. Group V: The resection and fixed of the GPBPL strips were performed with a linear stapler by thoracoscopy. Clinico-radiological evaluation was done until euthanasia of all animals at week 8 postop. Progressive insufflation up to 40 cm H2O of airway pressure was done to evaluated resistance of the heal in the suture line reinforced. Macroscopic, and microscopic examination of the GPBP, GPBPL and lung were evaluated. RESULTS: All animals survived the surgical procedure and study time (8 weeks). No airleaks were evident at any time during the study including the insufflation test. Macroscopic examination of the GPBP and GPBPL showed good adaptation to the lung tissue. Microscopically all animals presented good healing with deposition of fibrotic tissue layer on the GPBP and GPBPL. CONCLUSION: GPBP and GPBPL are an adequate materials to reinforce lung staple line, when resection of lung tissue was performed in dogs by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy.
