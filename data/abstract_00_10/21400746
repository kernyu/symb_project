Nosocomial bacterial isolates collected within 2003-2004 (n=411) and 2005-2007 (n=422) were highly resistant to cephalosporins III-IV and antibacterials of other groups (aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolons, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole). Genes encoding TEM, SHV, CTX-M, OXA-2, and AmpC types of beta-lactamases (BLs) in the E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. isolates were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Prevalent CTX-M-type BLs were detected in 85% of the E. coli, 87% of the Klebsiella spp., and 38% of the Enterobacter spp. isolates of the first strain collection and in 94% of the E. coli, 91% of the Klebsiella spp., and 38% of the Enterobacter spp. isolates of the second one. Genes belonging to three subtypes of blacTx-M genes were identified: bla(CTX-M-1) (228 bla(CTX-M-15) and six bla(CTX-M-3) of the first strain collection; 275 bla(CTX-M-15), three bla(CTX-M-3), and one bla(CTX-M-22) of the second one), bla(CTX-M-2) (one bla(CTX-M-5) of the first strain collection and one bla(CTX-M-2) of the second one), bla(CTX-M-9) (17 bla(CTX-M-14) and one bla(CTX-M-9) of the first strain collection; seven bla(CTX-M-14) and one bla(CTX-M-9) of the second one). Three isolates of the first strain collection and one isolate of the second one carried two genes belonging to two different subtypes, i.e., bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(CTX-M-14) simultaneously. The bacterial isolates had high levels of associative resistance to ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, gentamicin, amikacin, and chloramphenicol associated with the resistance gene cassettes aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, aadB, aacA4, aac(6')Ib; dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA12, dfrA17, cmlA1, ereA2, and catB8 in the class 1 integrons and the resistance gene cassettes dfrA1, sat1, and aadA1 in the class 2 integrons.
