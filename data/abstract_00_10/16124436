Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
