The objective of this study was to examine associations among the genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in 207 fecal generic Escherichia coli isolates obtained from 77 cow-calf herds in western Canada. Twenty-three resistance genes corresponding to six different antimicrobial families were assessed using DNA hybridization and PCR. The most common resistance genes in the study sample (207 isolates) were sul2 (48.3%), tet(B) (45.4%), and ant(3'')-Ia (aadA1) (19.3%). Several statistically significant associations between the examined resistance genes were detected. The strongest associations observed were those between genes for resistance to chloramphenicol (catI) and trimethoprim (dhfrI) (odds ratio [OR] = 214; P = 0.0001), sulfonamide (sul1) and chloramphenicol (catI) (OR = 96.9; P = 0.0001), streptomycin [ant(3'')-Ia (aadA1)] and trimethoprim (dhfrI) (OR = 96.2; P = 0.0001), sulfonamide (sul1) and streptomycin [ant(3'')-Ia (aadA1)] (OR = 79.3; P = 0.0001), and tetracycline [tet(B)] and sulfonamides (sul2) (OR = 25.7; P = 0.0001). At least one of the resistance genes corresponding to each nonaminoglycoside family of antimicrobials examined in this study was associated with the two aminoglycoside resistance genes ant(3'')-Ia (aadA1) and aph(3')-Ia. The multiple, strong associations between genes and the diverse nature of the associations described in this study demonstrate the complexity of resistance gene selection in cow-calf herds and should be considered in the planning of AMR control practices for cow-calf operations.
