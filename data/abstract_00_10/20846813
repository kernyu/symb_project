Optimal antimicrobial therapy for infections due to ertapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae remains undetermined. In this study, a diabetic patient with recurrent pyomyositis and osteomyelitis caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae developed ertapenem resistance after imipenem/cilastatin treatment, which was a currently recommended therapy. He was finally treated successfully using tigecycline. Ertapenem resistance was in part explained by the production of SHV-type ESBL and the absence of an outer membrane protein, OmpK36. Our observation suggests that tigecycline may be an alternative for invasive infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae with decreased susceptibility to carbapenem.
