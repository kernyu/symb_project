The authors report the incidence of extended spectrum b-lactamases (ESBL)- producing strains in 1,602 enterobacteria consecutively isolated, from April 2002 to December 2003, in Caltagirone (CT) Hospital, and their in vitro susceptibility to several antimicrobial agents. The incidence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteria was equal to 1.5%, mainly among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and Citrobacter koseri, isolated by emergency and medicine wards. In vitro, the enterobacteria were fully susceptible to carbapenems and highly susceptible to third-generation cephalosporin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin.
