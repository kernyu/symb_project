Chronic bacterial colonisation or infection of wound is one of the major factors interfering proper wound healing, especially in diabetic foot ulcers. This study assesses the potential antimicrobial properties of maggots in vitro. This is a prospective randomised experimental study. Complete lysis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and Candida albicans cultures in the area of maggot application was observed 24 hours after application of live maggots in all culture plates and was confirmed by Gram staining. This lysis persisted for more than 5 days after the maggot application. Complete lysis of the bacterial or fungal cultures in the area of maggot application provides convincing evidence for the antimicrobial property of maggots. This effect has a significant implication in management of diabetic foot ulcers and vascular ulcers.
