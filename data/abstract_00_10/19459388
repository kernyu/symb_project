In order to elucidate the regulation functions of salicylic acid (SA) on the photosynthesis of cucumber under low temperature and light intensity, the seedlings of cucumber 'Jinyou 3' under low temperature and light intensity were foliar-sprayed with different concentration SA, and the leaf gas exchange parameters, photochemical efficiency, MDA content, and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured. The results showed that under low temperature and light intensity, the leaf photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr), actual photochemical efficiency of PS II (PhiPSII), and maximal photochemical efficiency of PS II (Fv/Fm) of the seedlings all decreased but the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) increased, suggesting that nonstomatal limitation was the main cause of the decrease of Pn under low temperature and light intensity stress. Low temperature and light intensity also led to the increase of leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, the decrease of catalase (CAT) activity, and the decrease after an initial increase of peroxidase (POD) activity. However, foliar-spraying 0.5-2.5 mmol x L(-1) of SA before the stress increased the leaf Pn, Gs, Tr, PhiPSII, Fv/Fm, and activities of SOD, POD and CAT while decreased the Ci and MDA content, suggesting that SA could regulate the leaf photosynthetic functions of cucumber seedlings, and enhance the seedlings resistance against low temperature and light intensity. The optimum concentration of SA for the foliar-spraying was 1 mmol x L(-1).
