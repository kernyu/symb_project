Staphylococcus aureus has been well established as a clinical and epidemiological pathogen and can cause infections at many anatomical sites. Increasing insusceptibility to beta-lactams and the glycopeptides complicates the treatment of these infections. We isolated 584 strains of S. aureus from various clinical and animal origin food samples during (from January 2006 to December 2007) the survey. Resistance to 15 antibiotics frequently used in human medicine and veterinary practice was also determined. A remarkable level of penicillin resistance was detected in both clinical (98.3%) and food (92.0%) S. aureus isolates. But, there were no S. aureus strains that were resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin/dalfobristin. The rate of resistance to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, methicillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, norfloxacin, and moxifloxacin among the human and foods S. aureus isolates ranged from 50.3% to 56.3% and 1.4% to 9.5%, respectively. In our survey, in vitro susceptibility data suggested that the incidence of resistance among the S. aureus strains isolated from food were not remarkably high, excluding penicillin. Although the transfer of antibiotic resistance of S. aureus from foods to humans probably occurs less frequently than is generally assumed, the increasing prevalence of resistance in the strains of human origin may have important therapeutic implications.
