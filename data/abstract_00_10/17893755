The increase of the number of antimicrobial resistances is an increasing threat that demands the establishment of a monitoring of the resistance trends by means of systems that facilitate the information like the microbiological surveillance networks. The surveillance resistance system can be active when the strains are analyzed in a reference laboratory or cumulative when microbiology Services asses the antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacterial isolates and summarize on a global report. The microbiological networks allow to realize studies accumulated of a wide number of microorganisms and antimicrobial in a simple way, in real time and coming to details of geographical area delimited by the user. In the Comunitat Valenciana, the Microbiologica surveillance network of the Comunitat Valenciana (RedMIVA) gathers the antibiograms realized in the hospitals of the Comunitat, centralizes the information and spreads the results analyzed to the selected users. The experience has demonstrated that the integration of the hospitals can be initially costly, but once integrated all the hospitals, the yield of the information overcomes the effort of the implementation. By means of simple consultations it is possible to have the information of resistances of the whole Community.
