Among plant pathogens, sedentary endoparasitic nematodes are one of the most damaging pests in global agriculture. These obligate parasites interact with their hosts in a quite unique and intriguing way. They induce the redifferentiation of root cells into specialized feeding cells essential for nematode growth and reproduction; thus, nematodes have evolved the ability to exploit plant genes and hijack host functions for their own requirements. Various approaches to engineer plants with resistance to parasitic nematodes have been pursued, most focusing on the introduction of resistance genes. An alternative strategy to achieve resistance is to exploit the susceptibility of plant disease. Better knowledge of the plant response during the compatible interaction should allow the identification of targets to engineer resistance to parasitic nematodes in crop species.
