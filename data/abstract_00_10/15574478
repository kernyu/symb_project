OBJECTIVES: To test the efficacy of gendine, a novel antiseptic, containing Gentian Violet and chlorhexidine, in coating different medical devices, including endotracheal tubes (ETT) and urinary catheters (UC). METHODS: We determined the antimicrobial efficacy and cytotoxicity of ETT and UC segments coated, through an instant dip method, with gendine. Using the modified Kirby-Bauer method, gendine-coated devices showed zones of inhibition of >/=15 mm against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida parapsilosis. RESULTS: Gendine-coated endotracheal tubes (GND-ETT) soaked in bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL) and incubated at 37 degrees C maintained a zone of inhibition of >/=15 mm against MRSA and P. aeruginosa for at least 3 weeks. Similarly, gendine-coated urinary catheters (GND-UC), soaked in urine, maintained a zone of inhibition of >/=15 mm against E. coli for 8 weeks. Using the minimum essential media elution method in mouse fibroblast cells, GND-ETT and GND-UC were found to be non-cytotoxic. Gendine-coated UC significantly reduced the amount of viable MRSA, E. coli or C. parapsilosis organisms adhering to their surfaces when compared with silver/hydrogel-coated urinary catheters or control uncoated catheters (P < 0.01). Similarly GND-ETT significantly reduced the adherence of the same organisms as well as P. aeruginosa when compared with control (P </= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: GND-ETT and GND-UC impregnated using an instantaneous dip method, were shown to have broad-spectrum activity, prolonged antimicrobial durability and high efficacy in inhibiting adherence of organisms commonly causing nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Furthermore, these coated devices were shown to be non-cytotoxic.
