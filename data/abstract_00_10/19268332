The susceptibility to 23 antimicrobial agents was determined in 114 isolates of Staphylococcus intermedius and eight isolates of Staphylococcus schleiferi of canine origin. Overall, 73% of S. intermedius isolates and 37.5% of S. schleiferi isolates were susceptible to all the 23 antimicrobials tested. The large majority of S. intermedius strains retained susceptibility to antimicrobials currently employed in treatment of pyoderma (cephalosporins, cotrimoxazole and association amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) as well as to those effective against staphylococci (fusidic acid, rifampicin and fluoroquinolones). Resistance in S. intermedius was observed mainly against macrolides, chloramphenicol and lincosamides, while S. schleiferi isolates retained susceptibility to all antimicrobials except three of six fluoroquinolones. Although, our results confirm susceptibility to antimicrobials currently employed in pyoderma treatment, the several different resistance patterns observed for S. intermedius emphasize the importance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of canine staphylococci to choose the most appropriate treatment of infections and to allow the prudent use of antimicrobial drugs in companion animals.
