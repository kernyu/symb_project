Nosocomial blood stream infection (or nosocomial bacteremia) is a common problem in hospitals worldwide, including Malaysia. A three-year prospective cohort study (October 2003-March 2007) of the incidences, risk factors, and patterns of the microorganisms causing bacteremia was conducted using a validated surveillance form in three intensive care units (ICUs) in Malaysia. Center for Disease Control criteria were used to diagnose bacteremia. Patients were monitored from admission until the end point of study, which was the first detection of bacteremia in the blood in each patient. The frequency of occurrence of bacteremia with clinical symptoms was 10.7% (n=23). Bacteremia was observed to occur within a mean length of stay of 10 days in ICU. The rate of device-related infection was 10.4% per device utilization days with a device utilization rate of 95.9%/1000 patient days. The total number of patient days was 2309 and the period of device utilization was 2211 days. The common bacteria detected were extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=6); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=6); Acinetobacter species (n=5); Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)(n=3); and (non- ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=2). Multivariable analysis using Cox Proportional Hazard Model showed that the predictors for developing bacteremia were cancer, MRSA carriage, duration of central venous catheter (CVC) infusion, frequency change of CVC, and the administration of hydrocortisone drugs. These results indicate that a combination of nursing and medical interventions as well as patients' severity of illness could lead to bacteremia in ICU. Strategic implementation of quality assurance measures in ICUs could help to control this problem.
