A reduction in Campylobacter spp. has been associated with use of commercial antimicrobial technologies during the processing of broiler chickens. This review is focused on commercial interventions that have received approval by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for use on raw poultry in the United States. Most of these interventions are currently applied prechill. The limited number of publications on the topic suggests that the application of antimicrobials in commercial settings results in Campylobacter reduction of 1 to 2 log CFU/ml of carcass rinse. However, postchill counts of 0.5 to 1 log CFU/ml of carcass rinse (approximately 4,000 CFU per carcass) are still common. Thus, antimicrobial interventions are not a complete solution for the control of Campylobacter on raw poultry. New postchill interventions are needed, as are (i) improvements in the methodology for detection and enumeration of Campylobacter, (ii) additional surveys on the contamination of processed poultry, and (iii) an understanding of possible resistance to antimicrobials by Campylobacter spp. Research addressing these topics will lead to better control of Campylobacter in commercial poultry carcasses.
