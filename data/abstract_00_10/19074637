The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the adipokine adiponectin (APN) in development of spontaneous colitis in IL-10 knockout (KO) mice. To this aim, we generated double IL-10 APN KO mice and compared their disease development to that of single IL-10 KO mice. Both IL-10 KO and double IL-10 APN KO mice spontaneously developed colitis of comparable severity. No significant differences in inflammatory infiltrate or crypt elongation were observed in colonic tissue obtained from IL-10 KO and double IL-10 APN KO mice at either 12 or 20 wk of age. A comparable increase in circulating levels of serum amyloid A and IFN-gamma was observed in IL-10 KO and double IL-10 APN KO mice as disease progressed. In vitro stimulation of lymphocytes from mesenteric lymph nodes with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 induced a significantly higher production of IL-17 and TNF-alpha in IL-10 KO and double IL-10 APN KO mice compared with their healthy littermates. No significant differences in cytokine production from lymphocytes or colonic mRNA expression of cytokines were observed between IL-10 KO and double IL-10 APN KO mice. Both IL-10 KO and double IL-10 APN KO mice had a similar decrease in body weight and bone mass compared with their respective healthy littermates. Finally, APN deficiency did not lead to development of insulin resistance, either in APN KO or double IL-10 APN KO mice. In conclusion, lack of APN does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of spontaneous colonic inflammation in the IL-10 KO model.
