The genodiversity of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the Nottingham region of the United Kingdom was compared with isolates from the Freiburg region of Germany. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates was higher in Nottingham than in Freiburg. In patients from Nottingham hospitals, 80% of MRSA isolates were classical epidemic MRSA-15, but genotypic variants of epidemic MRSA-15 comprised 72% of isolates from Nottingham community-based patients. In contrast, MRSA isolates from Freiburg showed greater diversity, but 47% and 23% of isolates, respectively, belonged to two predominant MRSA genotypes found in isolates from both hospitalised and community-based patients. The results suggest that genodiversity becomes increasingly more confined in settings with a higher frequency and longer duration of MRSA prevalence.
