Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF; Viread), an ester prodrug of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) tenofovir, is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV infection. As a component of an antiretroviral regimen, oral tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily effectively reduces viral load in patients with HIV infection who are treatment-experienced with baseline NRTI resistance mutations or treatment-naive. Tenofovir DF provides a simple and convenient once-daily dosage regimen, and is generally well tolerated and able to produce sustained suppression of viral replication.
