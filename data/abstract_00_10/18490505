The bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of levofloxacin and gatifloxacin at concentrations corresponding to those in antibiotic eye drops against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were determined. Levofloxacin and gatifloxacin at concentrations simulating those in eye drops showed lower bactericidal activities and shorter PAEs against fluoroquinolone-resistant strains than against fluoroquinolone-sensitive strains.
