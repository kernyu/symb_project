An environmentally benign approach to surface modification was developed to impart copper surface with enhanced resistance to corrosion, bacterial adhesion and biocorrosion. Oxidative graft polymerization of 2,2'-bithiophene from the copper surface with self-assembled 2,2'-bithiophene monolayer, and subsequent reduction of silver ions to silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) on the surface, give rise to a homogeneous bithiophene polymer (PBT) film with densely coupled Ag NPs on the copper surface (Cu-g-PBT-Ag NP surface). The immobilized Ag NPs were found to significantly inhibit bacterial adhesion and enhance the antibacterial properties of the PBT modified copper surface. The corrosion inhibition performance of the functionalized copper substrates was evaluated by Tafel polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Arising from the chemical affinity of thiols for the noble and coinage metals, the copper surface functionalized with both PBT brushes and Ag NPs also exhibits long-term stability, and is thus potentially useful for combating the combined problems of corrosion and biocorrosion in harsh marine and aquatic environments.
