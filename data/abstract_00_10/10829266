Vancomycin is a safe, effective antibiotic for a variety of serious gram-positive infections. Because of emerging resistance in enterococci and staphylococci and the emerging threat of spread of vancomycin-resistant genes to other gram-positive organisms, judicious use of vancomycin should be promoted. Quinupristin/dalfopristin, a streptogramin antibiotic, and linezolid, an oxazolidinone, show promise against some strains of gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to vancomycin.
