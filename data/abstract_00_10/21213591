A significant proportion of all incidents of nosocomial infections in acute-care hospitals is due to contaminated catheters. Alternative strategies e.g. antibiotics as well as surface modifications have been devised in an attempt to reduce the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), but most have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, the race to identify such substances which can combat pathogenic bacteria is ongoing in order to improve the quality of health care. Novel technologies such as the potential use of antiseptic or antimicrobial coatings on catheters hold promise for reducing these infections in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. In this study, the bactericidal activity of newly synthesized tungsten-nanoparticles was tested on clinical multiple drug resistant Escherichia coli isolates from UTI patients with indwelling catheters and Staphylococcus aureus reference strain. The results suggest that the particles tested in this study certainly mediate the inhibition of bacterial growth. We believe that the fabrication of W-NPs on catheters could possibly prevent them from being contaminated by pathogens and hence provide continuous protection of the site. This study is the first of its type testing the antibacterial effects of W-NPs on clinical bacterial isolate from catheterized human UTI case.
