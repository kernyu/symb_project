Mean fecal global yeast counts increased similarly during 7 days of treatment with telithromycin (800 mg once daily) or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amoxiclav) (1 g of amoxicillin and 125 mg of clavulanic acid 3 times daily) in human volunteers and decreased slowly thereafter. On skin, coagulase-negative staphylococci of decreased susceptibility (DS) to telithromycin increased in the telithromycin group, whereas those with DS to methicillin increased in the amoxiclav group. A similar antibiotic-related shift towards homologous DS was observed for oral nongroupable streptococci (NGS), but in addition, the prevalence of NGS resistant to both classes of antibiotics was significantly greater in the amoxiclav group at days 8 (P < 0.01) and 45 (P < 0.015).
