We report results of the first study on the molecular basis of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains currently circulating in Bulgaria. The study panel consisted of 133 (including 37 drug-resistant) isolates recovered from newly diagnosed, adult pulmonary TB patients from different regions of Bulgaria in 2005--2006. Three types of the rpoB mutations were found in 20 of 27 RIF-resistant isolates; rpoB S531L was the most frequent. Eleven (48%) of 23 INH-resistant isolates had katG S315T mutation. inhA -15C > T mutation was detected in one INH-resistant isolate (that also had katG315 mutation) and three INH-susceptible isolates. A mutation in embB306 was found in 7 of 11 EMB-resistant isolates. Comparison with spoligotyping and 24-VNTR locus typing data suggested that emergence and spread of drug-resistant and MDR-TB in Bulgaria are not associated with any specific spoligotype or MIRU-VNTR genotype.
