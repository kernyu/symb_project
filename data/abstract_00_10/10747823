In February 1998, 195 patients in the geriatric department of a French hospital were screened for the presence of co-amoxiclav-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Eleven co-amoxiclav-resistant isolates obtained all produced an identical IRT-2 beta-lactamase. These K. pneumoniae isolates were clonally related and harboured a c. 55 kb non-conjugative plasmid encoding a non-class-1 integron-located blaIRT-2 gene. This study underlines that geriatric departments may be a reservoir for antibiotic-resistant strains and that IRT beta-lactamase-producing strains may be nosocomial pathogens.
