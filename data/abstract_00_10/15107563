The in vitro susceptibilities to 21 antimicrobial agents, of 37 isolates of Brachyspira (B.) hyodysenteriae isolated from pigs in Okinawa meat center and a pig farm in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, were determined by the agar dilution method. Carbadox was the most active of all the agents tested against the isolates (MIC: <0.003 to 0.05). All the isolates were highly susceptible to olaquindox, tiamulin, dimetridazole, efrotomycin and valnemulin with MICs ranging from </=0.1 to 1.6 microg/ml. Penicillins, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, terdecamycin and streptomycin were also active against the isolates. Most isolates were resistant to lincomycin, avilamycin and macrolides (with the exception of terdecamycin).
