Neuron death in Alzheimer's disease is believed to be triggered by an increased production of amyloidogenic beta-amyloid peptides, involving both increased oxidative stress and activation of a conserved death program. Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, is expressed at high levels in the adult nervous system. Exposure of neuronal cultures to subtoxic concentrations of beta-amyloid peptide 1-40 (1-10microM) or the fragment 25-35 (1-10microM) up-regulated both bcl-xL mRNA and Bcl-xL protein levels, determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Bcl-xL protein was also up-regulated during oxidative stress induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide (3-100microM) or ferric ions (1-10microM). In contrast, apoptotic stimuli (exposure to staurosporine or serum withdrawal) actually decreased neuronal Bcl-xL expression. To investigate the role of Bcl-xL in cell death relevant to Alzheimer's disease, we stably overexpressed Bcl-xL in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Cells overexpressing Bcl-xL were significantly protected from beta-amyloid neurotoxicity and staurosporine-induced apoptosis compared to vector-transfected controls. In contrast, Bcl-xL overexpression only conferred a mild protection against oxidative injury induced by hydrogen peroxide. We conclude that up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression in response to subtoxic concentrations of beta-amyloid is a stress response that increases the resistance of neurons to beta-amyloid neurotoxicity primarily by inhibiting apoptotic processes.
