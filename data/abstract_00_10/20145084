We studied three clinical isolates of Candida spp. (one C. tropicalis isolate and two C. glabrata isolates) from patients with invasive candidiasis. The first isolate emerged during echinocandin treatment, while the others emerged after the same treatment. These strains harbored an amino acid substitution in Fksp never linked before with reduced echinocandin susceptibility in C. tropicalis or in C. glabrata. The molecular mechanism of reduced susceptibility was confirmed using a 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase inhibition assay.
