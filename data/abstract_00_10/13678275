Two distinct conformations of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier involved in the adenine nucleotide transport are called BA and CATR conformations, as they were distinguished by binding of specific inhibitors bongkrekic acid (BA) and carboxyatractyloside (CATR), respectively. To find out which amino acids are implicated in the transition between these two conformations, which occurs during transport, mutants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADP/ATP carrier Anc2p responsible for resistance of yeast cells to BA were identified and characterized after in vivo chemical or UV mutagenesis. Only four different mutations could be identified in spite of a large number of mutants analyzed. They are located in the Anc2p transmembrane segments I (G30S), II (Y97C), III (L142S), and VI (G298S), and are independently enabling growth of cells in the presence of BA. The variant and wild-type Anc2p were produced practically to the same level in mitochondria, as evidenced by immunochemical analysis and by atractyloside binding experiments. ADP/ATP exchange mediated by Anc2p variants in isolated mitochondria was more efficient than that of the wild-type Anc2p in the presence of BA, confirming that BA resistance of the mutant cells was linked to the functional properties of the modified ADP/ATP carrier. These results suggest that resistance to BA is caused by alternate conformation of Anc2p due to appearance of Ser or Cys at specific positions. Different interactions of these residues with other amino acids and/or BA could prevent formation of stable inactive Anc2p . BA complex.
