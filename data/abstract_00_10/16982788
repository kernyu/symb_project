By PCR, we screened for qnr genes 112 clinical isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli collected from hospitals in France during 2004. For the first time, 7.7% of CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates presented a plasmid-mediated resistance to quinolones. All strains harbored a qnrA gene located on a sul1-type class 1 integron with similar structure to the In36 integron.
