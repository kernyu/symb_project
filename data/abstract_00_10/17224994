No fully effective treatment has been developed since the discovery of Chagas' disease by Carlos Chagas in 1909. Since drug-resistant Trypanosoma cruzi strains are occurring and the current therapy is effectiveness in the acute phase but with various adverse side effects, more studies are needed to characterize the susceptibility of T. cruzi to new drugs. Many natural and/or synthetic substances showing trypanocidal activity have been used, even though they are not likely to be turned into clinically approved drugs. Originally, drug screening was performed using natural products, with only limited knowledge of the molecular mechanism involved in the development of diseases. Trans-splicing, which is unusual RNA processing reaction and occurs in nematodes and trypanosomes, implies the processing of polycistronic transcription units into individual mRNAs; a short transcript spliced leader (SL RNA) is trans-spliced to the acceptor pre-mRNA, giving origin to the mature mRNA. In the present study, permeable cells of T. cruzi epimastigote forms (Y, BOL and NCS strains) were treated to evaluate the interference of two drugs (hydroxymethylnitrofurazone - NFOH-121 and nitrofurazone) in the trans-splicing reaction using silver-stained PAGE analysis. Both drugs induced a significant reduction in RNA processing at concentrations from 5 to 12.5 microM. These data agreed with the biological findings, since the number of parasites decreased, especially with NFOH-121. This proposed methodology allows a rapid and cost-effective screening strategy for detecting drug interference in the trans-splicing mechanism of T. cruzi.
