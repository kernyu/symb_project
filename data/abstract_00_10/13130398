The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of metronidazole resistance (MtzR) and clarithromycin resistance (ClaR) on the eradication rate for omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole triple-therapy regimen and on the development of posttherapy drug resistance in a region of high rates of MtzR. One hundred ninety-six Helicobacter pylori isolates were recovered from patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, or nonulcer dyspepsia during upper endoscopy. The prevalences of MtzR, ClaR, and dual resistance were 37.8%, 13.8%, and 8.7%, respectively. The intention-to-treat eradication rates for metronidazole-susceptible (87.2% vs. 67.6%; P=.001) and clarithromycin-susceptible (86.4% vs. 40.7%; P<.001) strains were significantly higher than the rates for resistant strains. Multiple logistic regression analysis implicated younger age (<40 years old), MtzR, ClaR, and the diagnosis of nonulcer dyspepsia as independent factors that predicted treatment failure. The rates of posttreatment MtzR, ClaR, and dual resistance were 88%, 88%, and 75%, respectively. MtxR and ClaR significantly affected the success of eradication therapy. Posttreatment rates of resistance were high and were related to the presence of pretreatment antibiotic resistance.
