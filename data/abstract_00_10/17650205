AIMS: To characterize Lactococcus garvieae strains of dairy origin and to determine their technological properties and safety for their possible use in starter culture preparation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-seven L. garvieae isolates, recovered from two artisanal Italian cheeses were studied, in comparison with 12 fish isolates and the type strain of the species. Phenotypic typing revealed that the strains could be differentiated on the basis of their ecological niche of origin in lactose positive strains (all isolated from dairy sources) and lactose negative strains (all isolated from fish). Furthermore, the strains exhibited a high degree of physiological variability, showing the presence of 26 different biotypes. The strains possessed moderate acidifying and proteolytic activities and did not produce bacteriocins. A safety investigation revealed that all strains were sensitive to vancomycin and moderately resistant to kanamycin; some biotypes were tetracycline resistant. Production of biogenic amines or presence of genes encoding virulence determinants occurred in some isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of L. garvieae in some artisanal Italian cheeses can be linked to the typicity of the products. Although in a few cases an antimicrobial resistance or a presence of virulence determinants may imply a potential hygienic risk, most of the strains showed positive properties for their possible adjunction in a starter culture preparation, to preserve the natural bacterial population responsible for the typical sensorial characteristics of the traditional raw milk cheeses. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: L. garvieae strains can be considered an important part of the microbial population associated with the natural fermentation of artisanal Italian cheeses. A deepened characterization of the strains may aid in understanding the functional and ecological significance of their presence in dairy products and in selecting new strains for the dairy industry.
