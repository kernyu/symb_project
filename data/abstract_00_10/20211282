The ability to interfere with gene expression is of crucial importance to unravel the function of genes and is also a promising therapeutic strategy. Here we discuss methodologies for inhibition of target RNAs based on the cleavage activity of the essential enzyme, Ribonuclease P (RNase P). RNase P-mediated cleavage of target RNAs can be directed by external guide sequences (EGSs) or by the use of the catalytic M1 RNA from E. coli linked to a guide sequence (M1GSs). These are not only basic tools for functional genetic studies in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells but also promising antibacterial, anticancer and antiviral agents.
