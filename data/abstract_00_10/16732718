Apoptosis is a fundamental cellular death process that is essential for normal tissue homeostasis, whose deregulation is associated with several human disease states, including cancer. Increased understanding of cancer biology has led to the hypothesis that although cancer cells are inherently resistant to the engagement of apoptosis due to the deregulation of molecular components of core apoptotic machinery or of survival signalling cascades, they are primed to die as a result of microenvironmental and oncogenic proapoptotic stress. Recently, deeper insight into the molecular regulation of apoptosis and, specifically, into its deregulation in cancer has led to the development of promising therapies to restore apoptosis and enable selective tumour cell kill. It is hoped that these mechanism-based therapies will exhibit less problematic toxicity profiles than those of conventional agents. Moreover, the development of tailored therapies directed at malignancies bearing specific alterations in apoptotic or survival signalling components may be used in combination approaches to overcome the resistance to other forms of treatment.
