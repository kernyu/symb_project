A real-time PCR assay identified linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates with a G2576U rRNA mutation. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of ribosomal DNA amplicons with NheI also detected this mutation. Both assays detected isolates heterozygous at this position. Recognition of isolates with what is presently the most frequent oxazolidinone resistance mutation may aid surveillance and individual case management.
