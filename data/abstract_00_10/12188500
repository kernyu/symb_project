We have compared the rates of infection and resistance in an animal model of an orthopaedic procedure which was contaminated with a low-dose inoculum of Staphylococcus epidermidis. We randomised 44 Sprague-Dawley rats to have bone cement implanted subcutaneously containing either gentamicin or saline (control). The wound was inoculated with a dilute solution of gentamicin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis. At two weeks the cement was retrieved and microbiologically tested. A lower overall rate of infection was seen in the gentamicin-loaded cement group, but there was a significantly higher rate of gentamicin-resistant infection in this group (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.01). Antibiotic-impregnated cement has an optimum surface for colonisation and prolonged exposure to antibiotic allows mutational resistance to occur. Gentamicin-loaded cement may not be appropriate for revision surgery if it has been used already in previous surgery.
