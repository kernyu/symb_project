This paper reports the synthesis and the antiviral properties of new diarylpyrimidine (DAPY) compounds as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). The synthesis program around this new DAPY series was further optimized to produce compounds displaying improved activity against a panel of eight clinically relevant single and double mutant strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
