OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and susceptibility pattern of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Thailand from 2000 to 2005. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data on the WHONET, from 28 hospitals participated in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance, Thailand surveillance program, were reviewed and analyzed for the prevalence and susceptibility pattern. RESULTS: During the five-year surveillance from 2000 to 2005, the prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli detected by ceftazidime screening test was 17%, 21.3%, 23.2%, 20.4%, 23.1%, and 25.0%; as well as detected by cefotaxime screening test was 20.8%, 65.9%, 69.3%, 69.3%, 68.3%, and 33.8%, respectively. The prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae detected by ceftazidime screening test was 30.9%, 34.7%, 32.5%, 34.4%, 372%, and 39.2%; as well as detected by cefotaxime screening test 38.4%, 39.3%, 40.1%, 41.0%, 42.8%, and 40.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: From 2000 to 2005, the prevalence of ESBL-producing organisms in Thailand was high. ESBL-producing E. coli was most commonly isolated from sputum, followed by blood and urine specimens. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae had not been increasingly isolated from sputum, blood and urine.
