A total of 460 Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus spp. collected from respiratory infections during 2000 was tested for their susceptibility to 15 selected antibiotics. Overall, penicillin resistance among pneumococci was 10.5%, while lack of susceptibility to macrolides, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and chloramphenicol reached 35.2%, 26.2%, 22.6% and 6.0%, respectively. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and levofloxacin were the most potent compounds (100% and 99.9% susceptible strains, respectively). Among isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, beta-lactamase production (12.5% and 10%, respectively), and co-trimoxazole (19.9% and 40.0%) and clarithromycin (11.2% and 40.0%) resistance were the prevalent threats. This study confirms the trend observed in Italy since 1992: macrolide resistance among respiratory microorganisms is increasing, while several drugs including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, third generation injectable cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones remain active on the great majority of these pathogens.
