The study comprised strains of Candida albicans isolated from patients hospitalised in a tertiary care hospital during a 2-year period. In total 851 strains were cultured, including 379 (44.5%) strains from internal medicine patients, 243 (28.6%) from surgical patients and 229 (26.9%) from patients in the surgical intensive care unit. The strains were tested for susceptibility to the triazoles: fluconazole and itraconazole. There were 523 (61.5%) strains susceptible, 11 strains (1.3%) showed intermediate susceptibility and 317 (37.2%) were resistant to fluconazole, while 403 (47.3%) strains were susceptible, 43 (5.1%) intermediately susceptible and 405 (47.6%) resistant to itraconazole. Regular surveillance of fungal resistance patterns should be carried out and there should be prudent use of hospital triazole usage.
