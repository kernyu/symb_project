Physical, genetic, and chemical-genetic interactions centered on the conserved chaperone Hsp90 were mapped at high resolution in yeast using systematic proteomic and genomic methods. Physical interactions were identified using genome-wide two hybrid screens combined with large-scale affinity purification of Hsp90-containing protein complexes. Genetic interactions were uncovered using synthetic genetic array technology and by a microarray-based chemical-genetic screen of a set of about 4700 viable yeast gene deletion mutants for hypersensitivity to the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. An extended network, consisting of 198 putative physical interactions and 451 putative genetic and chemical-genetic interactions, was found to connect Hsp90 to cofactors and substrates involved in a wide range of cellular functions. Two novel Hsp90 cofactors, Tah1 (YCR060W) and Pih1 (YHR034C), were also identified. These cofactors interact physically and functionally with the conserved AAA(+)-type DNA helicases Rvb1/Rvb2, which are key components of several chromatin remodeling factors, thereby linking Hsp90 to epigenetic gene regulation.
