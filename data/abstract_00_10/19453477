Influenza is a highly contagious and debilitating disease that imposes an excess burden of complications and mortality. Antiviral therapy is the primary intervention for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of influenza. Amantadine and rimantadine are members of the M2 class of antiviral agents and are moderately effective in influenza management. However, their utility is compromised by high levels of resistance, tolerability concerns and a lack of efficacy against influenza B. An alternative class of agents, the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs), represent the most advanced form of antiviral therapy available, and act by specifically inhibiting the neuraminidase enzymes that are present on all influenza subtypes. Two NIs, oseltamivir and zanamivir, are currently available for clinical use. Oseltamivir, the most widely used NI, is administered orally as a prodrug (oseltamivir carboxylate) and systemically distributed to all potential infection sites. Zanamivir, a second NI, is administered by inhalation via a disk inhaler and deposited primarily in the respiratory tract. When administered within 48 hours of symptom onset, both agents significantly reduce illness duration and symptom severity, and decrease the rate of influenza-associated complications. With oseltamivir, greater benefits are detected with earlier treatment initiation (<12 hours). In PEP, both NIs effectively protect the close contacts of index cases from symptomatic influenza. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are generally well tolerated and associated with a low level of resistance. Emerging evidence supports the activity of both NIs against the H5N1avian influenza infection, which is a pandemic candidate. However, the WHO currently recommends the use of oseltamivir for the management of suspected cases, given the systemic nature of the H5N1 challenge. Ongoing studies are exploring the effectiveness of oseltamivir, zanamivir and other NIs for pandemic management.
