Staphylococcal spp. are notorious for causing biofilm-related device-associated infections, leading to tens of thousands of deaths per year. In this paper, we review quorum sensing inhibitors as potential therapeutics for even the most persistent infections. The animal models reviewed are subcutaneous graft, central venous catheter (CVC), ureteral stent and wound models, and a wound case study. The therapeutic approaches reviewed are the use of RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP) and its non-peptide analog. These have been shown to prevent or treat infections caused by any staphylococcal strain tested, including antibiotic-resistant strains like CA-MRSA USA300.
