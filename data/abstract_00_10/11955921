A 43-year-old woman in good health was admitted to the hospital 3 days after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in the left eye with postoperative bandage contact lens application. She had developed a severe keratitis with ulceration and hypopyon. Upon the patient's admission to the hospital, the contact lens was removed. Ofloxacin eyedrops were prescribed 4 times a day. In the hospital, the patient was successfully treated with immediate thermocautery application, followed by full-thickness keratoplasty the next day and intensive systemic and topical antibiotics. Cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Severe MRSA keratitis is a rare cause of infection after PRK.
