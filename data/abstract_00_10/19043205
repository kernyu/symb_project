In vitro interaction of fluconazole and baicalein (BE) was investigated against 30 fluconazole-resistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans. Synergistic activities were determined using the checkerboard microdilution assay based on the fractional inhibitory concentration indices. Organisms were also tested against the 2 drugs singly and in combination using time-kill methods. Both fluconazole and BE showed weak antifungal activity when tested alone. However, the combination of fluconazole and BE showed strong antifungal activity against most of the fluconazole-resistant isolates tested. The findings of time-kill curves confirmed the interaction. Yeast cells grown in the presence of BE exhibited a reduced extrusion of Rhodamine 6G, which indicates the inhibition of efflux pumps by BE. This novel synergism of fluconazole and BE that can overcome drug-resistance in yeast may prove useful in combined treatment of fungal infections.
