Lactobacillus acidophilus 30SC was tested for its potential as a probiotic culture. The strain exhibited good acid tolerance in an artificial gastric solution as well as bile resistance in media containing 0.3% bile acids. The strain produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature and, therefore, referred to as a bacteriocin. The bacteriocin was active over a wide pH range and inhibited a number of gram-positive bacteria including Listeria ivanovii and pathogenic strains. The bacteriocin was purified by 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. The SDS-PAGE of the active fractions resulted in a single band with estimated molecular mass of 3.5 kDa. These results demonstrate the potential of L. acidophilus 30SC as a probiotic culture that can be utilized in the manufacturing of dairy foods and dietary supplements.
