BACKGROUND: Elevated temperatures jeopardize plant disease resistance, as mediated by salicylic acid (SA). SA potentiates heat-induced expression of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) in tomato cells. In mammalian cells, Hsp70 suppresses apoptosis. We hypothesized that potentiation of heat-induced Hsp70 by SA contributes to a reduction in apoptosis in tobacco protoplasts. METHODS: Tobacco protoplasts (Nicotiana tabacum) were exposed to SA (70 microM) at normal temperatures or in combination with heat shock. Hsp70/Hsc70 accumulation and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, DNA fragmentation, as well as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were quantified by flow cytometry. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: SA at normal temperatures did not influence Hsp70/Hsc70 accumulation, but were found to induce apoptosis. In contrast, SA in combination with HS potentiated heat-induced Hsp70/Hsc70 accumulation in tobacco protoplasts that correlated negatively with apoptosis, illustrated by decreased PS exposure and DNA fragmentation and enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential. We propose that this correlation supports a possible role for apoptosis suppression by Hsp70 under elevated temperatures during pathogen infection.
