Antibiotic resistance, particularly with the fluoroquinolones and macrolide antibiotics, has now emerged globally with thermophilic campylobacters, including Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, giving rise to concerns about how these organisms have acquired such resistance characteristics, as well as consequences for human and animal treatment. This review examines (i) the clinical epidemiology of antibiotic resistance in human and animal thermophilic campylobacters, (ii) an update on resistance rates globally, (iii) surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in campylobacters originating from animals, particularly poultry, (iv) the role of the environment in the acquisition and transmission of antibiotic-resistant campylobacters, as well as (v) issues of biocide resistance in campylobacters.
