This study investigated the clinical characteristics of ciprofloxacin-resistant Proteus mirabilis isolates from urine samples associated with nosocomial infection or colonisation, and identified the risk-factors for ciprofloxacin resistance. Data for patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant P. mirabilis isolates (n=13) were compared with those for randomly selected patients with ciprofloxacin-susceptible P. mirabilis isolates (n=40) who were matched by temporal occurrence as control patients. The majority of ciprofloxacin-resistant P. mirabilis isolates were multiresistant, and ciprofloxacin resistance was associated significantly with previous use of fluoroquinolones and production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
