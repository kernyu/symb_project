Typhoid fever, like many gastroenteric infections, is considered a particular risk during pregnancy because of reduced peristaltic activity in the gastrointestinal and biliary tracts and increased prevalence of biliary 'sludge' and concretions. Antibiotic resistance among salmonellae makes the choice of antibiotics for initial treatment of infection difficult before cultures and sensitivities are reported. Because of the potential risks of some antimicrobial agents for pregnancy, the selection of antibiotic therapy is further complicated.
