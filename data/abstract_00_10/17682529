Sensitivity of museum and fresh strains to antimycotics has been determined. 5-Fluorocytosine (86.2%) and amphotericine B (93.2%) were highly effective as to results on test-systems, considerable part of strains was resistant to fluconasole (93.2%) and itraconasole (62.1%). Due to disk-diffusion method it was determined that nystatine was an effective inhibitor of growth of 100% of all species cultures, amphotericine B--93.3%, resistance to clotrimasole was 56.6%. During the last three years the part of polyresistant strains of yeastlike fungi exceeds considerably the critical level. A comparison of antibiotic sensitivity of C. albicans representatives and strains of non-albicans species did not manifest cardinal differences.
