Carbapenemases are among the newest resistance mechanisms to emerge in some gram-negative bacteria. We describe bacteremia in a critically ill liver transplant recipient infected with KPC-2-producing Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas putida. Although this enzyme has been previously described in Enterobacter spp., this is the first report of KPC carbapenemase in P. putida.
