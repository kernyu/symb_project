We summarize the clinical history and laboratory results following the introduction of tenofovir among 6 patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) who presented with severe liver disease while receiving lamivudine-based highly active antiretroviral therapy. In all cases, the introduction of tenofovir led to a sustained undetectable HBV and HIV loads, with marked clinical and laboratory improvement in liver function. We provide supporting evidence for the role of tenofovir in the management of advanced HBV infection in HIV-positive patients after the development of lamivudine resistance.
