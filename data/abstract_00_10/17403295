OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of c-Jun NH (2)-terminal kinase (JNk) in insulin resistance after burn and its mechanism. METHODS: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to control, burn and burn + anisomycin groups. The rats in control group received sham burn trauma, and burn and burn + anisomycin groups received 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full thickness burn injury. Anisomycin (5 mg/kg) together with 250 microl dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was injected to the rats in anisomycin group intravenously, and only 250 microl DMSO in the other two groups. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps was performed 2 hours after the injection. The changes of phospho-serine 307, phospho-tyrosine of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and phospho-JNK in muscle tissues were determined and compared using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis or immunohistochemistry in the three groups. RESULTS: The infusing rates of total 10% glucose (mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) in control, burn and burn + anisomycin group were 12.3 +/- 0.4, 6.6 +/- 0.3, 6.5 +/- 0.4, respectively. The level of IRS-1 Serine 307 phosphorylation and phospho-JNK in muscle increased significantly, while insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 decreased markedly after burn. CONCLUSIONS: The activation of JNK elevates the level of IRS-1 phospho-serine 307 and might play a role in insulin resistance after burn in rats.
