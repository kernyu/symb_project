Summary. To assess the natural variation in drug susceptibility among treatment-naive hepatitis C virus (HCV) patient isolates, the susceptibilities of chimeric replicons carrying the HCV NS5B polymerase from up to 51 patient isolates against a panel of diverse HCV nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors were evaluated using a replicon-based transient replication assay. Some patient to patient variation in susceptibility to the panel of three HCV nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors was observed. Linear regression and correlation analyses revealed no correlations among the susceptibilities to the polymerase inhibitors tested. Our results suggest that variable antiviral responses to HCV nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors may be observed because of the natural variation in baseline susceptibility. In addition, the lack of correlation among the susceptibilities to three classes of HCV polymerase inhibitors evaluated here supports their possible combined use in a combination therapy strategy.
