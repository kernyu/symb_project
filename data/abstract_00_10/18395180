Though the increased resistance to antibiotics observed worldwide is not a major concern in France, treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus has important limitations. New antibiotics have recently been marketed or will soon be (quinupristin-dalfopristin, linelozide, tigecyclin, daptomycin, ceftobiprole, dalbavancin). Their role, which has been documented in several forms of acute infections, remains to be established in infective endocarditis. At present, only treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus right-sided endocarditis justifies the use of daptomycin, preferably in association with rifampicin, when the use of vancomycin is not possible or contraindicated.
