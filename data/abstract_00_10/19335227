We sought to evaluate the indirect impact of ertapenem use for the treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections in our hospital on the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem. The use of ertapenem was mandated for treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections in the absence of nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli for 1 year. The use of imipenem was restricted. Imipenem consumption decreased 64.5%. Ertapenem consumption was 42.57 defined daily doses per 1,000 patient-days. None of the 18 P. aeruginosa isolates recovered after ertapenem introduction were imipenem-resistant, compared with 4 of the 20 P. aeruginosa isolates recovered in the previous year.
