A series of 3,5-disubstituted thiadiazine thiones (4-24) have been synthesized by reaction of primary amines with carbon disulphide followed by cyclocondensation of the resulting intermediate with formaldehyde and primary amines or amino acids. The compounds were screened for antitubercular activity in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Three compounds 4, 12 and 18 showed antimycobacterial activity with MIC 12.5 microg/mL. Compound 4, was tested in vitro against five multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of M. tuberculosis and was found to be active. Compound 4 also exhibited activity in vivo. While all the mice died in the untreated group, the mean survival time (MST) of the compound treated mice was enhanced, 33% mice were surviving in treated group and the load of bacilli in the lung was considerably less in the compound treated group than in the untreated control group.
