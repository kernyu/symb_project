BACKGROUND: Foot infections are a common reason for hospitalization and a cause of complications in patients with diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of microorganisms found on culture in complicated diabetic foot infections in hospitalized patients, and the sensitivity of the causative microorganisms to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Between December 2001 and December 2005 in our department, 84 samples in 62 diabetic patients with moderate/severe infection were collected for microbiological study. RESULTS: At least one microorganism was isolated in 88% of samples. The most frequently isolated germ group was gram-positive bacteria (55% of the samples), with Staphylococcus aureus (33%) in the first position, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Enterococcus spp. (9%), and Escherichia coli (8%). Culture for anaerobic microorganisms was only performed in half the samples; 25% were positive, and Peptostreptococcus spp. predominated. Among the multiresistant microorganisms, methicillin-resistant staphylococci aureus (MRSA) were the most common, accounting for 38% of the isolated strains of S. aureus, ie, 12% of all samples. As to the gram-negative microorganisms, nearly 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Most of the cultures in our study were monomicrobial, with S. aureus being the most prevalent microorganism, followed by enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa. The main resistant microorganism in diabetic foot infections requiring hospitalization was methicillin-resistant golden staphylococcus, which was found in 12% of the series.
