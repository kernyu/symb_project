Gonorrhea is essentially out of control in many settings and high disease rates are coupled with the spread of multiresistant gonococci. Increases in quinolone resistance have followed loss of the penicillins and tetracyclines as useful treatments. Decreasing susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins is also reported. Over-reliance on antibiotic treatment as a disease control measure in settings with high disease rates and poor control of antibiotic usage is a significant contributor to the antimicrobial resistance reported. Conversely, containment of resistance is more likely to be achieved when combined with disease control principles shown to be effective. However, until a higher priority is given to funding for sexually transmitted diseases, this prospect is unlikely to eventuate and the possibility of untreatable gonorrhea becomes more real.
