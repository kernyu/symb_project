A total of 132 infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (including 112 imipenem resistant, 32 of them producing VIM-2 beta-lactamase) were identified during a one-year period (June 2002-June 2003). PFGE molecular typing revealed that P. aeruginosa clinical isolates sensitive to imipenem, P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to imipenem but VIM-negative, and P. aeruginosa-resistant and VIM-positive isolates could be allocated to three different clusters with approximately 70% similarity. A case control study of patients infected with an MBL-producing imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolate and controls (patients hospitalized in the same time period with no infection), revealed that only the number of catheters present at the time of the infection was strongly associated with the development of infection due to VIM-producing P. aeruginosa (OR 4.83, 95% CI: 1.94-12.0). In conclusion, the results of the molecular typing combined with the results of the case control study indicate that in the specific hospital setting, infection control, addressed specifically to critically ill patients, is an important part of any strategy to reduce imipenem-resistant infections.
