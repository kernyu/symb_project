Twenty-eight quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecium from hospital patients and nonhuman sources in European countries were studied. High-level resistance (MICs, >/=32 microg/ml) was associated with the presence of vat(E) (satG) (14 isolates inverted question mark50%) or vat(D) (satA) (6 isolates inverted question mark21%). These genes were not detected in eight (29%) isolates with lower levels of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance (MICs, 4 to 16 microg/ml). This suggests the presence of further mechanisms of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin in E. faecium.
