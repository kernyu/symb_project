Five Listeria monocytogenes isolates (CLIP 21369, CLIP 73298, CLIP 74811, CLIP 75679, and CLIP 79372) were found to be resistant to fluoroquinolones during the screening for antibiotic resistance of 488 L. monocytogenes isolates from human cases of listeriosis in France. On the basis of a fourfold or greater decrease in the ciprofloxacin MIC in the presence of reserpine, fluoroquinolone resistance was attributed to active efflux of the drugs. The lde gene (Listeria drug efflux; formerly lmo2741) encodes a 12-transmembrane-segment putative efflux pump belonging to the major facilitator superfamily of secondary transporters that displayed 44% identity with PmrA from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Insertional inactivation of the lde gene in CLIP 21369 indicated that the corresponding protein was responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance and was involved in the level of susceptibility to dyes such as ethidium bromide and acridine orange.
