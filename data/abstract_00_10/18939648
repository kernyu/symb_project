Ulcerative enteritis is a disease that typically responds well to medication. An outbreak of ulcerative enteritis that was persistent and unresponsive to treatment is described. The outbreak started in semimature birds and progressively spread to younger birds. Confounding factors leading to this persistence were a significant coccidosis problem, a feed mixing error, and suspected antibiotic resistance. Although Clostridium colinum was never isolated, a bacitracin-resistant Clostridium perfringens was cultured from affected birds. Only the combined treatment of the flocks with an anticoccidial and tylosin was effective in controlling clinical disease. Numerous other management and treatment strategies were unsuccessful in lowering the severe mortality.
