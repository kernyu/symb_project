The effect of sequencing batch reactor operation on presence and concentration of tetracycline-resistant organisms was studied as a function of organic loading rate (OLR) and solids retention time (SRT), with and without supplemented influent tetracycline. These effects were evaluated using bacterial counts, bacterial production, system growth rate, and percent resistance. These evaluation parameters were applied to both intermediate resistant and resistant heterotrophs, enterics, and lactose fermenters. Tetracycline intermediate resistant and resistant bacteria are defined as the survival of colonies on agar with 5 and 20 mg/L tetracycline, respectively. Based on these studies, increases in influent tetracycline concentration and OLR resulted in amplification of tetracycline resistance. Decreases in SRT also resulted in amplification of tetracycline resistance.
