Antifungal medications for intravaginal use have been available in the United States for more than a decade. Women may be inclined to self-diagnose yeast infections with any vaginal discharge or other vulvovaginal symptoms that they deem abnormal. As we saw in the first part of this article, "Abnormal vaginal discharge: Using office diagnostic testing more effectively" (J Fam Pract 2004; 53[10]:805-814), abnormal discharge is more likely to be bacterial vaginosis or no pathogen at all. Potential delay in diagnosis and treatment of a sexually transmitted disease is also a concern. Increasing resistance of Candida sp. to imidazoles is associated with indiscriminate use of over-the-counter products.
