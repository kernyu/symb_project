It was the aim of this study to investigate the effect of chitosan-4-thiobutylamidine (Ch-TBA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) on the absorption of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) substrate saquinavir in vitro and in vivo. Bidirectional transport studies were performed with Caco-2 cell monolayers and additionally with freshly excised rat small intestinal mucosa mounted in Ussing type chambers. Furthermore, a delivery system based on Ch-TBA and GSH was evaluated in vivo in rats. The functional activity of the efflux pumps in Caco-2 cells and rat intestinal mucosa during the experiment was proven by the efflux ratio of saquinavir, which was 6.4 for Caco-2 cells and 2.1 for rat intestinal mucosa, respectively. Ch-TBA and particularly the combination of Ch-TBA with GSH enhanced apical (AP) absorption and decreased the secretory transport of saquinavir. In presence of 0.5% Ch-TBA and 0.5% GSH, the uptake of saquinavir was 1.6-fold improved in Caco-2 monolayer and 2.1-fold improved in rat intestinal mucosa. In vivo, the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of saquinavir was 1.4-fold and Cmax 1.6-fold increased, in comparison with control. Results of this study showed that Ch-TBA in combination with GSH can be an interesting tool for increasing the oral bioavailability of actively secreted compounds.
