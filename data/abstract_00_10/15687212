The majority of Bordetella sp. virulence determinants are regulated by the BvgAS signal transduction system. BvgAS mediates the control of multiple phenotypic phases and a spectrum of gene expression profiles specific to each phase in response to incremental changes in the concentrations of environmental signals. Studies highlighting the critical role of this signaling circuitry in the Bordetella infectious cycle have focused on planktonically growing bacterial cells. It is becoming increasingly clear that the major mode of bacterial existence in the environment and within the body is a surface-attached state known as a biofilm. Biofilms are defined as consortia of sessile microorganisms that are embedded in a matrix. During routine growth of Bordetella under agitating conditions, we noticed the formation of a bacterial ring at the air-liquid interface of the culture tubes. We show here that this surface adherence property reflects the ability of these organisms to form biofilms. Our data demonstrate that the BvgAS locus regulates biofilm development in Bordetella. The results reported in this study suggest that the Bvg-mediated control in biofilm development is exerted at later time points after the initial attachment of bacteria to the different surfaces. Additionally, we show that these biofilms are highly tolerant of a number of antimicrobials, including the ones that are currently recommended for treatment of veterinary and human infections caused by Bordetella spp. Finally, we discuss the significance of the biofilm lifestyle mode as a potential contributor to persistent infections.
