Antibiotic treatment of infections associated with the use of indwelling medical devices in ageing and/or severely ill patients represents a significant healthcare problem due to the difficulty of treating such infections and to the various collateral effects that may be observed following the often aggressive therapy. We summarize some effects of antibiotics on the expression of virulence factors of the microorganisms which cause such infections. These effects, particularly those resulting in a stimulation of bacterial virulence, might be usefully included among the other well-known collateral effects of antibiotic therapy.
