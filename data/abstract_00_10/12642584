The human multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1) contributes to the poor bioavailability of many anticancer and antimicrobial agents as well as to drug resistance at the cellular level. For rational design of effective Pgp inhibitors, a clear understanding of its mechanism of action and functional regulation is essential. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of Pgp-mediated drug transport by cis-(Z)-flupentixol, a thioxanthene derivative, occurs through an allosteric mechanism. Unlike competitive inhibitors, such as cyclosporin A and verapamil, cis-(Z)-flupentixol does not interfere with substrate ([(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin) recognition by Pgp, instead it prevents substrate translocation and dissociation, resulting in a stable but reversible Pgp-substrate complex. cis-(Z)-Flupentixol-induced complex formation requires involvement of the Pgp substrate site, because agents that either physically compete (cyclosporin A) for or indirectly occlude (vanadate) the substrate-binding site prevent formation of the complex. Allosteric modulation by cis-(Z)-flupentixol involves a conformational change in Pgp detectable by monoclonal antibody UIC2 binding to a conformation-sensitive external epitope of Pgp. The conformational change observed is distinct from that induced by Pgp substrates or competitive inhibitors. A single amino acid substitution (F983A) in TM12 of Pgp that impairs inhibition by cis-(Z)-flupentixol of Pgp-mediated drug transport also affects stabilization of the Pgp-substrate complex as well as the characteristic conformational change. Taken together, our results describe the molecular mechanism by which the Pgp modulator cis-(Z)-flupentixol allosterically inhibits drug transport.
