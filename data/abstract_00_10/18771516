Thermotolerant Campylobacter spp., in particular Campylobacter jejuni, are among the most frequently identified pathogens, found to be causing human gastrointestinal infections in Europe, with the Czech Republic being no exception. The presented work aimed at assessing results of the first nationwide monitoring of prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Campylobacter spp. in broiler flocks in the Czech Republic, including a comparison of antibiotic resistance of C. jejuni isolates collected from poultry and the human community. The monitoring was carried out in poultry slaughterhouses in 2006 and 2007. From broilers, cloacal swabs were collected and examined. The human isolates of C. jejuni were acquired from rectal swabs in community patients with diarrhoeal diseases. Suspected isolates of both animal and human origin were confirmed by the PCR methods. Antibiotic resistance to selected anti-microbial agents was tested by the microdilution method. In the monitored period, the prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. in broilers in the Czech Republic reached almost 50%. In 2006, C. jejuni was detected in 46% and Campylobacter coli in 3% of the tested samples. In 2007, C. jejuni was found in 43% and C. coli in 2% of the samples. The results of anti-microbial susceptibility testing of C. jejuni showed higher resistance in animals when compared with humans. The only exception was tetracycline with higher resistance in isolates of human origin. The highest resistance detected was to quinolone antibiotics. Resistance to oxolinic acid was 77% in animal and 60% in human isolates, to ciprofloxacin 72% in isolates from poultry and 55% in those from humans. In ampicillin, 26% of poultry isolates and 16% of human isolates were resistant. Moreover, 9% of animal isolates demonstrated resistance to streptomycin, undetected in human isolates. In erythromycin, resistance was found in 6% of poultry and 1% of human isolates.
