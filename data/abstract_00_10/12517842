One hundred thirty-two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates recovered from patients with S. aureus infections between January 1998 and February 1999 in two hospitals, one located in Taipei, Taiwan, and another in Nanjing, People's Republic of China, were examined for antibiotic susceptibility and for clonal type by a combination of three methods: hybridization of ClaI restriction digests with mecA- and Tn554-specific DNA probes and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal SmaI digests. Selected isolates representing each clonal type were also analyzed by spaA typing, multilocus sequence typing, and a multiplex PCR method capable of identifying the structural type of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) carried by the bacteria. The overwhelming majority of isolates (126 of 132 or 95%) belonged to minor variants of a single clonal type resembling the Brazilian and Hungarian epidemic MRSA clones, which showed a common spaA type and which were either sequence type 239 (ST239) or ST241 (a single-locus variant of ST239) in association with SCCmec type III or IIIA.
