To determine vaccine coverage of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Saudi Arabian children aged 5 years and under, 350 IPD isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Of these 46%, 42% and 12% were penicillin-sensitive, pencillinintermediate, and penicillin-resistant, respectively. Rates of resistance to erythromycin and cefotaxime were 26% and 6%, respectively. The potential serotype coverage of the PCV7 vaccine in Saudi Arabia among children <5 years of age is 62%, and vaccine coverage significantly improved in children <2 years of age, to reach 83% against IPD isolates. PCV7 is expected to have a substantial impact on the burden of invasive and antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal disease in Saudi Arabia.
