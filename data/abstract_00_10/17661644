The potential for enhanced diagnosis and control of gonococcal infection through the application of advances in molecular medicine is now being realized. However, the introduction of diagnostic nucleic acid amplification assays (NAATs) revealed some significant limitations of these applications. Resolution of some, but not all, of these problems has led to recommendations for refined testing algorithms and a better recognition and acceptance of the limitations of NAATs. Resource restriction has limited the use of diagnostic NAATs, especially in less-developed countries where disease rates are highest. However, NAATs have also proved useful in public health approaches to gonorrhea control in all settings. Additional applications including molecular typing of gonococci to identify and interrupt gonococcal transmission chains and definition of antimicrobial resistance patterns in the gonococcus have been proposed. These approaches, especially those for antimicrobial resistance determination, have been less successful for a number of reasons, including their cost and other unresolved issues.
