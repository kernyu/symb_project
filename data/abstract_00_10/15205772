After 2 years of preparation, the Commission for Hospital Hygiene, founded in 1974 by the former German Public Health Service, published the "Guideline for Assessment,Prevention, and Controlling of Nosocomial Infections," which represented an exemplarily complete standard for hospital hygiene. In 1997 within the framework of planning the amendment to the Federal Epidemic Law, a new Commission for Hygiene and Infectious Disease Prevention started work and adapted the guideline to meet today's standards of systematic risk analysis and risk management. The amended Infection Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG), which came into force in January 2001, installed the Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infectious Disease Prevention legally and required it to formulate a guideline to decrease the rate of nosocomial infections, the number of outbreaks, and the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in healthcare facilities by establishing standards of modern prevention. This article describes the political importance of nosocomial infections for public health as well as the working basis, the methods, and the latest guidelines of the Commission.
