BACKGROUND: The aim of the present paper was to determine the rate of culture-proven nosocomial infections and evaluate the episodes of nosocomial Gram-positive (GP) bacterial infections in pediatric patients. METHODS: The data of children with positive culture, who were diagnosed as having nosocomial infection on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, were examined and only the patients with nosocomial GP bacterial infections were included in the study. RESULTS: Between January 1997 and January 2004 a total of 836 episodes of nosocomial GP bacterial infections were observed. The most frequently seen nosocomial GP bacterial infections were primary bloodstream infections (BSI; 43%), ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections (18%), and nosocomial pneumonias (11%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS; 46%) were the most common nosocomial GP bacteria isolated, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (33%). Methicillin resistance rates for CONS and S. aureus were 85% and 25.2%; respectively. The mortality rate was 4% of all children with nosocomial GP bacterial infections in the present study. CONCLUSION: In the present patients primary BSI were the most common nosocomial GP bacterial infections and CONS were the most frequent GP pathogen isolated. Antimicrobial resistance in GP isolates is an increasing problem.
