Methicillin&#x2010;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of disease across Europe, except for Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands. Recently, MRSA incidence has decreased in many European countries following national interventions, including structural and regulatory changes in health care, promotion of hand hygiene, antibiotic stewardship, and targeted screening, isolation, and decolonization of hospitalized carriers of MRSA.
