A real-time PCR assay with the cycling probe method was used to detect mutations at codons 83 and 87 in the DNA gyrase A subunit encoded by gyrA in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi A clinical isolates. The susceptibility estimated from the results of the gyrA mutation assay was consistent with that identified by the culture method using an E-test. This assay allows rapid screening of S. enterica serovar Typhi and Paratyphi A with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.
