Studies were conducted to compare and evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility test results for enterococci obtained by six national committee disk diffusion procedures. Variations in the incidence of isolates in resistance categories and errors were associated with the use of ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, rifampin, and teicoplanin in a number of committee procedures. Results indicate that laboratories performing disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing may have problems correctly identifying resistance in enterococci with agents used to combat infections and that it may be difficult to compare resistance data for surveillance purposes.
