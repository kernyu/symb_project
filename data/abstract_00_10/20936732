Acinetobacter has been the major pathogen of nosocomial infection. With the wide use of carbapenems, the emergence of multi-resistant isolates especially those resistant to carbapenem, brings a great problem to clinical treatment. The production of inactive enzymes is the main mechanism for antibiotic resistance, particularly the production of carbapenemases mediated by chromosome or plasmid. Combinations of beta-lactam antibiotics and sulbactam may show synergism or partial synergism for acinetobacter isolates.
