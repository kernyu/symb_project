Of 1284 Bacteroides strains collected in Europe in 2000 for antibiotic susceptibility surveillance, 65 isolates displayed imipenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) > or =1 mg/L and were chosen for a thorough analysis of their resistance mechanism. Twenty-five of the isolates were positive for the cfiA carbapenem resistance gene. The resistance rates were 0.8% and 1.3% for imipenem and meropenem, respectively. In six of the strains, insertion sequence (IS) elements (IS613, IS614B, IS1186 and IS1187) activated the cfiA gene. However, other strains displayed at least elevated carbapenem MICs or were carbapenem resistant and produced measurable carbapenemase activities but did not harbour IS elements in the region upstream of the cfiA gene. The major determinant of carbapenem resistance in Bacteroides fragilis is production of CfiA metallo-beta-lactamase via activation of the cfiA gene by IS elements (higher level resistance) or by activation of its putative own promoter.
