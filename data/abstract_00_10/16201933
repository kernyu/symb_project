We report our experience with two cases of fixation device-related orthopedic infections due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Both patients were successfully treated with intravenous administration of colistin, despite the reported poor penetration of this medication to these tissues, in the old literature. No serious colistin-associated toxicity developed and no recurrence of the infection occurred on follow up.
