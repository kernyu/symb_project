Cloning of plant disease resistant genes is greatly helpful for disease resistant breeding in plants and the insight of resistance mechanism. However, there are less relevant researches in peach [prunus persica (L.) Batch]. In this study, four NBS-LRR type resistance gene analogs (RGAs) were cloned from genomic DNA of peach. The PNBS2 fragment was also amplified from peach cDNA and the full-length cDNA of PNBS2 (PRPM1, GenBank accession no. AY599223) has been cloned. Sequence analysis indicated that the cDNA of PRPM1 is 3007 bp in length and that the contained ORF encodes for a polypeptide of 917 amino acids. Compared with known NBS-LRR genes, it presented relatively high amino acid sequence identity. The polypeptide has typical structure of non-TIR-NBS-LRR genes, with NB-ARC, LZ, LRR and transmembrane domains. Southern analysis indicated that the PRPM1 gene might be a single copy in peach genome. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of PRPM1 was not induced by salicylic acid (SA) in peach young leaves. The isolation of putative resistance genes from peach provided useful bases for studying the structure and function of peach disease-resistance relating genes and disease resistant genetic breeding in peach.
