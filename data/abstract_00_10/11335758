Pediococci are recently recognized Gram-positive human pathogens, resistant to vancomycin and generally susceptible to penicillin. Infection in adults has been seen in patients with chronic underlying conditions as well as those with previous abdominal surgery. Two previous infants with congenital gastrointestinal malformations requiring surgical correction have been reported with sepsis attributable to Pediococcus sp. We report a third infant born with gastroschisis who developed Pediococcus bacteremia and meningitis 3 months after surgery, and speculate regarding the role of probiotics in the pathogenesis of this infection.
