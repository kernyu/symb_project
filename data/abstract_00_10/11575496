Sterol composition of four clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus resistant to itraconazole was determined by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry and compared with that of four susceptible strains. For all strains, the major sterol was ergosterol. Sterol compositions were qualitatively and quantitatively similar for the resistant and susceptible strains. These results suggest that itraconazole resistance is not related, for the strains studied, to alterations in the ergosterol synthesis pathway.
