New extended-spectrum beta-lactamase GES-11 was detected in Acinetobacter baumannii BM4674. The enzyme conferred resistance to beta-lactams, including aztreonam, and reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. The structural gene was part of a class 1 integron borne by self-transferable plasmid pIP847. GES-type beta-lactamases have not been reported previously in A. baumannii.
