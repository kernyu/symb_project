Although both bacillary and coccoid forms of Helicobacter pylori reside in human stomach, the pathophysiological significance of the two forms remains obscure. The present work describes the effect of oxygen tension on the transformation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism of this pathogen. Most H. pylori cultured under an optimum O2 concentration (7%) were the bacillary form, whereas about 80% of cells cultured under aerobic or anaerobic conditions were the coccoid form. The colony-forming unit of H. pylori decreased significantly under both aerobic and anaerobic culture conditions. The bacillary form of H. pylori generated predominantly superoxide radical, whereas the coccoid form generated preferentially hydroxyl radical. Specific activities of cellular respiration, urease, and superoxide dismatase decreased markedly after transformation of the bacillary form to the coccoid form, with concomitant generation of protein carbonyls and 8-hydroxyguanine. The frequency of mutation of cells increased significantly during culture under nonoptimum O2 conditions. These results indicate that ROS generated by H. pylori catalyze the oxidative modification of cellular DNA, thereby enhancing the transformation from the bacillary to the coccoid form. The enhanced generation of mutagenic hydroxyl radicals in the coccoid form might accelerate mutation and increase the genetic diversity of H. pylori.
