In tropical areas treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria episodes is a priority concern. New treatments must be found because of the ability of the plasmodium to develop resistance to antimalarial agents. This article presents an overview of therapeutic breakthroughs made over the last five years. A promising area involves combination therapies using two known or new antimalarial agents especially artemisin. Research on antimalarial drugs acting by novel mechanisms such as ferroquine, trioxanes, phosphatidyl choline inhibitor, fluoroquinolones and fosfidomycine is also reviewed.
