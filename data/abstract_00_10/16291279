Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is being recognized increasingly as a cause of community-acquired infection. The organism usually causes skin and soft tissue infection. Here, we present a patient with community-acquired MRSA pneumonia and review the literature. The patient, a 37-year-old Saudi male with no significant medical history was admitted with fever, respiratory distress and scrotal ulceration. Scrotal swabs and blood cultures grew MRSA. Imaging studies showed necrotizing pneumonia. Physical examination and echocardiographic findings revealed no evidence of endocarditis. The patient was treated successfully with 4 weeks of intravenous vancomycin. The infection appears to have originated in the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the scrotum, and subsequently led to necrotizing pneumonia. Community-acquired MRSA pneumonia has been associated with the production of Panton-Valentine leukocidin.
