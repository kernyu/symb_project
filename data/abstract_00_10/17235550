Many children with a late steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and focal glomerulosclerosis have a poor prognosis and enter end-stage renal failure (ESRF) within five years. Reports are scarce on the long-term follow-up of patients entering remission while receiving immunosuppressive therapy after steroids have failed. A two-year-old boy with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis having both late steroid and cyclophosphamide resistance entered complete remission of the SRNS almost two years after starting induction therapy with cyclosporine A (CSA). During the 15-year follow-up, the patient experienced five relapses during CSA maintenance therapy. All relapses were successfully treated within 10 days by intravenous methylprednisolone pulses in addition to CSA. The relapses were accompanied by a drop in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). At the age of 18 years, the patient had grade II chronic kidney disease (GFR=61 ml/min/1.73 m2). At the age of 14 years, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was added to the maintenance therapy and the CSA dosage was reduced. Two renal biopsies at the ages of 10 and 18 years failed to detect CSA nephrotoxicity. We conclude that children with SRNS may have long-term benefit from a combination therapy using intravenous methylprednisolone pulses and CSA.
