When boosted by ritonavir, protease inhibitors trough concentration and inhibitory quotient are increased, thus enhancing their therapeutic margin. Although the inhibitory quotient is less high when patients are pre-treated and have developed resistance mutations, it nonetheless offers a precious alternative for patients experiencing therapeutic failure. Despite great inter-individual variability in virologic responses, boosted protease inhibitors can be compared to boosted lopinavir. The latter seems superior to saquinavir boosted and indinavir boosted in terms of virologic efficacy and resistance mutations selection. A conclusion regarding boosted atazanavir and boosted fos-amprenavir versus lopinavir cannot be absolutely drawn on the basis of present results.
