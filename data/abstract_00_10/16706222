Changes in superoxide radical formation and bioelectrical characteristics of excised wheat root cells under modification of plasma membrane ion permeability were studied. It was shown that a 2 h treatment of excised roots with valinomycin (Val, 20 microM), N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodimide (DCCD, 100 microM), gramicidin S (Gr, 20 microM), chlorpromazine (CPZ, 100 microM) caused an increased loss of potassium by cells, lowering of membrane potential (MP) and electrical input resistance (Rin) of the cells. The superoxide formation by excised root cells diminished (under DCCD) or remained at the control level (under Val), which was accompanied by a minor decrease of MP and Rin of the cells, a small increase in potassium loss by excised roots, and in no change of pH of incubation medium. Significant depolarization of plasma membrane, dropping of Rin and essential loss of potassium ions by the cells correlated with a rise in the medium alkalinization and superoxide formation by excised roots (in the presence of Gr, CPZ). Ion channel blocker gadolinium (Gd3+, 200 microM) caused an increase of MP and Rin reduction of potassium loss by cells, and a decrease of pH of the incubation medium, and also enhancement of superoxide formation by excised root cells. It is suggested that upon plasma membrane ion permeability modification the activity of superoxide generating systems depends on the specificity and mechanisms of action of modulators, and is determined by their influence on redox state of plasma membrane as well as by peculiarities of ion transport disturbance.
