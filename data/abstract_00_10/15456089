A system of reverse genetics was used to generate influenza A/H1N1 viruses harbouring neuraminidase (NA) mutations previously associated with resistance to NA inhibitors in various viral subtypes. The His274Tyr and Glu119Gln mutants were rescued whereas the Arg292Lys and Glu1l9 --> Gly, Val, Ala or Asp mutants could not be generated. In NA inhibition assays, the His274Tyr mutant was resistant to oseltamivir (430-fold over wild-type) and BCX-1812 (50-fold) but was sensitive to zanamivir. A similar trend was seen when the mutant was evaluated by plaque reduction assay (PRA). The Glu119Gln mutant expressed a low level of resistance to oseltamivir (nine-fold) and zanamivir (fourfold) in NA inhibition assay but was only marginally resistant to oseltamivir (fourfold) in PRA. The replication capacity of both mutants, in particular that of the His274Tyr virus, was impaired when compared with the wild-type virus in vitro.
