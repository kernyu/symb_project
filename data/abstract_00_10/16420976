Vancomycin is the preferred parenteral antibiotic for the treatment of all methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, including the newly emerging community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections. Vancomycin-intermediate nosocomial MRSA strains have developed in vitro and in vivo after exposure to vancomycin. The aim of this study was to determine whether daily serial passage of CA-MRSA strains onto vancomycin-supplemented agar selects for the development of vancomycin resistance. Twelve clinical isolates of the six commonest Australian and US strains of CA-MRSA were serially passaged daily for 25 days onto brain-heart infusion agar plates supplemented with 4 microg/mL vancomycin and then subcultured for a further 15 days onto antibiotic-free agar to assess the stability of the resistance phenotype. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by standard Etest every 5 days from day 0 to day 40. Serial passaging resulted in increased MICs in all strains but the rises were modest, with an increase of < 2 doubling dilutions. All strains remained vancomycin susceptible throughout the experiment according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute criteria.
