AIM: To determine if disinfecting footbaths in the food industry were contaminated with bacteria and to characterize some of the bacteria present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacterial strains were isolated from disinfecting footbaths containing TEGO 103G (amphoteric disinfectant) or TP-99 (alkyl amino acetate-based disinfectant) in five of six dairy factories. Fourteen strains identified as Cedecea spp. by their fatty acid composition were further characterized. Results from Rapid ID 32 E API analysis and 16S-rDNA-sequencing showed that all strains were Serratia marcescens. Unlike S. marcescens ATCC 13880, the isolates from disinfecting footbaths were not killed (<5 log10 reduction) by the recommended in-use concentration of TEGO 103G, TEGO 51 or benzalkonium chloride. Survival and multiplication in tap water with an in-use concentration of TEGO 103G was demonstrated for one of the strains. All strains were killed by the in-use concentrations of commercial disinfectants based on peracetic acid, hypochlorite, quaternary ammonium compounds and alkyl amino acetate (TP-99). There were no indications of cross-resistance between disinfectants and antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Serratia marcescens may survive and multiply in disinfecting footbaths containing TEGO 103G or alkyl amino acetate because of disinfectant resistance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Disinfecting footbaths may act as contamination sources in food factories and should not be used without regular hygienic monitoring.
