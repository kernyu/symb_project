For more than 20 years, hospital and community-acquired antimicrobial resistances regularly increase. In France, methicilline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are the most common resistant pathogens. Previous hospitalisation, surgery, long length of stay, enteral feeding and antibiotic exposure are the main risk factors associated with nosocomial MRSA infections. To limit the emergence of resistances, control strategies have been implemented, based on isolation practices, healthcare workers education, strict hand hygiene and a controlled use of antibiotics. However, new antimicrobials acting by a novel mechanism of action are necessary in fighting the most resistant organisms. Therefore, the launch on the American market in June 2005 of tigecycline, a first-in-class glycylcycline indicated in the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections, will provide to physicians a new therapeutic option against hospital or community-acquired resistant pathogens. The data presented to ICAAC indicate its expended broad spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram positives, Gram negatives, anaerobes and against number of difficult-to-treat resistant isolates, such as hospital or community-acquired MRSA, vancomycine resistant Enterococcus but also ESBL-producing organisms.
