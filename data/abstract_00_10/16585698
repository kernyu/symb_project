Taxonomic studies were performed on 13 clinical isolates (ten of which were epidemiologically related) that had been previously identified as Oerskovia turbata. Comparative phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, indicated that the isolates are closely related to Cellulosimicrobium cellulans with sequence similarity values ranging from 99.5 to 99.8 %. Chemotaxonomic results (fatty acid profiles and menaquinones) supported the inclusion of these isolates in the genus Cellulosimicrobium. The DNA G+C content was 74.5 mol%. The results of DNA-DNA reassociation, whole-cell sugars (with galactose as the characteristic whole sugar) and phenotypic properties, including antimicrobial resistance, indicated that these isolates are representatives of a novel species of the genus Cellulosimicrobium. The name Cellulosimicrobium funkei sp. nov. is proposed for the novel strains, with strain W6122T (=ATCC BAA-886T = DSM 16025T = CCUG 50705T) as the type strain. The definition of this novel Cellulosimicrobium species will assist in the understanding of the epidemiology and clinical significance of these micro-organisms.
