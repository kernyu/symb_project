Highlights are presented from this annual workshop, which was devoted to the investigation of adverse effects associated with antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. Topics covered included the lipodystrophy syndrome, which encompasses body composition changes (subcutaneous fat wasting, visceral fat accumulation) and metabolic abnormalities (insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia). The relevance of HIV protease inhibitor-induced metabolic abnormalities to cardiovascular disease is discussed. Research in the areas of hyperlactataemia, abacavir hypersensitivity, and bone mineral density in the context of HIV infection is also briefly reviewed.
