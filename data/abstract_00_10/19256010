A hundred and forty children aged 13 to 17 who had new-onset active pulmonary tuberculosis were examined. There was a predominance of infiltrative tuberculosis (63.6%) in the pattern of its clinical forms. The processes were more frequently disseminated (79.3%) with lung tissue decay in every two patients (55.1%) and bacterial discharge in every three patients (39.3%). Among the new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, the proportion of its multidrug resistance was 7.9%. The routine regimens were used for treatment. The efficiency of intensive-phase (IF) treatment was evaluated in 85 patients, including 18 patients receiving chemotherapy (CT) (HRZ/E/S) regimen 3 (Group 1), 45 having CT (HRZ/E/S) regimen 1 (Group 2), and 22 having CT (HRZE[A][Fq]/[Pt]) regimen 2B (Group 3). Clinical laboratory, Xray, and microbiological findings were criteria for evaluating the efficiency of IP CT. Abacillation occurred in all cases by month 4 of therapy. By and large, the efficiency of IF CT was 90.6% in new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis among old-age children and adolescents. In patients with disseminated processes, it ranged from 81.8% (Group 3) to 91.1% (Group 2) depending on the extent of lung tissue damage. The efficiency of therapy was as high as 100% in patients with circumscribed processes. Polyresistant resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) to chemical agents, including multidrug resistance (7.9%), was a main reason of ineffective IF treatment (9.4%) in new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis among old-age children and adolescents. Overall, the actual use rate of routine CT regimens was 65.9% in new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and adolescents. Uncontrolled adverse reactions to antituberculous drugs and drug resistance in MBT were reasons for deviations of routine regimens (modifications, use of individual regimes).
