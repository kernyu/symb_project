Between April 2001 and March 2003, we studied minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of 7 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 8 strains of Haemophilus influenzae isolated from children with meningitis. The age range of the patients was from 4 months to 5 years. Susceptibilities of ampicillin (ABPC), cefotaxime (CTX), panipenem (PAPM), and vancomycin (VCM) in S. pneumoniae and those of ABPC, CTX, ceftriaxone (CTRX), and meropenem (MEPM) in H. influenzae were measured. MICs of ABPC, CTX, PAPM, and VCM to S. pneumoniae were < or = 0.06-2, < or = 0.06-0.5, < or = 0.06, and 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml and MICs of ABPC, CTX, CTRX, and MEPM to H. influenzae were 0.12-64, < or = 0.06-0.5, < or = 0.06-0.12, and < or = 0.06-0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. In 5 of all strains, difference between MIC and MBC to ABPC was observed. Four strains out of them had mutations of penicillin binding protein genes measured by PCR methods.
