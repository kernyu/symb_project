INTRODUCTION: The role of the exocrine pancreas in regulating gut microflora colonization is unclear. The main objective in the current study was to assess the effect of pancreatic fluid on the growth of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. METHODS: The antibacterial activity of pure pig pancreatic juice collected from catheterized, healthy, conscious, and anesthetized pigs was investigated with multiresistant microbial isolates and nonpathogenic strains. Studies were performed on pathogenic bacterial and fungi as well as lactic acid bacteria and reference strains. RESULTS: Pancreatic juice was effective (P < 0.01) against multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens, whereas lactic acid bacteria were insensitive. The antibacterial action was independent of pancreatic juice proteolytic activity. The in vitro antibacterial properties of pancreatic juice last for several hours. Data suggest that broth composition may modulate the intensity of pancreatic juice antibacterial activity. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic juice antibacterial activity may be an important factor in limiting the colonization of pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. We postulate that observed antibacterial activity of the pancreatic juice could play an important role as one of the factors of innate immunity.
