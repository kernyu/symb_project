OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug resistance spectrum of clinical bacterial and Candida isolates. METHODS: Most of the bacterial isolates were identified using automated BD Phoenix, and a few with K-B method carried out manually. Candida isolates were identified by color-display plate and K-B method. RESULTS: The most common isolates in the 2478 strains were P. aeruginosa (15.6%), E. coli (11.5%), C. albicans (9.6%), K. pneumoniae (9.3%), S. aureu (8.2%), and S. epidermidis (7.5%). In gram-negative isolates, the antibiotics with the lowest resistance rate were meraopenem (14.4%), cefoperazone/Sulbactam (14.8%), Imipenem (21.9%), piperacillin/tazobactam (27.4%), ceftazidime (30.0%), amikacin (31.1%), and cefepime (33.1%). The detection rate of E.coli and K. pneumoniae isolates producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) were 47.4% and 37.3% respectively. In gram-positive isolates, the antibiotics with the lowest resistance rate were vancomycin (0.9%), teicoplanin (1.1%), nitrofurantoin (6.9%), amikacin (20.1%), chloramphenicol (30.7%), and cefoperazone/sulbactam (31.5%). The methecillin-resistant rates of S. aureu , S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus were 57.1%, 65.0%, and 66.0%. For Candida isolates, the most sensitive antibiotics were amphotericin B (0.3%), nystain (0.3%), itraconazole (5.6%), fluconazole (9.4%), and fluorocytosine (9.4%). CONCLUSION: The results suggest high rate of ESBL production and oxacillin resistance of the bacteria isolated in the hospital. More rational use of antimicrobial agents is crucial for reducing the drug-resistance of the bacteria, and effective measures must be taken to reduce dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria.
