Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of vancomycin (VCM) and teicoplanin (TEIC) were measured using a novel susceptibility test based on the chemiluminescence assay (CA) method (Rapid-Lumi Eiken; Eiken Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) against 33 strains in total: 7, 5, and 10 strains of which are VCM-resistant enterococci (VRE) with vanA, vanB, and vanC genes, respectively, and the other 11 strains are vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE). The results were in good accordance with the values determined by the standard broth dilution method approved by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS): i.e., 88% (29/33) of consistency for VCM and 97% (32/33) for TEIC, respectively. In addition, genotypes in VRE strains (vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2/3 genes) were properly estimated from the results of the CA method and the NCCLS interpretive categories, even though the incubation time was very short (2-4 h). In conclusion, it was found that the new method is reliable and rapid to detect VRE strains in clinical laboratories.
