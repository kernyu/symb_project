Fungal pulmonary infections are becoming more prevalent as a consequence of the rising prevalence of immunocompromised patients. Besides ubiquitous opportunistic fungi such as Aspergillus spp and geographically delimited mycoses, fungi that were previously thought to be of uncertain pathogenicity, such as hyaline and dematiaceous molds, are increasingly being diagnosed as the causes of invasive disease in profoundly immunosuppressed hosts. Overall progress in the clinical management of fungal pulmonary infections has been slow compared with other areas of infectious diseases. However, recent encouraging advances in fungal diagnostics and therapeutics have resulted in improved clinical outcomes, particularly in vulnerable patient populations such as solid organ or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. This article provides an overview of endemic mycoses and other emerging fungal pulmonary infections. Recent developments in terms of the diagnosis and clinical management of these infections are also discussed.
