We report the recent isolation of Cryptococcus laurentii from the blood of a patient given the diagnosis of ganglioneuroblastoma. The organism was identified using physiological and molecular characteristics, including morphology, carbohydrate and nitrate assimilation, urease activity, inability to form melanin on appropriate media, positive staining with diazonium blue B and sequence analysis of the D1/D2 domain of 26S ribosomal DNA. The isolate was resistant to fluconazole and 5-fluorocytosine using both the Etest and a broth microdilution assay. Repeated recovery of the organism from different blood cultures, and the patient's good response to treatment with amphotericin B support its etiological role. C. laurentii has rarely been implicated as a cause of clinically significant infections. The identity of reported isolates has not always been adequately documented, and some appear to have been isolated from lesions caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, emphasizing the true rarity of disease due to this fungus.
