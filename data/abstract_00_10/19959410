The introduction of integrase inhibitors as a new drug class for treatment of HIV have added a very potent and extremely well tolerated new treatment option to the HIV-armentarium. Particularly in patients with previously developed drug resistance, the availability of new active drugs offers great hope. Moreover, the in general excellent safety profile offers numerous opportunities for all lines of therapy and special patient populations. Clearly more data is needed to further explore and define the future role of integrase inhibitors in HIV-care.
