The evaluation of susceptibility patterns of clinical and laboratory isolates of dermatophytes and Candida to sertaconazole nitrate has been determined using macrodilution and microdilution test methods in laboratories worldwide. Antimycotics that have been compared to sertaconazole nitrate include itraconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, and terbinafine. A comparison of the minimum inhibitory concentrations clearly shows differences in potency and spectrum among the various agents. This article reviews the antifungal activity of sertaconazole nitrate against major fungal pathogens that cause and complicate tinea pedis. In light of the new topical formulation of sertaconazole nitrate, this compilation of data from the literature is helpful for relating in vitro data to the tissue concentrations required for effective eradication of cutaneous fungal infections.
