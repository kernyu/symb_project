UNLABELLED: Published data confirm that community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are increasing in incidence in both urban and rural settings. The statistical risk is higher for athletes, military personnel, prison inmates, intravenous drug abusers, the homeless, children in daycare, and certain Native American groups, but the infections are by no means restricted to these populations. Roughly 85% of the infections involve the skin and subcutaneous tissue, with the most common presentations being an abscess or folliculitis. The typical associated gene cassette is quite small and codes only for methicillin resistance. Abscesses generally respond to drainage. LEARNING OBJECTIVE: At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should recognize groups at high risk for community-acquired MSRA infections and manage these infections appropriately.
