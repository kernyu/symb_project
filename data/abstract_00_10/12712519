Lac+ type- S. flexneri 1298 1a and S. flexneri 1338 1b hybrids has been obtained in the crosses of Shigella strains with Escherichia coli K-12 Hfr C. The detection of in vitro survive of the bacteria of genetically linked pair strains, differing in type specific antigen synthesis is presented. The more sensitive of lac+ type- hybrids to the treatment by hydrogen peroxide of concentration 205 mM in comparison with the parent S. flexneri strains possesses the type specific antigen synthesis was shown.
