We demonstrate that among the three monofunctional catalases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, KatA and, to a lesser extent, KatB, but not KatE, are required for resistance to peroxide and osmotic stresses. KatA is crucial for adaptation to H2O2 stress and full virulence in both Drosophila melanogaster and mice. This dismantling of catalase roles represents a specialized catalytic system primarily involving KatA in responses to adverse environmental conditions.
