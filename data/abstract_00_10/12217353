In a previous report, we have described novel anti-malarial compounds based on a 2,5-diaminobenzophenone scaffold. Here, we have invesigated acryloyl derivatives carrying a biaryl structure consisting of a terminal aryl residue and a central 2-furyl ring. Several compounds were obtained in the series of para-substituted phenylfurylacryloyl derivatives that displayed improved anti-malarial activity in comparison to earlier described derivatives. From the structure-activity relationships it can be deduced that there has to be a lipophilic moiety in the para-position of the terminal phenyl residue. Furthermore, there are indications that, alternatively, activity may benefit from the presence of a polar moiety with hydrogen bond acceptor properties.
