Prosthetic joint infection is an infrequent but serious complication of total joint arthroplasty. Complete removal of all foreign material is essential, however when prosthesis removal is not possible or contraindicated, suppressive antibiotic therapy with retention of the functioning hip arthroplasty may be considered. Linezolid, the first approved oxazolidinone, appears to be a promising new agent for the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. We report two cases of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prosthetic hip infections successfully treated with a long course of linezolid. This observation suggest that linezolid is a promising drug for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections due to MRSA or other Gram-positive pathogens, particularly when other therapeutic approaches are not feasible or a long-term antibiotic therapy is required.
