Antibiotic resistance is a major European and global public health problem. There are a number of reasons for its emergence; however, the main reasons are the excessive and improper use of this group of antimicrobial drugs. Several recommendations on the prudent use of antibiotics have been developed by various national and intemational authorities. The main message is to use them more responsibly and rationally, since the very dynamic emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms, plus a lack of new antimicrobial drugs in the pipelines of pharmaceutical companies, may result in our inability to treat infections successfully in the near future. To strengthen the message on prudent use, an initiative of the ECDC resulted in a decision by the European Commission to establish the 18th of November as European Antibiotic Awareness Day every year.
