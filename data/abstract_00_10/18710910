Aspergillus fumigatus is a leading cause of death in immunocompromised patients and a frequent colonizer of the respiratory tracts of asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Biofilms enable bacteria and yeasts to persist in infections and can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. We investigated the ability of A. fumigatus to form biofilms on polystyrene (PS) and human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells. We developed a novel in vitro coculture model of A. fumigatus biofilm formation on HBE and CFBE cells. Biofilm formation was documented by dry weight, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). The in vitro antifungal activities of seven antifungal drugs were tested by comparing planktonic and sessile A. fumigatus strains. A. fumigatus formed an extracellular matrix on PS and HBE and CFBE cells as evidenced by increased dry weight, SEM, and CSLM. These biofilms exhibited decreased antifungal drug susceptibility and were adherent to the epithelial cells, with fungi remaining viable throughout 3 days. These observations might have implications for treatment of A. fumigatus colonization in chronic lung diseases and for its potential impact on airway inflammation, damage, and infection.
