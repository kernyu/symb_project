The beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of HIV disease have been accompanied by metabolic changes associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. These changes, which include dyslipidemia, change in body fat distribution, and insulin resistance, resemble the symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Protease inhibitors, nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have all been associated with dyslipidemia to varying degrees. In addition, patients on ART show an increased risk of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events. According to the recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program and the Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group, health care providers should assess cardiovascular risk before starting ART and then continue to monitor lipid levels. Treatment of ART-associated dyslipidemia should follow the following sequence: therapeutic lifestyle changes, lipid-lowering drug therapy, and finally, modifying ART if necessary. By providing education, support, and follow-up care, nurse practitioners can help to implement these steps.
