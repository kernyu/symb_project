The influence exerting by lysogeny state on the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to bactericidal action of teicoplanin was studied. In this aim the standard, non-lysogenic, bacteriophage-free S. aureus NCTC 8325-4 strain was lysogenized with 10 different, bacteriophages obtained in our laboratory. All bacteriophages were derived from multiresistant S. aureus strains and all were able to convert staphylokinase. For all derivatives MBCs and MICs of teicoplanin were determined. In the case of four strains the ratio MBC/MIC showed the presence of tolerance to teicoplanin (MBC/MIC > or = 32) and was significantly higher than in the case of the parent strain NCTC8325-4. In the case of two strains this ratio was smaller than for parent strain. Only small correlation with our previous results obtained for vancomycin was observed.
