A novel spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance gene, designated aadA14, was detected on the mobilizable 5,198-bp plasmid pCCK647 from Pasteurella multocida. The aadA14 gene encodes an aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase of 261 amino acids. Sequence comparisons revealed that the AadA14 protein showed less than 60% identity to the AadA proteins known so far.
