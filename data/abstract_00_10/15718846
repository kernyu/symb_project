Efavirenz treatment has been associated with increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations, and the circulating levels of the drug have been related to the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR-1) C3435T polymorphism. The changes in the measured lipid parameters were evaluated in 59 HIV-infected patients initiating efavirenz-based treatment at baseline and at 12 months of follow-up. Efavirenz treatment increased HDL-cholesterol. The changes in concentrations appeared to be influenced by the MDR-1 gene polymorphism, in which CC > CT > TT.
