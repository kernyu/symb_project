PURPOSE: To describe the course of ocular toxoplasmosis during pregnancy. METHODS: This study was a retrospective, non-comparative case series of four pregnant women who were treated for ocular toxoplasmosis during pregnancy. RESULTS: All of the participants had severe and treatment-resistant toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis during pregnancy, leaving three of them with decreased visual acuity in spite of aggressive therapy. Delivery of the infant appeared to help the recovery in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant state may provoke the recurrence of ocular toxoplasmosis.
