Genetic variation at intron 1 of the interferon gamma gene has recently been associated with variation in faecal egg count in Romney, Merino and Soay breeds of sheep. The Texel breed is more resistant to gastrointestinal nematode infection than the Suffolk breed, based on faecal egg count. Hence, the objective of this experiment was to characterise the polymorphisms of intron 1 of the interferon gammagene in Suffolk and Texel sheep, and to determine if the characterised haplotype variants were associated with faecal egg count variation in these breeds. Intron 1 haplotypes and faecal egg measurements were determined for Suffolks (n=113) and Texels (n=135). Four haplotypes were identified in Suffolks (A, B, C and D), two haplotypes as previously described, and two previously unknown haplotypes. However, there was no association between interferon gamma intron 1 haplotype and faecal egg count in Suffolks. In contrast, two previously identified haplotypes (A and B) were present in the Texel breed, and the B haplotype was associated with resistance to nematode infection (P=0.02). These results suggest that intron 1 of the interferon gamma gene has an important role in resistance to nematode infection in the Texel breed.
