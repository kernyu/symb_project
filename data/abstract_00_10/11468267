Molecular methods have had a significant impact on the diagnosis of viral infections because of their superior sensitivity and rapid turnaround time compared with conventional diagnostic methods. These characteristics have allowed molecular tests to play a central role in the use of testing protocols for managing viral infections. Several examples of such protocols are reviewed in this report, including the use of molecular testing for early disease detection to improve overall disease management and to direct antiviral therapy.
