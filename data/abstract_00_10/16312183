In HIV-2 infection, many studies have reported a high frequency of selection of the Q151M mutation, but its impact on phenotypic susceptibility of HIV-2 isolates remains unclear. Four HIV-2 infected patients from the French ANRS HIV-2 cohort, with evidence of Q151M mutation in both plasma and available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) co-cultivated supernatants, were selected. In vitro phenotypic susceptibilities to different nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were determined using a PBMC assay. In HIV-2 isolates, the Q151M mutation alone impacts only the phenotypic susceptibility to stavudine and abacavir. A decrease in susceptibility to all NRTIs was observed when Q151M was selected with V111I, a mutation of unknown impact on HIV-1 resistance. Clinical relevance of these phenotypic susceptibility results needs to be evaluated in HIV-2 treated patients.
