Twenty isolates resistant to seven quinolones were isolated from major rivers in Korea. All isolates had three mutations, Ser83-->Leu and Asp87-->Asn in GyrA and Ser80-->Ile or Ser80-->Arg in ParC and three isolates had an additional mutation Glu84-->Gly or Glu84-->Val in ParC. In addition, a clonal spread was not found in these isolates.
