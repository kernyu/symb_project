Cloacal swabs were sampled from 100 duck farms in Taiwan between March 2000 and January 2001 for isolation and standard cultivation of Salmonella spp. and thermophilic Campylobacter spp. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 4.6% (91/2000) of ducks from 20% (20/100) of duck farms. Ten serotypes of Salmonella enterica were identified: S. Potsdam (31.9% of isolates), S. Dusseldorf (18.7%), S. Indiana (14.3%), S. Typhimurium (7.7%), S. Hadar (5.5%), S. Newport (4.4%), S. Derby (4.4%), S. Montevideo (2.2%), S. Schwarzengrund (2.2%), and S. Asinnine (1.1%). Isolation of S. Asinnine or S. Indiana from poultry had not hitherto been described in Taiwan. The salmonella isolation rate in ducklings under two weeks of age was significantly higher than the other age groups (P<0.05). Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 43.5% (1045/2400) of ducks from 92% (92/100) of duck farms. Among them, 991 isolates (94.8%) were identified as C. jejuni and 54 isolates (5.2%) as C. coli. The campylobacter isolation rate in ducklings under two weeks of age was significantly lower than other age groups (P<0.05). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by the disk diffusion and E- test methods. The results indicated that Salmonella isolates were 100% susceptible to amikacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftraxone, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and polymyxin B. A markedly higher antimicrobial resistance to amoxicillin, florfenicol, flumequine, josamicin/trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, polymyxin B, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and tetracycline was found in campylobacter isolates.
