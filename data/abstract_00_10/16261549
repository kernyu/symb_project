Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a genetic disease characterized by calcification and fragmentation of elastic fibres of the skin, cardiovascular system and eye, caused by mutations of the ABCC6 gene, which encodes the membrane transporter MRP6. The pathogenesis of the lesions is unknown. Based on studies of similar clinical and histopathological damage present in haemolytic disorders, our working hypothesis is that PXE lesions may result from chronic oxidative stress occurring in PXE cells as a consequence of MRP6 deficiency. Our results show that PXE fibroblasts suffer from mild chronic oxidative stress due to the imbalance between production and degradation of oxidant species. The findings also show that this imbalance results, at least in part, from the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) with overproduction of H2O2. Whether mitochondrial dysfunction is the main factor responsible for the oxidative stress in PXE cells remains to be elucidated. However, mild chronic generalized oxidative stress could explain the great majority of structural and biochemical alterations already reported in PXE.
