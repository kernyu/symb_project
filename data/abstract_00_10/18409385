A collection of bacterial antibiotic resistance strains isolated from arctic permafrost subsoil sediments of various age and genesis was created. The collection included approximately 100 strains of Gram-positive (Firmicutes, Arthrobacter) and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroidetes, gamma-Proteobacteria, and alpha-Proteobacteria) resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamycin, kanamycin, and streptomycin), chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Antibiotic resistance spectra were shown to differ in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Multidrug resistance strains were found for the first time in ancient bacteria. In studies of the molecular nature of determinants for streptomycin resistance, determinants of the two types were detected: strA-strB genes coding for aminoglycoside phosphotransferases and genes aadA encoding aminoglycoside adenylyltransferases. These genes proved to be highly homologous to those of contemporary bacteria.
