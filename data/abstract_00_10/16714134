Salmonella resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) have emerged worldwide since 1988. By 2004, 43 countries had reported this public health problem. Resistance was mediated by classical extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases, and recently a class A carbapenemase. Of these, CMY-2 is the most widely disseminated enzyme. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and S. enterica serotype Enteritidis are the most common serovars associated with ESC resistance in human infections. Many outbreaks in humans have been reported, most often among children and neonates. ESC-resistant Salmonella is frequently recovered from animals and food, with poultry as primary food source, suggesting that humans are often infected by these routes.
