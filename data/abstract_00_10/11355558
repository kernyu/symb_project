Sixteen isolates obtained, in January 1998-December 1999, from splenic aspirates from sodium stibogluconate-resistant cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL; Indian kala-azar) and drawn from different districts of Bihar (India) were identified as Leishmania donovani. By isoenzyme analysis, all the strains were found identical to the WHO reference strain L. donovani MON-2 and differed from L. tropica MON-5. This study suggested that resistant cases of VL in Bihar were caused by L. donovani and not by L. tropica. No new strain responsible for drug unresponsiveness emerged during this period and other cause or causes of emergence of drug resistance should be sought. All the patients were cured with amphotericin B.
