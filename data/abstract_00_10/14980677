The synthesis and in vitro potency of DNA minor-groove binding antibacterials lacking the C-terminal amide bond are described. The crescent shaped molecules bear the positively charged amino group at an internal pyrrole unit instead of the C-terminus. Three structural parameters were investigated: the N-terminal unit, the internal amino group, and the C-terminal ring system. Several compounds demonstrated good in vitro potency against various Gram-positive bacteria and some molecules were moderately active against Escherichia coli, a representative Gram-negative strain.
