The addition of CaBr(2) to the fermentation of a marine-derived Fusarium tricinctum resulted in production of halogenated chlamydosporol analogues. Two new antimicrobial halogenated pyranopyranones, bromomethylchlamydosporols A (1) and B (2), and two known compounds, chlamydosporol (an inseparable epimeric mixture of 7R:7S = 1:1 from (1)H NMR data) (3) and fusarielin A (4), were isolated from the culture. The structures of 1 and 2 were assigned through a combination of spectroscopic data analyses. Compounds 1-4 exhibited mild antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and multidrug-resistant S. aureus. The MIC values of each strain were as follows: compounds 1 and 2 showed an MIC of 15.6 mug/mL against S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and multidrug-resistant S. aureus, and compounds 3 and 4 exhibited an MIC of 31.5 mug/mL against S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 62.5 mug/mL against multidrug-resistant S. aureus.
