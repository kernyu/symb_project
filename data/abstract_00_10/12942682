Structured treatment interruptions (STIs) are a new strategy under investigation in clinical trials involving a number of different HIV-infected populations. These populations include patients with prolonged HIV RNA suppression who were treated in either seroconversion or later in disease, and patients with virologic failure despite HAART, prior to the initiation of a salvage regimen. The goals of STI vary in each of these groups. Until the results of clinical trials are available, the use of STIs must be considered experimental. There are a number of potential risks, including the loss of a significant number of CD4 cells with the development of opportunistic infections, rebound of HIV RNA, emergence of drug resistance, and reseeding of viral reservoirs. However, STIs also hold the promise for decreasing antiretroviral drug burden and toxicity, and improving quality of life. Given that much of the world's population infected with HIV does not have access to continuous HAART, the development of strategies that could decrease overall drug burden and cost is important. This paper provides an update of the recently published and presented studies on the use of STIs in various populations of HIV-infected patients. In particular, it discusses what is known and unknown about the relative risks and benefits of this approach, and what studies are ongoing. Lastly, it identifies how the use of STIs could decrease drug burden and toxicity in patients receiving therapy.
