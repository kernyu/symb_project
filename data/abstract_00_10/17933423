We report the identification and control of an outbreak of a ciprofloxacin-susceptible strain of UK epidemic meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA)-15 on a neonatal unit (NNU). All babies were screened for MRSA on admission using ciprofloxacin-containing media which did not detect the outbreak strain. The first identified case was a premature baby who developed MRSA bacteraemia with associated tibial osteomyelitis and multiple subcutaneous abscesses. The outbreak strain was subsequently identified in the nasopharyngeal secretions of a second child who was not clinically infected. Screening of all patients on the NNU using non-ciprofloxacin-media identified two other colonised babies. All four patient isolates were EMRSA-15, spa type t022, SCCmec IV, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) negative, indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and susceptible to all non-beta-lactam antimicrobials tested. The outbreak strain was cultured from four of 48 environmental sites in a communal milk-expressing room. Unsupervised movement of mothers to and from the milk-expressing room may have contributed to the outbreak. Control measures included cohort isolation of affected babies, improved environmental cleaning, increased emphasis on hand hygiene and education of mothers. Ciprofloxacin-containing media should be used with caution for MRSA screening in settings where ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains (including community-associated MRSA) are increasing in prevalence.
