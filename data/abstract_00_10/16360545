Standard first-line treatment of ovarian cancer (OC) consists of platinum-taxane combined chemotherapy. However, this regimen only cures about 25% of women with OC. Phase II studies have shown that platinum-gemcitabine doublet and platinum-taxane-gemcitabine triplet regimens are active first-line chemotherapy in advanced OC, with overall response rates (ORR) above 55%. Several phase III studies of gemcitabine-based doublet and triplet chemotherapy in OC are currently underway. Preliminary data show that these regimens are well-tolerated, with manageable haematological toxicity, and the efficacy results are eagerly awaited. Gemcitabine is also active as second-line monotherapy in women with recurrent OC, and studies combining gemcitabine with paclitaxel, docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan resulted in higher ORR than gemcitabine alone. Gemcitabine-cisplatin and gemcitabine-carboplatin are active in women with platinum-resistant recurrent OC suggesting in vivo synergy between these two classes of drug. These studies show that gemcitabine-based chemotherapy may have an important role as second-line treatment in women with platinum-resistant OC. Gemcitabine combinations are also highly recommended as they avoid the problems of neurotoxicity and alopecia seen with other regimens. In order to respect the quality of life of women with recurrent OC, assessment of prognostic factors is recommended so that the most appropriate chemotherapy can be administered.
