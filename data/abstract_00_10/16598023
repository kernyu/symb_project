We examined cloacal samples from poultry raised on nonintensive production farms in Brazil for the presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. No VanA- or VanB-containing enterococci were identified in a total of 200 cloacal swabs. The most prevalent species were Enterococcus gallinarum (vanC1; 13.0%) and E. casseliflavus (vanC2/3; 5.5%).
