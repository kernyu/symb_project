More than 40% of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated in hospitals are methicillin-resistant, thus posing daily problems regarding therapy. The treatment of these infections is principally based on glycopeptides. The need or not to combine them, first-line or second-line, with another antibiotic, remains a subject for debate. In this article, we have endeavoured to demonstrate the validity of arguments which plead in favour of using glycopeptides in combination, and not as single-drug therapy.
