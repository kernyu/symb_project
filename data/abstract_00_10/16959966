From a genetic standpoint, Streptomyces rimosus is arguably the best-characterized industrial streptomycete as the producer of oxytetracycline and other tetracycline antibiotics. Although resistance to these antibiotics has reduced their clinical use in recent years, tetracyclines have an increasing role in the treatment of emerging infections and noninfective diseases. Procedures for in vivo and in vitro genetic manipulations in S. rimosus have been developed since the 1950s and applied to study the genetic instability of S. rimosus strains and for the molecular cloning and characterization of genes involved in oxytetracycline biosynthesis. Recent advances in the methodology of genome sequencing bring the realistic prospect of obtaining the genome sequence of S. rimosus in the near term.
