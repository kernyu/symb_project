In addition to momilactone, phytocassanes A through E (diterpene phytoalexins) were detected in rice leaves in fields suffering from rice blast. Furthermore, phytocassane accumulation was most abundant at the edges of necrotic lesions, indicating that the phytoalexins prevent subsequent spread of the fungus from the infected site. In pot experiments the pattern of phytocassane accumulation in rice leaves in an incompatible interaction (infection with an avirulent race of Magnaporthe grisea) was more rapidly induced than in a compatible interaction (infection with a virulent race of M. grisea).
