The susceptibility to 14 beta-lactam and non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was evaluated for Streptococcus pneumoniae from patients with community-acquired respiratory infections in a Mexican medical center. Three hundred fifteen pneumococcal isolates obtained from patients between 1995 and 2001 were tested by the broth microdilution test. Fifty-two percent of the isolates were nonsusceptible to penicillin (minimal inhibitory concentration, >0.06 microg/mL). Penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates were more likely to exhibit resistance to cephalosporins, macrolides, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline when compared to penicillin-susceptible isolates. Ninety-three percent of the penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates were resistant to at least one other class of antimicrobials, in contrast to only 47% of the penicillin-susceptible strains (p < 0.0001). More than 90% of the tested isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and gatifloxacin. Reduced susceptibility to penicillin was considered to be a reliable marker for the higher probability of multidrug resistance, thus requiring in vitro tests to guide chemotherapy or the choices of parenteral extended spectrum cephalosporins or newer respiratory quinolones.
