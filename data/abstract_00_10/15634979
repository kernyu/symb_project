The growing number of fungal infections, coupled with emerging resistance to classical antifungal agents, has led to the development of new agents, among them voriconazole. Susceptibility to voriconazole was tested by two microdilution techniques: the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference method M38-A and a colorimetric method, Sensititre YeastOne. The study tested a total of 244 isolates: 223 Aspergillus (136 Aspergillus fumigatus, 37 A. niger, 26 A. terreus, 16 A. flavus, 7 A. nidulans, and 1 A. ustus), 14 Fusarium (8 Fusarium moniliformis, and 6 F. oxysporum), 6 Scedosporium apiospermum, and 1 Rhizomucor pusillus strain and four control strains (Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019, C. krusei ATCC 6258, A. fumigatus ATCC 204305, and A. flavus ATCC 204304). For all tested species except one F. moniliforme strain and R. pusillus, the MIC, the MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)), and MIC(90) ranges of </=1 microg/ml were obtained for voriconazole, indicating excellent activity against these species. The high rate of agreement between the two methods used (97 to 99%) suggests that the Sensititre YeastOne colorimetric method may be a valuable tool for determining the susceptibility of filamentous fungi to voriconazole.
