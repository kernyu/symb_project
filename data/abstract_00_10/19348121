Eight different newly synthesised aldehyde Schiff base N-aryl thiosemicarbazones, differing in R, R' groups, are tested on 25 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a standard strain. Antibacterial activity was carried out by a well-diffusion method in concentrations of 15-500 microg/well. Compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 showed good inhibition of MRSA. Increasing concentration of the test compounds enlarged the inhibition zone. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was carried out using a dilution susceptibility test in concentrations of 4-512 microg/mL of the medium. The lowest MIC value (16 microg/mL) was produced by compound 4.
