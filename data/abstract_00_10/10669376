The relationship between enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and travelers' diarrhea was examined in a high-risk area in 1992-1997. Toxin patterns, colonization-factor antigens (CFAs), and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility were determined. In total, 928 US students with diarrhea acquired in Guadalajara, Mexico, were screened for enteric pathogens. Diagnosis of ETEC infection was done with oligonucleotide probes. ETEC was isolated in 19.9% of the travelers with diarrhea. CFAs were identified in 51% of the ETEC strains. The highest CFA frequency was observed among heat-stable isolates. Ampicillin, furazolidone, and sulfisoxazole resistance of ETEC increased during the study period. ETEC isolation rates and CFA patterns varied little during the 6 years of the study, which has implications for immunoprophylactic strategies. The finding that differences in the results of ribotyping and plasmid analysis change over time suggests that multiple strains of ETEC were responsible for the illness in the region studied.
