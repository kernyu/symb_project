Malaria prevention has benefited from many diverse disciplines of research, including epidemiologic monitoring, development of laboratory techniques, assessment of insect repellents, or pharmaceutical innovations. Strategies in all these sectors have been explored in recent years, resulting in improved options to prevent travelers' malaria. The addition of atovaquone-proguanil for malaria chemoprophylaxis and the recommendation of primaquine as primary prophylaxis have been significant advances. Tafenoquine seems promising. Standby treatment recommendations have been refined. Many areas still need better strategies. Problematic areas include chemoprophylaxis for long-term travelers, expatriates, and pregnant women; optimal criteria for terminal prophylaxis; and the prevention of malaria in populations that are least likely to seek pretravel evaluations, such as those visiting friends and relatives in their home countries (VFRs). Finally, research in travel and tropical medicine should continue to focus on additional strategies to confront the ever-widening challenge of drug-resistant malaria.
