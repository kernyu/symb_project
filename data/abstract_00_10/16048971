In mice, vancomycin and linezolid treatment disrupted the anaerobic intestinal microflora, based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, and promoted colonization by Klebsiella pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. However, the effects varied depending on dose and duration of treatment. Daptomycin treatment did not disrupt the anaerobic microflora or promote either pathogen.
