Globally, antibiotic resistance continues to be an increasing problem. The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae has seriously reduced the number of empirical agents suitable for selected indications. Increasing Gram-negative resistance has also negatively impacted the physician's alternatives when choosing adequate initial therapy; increased reliance on the carbapenem class as empirical agents has led to the emergence of multidrug resistance in non-enteric Gram-negative bacilli. There is a critical need for new, broad-spectrum alternatives to the currently available broad-spectrum agents.
