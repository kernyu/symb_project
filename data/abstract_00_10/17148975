We studied a case of recent infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV-1. Over 16 months off-therapy, the CD4 cell count decreased from 419 to 184 cells/mul. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) then led to an incomplete virological response but to an immunological benefit, concurrently with a shift to CCR5-only tropism and a reduction in replication capacity. ART, even if suboptimal, can be of interest in the case of MDR virus infection.
