The new ketolide telithromycin has potent in vitro activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. The aim of the present study was to define the pharmacodynamic profile of telithromycin against S. pneumoniae strains with various resistance profiles in an in vivo system. Ten S. pneumoniae strains were studied; seven exhibited penicillin resistance, six demonstrated macrolide resistance, and two exhibited gatifloxacin resistance. The telithromycin MICs for all isolates were < or =0.5 microg/ml. Using the murine thigh infection model, CD-1/ICR mice were rendered neutropenic and were then inoculated with 10(5) to 10(6) CFU of S. pneumoniae per thigh. Telithromycin was administered orally at doses ranging from 25 to 800 mg/kg of body weight/day, with the doses administered one, two, three, or four times a day. The activity of telithromycin was assessed by determination of the change in the bacterial density in thigh tissue after 24 h of treatment for each treatment group and the untreated controls. Pharmacokinetic studies of telithromycin were conducted in infected, neutropenic animals. The levels of protein binding by telithromycin in mice ranged from 70 to 95% over the observed range of pharmacokinetic concentrations. By using either the total or the free concentrations of telithromycin, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC ratio was a strong determinant of the response against S. pneumoniae, regardless of the phenotypic resistance profile. The maximal efficacy (the 95% effective dose) against this cohort of S. pneumoniae strains and bacterial inhibition (stasis) of telithromycin were predicted by ratios of the AUC for the free drug concentration/MIC of approximately 1,000 and 200, respectively.
