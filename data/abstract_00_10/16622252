We investigated the influence of the macrophage iron exporter ferroportin and its ligand hepcidin on intracellular Salmonella growth. Elevated ferroportin expression inhibited bacterial multiplication; hepcidin-induced ferroportin down-regulation enhanced it. Expression analysis of iron-responsive Salmonella genes indicated ferroportin-mediated iron deprivation. These results demonstrate a role for ferroportin in antimicrobial resistance.
