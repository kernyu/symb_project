BACKGROUND: This study analyzes the biochemical, serological, and virological efficacy and the safety of adefovir dipivoxil in patients with renal disturbances. METHODS: Twelve patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection were treated for a median time of 15 (3-19) months. The daily dosage was 10 mg initially and then adjusted according to renal function. RESULTS: Median (range) ALT values remained stable: 55 (13-117) and 37 (17-266) UI/L. After the 12th month, the median decline in serum HBV DNA was from 8.76 (6.3-9.7) to 2.97 (1.15-5.65) log10 Eq/ml (median decline of -5.5 log10). No virologic breakthrough was observed. One of the six HBeAg-positive patients lost HBe Ag but without HBe seroconversion; none had HBs Ag loss. There were no significant clinical and biochemical adverse effects. In the 11 nonhemodialysed patients, the creatinine clearance significantly improved from 70 (30-100) to 88 (38-125) ml/mn (P=0.01) and the mean serum creatinine levels increased only slightly from 114 (91-839) to 130 (81-561) micromol/ml (NS). Serum phosphorus remained stable. The urinary level of protein decreased from 0.16 (0.08-8.63) to 0.12 (0.01-0.74) g/day (NS). CONCLUSIONS: Adefovir dipivoxil is safe for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with varying degrees of renal dysfunction and lamivudine-resistant HBV and results in biochemical and virological efficacy similar to that reported in the general population.
