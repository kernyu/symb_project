The development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria has become a global problem. Isolates of Salmonella and Escherichia coli recovered from shell egg samples, collected at 3 commercial plants, were analyzed for resistance to 16 antimicrobial agents (n=990). Eggs were sampled by rinsing in a saline solution. Pooled samples were preenriched in buffered peptone water and then selectively isolated using standard broths and agars. Salmonella-positive isolates were serogrouped immunologically before being serotyped. Enterobacteriaceae were enumerated from individual samples using violet red bile glucose agar plates. Escherichia coli were identified biochemically from presumptive Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Salmonella and generic E. coli antimicrobial-susceptibility testing was conducted using a semiautomated broth microdilution system. More resistance was observed in the Salmonella isolates (n=41) than in the E. coli isolates (n=194). Salmonella Typhimurium was the most prevalent (69.0%) serotype and demonstrated the greatest multiple resistance. Salmonella Kentucky, the least prevalent (5.0%) serotype recovered, was the most susceptible. Although 34.1% of the Salmonella serotypes were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents, 60.1% were resistant to 11 or more compounds. Many Salmonella isolates exhibited resistance to tetracycline (63.4%), nalidixic acid (63.4%), and streptomycin (61.0%). Most E. coli isolates (73.2%) were susceptible to all antimicrobial drugs. Many E. coli isolates exhibited resistance to tetracycline (29.9%), streptomycin (6.2%), and gentamicin (3.1%). Only 1% of the E. coli isolates were resistant to 4 antimicrobial agents. These data indicate that shell eggs can harbor resistant foodborne and commensal bacteria; among Salmonella isolates, resistance was serotype-dependent.
