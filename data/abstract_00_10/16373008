Resistance to medication, adverse effects in the medium-long term, and cost are important limitations to lifelong adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The combination of HAART with immune therapy to restore and/or boost immune-specific responses to HIV has been proposed, with the ultimate aim of controlling viral replication in the absence of HAART over long periods. The functional defects of the cellular and humoral responses would explain the lack of control of the immune system over viral replication. Different types of immune-mediated therapy have been investigated to solve these problems, including passive immune therapy, cytokines, structured treatment interruptions, immunosuppressors and therapeutic vaccines. Our still limited knowledge of immune mechanisms which can control HIV viral replication and of the causes of the deterioration of cellular and humoral immunity have produced only modest benefits in immune-mediated therapy, and are therefore confined to research for the time being. The availability of an optimal therapeutic vaccine would be an important scientific advance which could be compared with the arrival of protease inhibitors in clinical practice. Therefore, priority should be given to research in this field.
