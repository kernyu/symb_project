Antibiotic consumption has increased by around 50% in Danish hospitals over the last 7 years. In percentages, the highest increase has been among broad spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins, crabapenems and fluoroquinolones. The consequence of this is selection of resistant bacteria and fungi. Control of antibiotic resistance requires implementation of different strategies: better and more rapid diagnosis of infectious origin, restriction on antibiotic use, e.g. through re-evaluation every 2-3 days of patients receiving antibiotics, optimization of dosing and duration of treatment, preferred use of narrow spectrum antibiotics and optimization of hospital hygiene.
