OBJECTIVE: To develop and investigate GLL-37, a substitution analogue of the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 with anti-enzymatic degradation activity and improved efficacy. METHODS: The bactericidal activities of LL-37 and newly developed GLL-37 against 6 Gram-negative and -positive bacteria were determined by Broth microdilution assays. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 and GLL-37 against E.coli ATCC 25922 in different NaCl concentration medium were also detected. Both peptides were co-incubated with elastase, and then analyzed by PAGE electrophoresis and bactericidal activity determination. RESULT: GLL-37 showed a stronger elastase resistance ability than LL-37, and was significantly more effective than LL-37 under high-salt condition. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial peptide GLL-37 derived form LL-37 has the potential as a new therapeutic agent for bacterial infections.
