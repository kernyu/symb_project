An aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme in arbekacin-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), exhibiting 4'''-N-acetylation, was examined. Although the MRSA strain with AAC(4''') had no AAC(6')-APH(2") activity, a DNA fragment of the AAC(6')-APH(2") gene was amplified by PCR and the purified N-terminal 30-amino acid sequence of this AAC(4''') was identical to AAC(6')-APH(2"). Direct DNA sequencing of this 'silent' AAC(6')-APH(2") gene revealed a single point mutation leading to a substitution of Gly for Asp80, through which the secondary structure is affected. A change in protein conformation could lead to a cleavage and a change of the enzymatic activity. We propose a new aminoglycoside-resistance mediated by AAC(4''') is caused by a mutation-modified AAC(6')-APH(2").
