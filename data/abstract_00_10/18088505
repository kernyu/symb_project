Moxifloxacin is a novel antibacterial agent that undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver to the glucuronide M1 and the sulfate M2, which are eliminated via the bile. To investigate the role of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp2) as the hepatic transport system for moxifloxacin and its conjugates, livers of Wistar and Mrp2-deficient TR- rats were perfused with moxifloxacin (10 microM) in a single-pass system. Values for the hepatic extraction ratio (E) and clearance (Cl) were insignificantly higher in TR- rats than Wistar rats (0.193+/-0.050 vs 0.245+/-0.050 for E; 6.85+/-1.96 vs 8.73+/-1.82 mL min(-1) for Cl), whereas biliary excretion and efflux into perfusate over 60 min were significantly lower in the mutant rat strain. Cumulative biliary excretion of M1, M2 and moxifloxacin was significantly reduced to 0.027%, 19.1%, and 29.6% in the TR- rats compared with Wistar rats, indicating that the biliary elimination of M1 is mediated exclusively by Mrp2, whereas that of M2 and moxifloxacin seems to depend mostly on Mrp2 and, to a smaller extent, a further unidentified canalicular transporter. Moxifloxacin stimulates bile flow by up to 11% in Wistar rats, but not in TR- rats, further supporting an efficient transport of this drug and its glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites by Mrp2. Moxifloxacin (10 microM) also reversibly inhibited the Mrp2-mediated biliary elimination of bromsulphthalein in Wistar rats by 34%, indicating competition with the elimination of Mrp2-specific substrates. In conclusion, we found that Mrp2 mediates the biliary elimination of moxifloxacin and its glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites in rats. MRP2 may therefore play a key role in the transport of moxifloxacin and its conjugates into bile in humans.
