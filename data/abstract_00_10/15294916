Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is composed of a homopolymer of O-acetylated, alpha1-->6-linked ManNAc 1-phosphate that is distinct from the capsule structures of the other meningococcal disease-causing serogroups, B, C, Y, and W-135. The serogroup A capsule biosynthetic genetic cassette consists of four open reading frames, mynA-D (sacA-D), that are specific to serogroup A, but the functions of these genes have not been well characterized. mynC was found to encode an inner membrane-associated acetyltransferase that is responsible for the O-acetylation of the CPS of serogroup A. The wild-type CPS as revealed by 1H NMR had 60-70% O-acetylated ManNAc residues that contained acetyl groups at O-3, with some species acetylated at O-4 and at both O-3 and O-4. A non-polar mynC mutant generated by introducing an aphA-3 kanamycin resistance cassette produced CPS with no O-acetylation. A serogroup A capsule-specific monoclonal antibody was shown to recognize the wild-type O-acetylated CPS, but not the CPS of the mynC mutant, which lacked O-acetylation. MynC was C-terminally His-tagged and overexpressed in Escherichia coli to obtain the predicted approximately 26-kDa protein. The acetyltransferase activity of purified MynC was demonstrated in vitro using [14C]acetyl-CoA. MynC O-acetylated the O-acetylated CPS of the mynC mutant and further acetylated the wild-type CPS of serogroup A meningococci, but not the CPS of serogroup B or C meningococci. Genetic complementation of the mynC mutant confirmed the function of MynC as the serogroup A CPS O-3 and O-4 acetyltransferase. MynC represents a new subclass of O-acetyltransferases that utilize acetyl-CoA to decorate the D-mannosamine capsule of N. meningitidis serogroup A.
