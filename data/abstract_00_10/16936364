Each year 1.8 million children die due to diarrheal diseases. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics has resulted in increasing resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Moreover the recent outbreaks of shigella and cholera have revealed multi-drug resistance strains. There is a need for review of recommended antibiotics for shigellosis. From recent data it emerges that fluoroquinolones should be the first line of therapy and cephalosporins to be used as the second line. Among the anti-cholera antibiotics, tetracyclines which were the drug of choice for adults, has the advantage of high sensitivity and low cost. Single dose doxycycline would have minimal side effects, hence can be the drug of choice even in children. We should not allow the business pressures to force usage of probiotics and racecadotril as their role in the management of acute diarrhea is yet to be established. Nitazoxanide has high efficacy against Cryptosporodial diarrhea only. Strict adherence to the recommendations for the management of acute childhood diarrhea is needed or else we dilute the effect of standard management.
