BACKGROUND: The NEFA Study was a randomized study comparing nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV) or abacavir (ABC) as substitutes for protease inhibitors in a large group of HIV-1-infected patients successfully treated with antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate genotype and phenotype resistance patterns among patients who have experienced virological failure under one of the three study arms. METHODS: Patients with virological failure, defined as two consecutive determinations of HIV-1 RNA > 200 copies/ml, were analysed for phenotypic susceptibility and HIV-1 mutations. RESULTS: Of the 460 patients included in the study, 51 (11%) experienced virological failure after 24 months of follow-up while on assigned study medication. A higher proportion of patients in the ABC [25 (17%)] than in the NVP [14 (9%)] or EFV [12 (8%)] arms selected resistance to the study drug (P = 0.04). Moreover, a much higher number of resistance mutations to one or more of the backbone nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs contained in the failing regimen were observed in the ABC than in the EFV or NVP arms. In general, there was a good concordance among genotype and phenotype resistance testing, except for ABC, stavudine and didanosine, where phenotypic resistance testing added valuable information (fold change in the median inhibitory concentration). CONCLUSIONS: Cross-resistance involving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs might explain the higher risk of virological failure in patients switched to ABC-containing antiretroviral therapy. Phenotypic resistance testing may be helpful in interpreting unclear genotypic results.
