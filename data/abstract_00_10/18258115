We searched for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants of the Qnr type in several water samples collected at diverse locations from the Seine River (Paris, France). The qnrS2 genes were identified from Aeromonas punctata subsp. punctata and A. media. The qnrS2 gene was located on IncU-type plasmids in both isolates, which resulted in increased MIC values of quinolones and fluoroquinolones, once they were transferred into Escherichia coli. The qnrS2 gene identified in A. punctata was part of novel genetic structure corresponding to a mobile insertion cassette element. This identification of plasmid-mediated qnr genes outside Enterobacteriaceae underlines a possible diffusion of those resistance determinants within gram-negative rods.
