It is generally assumed that unsaturated fatty acids are important biological mediators that may be applied in the treatment of patients suffering from autoimmune disorders, in the modulation of tumorigenic processes or in the induction or inhibition of apoptosis. In this study, mice divided into three groups were fed dietary lipids; olive oil (20% w/w), fish oil (20% w/w) or hydrogenated coconut oil (20% w/w) for four weeks. Then, survival percentage, natural killer (NK) cell activity and lipid peroxidation were measured after murine lymphoma (LSTRA) transplantation. Survival percentage showed a reduced resistance to LSTRA tumor in mice fed fish oil diet and generaly loss of NK cell activity was observed after lymphoma transplantation. Lipid peroxidation from mice fed dietary lipids was measured in the presence of both phospholipase and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. In general, the data contained in this paper point to a detrimental effect caused by dietary lipids in mice transplanted with a lymphoma.
