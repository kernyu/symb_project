The in vitro activities of DA-7867, a novel oxazolidinone, and garenoxacin (BMS-284756) were compared to those of linezolid in 67 susceptible and drug-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. DA-7867 was the most active drug with an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml, compared to the MIC(90)s of 4 microg/ml of garenoxacin and 2 microg/ml of linezolid.
