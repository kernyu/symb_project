The death rate in the United States is higher for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) than the death rate for AIDS. It has also been present for much longer than people realize. It is affecting all groups of individuals, children, and adults alike. Moreover, like AIDS, education is the key in preventing the spread of this disease. Because skin-to-skin contact is the main cause of MRSA transmission, simple good hand washing techniques remain crucial. New classes of antibiotics have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for MRSA, as the challenge becomes continued antibiotic resistance.
