The present study demonstrates that the nasal carriage rate of Staphylococcus aureus was 40% in Jordanian healthy young adult population, and 19% of nasal S. aureus and 57% of clinical isolates over the same period were resistant to oxacillin (MRSA), respectively. The mecA gene was detected in all MRSA isolates in both groups. Most of MRSA isolates were multiresistant to three antibiotic classes (beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides-lincosamides). This result suggests a serious problem may be encountered in treatment of staphylococcal infections in Jordan.
