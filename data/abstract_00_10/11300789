We investigated the effects of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant mutant Y181C on RNA 5'-end-directed RNase H cleavage by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, using an RNA.DNA hybrid in which a radiolabeled RNA 5' end was recessed. Y181C produced a higher ratio of secondary (9 nucleotide long) to primary (18 nucleotide long) products than wild type. When the RNA was 3'-end-labeled, Y181C generated a long product, which results when secondary cleavage precedes the primary. When using an RNA.DNA hybrid in which the labeled RNA 5' end and DNA 3' end were flush, formation of secondary product by both enzymes was inhibited. Under these conditions, Y181C cleaved closer to the RNA 5' end than wild type. Studies with this substrate labeled at the RNA 3' end showed that Y181C is no more likely than wild type to cleave toward the RNA 3' end. Thus, Y181C RT has a strong preference to cleave in the direction of the RNA 5' end even when secondary cleavage is prevented, resulting in a disruption of the normal sequence of primary followed by secondary cleavages.
