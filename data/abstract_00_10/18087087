PURPOSE: To determine the virulence factors produced by Escherichia coli isolated from extraintestinal infections, to study the drug resistance pattern in E. coli with special reference to extended spectrum beta -lactamase (ESBL) and to evaluate screening methods for ESBL. METHODS: A total of 152 isolates of E. coli from various extraintestinal infections were screened for virulence factors such as haemolysin, surface hydrophobicity, serum resistance and protease. All the isolates were also studied for antibiotic susceptibility pattern using modified Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. ESBL production was screened by standard disk diffusion method and confirmed using phenotypic confirmatory method. RESULTS: Among 152 isolates, 36 (23.7%) were haemolytic, 42 (27.6%) were hydrophobic, 132 (86.8%) were serum resistant and only four were positive for protease. Multiple virulence factor were observed in 67 (44%) of isolates. Seventy-nine (51.4%) isolates produced ESBL. ESBL producing isolates showed multidrug resistance. There was a significant association ( P E. coli . CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows the expression of virulence factors and multidrug resistance in E. coli isolated from various extraintestinal infections. The study also shows that appropriate methods of detecting drug resistance and ESBL production are required for the judicious use of antibiotics in managing these infections.
