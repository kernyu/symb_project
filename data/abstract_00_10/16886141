We conducted a survey in 2005 of infectious diseases consultants and asked about persistent bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Many consultants perceived an increase in the frequency of illness, and, when presented with vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations approaching the limit of the susceptible range, most consultants indicated that they would switch to newer antimicrobial agents for treatment.
