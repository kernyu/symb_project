OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of a novel antimicrobial compound, AQ+, against a genetically heterogeneous collection comprising 213 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from global sources. AQ+ is an aqueous preparation containing 0.5% 8-hydroxyquinoline. METHODS: MICs were found for all the isolates tested using the BSAC microdilution method. Time-kill studies were performed according to NCCLS guidelines. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to view the ultrastructural effects of AQ+. RESULTS: AQ+ was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of all isolates with a median MIC of 0.25% at a pH optimum of 9.2. Lowering the pH to 7.5 gave an approximately 4-fold reduction in efficacy and at pH 5.5 there was an approximately 8-fold reduction in efficacy. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus were shown to be as equally susceptible to AQ+ as methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Time-kill curves for AQ+ were similar to those for gentamicin. TEM showed that AQ+ actively disrupts the cell wall of S. aureus leading to cell lysis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AQ+ has strong antimicrobial activity and may be useful in preparations to reduce nasal and skin carriage of MRSA.
