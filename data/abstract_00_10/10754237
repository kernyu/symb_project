We found that extract from petals of Rosa canina L. (rose red) strikingly reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of beta-lactams in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We isolated two compounds that reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations of beta-lactams from the extract, tellimagrandin I and rugosin B. Tellimagrandin I was very effective regarding the reduction of the minimum inhibitory concentration, and rugosin B showed some effect. Tellimagrandin I showed a weak bactericidal action when added together with oxacillin. Judging from the fractional inhibitory concentration index, the effect of tellimagrandin I and oxacillin was synergistic. Tellimagrandin I also significantly reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of tetracycline in some strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
