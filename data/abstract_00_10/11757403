The activity of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, oleandomycin, roxithromycin, spiramycin and josamycin against 21 and 34 B. pertussis strains and against 6 and 8 B. parapertussis strains isolated respectively in the years 1968 and 1997-99 was examined. The antibiotic agar dilution method was used. The minimum concentration of macrolides which inhibited growth of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis was calculated for 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of isolates. The susceptibility to macrolides of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis strains isolated in the years 1968 and 1997-99 did not differ significantly. The MIC90 values of erythromycin were the same for B. pertussis (MIC90 = 0.125 mg/l) and B. parapertussis strains (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l) recovered in 1968 as for those recovered in the years 1997-99. The most active antibiotic against all strains was azithromycin (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/l). The least active antibiotics were oleandomycin (MIC90 = 2-4 mg/l) and spiramycin (MIC90 = 8 mg/l). The study showed that erythromycin remains the antibiotic of choice for treatment of whooping cough and in case of emergence of B. pertussis and/or B. parapertussis strains erythromycin resistant, can be replaced by azithromycin.
