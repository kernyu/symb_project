Modified Hodge test and a method using a disk with imipenem plus 1000 mg of EDTA were used to determine the presence of metallo-beta-lactamase producing gram-negative rods among 166 clinical isolates from hospitals in Iasi and Galati. Of 9 imipenem resistant strains found, only one Pseudomonas aeruginosa gave positive results with both tests and other two P. aeruginosa clinical isolates gave negative results with both tests. The rest of the strains (2 P. aeruginosa, 2 Acinetobacter baumanii, 1 Sphingomonas paucimobilis) did not give conclusive results. These screening methods are useful, simple and accessible to clinical laboratories. PCR is needed to confirm the presence of metallo-beta-lactamase gene in bacteria and to determine the type of the enzymes.
