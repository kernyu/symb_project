The activity of amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole and voriconazole was tested in vitro against 618 clinical Candida spp. isolates, using the broth microdilution or the disk diffusion method (voriconazole). Amphotericin B and voriconazole were the most potent antifungal agents assayed (100% of susceptible strains). Resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was detected in three (0.7%) and 11 (2.7%) isolates of Candida albicans and in four (3.7%) isolates of Candida glabrata. Flucytosine intermediate, resistant strains, or both, were observed in C. albicans (0.3% and 0.7%), C. glabrata (2.8% intermediate) and C. tropicalis (15.2% and 15.2%). C. krusei was the least susceptible species to azoles. No statistically significant differences in the rates of resistant isolates depending on site of infection and age of the patient were observed, with the exception of C. albicans and itraconazole (higher percentage of resistance in children). At present, acquired antifungal resistance represents an uncommon finding in most Candida spp. circulating in Northern Italy.
