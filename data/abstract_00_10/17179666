The growth of a virulent strain of fixed rabies virus, Nishigahara, in mouse neuroblastoma NA cells treated with type I interferon (IFN) was compared with that of a derivative avirulent strain, Ni-CE. Nishigahara strain was slightly sensitive to IFN treatment but still grew more efficiently than did Ni-CE strain in IFN-treated NA cells. Furthermore, a virulent chimeric virus with the phosphoprotein gene from Nishigahara strain in the Ni-CE genome was less sensitive to IFN treatment than was Ni-CE strain, indicating that the IFN sensitivity is determined by the phosphoprotein gene of the virus.
