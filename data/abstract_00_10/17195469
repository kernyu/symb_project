Systems biology offers the potential for more effective selection of novel targets for anti-infective drugs. In contrast to conventional reductionist biology, a systems approach allows targets to be viewed in a wider context of the entire physiology of the cell, with the potential to identify key susceptible nodes and to predict synergistic effects of blocking multiple pathways. In addition to the holistic perspective provided by systems biology, the emphasis on quantitative analysis is likely to add further rigour to the process of target selection. Systems biology also offers the potential to incorporate different levels of information into the selection process. Consideration of data from microbial population biology may be important in the context of predicting future drug-resistance profiles associated with targeting a particular pathway, for example. This chapter provides an overview of major themes in the developing field of systems biology, summarising the core technologies and the strategies used to translate datasets into useful quantitative models capable of predicting complex biological behaviour.
