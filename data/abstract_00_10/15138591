Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme maintaining the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes, is up-regulated in the vast majority of human neoplasias but not in normal somatic tissues. Therefore, the telomerase complex represents a promising universal therapeutic target in cancer. Telomeric G-rich single-stranded DNA can adopt in vitro an intramolecular quadruplex structure, which has been shown to inhibit telomerase activity. We examined G-quadruplex interactive agent, telomestatin (SOT-095), for its ability to inhibit the proliferation of human leukemia cells, including freshly obtained leukemia cells. Telomere length was determined by either the terminal restriction fragment method or flow-FISH, and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Moreover, chemosensitivity was examined in telomestatin-treated U937 cells before ultimate telomere shortening. Treatment with telomestatin reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in U937 and NB4 cells followed by telomere shortening. Enhanced chemosensitivity toward daunorubicin and cytosine-arabinoside was observed in telomestatin-treated U937 cells, before ultimate telomere shortening. Telomere shortening associated with apoptosis by telomestatin was evident in some freshly obtained leukemia cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients, regardless of sub-types of AML and post-myelodysplasia AML. These results suggest that disruption of telomere maintenance by telomestatin limits the cellular lifespan of AML cells, as well. However, in a minority of AML patients apoptosis was not evident, thus indicating that resistant mechanism might exist in some freshly obtained AML cells. Therefore, further investigation of telomestatin as a therapeutic agent is warranted.
