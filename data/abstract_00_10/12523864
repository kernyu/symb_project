New high-molecular-weight hydrophobic/hydrophilic segmented copolymers of poly(ester ether carbonate) structure, containing poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) segments in their main chain, were synthesized and characterized. These copolymers were obtained by a two-step chain-extension reaction carried out in the presence of alpha,omega-dihydroxy-oligoPCL of molecular weight 1250 and PEG samples of molecular weight 150, 400, 600, 1000, and 2000. The molecular structures of all synthesized materials were characterized by means of (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectroscopy, their molecular weights were determined by means of size exclusion chromatography, and their thermal properties were obtained by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The poly(ester ether carbonate)s of this study are partly or totally miscible at least up to 50 wt % with poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and could be used to produce flexible PVC formulations. The miscibility between PVC and the poly(ester ether carbonate)s reported in this paper was investigated by means of DSC and DMA analysis. PVC blends were also analyzed by determining their swellability and the amount of extractables in aqueous media. By comparison purposes, the chain-extension product of PCL1250, that is, PCL polycarbonate, was also synthesized and characterized. The results obtained demonstrated that the copolymers with shortest PEG segment length, i.e. PEG150, 400, and 600, give the best results in terms of miscibility with PVC and lead to blends with maximum resistance to extraction by water. Therefore, they represent, in principle, good substitutes for low-molecular-weight, leachable PVC plasticizers, such as di(ethylhexyl) phthalate.
