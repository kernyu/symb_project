Discitis is a recognized and serious complication of healthcare. We describe the cases of 4 patients, who presented to our unit over a 1 year period. All had exposure to healthcare before the onset of discitis and developed complex infections. There were no additional risk factors for discitis in any of the cases. The risk factors for discitis were peripheral intravenous cannulation in 1 case, intraabdominal surgery in 2 cases and multiple risks including intensive care admission and urethral catheterization in another case. The described cases demonstrate the importance of ascertaining a definitive microbiological diagnosis in healthcare associated discitis and the complex and expensive antibiotic regimens that may be required for the management of such cases. Clinicians should be aware when seeing patients with back pain and recent health care exposure that discitis can be present and complicated and that resistant organisms can be the cause.
