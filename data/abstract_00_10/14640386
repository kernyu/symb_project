OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of modest (< 10-fold) decreases in baseline non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) susceptibility and their impact on virological response to NNRTI-containing triple therapy in drug-naive individuals. METHODS: Baseline HIV resistance phenotype, genotype and response to therapy were examined retrospectively for all antiretroviral-naive individuals initiating therapy with two nucleoside analogues and an NNRTI in British Columbia, Canada, between 05/1997 and 08/1999 (n = 279), followed until July 31 2001. Time to viral suppression (first of at least two consecutive plasma viral loads < 400 copies HIV RNA copies/ml) and viral rebound (to > or = 400 copies/ml after first pVL < 400 copies HIV RNA copies/ml), were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Nevirapine was the most commonly prescribed NNRTI (96%). Four- to 10-fold decreased susceptibility to NNRTIs was observed in > 30% of untreated individuals at baseline, an observation strongly driven by decreased susceptibility to delavirdine (22.4%). A > 10-fold decrease in susceptibility to any NNRTI was observed only rarely (< 2%). There was no association between four- and 10-fold decreased baseline susceptibility to NNRTIs and virological outcome (P > 0.05). In multivariate analyses, the strongest predictors of poor virological response to NNRTI-based therapy were baseline plasma viral load and the proportion of time on therapy in the first year of follow-up. There was no relationship between the presence of previously reported mutations associated with decreased NNRTI susceptibility (at codons 135 and 283 in HIV reverse transcriptase) and virological response. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the clinically significant level of resistance to NNRTIs, particularly nevirapine, in drug-naive individuals is likely greater than four- to 10-fold.
