BACKGROUND: Once-daily combination therapy with emtricitabine, didanosine and efavirenz has been highly effective in clinical trials but its long-term efficacy and safety has not been previously reported. METHODS: This multicentre, single-arm, open-label trial enrolled 40 antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients who received a once-daily regimen of emtricitabine, didanosine and efavirenz. The objective was to assess the long-term effects of this combination on plasma HIV RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell counts, safety and tolerability. RESULTS: After 5 years, 73% and 68% of patients had plasma HIV RNA levels < 400 and < 50 copies/ml, respectively, in an intent-to-treat, missing-equals-failure analysis. Genotypic resistance on treatment emerged in six patients. There was a significant increase in CD4+ T-cell count of 294 x 10(6) cells/l. Only six patients discontinued study treatment, because of non-severe adverse events. Lipodystrophy was infrequent, and lipid and glucose profiles were favourable with a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. CONCLUSION: A convenient once-daily regimen of emtricitabine, didanosine and efavirenz provided durable antiretroviral response and was well tolerated through 5 years of therapy.
