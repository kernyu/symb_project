OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of tanshinone microemulsion (Tan-M) on the cytotoxicity to human leukemia-cell-line (K562/ADM) and the reversion of MDR in vitro. METHOD: Microemulsion being supposed as the control group, MT method is adopted to test cytotoxicity and the reverse of MDR. RESULT: Obvious cytotoxicity to K562/ADM was observed for tan-M. Cell non-toxic dosage (growth quotiety > 95%) of Tan-M is 0.2 microg x mL(-1). Low toxic dosage (growth quotiety 85-90%) was 0.7 microg x mL(-1). Cell non-toxic dosage of was 0.7 microg x mL(-1) and low toxic dosage was 1.2 microg x mL(-1). Cell non-toxic dosage of Tan-M (0.2 microg x mL(-1)) significantly lowered the IC50 of K562/ADM by ADM (P < 0.01), and reversed MDR was 3.88 times. Low toxic dosage of Tan-M reversed MDR was 3.97 times. E-M (0.2 microg x mL(-1)) reversed MDR was 2.62 times. CONCLUSION: The result indicates that tanshinone microemulsion possesses cell-toxic effects on human leukemia cell-line and may reverse MDR of tumor cells.
