Stools from tourists from Europe and North America who acquired diarrhea in Mombasa (Kenya), Goa (India), or Montego Bay (Jamaica) were examined for enteric pathogens. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) was the most common pathogen (25%) identified in the 3 locations. Isolation of Shigella species was more frequent in Goa and Mombasa than in Montego Bay (10%, 9%, and 0.3%, respectively; P <.005). Viruses (rotaviruses and enteric adenoviruses) were found in 9% of travelers to the 3 areas. Of 275 ETEC isolates in this study, 158 (57%) produced a defined colonization factor antigen (CFA). Coli surface 6 (CS6) was the most frequent and was found in 41%-52% of CFA/CS-positive ETEC isolates. The frequency of resistance among bacterial enteropathogens to traditional antimicrobial agents was particularly high throughout the study period in all 3 regions. Quinolones were active against the bacterial enteropathogens in the 3 sites.
