Enterococci from different free-living rodents were isolated and selected. The strains were genotyped and their antibiotic sensitivity and /or resistance, production of lactic acid, urease activity, the presence of enterocin structural genes, plasmid detection, and their binding ability to proteins were determined. Among 24 enterococcal strains, 17 strains were allotted to the species Enterococcus faecalis by tDNA-PCR, 7 strains being not yet identified. Only Enterococcus sp. ES66 possessed the structural genes for the production of enterocins (Ent) A and P. E. faecalis EE61 had the gene for EntL50B. The other isolates were Ent-gene-free. Enterococci were mostly sensitive to antibiotic treatment . The plasmid DNA was detected only in the strain EE97. The average value of lactic acid production reached 896 +/- 90 micromol/L. Most of the strains possessed low ureolytic activity. Enterococci bound very well sub-epithelial proteins, reaching the value of 3 by the particle agglutination assay, especially concerning the heparin, bovine lactoferrin and porcine fibronectin.
