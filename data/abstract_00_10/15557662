In Candida albicans, calcineurin is essential for virulence and survival during membrane perturbation by azoles. Crz1 is a proposed downstream target of calcineurin based on studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the in vitro phenotypes of C. albicans crz1/crz1 and calcineurin mutants differ and Crz1 is not required for virulence.
