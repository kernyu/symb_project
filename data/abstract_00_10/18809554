The molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibilities of 273 Staphylococcus aureus isolates positive for the exfoliative toxin-encoding gene obtained from patients with impetigo in Japan in 2006 were studied. The mecA gene was detected in 74 meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 23 meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates. All isolates with the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec were classified into type IV (92.8%, 90/97) or V (7.2%, 7/97). The ET-encoding gene etb was found primarily in strains with mecA (87.7%, 71/81), whilst eta (86.6%, 161/186) was detected mainly in strains without mecA. The chromosomal enterotoxin-encoding gene cluster egc was found in 83.0% of strains with eta, whilst no enterotoxin-encoding gene was detected in strains with only etb. PFGE showed that each strain carrying eta, etb and etd could be classified into distinct groups. The susceptibility profiles of MRSA to antimicrobial agents excluding beta-lactams were similar to those of MSSA. Gentamicin- and clarithromycin-resistant strains were frequently found for both MRSA and MSSA. The aminoglycoside-resistance gene aacA-aphD was detected in 97.3% of MRSA and 85.4% of MSSA. Additionally, the macrolide-resistance gene ermA or ermC was detected in 67.6% of MRSA and 71.4% of MSSA. Therefore, these results suggest that SCCmec types IV or V have spread, particularly in MSSA carrying etb in the community.
