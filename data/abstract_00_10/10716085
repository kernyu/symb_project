Brevundimonas vesicularis (B. vesicularis) is a pseudomonad rarely encountered in human infection. A case of nosocomial septicaemia with this organism following open-heart surgery is presented, with a review of the literature. The isolate demonstrated resistance to ciprofloxacin and aztreonam, which has not yet been reported. Treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in full recovery. A review of the literature reveals that B. vesicularis is a virulent organism involved in serious infections such as central nervous system infection or bacteraemia, some of which are nosocomial. Meanwhile, empiric therapy for B. vesicularis infection should include a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent until susceptibility results are known.
