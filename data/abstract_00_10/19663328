It has been established that extracellular polysaccharides of Glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), which are produced by Tremella mesenterica Ritz. Fr. (Basidiomycota), has antivirus properties and can induce the resistance to TMV in hypersensitive variety of tobacco. The resistance was blocked in the presence of actinomycin D. This process confirms that resistance has been activated with GXM de novo. GXM takes influence on the early stages of viruses and host plants interaction too, which are irrespective to cells genome activation.
