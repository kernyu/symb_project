Nasopharyngeal carriage of Moraxella catarrhalis is a risk factor for upper respiratory tract infections and otitis media. In this study, we aimed to characterize BRO beta-lactamases of M. catarrhalis strains isolated from 64 children without any symptoms of respiratory disease. Gram negative diplococci grown on selective media and which are catalase, oxidase, DNase, nitrate reduction positive, glucose, maltose, sucrose and lactose fermentation negative, were diagnosed as M. catarrhalis. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution method recommended by NCCLS. BRO beta-lactamases were differentiated by restriction enzyme analysis method. The resistance rate for ampicillin was 18.8% and all the isolates were found to be sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, cefaclor, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. Out of 64 M. catarrhalis isolates, 57 (89%) were found beta-lactamase positive with nitrocefin disk test (Remel, USA). The presence of BRO beta-lactamases in these 57 strains (89%) was also confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis, while 7 (11%) of them were found to be negative. Among the positive strains, 47 (73.4%) were typed as BRO-1, and 10 (15.6%) were typed as BRO-2. The characterization of BRO beta-lactamases of M. catarrhalis strains in carrier children is important since the high rate of carriage predisposes to respiratory tract infections. As a result, BRO beta-lactamase typing will guide the treatment regimen against the respiratory infections that can occur due to M. catarrhalis in carrier children.
