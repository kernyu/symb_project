Bacteria utilise Twin arginine translocation (Tat) to deliver folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Disruption of Tat typically results in pleiotropic effects on e.g. growth, stress resistance, bacterial membrane biogenesis, motility and cell morphology. Further, Tat is coupled to virulence in a range of pathogenic bacteria, including species of Pseudomonas, Legionella, Agrobacterium and Mycobacterium. We have investigated this, for Yersinia, previously unexplored system, and have shown that the Tat pathway is functional and absolutely required for virulence of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. A range of putative Yersinia Tat substrates have been predicted in silico, which together with the Tat system itself may be interesting targets for future development of antimicrobial treatments. Here we present a brief review of bacterial Tat and discuss our results concerning this system in Yersinia.
