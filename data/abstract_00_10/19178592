OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify and characterize hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase gene mutations associated with ongoing HBV replication in HIV/HBV-coinfected individuals receiving tenofovir (TDF). METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study identified 28 HIV/HBV-coinfected individuals who had received TDF for at least 3 months. All patients had samples available while receiving TDF (on-TDF), and 24 also had samples available prior to treatment (pre-TDF). Case records were reviewed to obtain clinical and virological data at the times of sampling (+/-3 months). The HBV DNA of all samples was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the polymerase region of PCR-positive samples was sequenced and compared with reference HBV data. RESULTS: Of the pre-TDF samples, 15 of 24 (63%) were HBV PCR positive. Of the on-TDF samples, four of 28 (14%) were HBV PCR positive (mean time on TDF 13.5 months; range 3-23 months). Lamivudine (3TC)-resistance mutations were detected in three of four (75%) of these viraemic samples. The previously identified putative TDF-resistance mutations, rtA194T+rtL180M+rtM204V, were not detected in any individual. CONCLUSIONS: Unique mutations in the HBV polymerase gene associated with TDF resistance are rare in HIV/HBV coinfection. 3TC-resistance mutations persist and a significant proportion of patients are HBV PCR positive despite the addition of TDF.
