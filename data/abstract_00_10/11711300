In an effort to expand the spectrum of activity of the oxazolidinone class of antibacterial agents to include Gram-negative bacteria, a series of new carbon-carbon linked pyrazolylphenyl analogues has been prepared. The alpha-N-substituted methyl pyrazole (10alpha) in the C3-linked series exhibited very good Gram-positive activity with MICs <or=0.5-1 microg/mL and moderate Gram-negative activity with MICs=2-8 microg/mL against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. This analogue was also found to have potent in vivo activity with an ED(50)=1.9 mg/kg. Beta-substitution at the C3-linked pyrazole generally results in a loss of activity. The C4-linked pyrazoles are slightly more potent than their counterparts in the C3-linked series. Most of the analogues in the C4-linked series exhibited similar levels of activity in vitro, but lower levels of activity in vivo than 10alpha. In addition, incorporation of a thioamide moiety in selected C4-linked pyrazole analogues results in an enhancement of in vitro activity leading to compounds several times more potent than eperezolid, linezolid and vancomycin. The thioamide of the N-cyanomethyl pyrazole analogue (34) exhibited an exceptional in vitro activity with MICs of <or= 0.06-0.25 microg/mL against Gram-positive pathogens and with MICs of 1 microg/mL against fastidious Gram-negative pathogens.
