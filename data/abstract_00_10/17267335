Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) exert a growing clinical and financial burden on healthcare systems and employers. In addition, antimicrobial resistance among pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, has compromised the use of commonly prescribed antimicrobial compounds. Newer fluoroquinolones have been developed to meet these emerging demands. Gemifloxacin is a potent, dual-acting fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC(90)0.03-0.06 microg/ml) including those strains demonstrating resistance to other classes of antibiotics. Gemifloxacin demonstrated excellent clinical success in community-acquired lower respiratory infections, has an acceptable safety profile, and is a cost-effective alternative in the management of LRTIs including those caused by resistant pathogens.
