During the last 10 years, as in other areas of the public sector in Poland, the healthcare system has undergone important changes presenting a challenge for medical staff and healthcare managers alike. Since 1997, the Polish Government has undertaken important healthcare reforms. New regulations have introduced decentralization of management and a financing system for hospitals. These changes have provided favourable conditions in which to implement an infection control system for hospitals. The most important recent initiatives are training courses and workshops for hospital staff organized in co-operation with microbiologists and epidemiologists as well as preparation of recommendations and guidelines for hospitals. Several non-governmental organizations have been set up to improve hospital hygiene, infection control and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance.
