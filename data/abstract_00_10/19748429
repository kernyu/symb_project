We report a case of recurrent Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a patient who failed vancomycin due to a vancomycin-heteroresistant strain lacking methicillin resistance. Although initial isolates were susceptible, isolates obtained after vancomycin chemotherapy were vancomycin heteroresistant. This case thus illustrates the clinical emergence of vancomycin heteroresistance.
