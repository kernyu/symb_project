BACKGROUND: We determined whether coformulated zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir plus tenofovir could maintain immune status in comparison with a genotype-guided salvage regimen in highly pretreated patients. METHOD: This was a randomized pilot control-arm study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained their CD4+ T-cell count at Week 48. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were randomized to the study arm and 10 to the control arm. At 48 weeks, 8 (64%) patients in the study arm and 10 (100%) in the control arm maintained their immune status (p = .09). No new AIDS-defining events occurred. Three patients (27%) in the study arm and 5 (50%) in the control arm achieved an undetectable viral load (p = .39). When a fully suppressive regimen was initiated, 69% of patients in the study arm (9 patients) and 60% (6 patients) in the control arm reached <50 copies at 96 weeks (p = .98). CONCLUSION: Although no statistically significant differences in immunological course were observed between the arms, the control group achieved better results after 48 weeks. This transient therapy could be reserved for specific patients in whom the risk of incomplete adherence or toxicity compromises efficacy while they are awaiting a fully active drug, without jeopardizing viral efficacy when a fully suppressive regimen is initiated.
