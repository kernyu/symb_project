Two hypersensitive and two resistant variants of elongation factor-G (EF-G) toward fusidic acid are studied in comparison with the wild type factor. All mutated proteins are active in a cell-free translation system and ribosome-dependent GTP hydrolysis. The EF-G variants with the Thr-84-->Ala or Asp-109-->Lys mutations bring about a strong resistance of EF-G to the antibiotic, whereas the EF-Gs with substitutions Gly-16-->Val or Glu-119-->Lys are the first examples of fusidic acid-hypersensitive factors. A correlation between fusidic acid resistance of EF-G mutants and their affinity to GTP are revealed in this study, although their interactions with GDP are not changed. Thus, fusidic acid-hypersensitive mutants have the high affinity to an uncleavable GTP analog, but the association of resistant mutants with GTP is decreased. The effects of either fusidic acid-sensitive or resistant mutations can be explained by the conformational changes in the EF-G molecule, which influence its GTP-binding center. The results presented in this paper indicate that fusidic acid-sensitive mutant factors have a conformation favorable for GTP binding and subsequent interaction with the ribosomes.
