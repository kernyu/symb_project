In April 2002, an investigation into an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in goats and sheep in Milae (Afar), Ethiopia was conducted. The investigation involved 4 flocks (722 sheep and 750 goats in total) and comprised the disease history, clinical and post-mortem examination, and microbiological analysis of nasal swabs, lung lesions, and pleural fluid samples. Clinically diseased animals exhibited severe respiratory distress, and necropsy of two of the goats demonstrated fibrinous pneumonia, lung sequestra, and excessive accumulation of straw coloured fluid in the thoracic cavity. Mannheimia haemolytica biotype T was isolated from nine (six goats and three sheep) out of 23 nasal swabs (39.1%). In the two necropsied animals Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae (Mccp) was isolated from the lungs, and Mannheimia haemolytica biotype T was isolated from lung lesions and thoracic fluid. An unidentified Mycoplasma species was isolated from the thoracic fluid of one of the goats. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from a lung sequestrum of one of the necropsied goats. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results indicated that two (33.3%) of the six M. haemolytica isolates that were tested were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin G, three (50%) to tetracycline, four (66.7%) to oxacillin, five (83.3%) to erythromycin, and six (100%) to clindamycin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to all of the different classes of antimicrobials that were tested. Pleuropneumonia caused by Mccp, and secondary complications caused by M. haemolytica and the other unidentified Mycoplasma species, were confirmed as the cause of the outbreak. Morbidity was not associated with the species of animals affected (P > 0.05); however, mortality was significantly higher in goats than sheep (P < 0.05).
