The patterns of antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori were assessed in two different regions in Japan. Overall, prevalences of resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin were 12.4 and 12.9%, respectively. While there was no difference in clarithromycin resistance, the prevalence of metronidazole resistance was significantly higher in Kyoto (23.8%) than in Sapporo (8.1%). From 1996 to 1999, the prevalence of metronidazole resistance did not change but the prevalence of clarithromycin resistance doubled (from 9.1 to 18.7%).
