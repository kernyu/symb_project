Described in the paper are characteristics of B. cepacia clinical strains isolated from patients at Moscow hospitals. The strains were investigated for the presence of proteolytic, chitinolytic, hemolytic and lipase activities as well as for presence of components of the "Quorum sensing" gene activity regulatory system by using biological test-systems and in the polymerase chain reaction with primers to genes cepI and cepR.
