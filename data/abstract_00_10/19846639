An intervention study was conducted to determine whether discontinuing the feeding of milk replacer medicated with oxytetracycline and neomycin to preweaned calves reduced antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli bacteria. Results demonstrated that the intervention did reduce multidrug resistance in these bacteria but that other factors also influenced multidrug resistance.
