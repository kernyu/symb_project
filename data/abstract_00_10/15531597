OBJECTIVES: To study the phenotype and phylogenetic relatedness of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated in Portugal. METHODS: A total of 614 invasive S. pneumoniae strains, isolated in Portugal from 1999 to the first 6 months of 2002, were characterized using serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. National outpatient sale data for macrolides were compared with erythromycin resistance. We investigated the main clonal lineages from erythromycin-resistant strains of serotype 14 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: The emergence of erythromycin-resistant strains correlated well with the usage of azithromycin in Portugal during the period of the study (r=0.900, P=0.001). Serotype 14 made the largest contribution to this emergence. We found two clonal complexes (CC) among erythromycin-resistant strains: CC1 was formed by three sequence types (ST), ST156, ST143 and ST1042, and CC2 by ST15 and ST9. All STs described, except ST1042, are putative founders of clonal groups or subgroups from serotype 14 as defined in the pneumococcal MLST database. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that macrolides usage is an important factor enhancing the spread of invasive erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae clones in Portugal. The study also makes a contribution to the understanding of spread of erythromycin-resistant clones in an international context.
