Two newly isolated virulent coliphages (MVBS and MVSS) showed ability to lyse (form plaque on) a high percentage of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains of various serotypes and origins (292/310; 94.2%), whilst displaying low lytic (plaque-forming) capacity on non-pathogenic ECOR strains (MVBS and MVSS lysed 10/72 (13.9%) and 15/72 (20.8%) strains, respectively). In comparison, a higher percentage (196/310, 63.2%) of tested isolates exhibited resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. It was also observed that, in contrast to antibiotics, phage treatment did not induce Shiga toxin production. These findings suggest that the newly isolated bacteriophages have potential for biocontrol and as therapeutic agents for pathogenic E. coli (EHEC and EPEC) strains.
