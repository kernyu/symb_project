Yersinia ruckeri is a gram-negative pathogen causing enteric redmouth disease in salmonids. Previous studies have reported that Y. ruckeri harbors an ampC gene that is expressed at low level. In this present work, the entire ampC gene of Y. ruckeri was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The AmpC enzyme confers resistance to aminopenicillins and narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, which fit well with the kinetic properties of the purified enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis showed that YRC-1 did not share significant sequence identity with known plasmid-mediated or chromosomal AmpC enzymes. This work provides further evidence that fish-pathogenic gram-negative rod species may constitute a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes.
