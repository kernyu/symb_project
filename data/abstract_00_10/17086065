The evolution of a sexually transmitted multiresistant HIV-1 in a linked transmission chain was followed for 33 months to assess its potential to persist in the absence of treatment. The multiresistant HIV reverted slowly to wild type in reverse transcriptase (positions 44, 67, 74, 118) rendering the virus only susceptible to lamivudine/emtricitabine. Persistence of the replication-competent resistant HIV increases its potential to spread further and strengthens the importance of resistance testing in newly infected patients.
