The oxazolidinone antimicrobial linezolid is effective against gram-positive bacteria. Although maximal recommended therapy is 28 days, treatment durations greater than this are common. Linezolid may cause reversible optic neuropathy and irreversible peripheral neuropathy after months of treatment. Three cases of linezolid-induced optic and peripheral neuropathy are described, and previously reported cases of linezolid-induced optic neuropathy are reviewed. The mechanism of neural toxicity may be impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis.
