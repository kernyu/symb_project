Klebsiella pneumoniae that was resistant to all available antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration of imipenem, 32 microg/mL), including carbapenems, was isolated from blood samples obtained from a 48-year-old patient in the intensive care unit. The patient developed septic shock, which was successfully treated with colistin, the only antibiotic with activity against this multidrug-resistant strain.
