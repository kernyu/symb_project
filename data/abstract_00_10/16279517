The present study was undertaken to assess the results of treatment in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in the Arkhangelsk Region in 1999 and to analyze the results of treatment in relation to the infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis with different profiles of sensitivity to antituberculous drugs. The outcomes of treatment were assessed in relation to the infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis with different profiles of sensitivity to antituberculous drugs in 76 patients to whom the BACTEC test was applied. Beneficial effects of therapy were recorded in 150 (63.9%) of the 235 new cases. In 29 (12.3%) patients, it ended in death, ineffective treatment was recorded in 20 (8.5%) first detected patients; 29 (12.3%) new cases discontinued treatment; the result of therapy was unknown in 7 (3.0%). There was a low efficiency of chemotherapy (26.2%), its inefficiency in 24 (39.4%) patients; treatment was discontinued in 18 (29.5%) cases and its outcome was unknown in 1 (1.6%) patient. Resistance to one antituberculous agent timely used in the effective chemotherapy regimen did not affect the outcome of treatment. The spread of drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis in the Arkhagelsk Region directly affects the outcome of the disease.
