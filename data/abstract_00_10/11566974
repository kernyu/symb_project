Community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the developed world. They cause considerable morbidity, resulting in a major impact on public health both clinically and socioeconomically. The bacterial pathogens most commonly associated with community-acquired RTIs are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, with Streptococcus pyogenes predominating in pharyngitis. Over the past years, each of these pathogens has developed mechanisms to evade susceptibility to antibacterials, leading to an alarming global increase in antibacterial resistance among these pathogens. There is great concern that currently available antibacterials are insufficient to treat community-acquired RTIs and there is an urgent requirement for new agents with activity against all strains of common community-acquired RTI pathogens. Telithromycin (HMR 3647) belongs to a new family of antibacterials, the ketolides, and has been specifically designed for the treatment of community-acquired RTIs. This review covers the potent in vitro activity of telithromycin against the most common community-acquired RTI pathogens compared with other currently available antimicrobial agents.
