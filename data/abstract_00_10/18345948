BACKGROUND: A significant number of treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection develop drug-resistant virus. OBJECTIVE: To define strategies for managing the antiretroviral-experienced patient and summarize current data with commonly used drugs for this population. METHODS: This review incorporated data from most recent antiretroviral treatment guidelines, published papers on related topics, and peer-reviewed publications or presentations at research meetings on the safety and efficacy of agents commonly used in this patient population. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The patient experiencing virologic failure on treatment must be evaluated for their ability to adhere with therapy and to define the number of available active drugs. A viable regimen should include at least two fully active agents, with the goal being to achieve complete virologic suppression.
