Streptococcus pyogenes causes mild infections, such as pharyngitis, and severe infections, such as necrotizing fascitis. In recent years, erythromycin-resistant strains of S. pyogenes have been reported in many countries. In some areas of Italy, increased rates of erythromycin resistance were first observed in the mid-1990s. Here, we report epidemiological T serotyping, invasiveness, erythromycin resistance, and PFGE patterns of 99 S. pyogenes strains isolated at the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology of the Second University of Naples, Italy. Regarding T serotyping, 26 of 99 strains were W+, 16 strains were U+, 16 were X+, and 14 were agglutinated by anti T serum. A low percentage revealed Y+. Twelve strains were not T serotyped. PFGE patterns showed species polymorphism; however, inside the various serotypes, we demonstrated a fair homogeneity. No correlation among invasiveness and T serotype or PFGE pattern has been shown. Twenty-two of 99 strains were erythromycin-resistant.
