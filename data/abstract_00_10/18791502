Community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections are becoming increasingly frequent, and cutaneous disease with this organism is often seen in otherwise healthy organized sports participants. A case of CA-MRSA skin and soft tissue infection in a female collegiate basketball player is presented, and screening and management of her team is discussed. Interestingly, multiple MRSA strains were discovered on testing of the team, raising concern that the prevalence of colonization in this population may be high.
