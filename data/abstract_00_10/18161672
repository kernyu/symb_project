PURPOSE: This in vitro study tested the effectiveness of a novel 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate (TSC) lock solution against the most common pathogens causing hemodialysis catheter-related infections. METHODS: Clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 4), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (n = 8), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and Escherichia coli (n = 4) were tested in duplicate. Bacterial suspensions of each isolate were made in a control solution of normal saline and Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB), and in a lock solution of ethanol 30%, TSC 4% and MHB. Suspensions were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Colony counts were determined from samples collected at t = 0 h (before exposure to the ethanol/TSC lock), t = 1 h (one hour after exposure to the ethanol/TSC lock), t = 24 h and t = 48 h. To confirm the absence of viable organisms in the lock solution, the remaining volume at 48 h was filtered through a 0.45 microm filter. The filter was rinsed with 15 mL sterile water and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA). RESULTS: All controls demonstrated significant growth over 48 h. In the lock solutions, initial inocula were reduced to 0 viable colonies by t = 1 h (6-log kill), and there was no growth at t = 24 and 48 h. Filtering of lock solutions also showed no growth. These results were consistent among duplicates of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The 30% ethanol/4% TSC lock solution consistently eradicated MRSA, MSSA, MRSE, P. aeruginosa and E. coli within 1 h of exposure. Experiments are currently underway to test this novel lock solution on preventing biofilm production by these pathogens.
