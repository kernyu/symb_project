The phospholipid and sterol composition of the plasma membranes of five fluconazole-resistant clinical Candida albicans isolates was compared to that of three fluconazole-sensitive ones. The three azole-sensitive strains tested and four of the five resistant strains did not exhibit any major difference in their phospholipid and sterol composition. The remaining strain (R5) showed a decreased amount of ergosterol and a lower phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylethanolamine ratio in the plasma membrane. These changes in the plasma membrane lipid and sterol composition may be responsible for an altered uptake of drugs and thus for a reduced intracellular accumulation of fluconazole thereby providing a mechanism for azole resistance.
