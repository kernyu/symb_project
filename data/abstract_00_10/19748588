In this study, the immunostimulatory effect of oral administration of different preparations (conventional fine powder [CP] and superfine powder [SP]) of Astragalus membranaceus root or its polysaccharides (APS) in sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) was investigated. Sea cucumbers with an average initial weight of 49.3 +/- 5.65 g were fed with a diet containing 3% CP or SP or 0.3% APS over a period of 60 days. The non-specific humoral (phenoloxidase, lysozyme and agglutination titer) and cellular (phagocytic capacity and reactive oxygen species) responses were determined and compared with controls (no supplement) after 20, 40 and 60 days of feeding. Variation in the levels of responses was evident among different supplements. SP and APS significantly enhanced most of the immune parameters tested. Among the humoral responses, lysozyme activity significantly increased after feeding with SP-supplemented diet for 20, 40 or 60 days. Furthermore, lectin titer showed significant enhancement after 20 and 60 days of feeding with APS-supplemented diet. Significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species was evident for all three supplements after 20 days of feeding, but no significant change in serum phenoloxidase activity was observed for any of the three supplements over the three different periods. Overall, significant modulation of the cellular responses was only noticed after 20 days of feeding with SP- or APS-supplemented diet. After 60 days, these two groups also exhibited a decrease in the cumulative symptom rates compared to the controls when challenged with Vibrio splendidus. These results indicated that dietary intake containing A. membranaceus root or its polysaccharides could enhance the immune responses of A. japonicus and improve its resistance to infection by V. splendidus.
