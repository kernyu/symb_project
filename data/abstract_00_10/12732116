Quinolones act by inhibiting enzymes (topoisomerases), which are indispensable to DNA synthesis. Their bactericidal activity is concentration-dependent. Their spectrum has become broader, especially since the introduction of a fluorine atom at position 6 (fluoroquinolones). They are used as the treatment of choice or as alternative therapy in a wide variety of infections, both in the hospital and non-hospital setting. Depending on the compound, they are used in urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, chronic osteomyelitis, respiratory tract infections, and severe systemic infections, among others. The upsurge and extent of quinolone resistance has limited the use of these agents in some cases and in future may determine their use in others. There are strategies to minimize the spread of resistance. Quinolones are safe and well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects are gastrointestinal and those affecting the central nervous system.
