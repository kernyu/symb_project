We developed a real-time PCR assay combined with melting curve analysis for rapidly genotyping quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of topoisomerase genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae. This assay was not only accurate for the screening of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance but also relevant as an early warning system for detecting preexisting single QRDR mutations.
