Reported here is an unusual cluster of non-invasive infections caused by an emm28 Streptococcus pyogenes strain resistant to bacitracin, erythromycin and clindamycin detected in Santander, Spain. Since one of the characteristics of group A streptococci is their almost uniform susceptibility to bacitracin, this finding was unusual, and a search for bacitracin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes strains was conducted in two other distant cities of Spain (Madrid and San Sebastian) where their presence was confirmed. These strains were frequently associated with erythromycin- and clindamycin-resistance, and most of them belonged to a unique emm28 T28, ST52 clone.
