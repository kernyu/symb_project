An omnibus survey of microbiologists (n = 400) and a survey of participants (n = 49) in the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme were conducted to determine the awareness and prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and the regularity and method of screening. Of the omnibus survey participants, 69% screened regularly for ESBLs, compared with 83% of MYSTIC participants. In both surveys, ESBLs were more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae (73% and 79%, respectively) and Escherichia coli (63% and 81%, respectively) than in other bacteria. The surveys demonstrated that awareness of, and testing for, ESBLs is inconsistent.
