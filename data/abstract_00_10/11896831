BACKGROUND: In contrast to the immunosuppressed patient population, the prevalence of fluconazole-resistant strains of Candida albicans among healthy individuals has not been extensively studied. METHODS: Candida species were cultured form 50 healthy outpatients with clinical signs of oral candidiasis. Following one week of the recommended fluconazole regimen, post-treatment cultures were obtained. Both pre- and post-treatment yeasts were identified and in vitro susceptibility testing was performed using the NCCLS M-27A method. Strains were further differentiated using established cDNA probes. RESULTS: Forty-four patients (88%) had positive C.albicans cultures prior to treatment. Antifungal susceptibility testing of these strains demonstrated no in vitro resistance to fluconazole. At post-treatment evaluation, eight patients (18%) had persistent signs of infection and 10 patients (23%) had positive Candida sp. cultures despite no clinical signs of infection. DNA analysis confirmed that the same C. albicans strain was present both in the pre-treatment and the post-treatment cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the presence of fluconazole-resistant strains of C.albicans does not appear to be prevalent among healthy outpatients furthermore, in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing does not always predict successful therapy in these patients.
