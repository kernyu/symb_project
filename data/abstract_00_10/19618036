OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence rates of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in patients under intermittent treatment with those observed in patients under daily treatment. METHODS: We used World Health Organization data regarding 5,138 patients with active pulmonary TB in Brazil, separated into two groups: patients in the Federal District of Brasilia, treated with a one-month daily regimen followed by an intermittent thrice-weekly regimen; and patients in other parts of Brazil, treated with a daily regimen only. The resistance pattern was categorized as primary or acquired, based on the history of previous treatment. Multidrug resistance was defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin, whereas monoresistance was defined as resistance to only one drug. RESULTS: The prevalence of primary resistance in the Federal District of Brasilia and in the other parts of Brazil, respectively, was as follows: overall, 9.2% and 9.3% (p = 0.94); monoresistance, 6.6% and 6.9% (p = 0.89); and multidrug resistance, 1.0% and 1.2% (p = 0.85). The prevalence of acquired resistance in the Federal District of Brasilia and in the other parts of Brazil, respectively, was as follows: overall, 15.8% and 26.8% (p = 0.39); monoresistance, 5.3% and 13.7% (p = 0.33); and multidrug resistance, 0.0% and 10.2% (p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were found between patients treated with an intermittent regimen and those treated with a daily regimen in term of resistance rates.
