As shown in twin studies, the inherited predisposition plays an important role in tuberculosis. Genetic influences may be specified in two ways. First, variants of genes whose products are involved in apparently disease-relevant pathways may be tested in population-based studies. Applying this approach, associations with pulmonary tuberculosis have been reported for variants of the genes encoding mannose-binding protein, the vitamin-D receptor, natural-resistance associated macrophage protein 1, interferon-gamma, of HLA alleles and of the interleukin-1 gene cluster. Second, genetic influences can be identified by genome-wide studies of members of affected families. Thus, linkage has been found between pulmonary tuberculosis and as yet undefined genetic variants on chromosome 15q and the X chromosome. Further genomic regions of interest have been identified in mouse models.
