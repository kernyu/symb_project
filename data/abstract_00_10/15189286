AIMS: Isolates obtained from various regions in Korea in 2002 were identified and their susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, monobactams and/or cephamycins was studied along with any production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteria identified by the conventional techniques and Vitek GNI card were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Using disk diffusion and double-disk synergy tests, we found that 39.2% of strains produced ESBLs. About 52% of isolates transferred resistance to ceftazidime by conjugation. Banding patterns of PCR amplification with the designed primers showed that 837- and 259-bp fragments specific to bla(TEM) genes were amplified in 63.3% of strains. 929- and 231-bp fragments (bla(SHV)), 847- and 520-bp fragments (bla(CMY)), 597- and 858-bp fragments (bla(CTX-M)) were amplified in 61.5, 17.3 and 7.7% of strains respectively. About 51.9% of strains contained more than two types of beta-lactamase genes. Especially, one strain contained bla(TEM), bla(CMY) and bla(CTX-M) genes. SIGNIFICANCE: Resistance mechanisms to beta-lactams, comprising mostly ESBL production, lead to the resistance against even recently developed beta-lactams in enterobacteria, which is now a serious threat to antibiotic therapy. The high prevalence of bla(CMY) genes and multidrug-resistant genes may also make therapeutic failure and lack of eradiation of these strains by extended-spectrum cephalosporins or cephamycins.
