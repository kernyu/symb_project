In order to determine the local epidemiology of candidemia, Candida strains isolated between 1994 and 2000 were identified to species level; antifungal resistance patterns and DNA fingerprints were analyzed. Identification of Candida strains (n: 140) was performed with germ tube test and carbohydrate assimilation reactions. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using a commercial test for 5-flucytosine and the broth macrodilution method according to NCCLS for fluconazole and amphotericin B. Molecular relatedness was determined by restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA followed by probe hybridization. C. albicans (37.2%), C. parapsilosis (32.2%), and C. tropicalis (12.2%) comprised 114 (81.4%) of 140 isolates. Susceptibility tests did not reveal resistance to amphotericin B in any of the Candida isolates. Fluconazole resistance was detected in one isolate of C. krusei, and 5-flucytosine resistance in two C. tropicalis isolates and one C. albicans isolate. Significantly higher frequency of clusters with identical strains in C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis was detected compared to C. albicans. Pediatric wards are particularly important in the nosocomial transmission of non-albicans candida species.
