The increasing problem of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria requires development of new antimicrobial agents. Synthesis and experimental application of the hybrids peptides may be one of the interesting possibilities in antimicrobial treatment. The aim of the present investigation is to determinate in vitro activities of two synthetic peptide amides: cecropin-melittin hybrid peptide (CAMEL) and protegrin analogue (IB-367) against control strains and multi-resistant clinical isolates. Antimicrobial activities were measured by MIC and MBC. The tested strains were susceptible to the peptides at concentrations in the range of 1 to 32 microg ml(-1).
