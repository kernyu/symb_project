Strains of Candida albicans obtained from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals prior to their first episode of oral thrush were already in a high-frequency mode of switching and were far more resistant to a number of antifungal drugs than commensal isolates from healthy individuals. Switching in these isolates also had profound effects both on susceptibility to antifungal drugs and on the levels of secreted proteinase activity. These results suggest that commensal strains colonizing HIV-positive individuals either undergo phenotypic alterations or are replaced prior to the first episode of oral thrush. They also support the suggestion that high-frequency phenotypic switching functions as a higher-order virulence trait, spontaneously generating in colonizing populations variants with alterations in a variety of specific virulence traits.
