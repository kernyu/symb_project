INTRODUCTION: Nocardiosis is a rare, generally systemic infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients. We report a case of Nocardia farcinica primary brain abscess in an immunocompetent patient, unusually associated with a pulmonary embolism. OBSERVATION: A 62 year-old woman without medical past was hospitalised because of a Bravais-Jacksonian type of seizure. The clinical and radiological profile was unspecific. The diagnosis was made on identification of the microorganism. The patient improved after craniotomy with excision of the abscess and appropriate antibiotic therapy for four months. DISCUSSION: The N. farcinica species is distinct from others by its high degree of antibiotic resistance its virulence. We insist on the need to identify not only the microorganism but also the species concerned because this may influence the treatment strategy.
