Candida species constitute the majority of nosocomial fungal pathogens in non-neutropenic patients. Candida infections are still connected with substantial mortality. Recent epidemiological observations indicate a shift to non-albicans species, especially because of a rise of infections caused by C. glabrata, which frequently shows fluconazole-resistance. New therapeutic options like caspofungin, as the first licensed echinocandin, new broad-spectrum azoles, and lipid preparations of amphotericin B emerged in the last decade as efficient alternatives to fluconazole and amphotercin B deoxycholate. In invasive candidiasis, a delayed treatment initiation is associated with an increased mortality, thus risk stratification and empirical therapy strategies become vitally important. This review reflects the efficacy of caspofungin in the treatment of Candida infections, especially in the setting of empirical therapy in critically ill patients, and considers the option of de-escalation to fluconazole.
