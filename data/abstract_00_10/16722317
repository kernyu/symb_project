OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of Usnic acid on the antibiotic-resistant plasmid in Staphylococcus aureus (Sa). METHODS: The antibiotic-resistant plasmid was abstracted from the clinical divided strain of Sa and plasmid elimination test was performed in vitro. RESULTS: Plasmid elimination test showed that Usnic acid could eliminate the resistant plasmid in Sa effectively. At 24th and 48th hour after the treatment of Usnic acid, the elimination rate of resistant plasmid was 5.2% and 16.4% respectively. CONCLUSION: Usnic acid can eliminate the antibiotic-resistant plasmid in Sa. It is possible to use Usnic acid to treat the infection of antibiotic-resistant Sa in clinic.
