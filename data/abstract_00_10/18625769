This study evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline, a novel cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative and -positive pathogens, against 4,151 recent clinical isolates collected in the United States. Ceftaroline was very potent against bacteria found in community- and hospital-acquired infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and common Enterobacteriaceae spp.
