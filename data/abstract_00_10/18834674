A cefotaxime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ML4313 was obtained from a patient from intensive care unit of Military hospital in Tunisia. This strain was resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones and phenicols, and tetracyclines. It was identified as producer of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by double-disk synergy test between amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and aztreonam. The ESBL was identified as CTX-M-28 by sequencing of PCR products and by isoelectric focusing. The ESBL resistance was transferred by a 50kb plasmid. CTX-M-28 is closely related to CTX-M-15. This is the first description of this enzyme in Tunisia.
