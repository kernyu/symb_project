Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered to be a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The clinicopathologic spectrum ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Simple steatosis has a relatively benign clinical course, but NASH can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. As yet there is no convincingly effective treatment for NAFLD and the best option for these patients might be a multimodal treatment plan targeting obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hypertension.
