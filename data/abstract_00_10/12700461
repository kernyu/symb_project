Primary resistance mutations to fusion inhibitors and polymorphisms in gp41 sequences of non-B subtypes and recombinant HIV-1 isolates were analysed. L91H to RPR103611 was detected in one DGpol/Denv/Dgp41 recombinant; L9F and K144R, rarely reported previously, were frequent in the B region of CRF14_BG recombinants. V194I and V318A, not described in the G subtype, were detected in the G region of BG recombinants and in G subtype viruses that also show the rare mutations T115L, M118V and K90R.
