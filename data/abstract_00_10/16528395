AIM: To measure the efficacy of two macrocyclic lactone-levamisole-benzimidazole combination drenches against naturally-acquired abomasal nematode infections on a sheep farm in the North Island, New Zealand. METHODS: Eighteen lambs carrying naturally-acquired worm burdens were removed from pasture and randomly allocated to one of three equal-sized groups, consisting of an untreated control group and two treatment groups. One treatment group was given a single oral dose of a triple-combination anthelmintic administered at the manufacturer's recommended dose rate of 0.2 mg/kg ivermectin, 7.5 mg/kg levamisole and 5.0 mg/kg albendazole. The other treatment group received a similar dose of another triple-combination drench consisting of 0.2 mg/kg abamectin, 8.0 mg/kg levamisole and 4.5 mg/kg oxfendazole. Worm counts were carried out post mortem on the abomasa of all animals in all groups, 10 days after treatment. RESULTS: While the abamectin-levamisole-oxfendazole combination was highly effective against all three abomasal nematode species present, the ivermectin-levamisole-albendazole combination was not. In the latter instance, a reduction of only 78% was achieved against infections of Ostertagia (=Teladorsagia) circumcincta. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence of resistance to an ivermectin-levamisole-albendazole combination drench by O. circumcincta. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Besides representing the first confirmed report of resistance to a combination drench consisting of three broad-spectrum anthelmintics, the present results provide further evidence of the continuing escalation of multiple anthelmintic resistance in sheep nematodes in New Zealand.
