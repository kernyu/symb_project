The authors report a case of a cutaneous infection due to Bacillus licheniformis. It occurred after a wound due to a wicker splinter. The bacteriological identification was easy thanks to the very typical aspects of culture. First intention antibiotherapy given for bacterial dermo-hypodermatitis may be ineffective because Bacillus licheniformis secretes a biofilm and is frequently resistant to Beta-lactams.
