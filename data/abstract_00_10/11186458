Fifteen strains of M. hominis isolated from patients with urogenital inflammations were analyzed. Variations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) have been found in fluoroquinolone-resistant M. hominis clinical isolates in comparison with the reference PG21 strain. In one isolate, parC had Asn substitute at position 91.
