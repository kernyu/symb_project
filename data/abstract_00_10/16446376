OBJECTIVES: This randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily versus amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg three times daily, both given orally for 7 or 10 days, in the treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia in Spain, a country with a high prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Following 2:1 randomization, 566 patients (intent-to-treat population) received either amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg (n = 374) or amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg (n = 192). RESULTS: Among the patients who did not deviate from the protocol (clinical per-protocol population), clinical success at day 21-28 post-therapy (test of cure; primary efficacy endpoint) was 92.4% (266/288) for amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg and 91.2% (135/148) for amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg (treatment difference, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, -4.4, 6.6). Bacteriological success at test of cure in the bacteriology per-protocol population was 90.8% (79/87) with amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg and 86.0% (43/50) with amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg (treatment difference 4.8; 95% confidence interval, -6.6, 16.2). At test of cure, amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was clinically and bacteriologically effective against 7/7 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) isolates (including three amoxicillin non-susceptible strains) and amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg against 5/5 isolates (including one amoxicillin non-susceptible strain). CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. Amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was at least as effective clinically and as safe as amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in a country with a high prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and has a more convenient twice daily posology.
