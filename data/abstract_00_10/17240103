Two hundred Staphylococcus aureus strains collected from an Indian hospital were tested for mupirocin susceptibility using disc diffusion method and E-test. High-level and low-level mupirocin resistance was detected in 10 (5%) and 2 (1%) S. aureus strains, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of the high-level mupirocin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates revealed the presence of 2 clones with the majority of strains belonging to 1 clone, suggesting clonal dissemination.
