AIMS: The main objectives of this study were to investigate the diversity of Campylobacter genotypes circulating in Senegal and to determine the frequency of antibiotic resistance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains of Campylobacter jejuni isolated from poultry (n = 99) and from patients (n = 10) and Campylobacter coli isolated from poultry (n = 72) were subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The pulsotypes obtained after digestion by SmaI and KpnI revealed a significant genetic diversity in both species, but without any predominant pulsotypes. However, farm-specific clones were identified in the majority of poultry houses (76.5%). Human and poultry isolates of C. jejuni had common PFGE patterns. High quinolone-resistance rates were observed for C. jejuni (43.4%) and C. coli (48.6%) isolates obtained from poultry. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a genetic diversity of Campylobacter between farms indicating multiple sources of infection; but specific clones had the ability to colonize the broiler farms. The antimicrobial resistance patterns were not related to any specific PFGE pattern suggesting that resistance was due to the selective pressure of antibiotic usage. Campylobacter with similar genotypes were circulating in both human and poultry. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study is important for the understanding of the epidemiology of Campylobacter in broiler farms in Senegal. It also emphasizes the need for a more stringent policy in the use of antimicrobial agents in food animals.
