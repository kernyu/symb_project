The microbiocidal efficacy of 0.55% ortho-pthalaldehyde (OPA) was evaluated in a rough carrier test, using more than 200 strains of bacteria and yeasts from patients and reference ATCC strains. This test was then compared with the European carrier test (prEN14561) using Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We also sought to determine whether recently isolated P. aeruginosa had the same susceptibility to OPA, after laboratory adaptation. It was shown that P. aeruginosa was less susceptible to OPA (being reduced by a factor of 10(3.8)) than the other strains (reduced by a factor of 10(4)). The surface test used, produced a lesser reduction of P. aeruginosa than the European test. For recently isolated strains (N = 66), the rough model demonstrated that the number of survivors increased both quantitatively and qualitatively from day one to day seven. It was concluded that disinfectant efficacy should be confirmed with recently isolated organisms.
