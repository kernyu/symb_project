BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is amongst the most chemoresistant malignancies. Expression of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme plays a major role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy. A Phase II study was undertaken to determine the effect of gemcitabine by fixed-dose rate infusion (FDR), cisplatin and the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, on the 6-month survival rate in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The eligibility criteria included a pathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. No prior gemcitabine therapy was allowed. Patients received a combination of gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) over 100 minutes, cisplatin 35 mg/m(2) I.V. on days 1 and 8, and celecoxib continuously at a daily dose of 800 mg. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with metastatic pancreas cancer were enrolled (median age, 59.5 years; M:F, 13:9). The median number of cycles was 2 per patient. The median survival time was 5.8 months (90% CI, 3.6-7.6 months). The probability of survival at 6 months was 46% (90% CI, 27-62%). The major toxicity was neutropenia with grade 3 or 4 toxicities seen in 65% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of celecoxib to gemcitabine (by FDR) and cisplatin did not appear to increase activity of the chemotherapy doublet in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Celecoxib alone may not be sufficient to sensitize pancreatic cancer to the effects of conventional cytotoxic therapy.
