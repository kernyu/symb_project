Two new resveratrol tetramers, hopeaphenol A (1) and isohopeaphenol A (2), along with the known vaticaphenol A (3), were isolated from the stem bark of Vatica oblongifolia ssp. oblongifolia through bioassay-guided fractionation. The structures and their relative stereochemistry were determined by spectroscopic techniques. Compounds 1 and 3 demonstrated moderate activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis.
