Increased permeability and reduced cerebral endothelial cell (CEC) viability induced by oxidative stress are the hallmarks of the blood-brain barrier disruption. In our experiments hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 0.5 mM) induced a continuous decrease of the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and resulted in intercellular gap formations in cultured rat CECs. Adrenomedullin (AM) increased TEER, enhanced peripheral localization of F-actin bands and attenuated the increased permeability induced by H2O2. Furthermore, AM treatment preserved mitochondrial membrane potential, attenuated cytochrome c release, and consequently improved CEC viability in H2O2 treated cultures. These results suggest that AM treatment protects CECs against oxidative injury.
