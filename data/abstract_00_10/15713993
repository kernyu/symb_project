OBJECTIVES: The aim of this multicenter feasibility study was to determine the toxicity profile and antitumor activity of the gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin combination as second-line treatment in platinum plus paclitaxel resistant/refractory advanced ovarian cancer. METHODS: Twenty patients received a 30-60-min infusion of gemcitabine a week for 2 weeks, followed by 120-180 min infusion of oxaliplatin every 3 weeks. The doses used were 1,000 and 130 mg/m(2), respectively. Seventeen cases (85% of the total) were platinum resistant and 3 (15%) were platinum refractory. RESULTS: Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 14/20 of cases (70%); there were no symptomatic cases. 2 patients required platelet transfusion and 8 patients received hydrocortisone. The dose- limiting toxicity was thrombocytopenia. Combined grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 8/20 (40%) of cases (no sepsis was registered). Five patients were treated with recombinant erythropoietin because of grade 3 anemia and 4 cases received G-CSF prophylactically from the first cycle. The overall response rate of the combination in terms of antitumor activity was 26% (95% CI = 9-51%). CONCLUSION: A combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin using this schedule gave rise to a moderate/severe toxicity profile and would be feasible only if growth factors were used and/or gemcitabine were administered at lower doses. The antitumor activity of the combination was insufficient reward for the resultant toxicity profile. However, equivalent to that of other drugs used in platinum refractory and resistant patients.
