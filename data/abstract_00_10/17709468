Recombinant phenotyping of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pol region III mutations from clinical specimens showed that T813S and G841A each conferred foscarnet resistance and approximately threefold increased ganciclovir resistance; adding the UL97 mutation C592G increased ganciclovir resistance to approximately sixfold. Bacterial artificial chromosome CMV clones containing pol mutation L845P were nonviable unless repaired with the wild-type sequence.
