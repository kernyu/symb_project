The adsorption characteristics and kinetics of 2,4-Dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) by biological activated carbon (BAC) was studied through contrast experiments with conventional activated sludge alone or quartz as the carrier. The advantage and disadvantage of removing 2,4-DCP using BAC and the mechanism of this process were investigated. The results show that the method of removing 2,4-DCP by BAC is applicable in practices, and the process of BAC demonstrates high removal rate than the process of suspended activated sludge and biofilm with quartz as the carrier. In addition, the BAC process showed high resistance to shock loadings, therefore, it is suitable to be utilized at high organic loading and under long-term operation. In BAC-system, activated carbon could not only adsorb 2,4-DCP but also oxidized 2,4-DCP.
