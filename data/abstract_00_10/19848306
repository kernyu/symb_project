INTRODUCTION: With the increasing prevalence of bloodstream infections caused by Candida sp. is necessary to establish the susceptibility of resistant strains in various geographical regions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B in yeasts isolated from blood through E test method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the period from 1992 to 2007, a total 112 strains of Candida species were isolated from blood of patients at the National Institute of Cardiology Ignacio Chavez. Susceptibility of these strains was performed to know the level of resistance to Itraconazole, Fluconazole, Voriconazole and Amphotericine B by E test method. RESULTS: C. albicans was the most common species (60.2%), followed by C. tropicalis (9.8%). A five percent of resistance to itraconazole, 1.8% to fluconazole; and 0.9% to amphotericine B and voriconazole were found. C. glabrata was the most resistant species to the four antifungal agents. CONCLUSION: The yeasts resistance to the four antifungal agents is still lower in our patients.
