We have developed an in vitro model of 38 T-lymphoblastic leukemia lines resistant to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and L-asparaginase (ASNase). Of these, 26 cell lines resistant to both drugs, 6 resistant to ara-C, and 6 resistant to ASNase were isolated. In 18 of these cell lines, all randomly selected, resistance to ara-C, ASNase and gamma radiation was documented by the MTT and trypan blue assays, as well as flow cytometry with Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining. In these lines, p53, p21WAF1, and bcl-2 levels were measured by ELISA. Results show that P21WAF1 upregulation following p53 induction did not occur, suggesting that p53 function may be lost. Moreover, the data imply that upregulation of bcl-2 is critical in the development of resistance to ara-C and ASNase in these leukemic lines. In the CEM/0 parent line, p53 maintained its ability to interact with its DNA binding site as documented by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). But in one single- and one double-resistant leukemic cell line examined, p53 was not shown to maintain this ability. We conclude that double-resistant clones to ara-C and ASNase are refractory to both drugs, providing an excellent leukemic model to investigate the multiple-drug resistance.
