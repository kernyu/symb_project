In our search for genes that inhibit the inflammatory effects of TNF without diminishing its antitumor capacities we found that, compared with C57BL/6 mice, DBA/2 mice exhibit a dominant resistance to TNF-induced lethality. Tumor-bearing (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)(BXD)F(1) mice completely survived an otherwise lethal TNF/IFN-gamma-antitumor therapy with complete regression of the tumor. This was not the case for C57BL/6 mice. Genetic linkage analysis revealed that TNF resistance is linked to a major locus on distal chromosome 6 and a minor locus on chromosome 17. Compared with littermate controls, chromosome substitution mice carrying a DBA/2 chromosome 6 in a C57BL/6 background were significantly protected against TNF and TNF/IFN-gamma, albeit less so than DBA/2 mice. Definition of a critical region of 13 Mb on chromosome 6 was the highest mapping resolution obtained. Further analysis of candidate genes may provide a powerful tool to control TNF-induced pathologies in humans.
