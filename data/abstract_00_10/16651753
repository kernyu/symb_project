To discover an orally active thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) and leukotriene D(4) (LTD(4)) dual antagonist, we designed and synthesized chloroquinolylvinyl derivatives based on the structures of the TXA(2) antagonist daltroban and the LTD(4) antagonist montelukast. Among these derivatives, 4-{[(2-(4-chlorophenylsulfonylamino)-1-{3-[(E)-2-(7-chloro-2-quinolyl)vinyl]pheny l}ethyl)thio]methyl}benzoic acid (18d) showed potent inhibitory activity against U46619-induced aggregation of guinea pig platelets and LTD(4)-induced contraction in the guinea pig ileum, with IC(50) values of 340 nm and 0.40 nm, respectively. Oral administration of 18 d also inhibited both the LTD(4)-induced acceleration of plasma leakage to skin in guinea pig and the U46619-induced increase in airway resistance in guinea pig with ED(50) values of 0.47 mg/kg and 3.3 mg/kg, respectively.
