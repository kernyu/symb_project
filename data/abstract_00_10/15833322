A tetracycline-platinum(II) complex, [PtCl2(C22H24N2O8)], was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, conductivity and thermogravimetric analyses, and infrared spectroscopy. The interaction of tetracycline (Tc) with platinum(II) ions was also studied in aqueous solution by 1H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopies. Tetracycline forms a 1:1 complex with platinum via the oxygen of the hydroxyl group at the A ring and that of the amide group. The complex is as efficient as tetracycline in inhibiting the growth of two Escherichia coli sensitive bacterial strains and six times more potent against E. coli HB101/pBR322, a bacterial strain resistant to tetracycline. This finding is very important because the use of tetracycline to treat bacterial infections has declined due to the emergence of resistant organisms.
