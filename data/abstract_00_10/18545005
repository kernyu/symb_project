Resistance of human immunodeficiency virus to antiretroviral therapy is a major concern. As new therapies are few, progress to acquired immune deficiency syndrome will ensue. We report a patient with multidrug-resistant HIV, high viral load, and low CD4 count who took a snake venom preparation while maintained on antiretroviral therapy. The response was impressive with a decreased viral load and increased CD4 count that was maintained for one year.
