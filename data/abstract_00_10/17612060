Foodborne salmonellosis continues to be a major health concern worldwide; thus, detection and tracking of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolates is of interest. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initiated antimicrobial sensitivity screening of Salmonella isolates from food and related samples in 1999. This paper summarizes the antimicrobial resistance data for Salmonella isolates obtained from 1999 to 2003. A total of 22,231 imported and domestic samples were analyzed for Salmonella, of which 1,319 (5.9%) yielded the pathogen. Since more than one culture was isolated from some samples, the total number of isolates obtained and tested for antimicrobial sensitivity was 1,382. Antimicrobial sensitivity screening was performed with the disc diffusion assay on 11 antimicrobial agents. Of the 1,108 food isolates screened, 42.1% (n = 467) were serotypes Weltevreden, Newport, Lexington, Senftenberg, Typhimurium, Saint Paul, Paratyphi, Enteritidis, Thompson, and Bareilly. A total of 249 (18.0%) isolates from all sources were resistant to two or more antimicrobials. Resistance to sulfisoxazole, streptomycin, and tetracycline was most common, whereas resistance to ciprofloxacin was least common. Weltevreden (n = 148) was the most common serotype isolated from food, but only nine (6.1%) of these isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobials. In contrast, although Derby was recovered only 19 times, 11 (57.9 %) of these isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobials. Of the 274 isolates from animal feed, dog treats and environmental swabs, 49.6% (n = 136) belonged to serotypes Infantis, Mbandaka, Anatum, Senftenberg, Typhimurium, Montevideo, Cerro, Enteritidis, and Bredeney, with 76 (27.7%) of these isolates resistant to two or more antimicrobials. Only limited trends in antimicrobial resistance were observed over time, with resistance to sulfisoxazole increasing, resistance to tetracycline decreasing, and resistance to streptomycin fluctuating.
