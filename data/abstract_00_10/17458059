PURPOSE: The aim of the study was the comparison of lysozyme concentration and peroxidase activity in mixed, non-stimulated saliva of HIV-positive patients and healthy subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in the group of 37 patients infected with HIV. The control group comprised of non-infected individuals, counterpart of the examined group. Mixed non-stimulated saliva, collected using expectoration method in the amount of 3-5 ml 2 hours after meal, was used for the study. Saliva samples were centrifuged, divided into portions 200 microl each, and stored at -80 degrees C. Peroxidase activity was determined using the method by Mansson-Rahemtull et al. Lysozyme concentrations were determined with the use of radial immunodiffusion method, ready-made kits (Human NL Nanorid plate--The Binding Site Ltd., UK). RESULTS: Higher concentrations of lysozyme as well as peroxidase activity were observed in the group of patients with HIV as compared to the control group, and they were 35.08 microg/ml, 46.74 IU/1, 21.3 microg/ml, 37.73 IU/l, respectively. The difference was statistically significant only in case of peroxidase activity. CONCLUSIONS: 1. HIV infection triggers immune mechanisms, that are manifested by the increase in salivary enzymes responsible for local non-specific resistance. 2. The immunological resistance decrease, manifested by the drop of the absolute number of CD4 lymphocytes T, is compensated by the increase in lysozyme concentration and peroxidase activity in non-stimulated saliva of HIV-positive patients.
