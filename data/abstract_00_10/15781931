BACKGROUND: Despite an extensive literature, the impact of both adjunctive steroid therapy and delayed diagnosis on the outcome of childhood pneumococcal meningitis is controversial. AIM: To determine the independent contribution of corticosteroid therapy and delayed diagnosis on the outcome of childhood pneumococcal meningitis in a representative population with good access to medical services. METHODS: Data were obtained from laboratories and hospital records to assemble a population register in Sydney, Australia, 1994-99. Follow up questionnaires were completed by attending physicians. RESULTS: A total of 122 cases of pneumococcal meningitis aged 0-14 years were identified. Almost 50% of 120 children with available records either died (n = 15) or had permanent neurological impairment (n = 39). Early use (before or with parenteral antibiotics) of corticosteroids protected against death or severe morbidity (adjusted OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77). Delayed diagnosis was associated with increased morbidity in survivors (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.03 to 11.4) but not with increased mortality. CONCLUSION: In a population with good access to health care and after adjusting for other known prognostic variables, early recognition of pneumococcal meningitis and treatment with adjunctive dexamethasone significantly improves outcomes. These data add to those from randomised controlled trials. Implementation requires development of protocols and guidelines for use in emergency departments.
