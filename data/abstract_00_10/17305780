The work reported here is the first nationwide, multicenter surveillance study conducted in Korea to obtain data on fluconazole susceptibility of Candida albicans (C. albicans) isolates. A total of 1137 isolates of C. albicans obtained from 17 university hospitals in South Korea during the 6-month period, July through December 2004, were tested. No resistant strains were observed in any of the isolates. Only five of the 1137 isolates (0.44%) of C. albicans were found to be susceptible dose dependent, with all remaining strains (99.56%) susceptible to fluconazole. Trailing growth at 48 h was found in only four isolates (0.35%).
