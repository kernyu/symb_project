Vitreoscilla hemoglobin Gene was cloned in Streptomyces aureofaciens through E. coli-Streptomyces shuttle plasmids constructed by both pIJ699-pUC19(vhb) and pIJ702-pBR322(vhb). Under low dissolved oxygen conditions, expression of hemoglobin enhanced CTC yield of engineering strain more about 40%-60% that that of control by improving oxygen transmission in cells. Hemoglobin expression by Promoter of tetracycline resistance gene was more effective for oxygen transmission than that by its native promoter regulated by dissolved oxygen concentrations in environments of locally low concentrations of dissolved oxygen.
