In the last few years, the antimicrobial activity, efficacy and relative safety of fluoroquinolones have made them attractive for the treatment of community-acquired and nosocomial infections. Prulifloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Prulifloxacin is available for oral use, and after absorption is metabolized in to the active form, ulifloxacin. It exhibits good penetration in target tissues and a long elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration. A number of randomized, controlled clinical trials carried out in Europe demonstrated the efficacy of prulifloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract (acute uncomplicated and complicated) and respiratory tract infections (acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis), in comparison with the most widely used drugs such as ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav and pefloxacin. Prulifloxacin was generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were gastric pain, diarrhea, nausea and skin rash. This review focuses on the characteristics of prulifloxacin, summarizing the relevant preclinical and clinical data.
