Two novel (3,12)-connected, chiral porous coordination polymers featuring 3D intersecting pore structures, selective sorption and solvothermal resistance properties are constructed by linking 3-connected benzene-1,3,5-tribenzoic acid with two types of 12-connected heptanuclear metal carboxylate clusters.
