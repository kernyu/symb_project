Seven new (1 and 3-8) and seven known (2 and 9-14) bisindole alkaloids of the topsentin and hamacanthin classes were isolated from the MeOH extract of a marine sponge Spongosorites sp. by bioactivity-guided fractionation. The structure of compound 7 is a revision from our previous report. The planar structures were established on the basis of NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses. Configurations of these compounds were defined by NMR spectroscopy and optical rotation. It is noteworthy that both R and S isomers were isolated for the hamacanthins (1-4, 9, 10, 15, and 16), while a single stereoisomer was isolated for dihydrohamacanthins (5, 11-14, 17, and 18). Compounds 1-4, 6, and 8-14 showed marginal cytotoxicity against five human solid tumor cell lines, and compound 2 showed weak antibacterial activity against clinically isolated methicillin-resistant strains.
