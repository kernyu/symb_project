We describe here the results of an analysis of Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance protein 1 (pfmdr1) gene copy number from 440 field isolates from Papua New Guinea. No multiple copies of the gene were found, which corresponds to the lack of usage of mefloquine. These data extend regional knowledge about the distribution of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum.
