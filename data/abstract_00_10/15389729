Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide into 21st century. The mortality and spread of this disease has further been aggravated because of synergy of this disease with HIV. A number of anti-TB drugs are ineffective against this disease because of development of resistance strains. Internationally efforts are being made to develop new anti-tubercular agents. A number of drug targets from cell wall biosynthesis, nucleic acid biosynthesis, and many other biosynthetic pathways are being unraveled throughout the world and are being utilized for drug development. In this review, socioeconomic problems in developing countries, efforts to control this disease in different individuals, the targets (known already and newly discovered), existing anti-tubercular agents including natural products and lead molecules, and the future prospects to develop new anti-TB agents are described.
