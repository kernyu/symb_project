Tuberculosis infection has been a relatively rare complication after lung transplantation. However, as more countries in which Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection remains endemic embark on lung transplant programs, the occurrence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis after transplantation is a genuine threat. We report the first case of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a double-lung transplant recipient who probably acquired the disease from the donor. We discuss the problems in clinical management of post-transplant tuberculosis infection and of drug-resistance.
