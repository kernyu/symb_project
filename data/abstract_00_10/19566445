We identified 1,805 gram-negative organisms in cultures of urine samples obtained over a 10-month period from residents of 63 long-term care facilities. The prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli was 51% (446 of 874 isolates), whereas the prevalences of ceftazidime and imipenem resistance in Klebsiella species were 26% and 6% (84 and 19 of 323 isolates), respectively. The prevalence of resistance varied significantly by facility type, size, and geographic location.
