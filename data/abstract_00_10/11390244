Mathematical models have played an important part in understanding both antibiotic and insecticide resistance. However, there has been little, if any, interdisciplinary work between these two areas of active research. One primary reason for this is that bacterial population genetics differ substantially from the population genetics of diploid organisms. This article examines these differences and their effect on resistance. It explores what efforts have gone into modeling resistance mathematically in both arenas, and offers suggestions on how the two groups could work together to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the resistance phenomenon
