From the whole plant of Euphorbia peplus L., five new diterpenes based on a jatrophane skeleton (pepluanins A-E, 1-5) were isolated, together with two known analogues (6 and 7), which served to divulge in detail the structure-activity relationships within this class of P-glycoprotein inhibitors. The results revealed the importance of substitutions on the medium-sized ring (carbons 8, 9, 14, and 15). In particular, the activity is collapsed by the presence of a free hydroxyl at C-8, while it increases with a carbonyl at C-14, an acetoxyl at C-9, and a free hydroxyl at C-15. The most potent compound of the series, pepluanin A, showed a very high activity for a jatrophane diterpene, outperforming cyclosporin A by a factor of at least 2 in the inhibition of Pgp-mediated daunomycin transport.
