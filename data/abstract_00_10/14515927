Comamonas species are environmental gram-negative rods that grow forming pink-pigmented colonies. Despite their common occurrence in nature, they rarely cause human infection. We present a case of Comamonas bacteremia that we think may have been related to tropical fish exposure. The patient was treated successfully with levofloxacin.
