BACKGROUND: The majority of recent community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in the United States have been caused by a single clone, USA300. USA300 secretes Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin, which is associated with highly virulent infections. METHODS: We sequenced the PVL genes of 174 S. aureus isolates from a global clinical sample. We combined phylogenetic reconstruction and protein modeling methods to analyze genetic variation in PVL. RESULTS: Nucleotide variation was detected at 12 of 1726 sites. Two PVL sequence variants, the R variant and the H variant, were identified on the basis of a substitution at nt 527. Of sequences obtained in the United States, 96.7% harbor the R variant, whereas 95.6% of sequences obtained outside the United States harbor the H variant; 91.3% of MRSA isolates harbor the R variant, and 91.3% of methicillin-susceptible strains harbor the H variant. A molecular model of PVL shows 3 mechanisms by which the amino acid substitution may affect PVL function. CONCLUSIONS: All sampled PVL genes appear to share a recent common ancestor and spread via a combination of clonal expansion and horizontal transfer. US isolates harbor a variant of PVL that is strongly associated with MRSA infections. Protein modeling reveals that this variant may have functional significance. We propose a hypothesis for the origin of USA300.
