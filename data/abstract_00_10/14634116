Both innate and adaptive immune systems contribute to host defense against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. NK cells have been associated with early resistance against intracellular pathogens and are known to be potent producers of the cytokine IFN-gamma. In C57BL/6 mice infected by aerosol exposure with M. tuberculosis, NK cells increased in the lungs over the first 21 days of infection. Expansion of the NK cell subset was associated with increased expression of activation and maturation markers. In addition, NK cells isolated from the infected lungs were capable of producing IFN-gamma and became positive for perforin. In vivo depletion of NK cells using a lytic Ab had no influence on bacterial load within the lungs. These findings indicate that NK cells can become activated during the early response to pulmonary tuberculosis in the mouse model and are a source of IFN-gamma, but their removal does not substantially alter the expression of host resistance.
