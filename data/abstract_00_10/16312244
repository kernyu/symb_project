The objective of this study was to investigate the perceived increase in resistance of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) isolated from the lower respiratory tract of horses to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT). The recorded SXT-susceptibility results of 50 S. zooepidemicus isolates from the tracheal wash fluid of equine patients examined at Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital from each of 2 time periods (1987-1990 and 1997-2001) were compared and statistically analyzed using a cross-sectional study design. There was a statistically significant difference between the documented resistance of S. zooepidemicus isolated in the 1987-1990 time period (8%), using quantitative microbroth dilution, and the resistance reported for isolates from the 1997-2001 time period (42%), using Kirby-Bauer agar disk diffusion. Laboratory investigation revealed inadequate quality control of media and subsequent falsely reported resistance of S. zooepidemicus from 1997 to 2001 time period. This study demonstrates how minor deviations from prescribed laboratory-testing guidelines can have a major effect on antimicrobial susceptibility test results. The study also underscores the need for regular surveillance and monitoring of trends in antimicrobial susceptibility to detect and correct such problems. In addition, epidemiologists and others collecting data from laboratories should be cautioned to interact with the laboratory regarding interpretation of results of various testing methods to ensure accurate analysis and conclusions.
