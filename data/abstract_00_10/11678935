Eighty-five recent isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae from patients with invasive disease were examined for their susceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin, penicillin and quinupristin-dalfopristin by E test. A novel duplex PCR assay was used to detect the presence of the erm(B) or mef(A) genes in all of the erythromycin-resistant isolates. All of the strains tested were susceptible to the combination quinupristin-dalfopristin, regardless of their susceptibility to penicillin or to erythromycin. By duplex PCR, two-thirds of the erythromycin-resistant strains harbored erm, and one-third harbored mef. The activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was not influenced by the genetic determinant of erythromycin resistance. The in vitro susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to quinupristin-dalfopristin is promising for future use; however, it is important to monitor the possible emergence of resistance.
