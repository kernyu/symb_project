An S678P substitution in Fks1p, the major subunit of glucan synthase, was sufficient to confer echinocandin resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus. The equivalent mutation in Candida spp. has been implicated in echinocandin resistance. This work demonstrates that modification of Fks1p is a conserved mechanism for echinocandin resistance in pathogenic fungi.
