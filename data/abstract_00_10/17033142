The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum drug-resistance, especially chloroquine resistance, represents one of the main obstacles to the control of malaria. Several studies have shown that in P. falciparum the mechanism of chloroquine resistance is linked to specific point mutations in the pfcrt gene of the parasite. In the present study we have analyzed 120 Italian imported malaria cases to evaluate the prevalence of 76T and 220S mutantions in the pfcrt gene. Moreover, the correlation between the presence of pfcrt point mutations and in vitro chloroquine resistance has been evaluated on 25 plasmodial isolates. The results showed a high prevalence of the pfcrt point mutations in isolates analyzed and a significant association between point mutations and in vitro chloroquine resistance. Molecular screening on imported malaria cases can be a useful tool to be employed in surveillance activity and also in monitoring the development and spread of drug resistance in endemic areas.
