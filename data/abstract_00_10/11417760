The aim of this study (the RESCUE trial) was to verify the effect of a shift from a lamivudine-containing to a didanosine-containing regimen on viral replication in HIV-1-infected subjects who had experienced prior treatment failure. Sixteen patients (didanosine-experienced in 14/16 cases) were consecutively enrolled: eight patients shifted from lamivudine to didanosine without other changes in their drug regimen. The other eight shifted from lamivudine to didanosine and changed one or more of their other drugs according to their physician's judgement. At the time of the regimen shift, all the subjects exhibited a high-level phenotypic resistance to both zidovudine and lamivudine with changes at codons 70-219 in 100% of cases, at codon 215 in 13 of 16 patients, and the M184V substitution in 13/16 patients. Phenotypic susceptibility to didanosine was maintained in the majority of cases (14/16) despite the high prevalence of changes at codon 184. A statistically significant decrease in viral load (P<0.005) without a significant increase in CD4 lymphocytes (P=0.514) was observed after 3 and 6 months from the introduction of the didanosine-containing regimen. These findings suggest the possibility of achieving a viral load response to didanosine-containing regimens in patients with reverse transcriptase (RT) M184V mutations who were previously treated with this drug and its possible use in salvage combinations.
