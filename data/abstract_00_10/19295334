OBJECTIVE: To assess by race/ethnicity long-term changes in metabolic parameters and body composition among treatment-naive persons initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: We compared changes in 398 participants (African American n = 243, Latino n = 43, white n = 112) initiating ART. At baseline, 1-month (metabolic parameters only) and 4-month follow-up intervals (anthropometric measurements) were performed and fasting metabolic parameters measured. Rates of change over time and overall mean changes from baseline were compared. RESULTS: Latinos had the greatest increase in glucose and insulin resistance and greatest loss of mid-arm and mid-thigh subcutaneous tissue areas. On average, mid-arm and mid-thigh nonsubcutaneous tissue areas increased in all races. Waist subcutaneous tissue area decreased only for Latinos. Visceral tissue area increased the most for Latinos and whites. For all groups, the initial increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was sustained. The initial increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was followed by a gradual decline in all groups. Triglycerides increased for all groups; the increase being the least for African Americans. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective long-term evaluation, changes in metabolic parameters and body composition varied across race groups. Latinos experienced the most unfavorable changes. Such changes should be monitored over time as the identified differences may impact ART selection.
