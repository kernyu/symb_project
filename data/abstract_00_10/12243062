The analysis of modern data concerning new genes of Vibrio cholerae of O139 serogroup and genetic control of their biosynthesis is represented. The special attention is paid to description of molecular genetic events induced the derivation the cholera causative agent of new serogroup. The structure of the moderate phages of V. cholerae O139 and their role in virulence of the cholera causative agent of the new serogroup and variability of its genome are discussed.
