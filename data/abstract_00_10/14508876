This review presents an overview of 38 patents published between January and June 2003 on different classes of antibacterial agents. Patent disclosures on novel oxazolidinone and macrolide derivatives with strong antibacterial activity continue to dominate patent publications in recent years. A use patent of a linezolid formulation for ear infections in infants and pre-operative procedure is highlighted. Disclosures on novel dual action oxazolidinone-quinolone hybrids designed to overcome bacterial resistance and new macrolide derivatives with antimycobacterial activity are also presented. Patents on beta-lactam and quinolone antibiotics focus on the development of new processes and formulations to improve cost, purity and stability of existing agents in clinical use. Novel antibacterial agents (DNA polymerase and D-glutamate racemase inhibitors) as potential lead compounds are also presented.
