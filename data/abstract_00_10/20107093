A total of 1,991 group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates, collected in 2008 and 2009, were tested for non-penicillin susceptibility by broth microdilution, disk testing, and oxacillin screening agar. No GBS isolates were non-penicillin susceptible. Oxacillin and ceftizoxime disk testing results showed that proposed screening criteria are nonspecific. The oxacillin screening agar was specific but of unknown sensitivity.
