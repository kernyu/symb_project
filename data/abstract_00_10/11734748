We report an outbreak of scarlet fever and pharyngeal colonization with Streptococcus pyogenes in a day-care center in Mexico City. The outbreak strain was resistant to erythromycin but susceptible to clindamycin. T-type 11,12 serotype was found in eight isolates, from two patients and six carriers, which had the emm22 gene. The recognition of streptococci resistant to macrolides causing outbreaks has implications for infection control and for improving antibiotic prescribing patterns in the day-care setting.
