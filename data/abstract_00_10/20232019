The role of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumanii and its clinical relevance have been recently appreciated as a ubiquitous opportunistic nosocomial pathogen. Risk factors associated with A. baumanii infection include severe underlying diseases, previous surgery, invasive procedures, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, length of hospital stay, admission to intensive care units (ICU). Carbapenem-multidrug resistant A. baumanii infections are probably associated to greater severity and more complications; in our cohort mortality was 49.3% and related mortality (within 72 hours) was 10.39%. However, severe underlying diseases probably play an important role in the clinical outcome of patients with MDR-C A. baumanii infection and controversy exists regarding the real mortality attributable to antimicrobial resistance because a high proportion of deaths took place > 7 days after diagnosis. Nevertheless, in our experience, carbapenem resistance, inappropriate therapy and monotherapy are associated to a higher mortality. Special attention should be paid to design well-controlled prospective clinical trials to determine the optimal antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients suspected of having MDR Acinetobacter infection.
