A 16-year-old boy developed a deep infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 6 months after total femoral replacement including knee and hip joints. The deep infection was eradicated by the use of debridement with continuous irrigation and removal of all prosthetic components followed by insertion of an antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer. Six weeks later, the total femoral prosthesis could be successfully reimplanted with both acetabular and tibial components. Two and half years later, the patient remained free of infection. Debridement with continuous irrigation and an antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer can be a feasible technique for the treatment of deep infection after large prosthetic replacement. Furthermore, reimplantation should be performed after a short waiting period. Such treatment should be considered before deciding on amputation.
