In the course of attempts to develop antimalarial drugs, we have designed and synthesized a series of quinoline alkaloide derivatives. Three of them, N-(4-methoxy-3,5-di-tert-butylbenzyl)cinchonidinium bromide (OSL-5), O-benzyl-N-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxybenzyl)cinchonidinium bromide (OSL-7), and N-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxybenzyl)quininium bromide (OSL-14) show potent activity against Plasmodium falciparum.
