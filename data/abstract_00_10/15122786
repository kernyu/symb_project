The changes in viral load and CD4(+) count at 3 and 6 months in a group of 166 HIV-infected patients was evaluated. The new therapy was chosen based on the medical history procedures for 70 patients, and in 96 patients it was guided by the partial or complete result of the line probe assay (LiPA) HIV RT and Protease resistance tests. The absolute difference from the baseline of the log viral load at 3 and 6 months was significantly different between the two groups when adjusted for baseline viral load (P < 0.0001) and stayed significant when intention-to-treat analysis was carried out (P < 0.001). The absolute difference of the CD4(+) count was not significantly different when adjusted for baseline CD4(+) (P = 0.854, 3 months; P = 0.06, 6 months). The proportion of patients with a viral load </=200 cp/ml in the medical history group (14.5%, 3 months; 15.2%, 6 months) was significantly different from the proportion of responders in the LiPA group (28.7%, 3 months, P = 0.03; 34.7%, 6 months, P = 0.008). In the intention-to-treat population, the difference between the two groups remained significant (P = 0.01). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of adherence (P = 0.88), number of drug failures (P = 0.12) and for the time since starting treatment (in years) (P = 0.48), but there was a significant difference for the number of new drugs in the new regimen (P < 0.0001) and for the pill burden of the treatment (P = 0.0006). A higher antiretroviral HIV treatment success guided by the LiPA HIV genotyping system than that based on the medical history only is reported. Of note, this study reached the same conclusions as previous studies, which all used sequencing.
