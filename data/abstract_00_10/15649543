Thirty-five clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci with decreased glycopeptide sensitivity were examined by a penicillin-binding protein (PBP2') latex agglutination (LA) test and were compared to the detection of the mecA gene by PCR, and oxacillin susceptibility determined minimum inhibitory concentrations. The latex test demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting methicillin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci after PBP2' induction with oxacillin.
