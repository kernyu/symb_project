OBJECTIVES: To study the type of bacterial pathogen causing urinary tract infection in children at Aseer Central Hospital, southwestern Saudi Arabia, and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. METHODS: A retrospective study of all the urine cultures carried out on children in the period from January 2003 to December 2006, for a total of 4 years were reviewed at the bacteriology laboratory, Aseer Central Hospital, southwestern region of Saudi Arabia. Their antimicrobial resistances as well as sensitivities were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 464 urine cultures were identified. Escherichia coli constitutes the most common pathogen isolated (37.3%), followed by Klebsiella (16.4%) and Pseudomonas species (15.7%). In general, there was a significant increase in the resistance rates of different bacterial pathogens to different antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In spite of an increase in the resistance rates of bacterial pathogens causing UTI, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and to some extent Azactam are appropriate for initial empirical intravenous therapy in UTI. In patients with uncomplicated UTI not requiring hospitalization, Nalidixic acid, and Nitrofurantoin can be used as oral treatment.
