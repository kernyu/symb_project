The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 224 current gram-positive clinical isolates including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. (MRSS), and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was evaluated. The MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited for daptomycin and vancomycin, respectively, were as follows: MRSA, 1 and 2 microg/ml; MRSS, 1 and 4 microg/ml; PRSP, 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; and VREF, 2 and >64 microg/ml. Daptomycin was bactericidal against 82% of 17 VREF isolates. The antibacterial activity of daptomycin was strongly dependent on the calcium concentration of the medium. Daptomycin was active against all gram-positive cocci tested.
