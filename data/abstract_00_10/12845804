5-(3-Perylenylethynyl)-2'-deoxyuridine was prepared by cross-linking 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine derivatives with 3-ethynylperylene followed by deprotection. 5-(1-Perylenylethynyl)-, 5-(3-perylenylethynyl)-, and 5-[4-(2-benzoxazolyl)phenylethynyl]-2'-deoxyuridine were found to inhibit in Vero cells the replication of type 1 herpes simplex virus and its drug-resistant strains.
