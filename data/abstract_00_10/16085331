The technological abilities of eleven wild Leuconostoc strains isolated from artisanal Afuega'l Pitu cheese, a homemade acid-coagulated cheese from raw milk from Asturias (northern Spain), were studied in order to test their potential application as components of dairy starters. Metabolic activity, production of flavour compounds, resistance to NaCl, acid, nisin and freezing, as well as genetic biodiversity were investigated. Marked differences among all tested strains reflected the existing biodiversity in naturally fermented products. After evaluation of their performance, strains IPLA567 and IPLA979 revealed the best properties to be used use in mixed dairy starter cultures. These two strains were able to ferment lactose and galactose and produced larger amounts of lactic acid than the others. Moreover, they showed high tolerance levels to NaCl, acid and nisin, although their resistance to freezing was slightly lower than the other strains. This study evidences the fact that natural environments can be considered as a proper source of new strains, which may help the dairy industry to widen their fermented products range.
