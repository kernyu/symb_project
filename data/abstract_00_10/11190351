Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for a variety of nosocomial infections associated with high morbidity and mortality, involving the immunocompromised and immunocompetent host. There are several groups of antipseudomonal antibiotics available today: antipseudomonal penicillins (carboxy and ureido penicillins), antipseudomonal cephalosporins, monobactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and carbapenems. This article reviews the newer antipseudomonal compounds and focuses on recent and important pieces of information for older compounds. Antibacterial spectrum, with particular emphasis on contemporary resistance mechanisms, and recent global resistance surveillance reports, pharmacokinetics, in vitro combination studies and in vivo interactions, and adverse effects and dosage schedules are described in an effort to approach the clinicians' needs.
