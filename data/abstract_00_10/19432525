The activity of daptomycin against 141 Staphylococcus aureus and 63 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates was assessed. The isolates were previously characterized and showed resistance to the antibiotics normally used against gram-positive cocci. Daptomycin was active against 100% of the isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC(90)] = 0.5 microg/ml, for both species). This antibiotic shows good in vitro activity; therefore, it is an excellent therapeutic alternative against these isolates.
