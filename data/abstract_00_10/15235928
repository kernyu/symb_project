BACKGROUND: A previous double-blind 24-week clinical trial of mizoribine (MZ) vs placebo in steroid-resistant primary nephrotic syndrome (SRPNS) showed that MZ was more effective than placebo in reducing the rate of deterioration of renal function. The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MZ in patients with SRPNS after 2 years' treatment. METHODS: A multicenter randomized open-label controlled trial in patients with SRPNS was conducted as a 2-year prospective postmarketing study. RESULTS: There was a significant imbalance in the baseline serum albumin level (s-Alb) between the conventional therapy (CT) and MZ onlay therapy groups. Early dropouts were more frequent in the subset of patients in the CT group having a baseline s-Alb < or =3 g/dl. Therefore, the primary analysis (urinary protein level (UP)-improving effect) was performed using a mixed-effects model, with stratification according to the baseline s-Alb value. The analysis revealed that, in the subset of 34 patients with membranous nephropathy (MN) within the stratum of patients with baseline s-Alb < or =3 g/dl (n = 52), the rate of change (slope of change in the UP level/month), in terms of the log (UP+0.2), was -0.0577 in those allocated to the MZ group and -0.0227 in those allocated to the CT group (P = 0.058). In the stratum of patients with a baseline s-Alb >3 g/dl (n = 97), there were no significant differences in the UP between the two treatment groups. Hence, MZ onlay therapy was not considered to be efficacious in this group of patients. No serious adverse reactions to the drug were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study yielded significant results, in that it suggested the possibility that long-term MZ therapy may afford further reduction of the UP, in addition to that obtained following CT, in particular, in MN patients in a severe nephrotic state.
