In wine making, the bacteriolytic activity of lysozyme has primarily been used to control the malolactic fermentation in wines. The use of lysozyme in musts before settling and the beginning of the alcoholic fermentation to inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria could be very beneficial. In a resistance test carried out in MT/b broth, lysozyme had greater antimicrobial activity toward Oenococcus oeni than Lactobacillus species. Several strains of wine bacteria belonging to Oenococcus proved sensitive to the bacteriolytic activity of lysozyme at low concentrations in both synthetic medium (MT/b) (50 mg/L), white must, or red must made with or without the skins (100 mg/L). Lactobacillus and Pediococcus strains survived at lysozyme concentrations of 200-500 and 500 mg/L, respectively, in MT/b and musts. Suspended solids in unclarified musts may strongly bind to lysozyme thereby causing its removal by filtration or centrifugation. One hour after lysozyme was added to musts, it was quantified by HPLC and found after centrifugation to be 40-50% and only 10% in musts made with or without the skins, respectively. Although appreciable amounts of lysozyme were bound to wine components, this did not appear to be a serious hindrance to lysozyme activity.
