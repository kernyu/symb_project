PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the past two decades standardized in-vitro antifungal susceptibility tests have been developed in response to increasing invasive fungal infections. Our purpose is to review the utility of real-time Candida antifungal susceptibility testing and its effects on clinical outcomes in the context of the new antifungal agents, existing antifungal susceptibility testing methods, and the changing epidemiology and susceptibilities of Candida spp. RECENT FINDINGS: New antifungal agents active against Candida spp. are now available. Caspofungin is approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis but standardized antifungal susceptibility testing has not been developed. The newer triazoles, such as voriconazole, posaconazole and ravuconazole, are not yet approved for invasive candidiasis. As infections caused by non-albicans Candida spp. with growing resistance to fluconazole increase, antifungal susceptibility testing may be important to guide therapy. Unfortunately, few studies exist describing the impact of real-time antifungal susceptibility testing on the treatment of invasive fungal infections. SUMMARY: Newer antifungal agents with broader anti-Candida activity, fewer adverse events and minimal resistance are currently available. The challenge clinicians face is choosing when to use these agents appropriately, while considering the changing Candida epidemiology and susceptibility trends without over-treating fluconazole-sensitive pathogens. Unfortunately, the correlation of antifungal susceptibility testing results by any method and clinical outcome is mostly lacking. We suggest that a concerted examination of the utility of real-time antifungal susceptibility testing and its effect on clinical outcomes by guiding appropriate antifungal therapy for high-risk patients with invasive candidiasis is warranted.
