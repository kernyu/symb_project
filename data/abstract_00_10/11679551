An extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, IBC-2, produced by a clinical strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was characterized. bla(IBC-2) was found, as a gene cassette, to be the sole gene within the variable region of a class 1 integron probably located in the chromosome. IBC-2 is a variant of IBC-1 and GES-1, differing by one amino acid from each of these beta-lactamases. When expressed in Escherichia coli, IBC-2 was observed to confer resistance to ceftazidime and decreased susceptibility to other oxyimino-beta-lactams.
