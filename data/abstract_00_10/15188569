The microflora of the prepucial sac in 94 children (aged 2 months to 15 years) with acute purulent balanoposthitis (APB) was studied. In the overwhelming majority of cases APB in children was caused by facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria (96.7%); of these, Gram positive bacteria occurred most frequently (85.7% of cases). In 51.6% of children these bacteria were represented by staphylococci, constituting 60.3% of all Gram positive flora. Gram negative bacteria were isolated in 40.6% of cases, Escherichia coli taking the first place among them. The isolated microflora was highly resistant to frequently used wide spectrum antibiotics.
