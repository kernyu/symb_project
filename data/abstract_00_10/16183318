OBJECTIVES: A pooled analysis of 14 Phase III studies was performed to establish the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of telithromycin 800 mg once daily in the treatment of pneumococcal community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs). METHODS: Data were examined from 5534 adult/adolescent patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), or acute bacterial sinusitis, who had received telithromycin for 5-10 days or a comparator antibacterial. RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 704/2060 (34.2%) bacteriologically evaluable patients. The respective per-protocol clinical cure rates for telithromycin and comparators were 94.3% and 90.0% (CAP); 81.5% and 78.9% (AECB); 90.1% and 87.5% (acute sinusitis); 92.7% and 87.6% (all indications). Clinical cure rates were 28/34 (82.4%) and 5/7, respectively, for penicillin-resistant infections, and 44/52 (84.6%) and 11/14, respectively, for erythromycin-resistant infections. Of 82 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia, 74 (90.2%) were clinically cured after telithromycin treatment, including 5/7 and 8/10 with penicillin- or erythromycin-resistant strains, respectively. Adverse events considered possibly related to study medication were reported by 1071/4045 (26.5%) telithromycin and 505/1715 (29.4%) comparator recipients. These events were generally of mild/moderate severity, and mainly gastrointestinal in nature. CONCLUSIONS: As S. pneumoniae is the leading bacterial cause of community-acquired RTIs, and antibacterial resistance is increasing among this species, these findings support the use of telithromycin as first-line therapy in this setting.
