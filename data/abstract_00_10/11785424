The following aerobic opportunistic bacteria have been isolated in women with different inflammatory processes of the reproductive system: staphylococci--62%, enterobacteria--30%, streptococci--11%, pseudomonads--7%. Gram-positive cocci (staphylococci and streptococci, except for Streptococcus faecium) manifested the highest sensitivity to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. Clinical isolates of enterobacteria were characterized by high percentage of strains sensitive to cyprofloxacine and cephalosporines of the third generation. The highest number of sensitive strains was registered in fluoroquinolon for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
