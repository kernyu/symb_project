The tet(M) gene encodes a protein which is related to tetracycline ribosomal protection, one of the mechanisms of tetracycline resistance. A tet(M) gene that is 100% homologous to the tet(M) gene of Staphylococcus aureus has been found in a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii, which also carries the tet(A) gene encoding a tetracycline efflux pump.
