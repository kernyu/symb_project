Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) septic arthritis is frequently associated with a poor clinical outcome. Joint reconstruction may be worth attempting in patients with a history of persistent MRSA infection. Here we report an unusual case of MRSA septic arthritis of the knee joint that was treated successfully by joint replacement after initial placement of antibiotic-loaded hydroxyapatite (HA) blocks.
