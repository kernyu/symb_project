We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 110 patients to determine if there was a difference in the time to appropriate antibiotic treatment between methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and non-MRSA hand infections. Patients were included in the study only if they had a culture-positive hand infection and received antibiotic treatment. Thirty-two patients (18 male and 14 female) with an average age of 39.1 years (range, 6 months-72 years) met the inclusion criteria. We recorded patient age, gender, date of presentation, time to receiving any antibiotic, time to final culture results, and time to receiving culture-appropriate antibiotics. The overall prevalence of MRSA infection was 34%. When compared to those with non-MRSA infections, patients with MRSA hand infections experienced a substantial delay in receiving appropriate antibiotics.
