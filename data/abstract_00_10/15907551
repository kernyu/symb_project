Intradural extramedullary tuberculoma of the spinal cord (IETSC) is a rare modality of tuberculosis, with only a few cases described so far. Here we review 22 reports of the disease found in the literature of the last 25 years. IETSC is closely associated with tuberculous meningitis (TM). Both conditions may occur simultaneously, but more frequently IETSC is preceded by TM. IETSC has been described in a predominantly young population of both genders. The pathogenesis is unknown, although a paradoxical reaction to antituberculous medication is a reasonable possibility. The disease presents insidiously with paraparesis, hypoesthesia with a sensory level, and bladder dysfunction, due to cord involvement or compression by the inflammatory process. Permanent paraparesis is a common sequela. MRI is the diagnostic technique of choice in IETSC. Prompt surgical excision of the tuberculoma is the cornerstone of therapy. Antituberculous treatment is also indicated; unless resistance is present, conventional chemotherapy is probably enough. Corticosteroids are also generally recommended. In conclusion, IETSC is a rare complication of TM, which presents insidiously, despite adequate antituberculous treatment. To avoid the permanent disability that this condition may provoke, an early diagnosis and prompt treatment is critical.
