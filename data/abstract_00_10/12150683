Helicobacter pylori appears to be a necessary cofactor for the majority of non-drug-associated duodenal and gastric ulcers. H. pylori infection is a chronic and transmissible infectious disease whose eradication has proved difficult. The last decade has seen > 1000 clinical trials using different eradication regimens. Many of these trials had severe limitations, some of which will be discussed here. The current review also focuses on the regimens that were used in the past, the present regimens and possibilities for the future. Also highlighted are some other aspects of H. pylori management, such as eradication failures and drug resistance.
