A screening study of the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases (IMP and VIM types and SPM-1) in isolates from different nonhospital sources was conducted, and it revealed the presence of bla(VIM-2), associated with the In58 class 1 integron, in two unrelated Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from aquatic habitats. The results suggest that the hospital setting was the possible origin of these bla(VIM-2)-carrying strains.
