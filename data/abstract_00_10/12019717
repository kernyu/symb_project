UNLABELLED: Helicobacterpylori (Hp) resistance to clarithromycin, one of the antibiotics most used to eradicate infection, is connected with the presence of a point mutation on the level of adenine at position 2143 or 2144 of 23S rRNA. AIM: The aim of the study is to evaluate of the presence of these mutation vs control clarithromycin resistant Hp strains present in North Sardinia; to verify the real association between the type of mutation and the resistance-level; to use easier molecular biology methods to quickly locate the resistance-associated mutations beginning with the bioptic material. The clarithromycin susceptibility of Hp isolates was tested by the E-test method (antibiotic assay). Genomic DNA of Hp strains was amplified using specific primers for the domain V. of ribosomic 23S rRNA and sequenced after the reaction with a primer within the fragment 23S. At the same time PCR-RFLP reliability was examined underlining the presence of these mutations with BsaI, BbsI, MboII restriction enzymes. Two mutations in 2143 (A- - G) and 2144 (A- - G) were found by domain V sequencing. The strains with mutation 2143 are characterized by a greater resistance level (MIC>64 g/ml) than those with mutation 2144 (MIC <64 g/ml). Restriction endonucleases BbsI and MboII recognise the site containing the mutation 2143 (A- - G), while BsaI recognise the mutation 2144 (A- - G). These methods might enable us to identify the presence of Hp directly from bioptic material and possible clarithromycin resistance and plan a suitable therapeutic strategy and consequently a better control of the infection.
