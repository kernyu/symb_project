This review describes characteristics of the family Campylobacteraceae and traits of Campylobacter jejuni. The review then focuses on the worldwide problem of C. jejuni antimicrobial resistance and mechanisms of pathogenesis and virulence. Unravelling these areas will help with the development of new therapeutic agents and ultimately decrease illness caused by this important human pathogen.
