Perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis (PAP) leads to a reduction in surgical site infections. The aim of PAP is adequate serum and tissue concentrations of the antimicrobial drug in the field of operation. The antibiotic must be effective against the expected pathogens during the operation, safe, and have the fewest possible side effects. The indication for PAP should take into account the risks of the operative procedure and especially the individual risk factors of the patient. Depending on pharmacokinetics, the antibiotic should be administered within 60 min before incision. After closure of the wound, further applications of the antibiotic drug have no influence on the infection rate of the wound but do increase the side effects (resistance, CDT colitis, allergy). Operation-specific recommendations according to guidelines of the Paul Ehrlich Society are given.
