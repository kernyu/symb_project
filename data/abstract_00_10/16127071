We conducted a prevalence study of mutations in Plasmodium falciparum that are associated with antifolate resistance in Blantyre, Malawi. The dihydrofolate reductase 164-Leu mutation, which confers resistance to both pyrimethamine and chlorproguanil, was found in 4.7% of the samples. Previously unreported mutations in dihydropteroate synthase were also found.
