OBJECTIVE: To investigate the DNA genome and RNA expression in 5-flurocytosine-resistant strains of Candida albicans from vaginal candidasis. METHODS: Sixteen strains of Candida albicans were selected from clinically diagnosed revul-vaginal candidasis. Eight 5-flurocytosine-sensitive isolates and 8 resistant isolates were examined by France Media FUNGUS sensitive test. DNA genome was detected with random amplification polymorph DNA. RNA expression was detected with random amplification polymorph RNA method. RESULTS: There were no distinct differences between 5-flurocytosine-sensitive and resistant Candida albicans in DNA genome, while RNA expression showed significant differences between 5-flurocytosine-resistant and sensitive strains. CONCLUSION: Clinical 5-flurocytosine-resistant strains of Candida albicans from revul-vaginal candidasis may be related to phenotype changes.
