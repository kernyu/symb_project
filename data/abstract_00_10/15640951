Dietary effect of water-soluble derivative - carboxymethyl chitin-glucan (CM-CG) on the level of DNA lesions induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was examined in ex vivo experiments. Lymphocytes, testicular cells, alveolar macrophages and epithelial II cells were isolated from Sprague Dawley rats fed a common or CM-CG enriched diet (200 mg/kg of body weight) during 21 days. Freshly isolated cells were in in vitro conditions exposed to H2O2 and the levels of DNA breaks were evaluated by single cell gel electrophoresis. A dose-dependent increase of DNA breaks was observed after treatment with hydrogen peroxide in all studied cell types. The levels of DNA breaks in cells isolated from CM-CG supplemented animals were lower compared to the levels of DNA breaks in cells isolated from animals fed a common diet. Intake of CM-CG enriched diet did not increase the level of DNA damage in different kinds of freshly isolated rat cells and equipped the cells with resistance to the treatment with hydrogen peroxide.
