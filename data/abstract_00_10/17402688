Melioidosis is a tropical disease caused by infection with the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Most cases present as an acute febrile illness with severe pneumonia and sepsis. Sub-acute and late onset disease can also occur Melioidosis has been diagnosed among travellers who contracted the disease while staying in endemic areas during the rainy season. We report a case of travel-associated B. pseudomallei cutaneous infection in a febrile 90-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus, with early stage manifestations of an isolated inoculation lesion. A 32 weeks' treatment with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate and doxycycline combination regimen led to resolution of the lesion and lack of relapse over fifteen months of follow-up. Melioidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unusual subacute cutaneous lesions in a febrile patients returning from endemic areas, as successful management largely depends on early diagnosis and specific long-term suppressive antimicrobial therapy at an early stage of the course of the disease.
