We evaluated the in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis of the combination of fluoroquinolones and linezolid with classical drugs. The combination of isoniazid with fluoroquinolones had synergic activity in nine of the ten isoniazid-susceptible strains. We also found synergism between rifampicin and linezolid in five of the 15 strains susceptible to rifampicin. The clinical significance of these findings should be evaluated.
