A study was conducted to examine the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the strains of bacteria isolated from patients with suspected urinary tract infection. A total of 348 bacterial isolates were grown from semi quantitative urine culture and were of significant bacteriuria. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed on Muller-Hinton agar by disc diffusion method according to the standard criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed a high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin (55.4%) followed by nitrofurantoin (45.4%), gentamicin (45.1%), amikacin (41.4%) and co-trimoxazole (30.5%). E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia showed 78.8 % and 75.3 % resistance to three or more drugs respectively. Cefotaxime (87.1%) appeared to be the most active antibiotic against the majority of isolates, followed by Norfloxacin (83.3%).
