OBJECTIVE: Establish the susceptibility pattern of Gram-negative bacteria causing infections in ICU patients, MYSTIC Program Brazil 2002. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gram-negative bacteria (n = 503) causing nosocomial infections were collected at seven Brazilian centers. The central laboratory confirmed the identification and performed the susceptibility tests by E-test methodology (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) for meropenem, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin. Interpretation criteria used were according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%) was the most frequently isolated, followed by A. baumannii (17.1%), K. pneumoniae (12.1%), E. coli (10.5%), and E. cloacae (7.9%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had susceptibility rates of 67.5% to piperacillin/tazobactam, 59.8% to meropenem, 57.3% to imipenem. A. baumannii presented susceptibility rates to meropenem of 89.5%, 88.4% to imipenem, and 74.4% to tobramycin. E. coli and K. pneumoniae were fully susceptible to both carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is still rare in this region. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa presented elevated resistance rates to all antimicrobials. Since these two bacterial species play an important role in nosocomial infections, the use of empirical combination therapy to treat these pathogens may be justified.
