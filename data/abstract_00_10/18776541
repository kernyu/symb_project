Novel 2-5A analogs composed of 3'-O, 4'-C-alkylene adenosine were synthesized as potent RNase L activators. When we examined their properties, including their RNase L activating ability and their stability to exonuclease, we found that these 2-5A analogs showed high RNase L activation and high resistance to enzymatic degradation without the modification of an essential adenosine at the second position.
