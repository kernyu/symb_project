In this study comprising isolates from 2001 to 2003, resistance was considerably more widespread among Campylobacter jejuni from humans infected abroad than infected within Norway. The discrepancy was particularly notable for fluoroquinolone resistance (67.4% vs. 6.5%). This is probably a reflection of a low resistance prevalence in Norwegian broiler isolates (1.2% fluoroquinolone resistant).
