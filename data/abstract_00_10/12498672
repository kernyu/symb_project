Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter jejuni has been observed worldwide and is now being seen in the United States. Among patients in our health-care system in Pennsylvania, fluoroquinolone-resistant C. jejuni were not observed from 1982 to 1992; however, resistance increased to 40.5% in 2001. Resistance to erythromycin remains at a low level (<5%).
