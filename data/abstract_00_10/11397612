The causes of penicillin failure in eradicating group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis are described. The mechanisms accounting for the failure include the presence in the tonsils of beta-lactamase producing bacteria and the absence of bacterial interference. The use of antimicrobials that can overcome and modulate these two phenomena and achieve better cure of the infection is described.
