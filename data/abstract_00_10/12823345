The cytotoxic activity of cytarabine (ara-C) in leukaemic blasts depends on activating enzymes such as deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and inactivating enzymes such as the 5'-nucleotidases. We have analysed dCK and 'high-Km' 5'-nucleotidase (cN-II) mRNA expression by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis in leukaemic blasts from 115 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients treated with ara-C. The prognostic value of these parameters as well as that of the cN-II/dCK ratio was determined. In univariate analyses: (1) low levels of dCK, high levels of cN-II and a high cN-II/dCK ratio predicted shorter disease-free survival (DFS); (2) low levels of dCK and cN-II/dCK ratio also predicted shorter overall survival (OS). In a multivariate analysis taking into account other clinical and laboratory variables: (1) high cN-II expression, a high cN-II/dCK ratio, age >/= 60 years and an unfavourable karyotype were independent prognostic factors for DFS; and (2) a high cN-II/dCK ratio, age >/= 60 years and an unfavourable karyotype predicted shorter OS. Age, karyotype and cN-II/dCK ratio were used to define a prognostic score that permitted the identification of high- and low-risk groups. Our results suggest that dCK and cN-II mRNA expression in leukaemic blasts at diagnosis is correlated with clinical outcome and may play a functional role in the resistance to ara-C in patients with AML.
