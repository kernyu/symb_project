We report the first case of multifocal Scedosporium apiospermum spondylitis in a cystic fibrosis patient. The infection, which occurred during voriconazole prophylaxis, disseminated contiguously from the base of the left lung and pleura and spread to vertebrae via the epidural space. S. apiospermum osteoarticular infections are rare, and are difficult to diagnose and cure because of their resistance to anti-fungal drugs.
