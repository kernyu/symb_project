A novel ABC transporter gene, vga(C), was identified on the 14,365-bp multiresistance plasmid pKKS825 in a porcine methicillin (meticillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolate of sequence type 398. The vga(C) gene encodes a 523-amino-acid protein which confers resistance not only to streptogramin A antibiotics but also to lincosamides and pleuromutilins. Plasmid pKKS825 also carries the resistance genes aadD, tet(L), and dfrK, which may enable the coselection of vga(C) under selective pressure by kanamycin/neomycin, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim.
