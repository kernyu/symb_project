Among 5938 clinical Shigella spp. isolates, two S. flexneri strains were isolated as those resistant to fluoroquinolones based on the MICs of the following antibiotics: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. S. flexneri 021787 had three substitutions, one in GyrA (Ser83Leu) and two in ParC (Ser80Ile and Arg91Gln). S. flexneri 021895 had four substitutions, two in GyrA (Ser83Leu and Asp87Gly) and two in ParC (Ser80Ile and Arg91Gln). The increased susceptibility of S. flexneri 021787 and S. flexneri 021895 to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin in the presence of the uncoupler carbonyl cyamide-m-chlorophenyldrazone implied that energy-dependent active efflux pumps contributed to the resistance against fluoroquinolones. Both S. flexneri 021787 and S. flexneri 021895 were also induced to express tolC (encoding a resistance-nodulation-division transporter), mdfA (encoding a major facilitator superfamily transporter), and ydhE (encoding a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporter) in the presence of ciprofloxacin. Thus, these results indicated that chromosome-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance of S. flexneri 021787 and S. flexneri 021895 resulted from the combination of target site mutations and enhanced expression of genes encoding efflux pumps.
