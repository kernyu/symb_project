Except for high-dose interferon as adjuvant therapy in stage III disease, little success has emerged over the last 20 years for metastatic melanoma. Recent advances in melanoma biology suggest that disarming oncogenic mechanisms in melanoma may be an attractive approach to therapy. For instance, sustained expression of Bcl2 has been associated with an increased resistance to apoptosis, and recently, anti-sense-mediated reduction of Bcl2 levels was shown to chemosensitize patients to dacarbazine, dimethyl triazino imidazole carboxomide, or DTIC. Likewise, the identification of activating mutations in the RAS signaling pathway, including the NRAS and BRAF genes, opens up new therapeutic options for RAS and RAF inhibitors. A more thorough understanding of melanoma biology and tumor immunology will undoubtedly yield new promise for patients with advanced disease.
