The Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy (SWAB) has revised the 1998 guideline for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in light of changing resistance patterns for common pathogens and new developments in epidemiology, diagnostic testing and treatment strategies. The current guideline is applicable to both primary and inpatient care, and has been developed by delegates of all professional organisations involved in the treatment of CAP, following recommendations for evidence-based guideline development. Assessment of a patient's 'severity of illness' at presentation is considered important when choosing an optimal empirical antibiotic regimen for CAP. Severely-ill patients should be treated with antibiotics covering the most important expected pathogens, including Legionella. Assessment of the severity of illness may be facilitated by the use of validated scoring systems like the pneumonia severity index and the 'confusion, urea, respiratory-rate, blood-pressure, 65-years-of-age' (CURB-65) score. Patients can also be stratified based on their location during treatment: in the community, a normal ward or an intensive-care unit. Legionella urine antigen testing is considered an important tool in the process of deciding on an optimal antibiotic regimen for CAP. Empirical therapy should be replaced with pathogen-directed therapy if the causative agent is identified.
