A review of the literature about the bacterial systems of regulation of expression of the genes controlled by signals generated by the bacteria themselves is given. Three types of presently known Quorum sensing systems contributing to the expression of the pathogenicity factors, infection process, and formation of biofilms by pathogenic bacteria are described. Possible mechanisms of enhanced resistance of bacteria in films to antibacterial preparations and factors of immune protection of human body are discussed. The perspectives of the development of new approaches to treatment of chronic diseases caused by the pathogens producing bacterial films are considered.
