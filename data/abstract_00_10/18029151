Rising levels of resistance amongst the major respiratory pathogens have compromised empiric antimicrobial therapy. This, coupled with a recent lack in availability of novel classes of antibacterials, has led to a need for new approaches to combat community respiratory tract infections. Bacteriological and clinical efficacy in two trials involving patients with acute bacterial sinusitis and six trials of patients with community-acquired pneumonia has shown that the development of a pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin SR, available as Augmentin XR in the USA) has allowed amoxicillin/clavulanate to retain its place in the treatment of respiratory tract infections today.
