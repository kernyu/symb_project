This article examines trends in infection and mortality from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) over the period 1993 to 2002. Trends in the number of deaths where MRSA was mentioned on the death certificate were compared with national reporting of microbiologically-confirmed bacteraemia to the Health Protection Agency Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC). Alongside national trends, patterns in the place of death were examined. Both the number of deaths and number of laboratory reports increased substantially over the period examined. MRSA mortality rates increased over 15-fold during the period 1993 to 2002. Reporting rates for bacteraemia increased 24-fold.
