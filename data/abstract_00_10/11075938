OBJECTIVE: To study the development of resistance during 8 weeks of salvage therapy with abacavir and nevirapine in combination with other reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs). METHODS: Samples obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy from 16 heavily pretreated patients were analysed for genotypic and phenotypic resistance. Genotypic resistance was analysed in cell-associated DNA and plasma HIV-RNA using direct sequencing. Phenotypic resistance was analysed in a PBMC-based assay and in a recombinant virus assay. Plasma viral load was measured at baseline and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: The majority of patients was genotypically and phenotypically resistant to lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine and PIs, whereas 50% of the patients showed resistance to nevirapine at baseline in at least one of the methods used. After 8 weeks of salvage therapy, no additional development of resistance against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and PIs could be detected. However, the amount of patients resistant to nevirapine increased to 83%. When the patients were divided into two groups according to baseline resistance against nevirapine, a significantly higher transient reduction in viral load was observed in patients with nevirapine-sensitive HIV at baseline compared to patients with resistant HIV at baseline. CONCLUSION: The transient effect of salvage therapy including abacavir and nevirapine was due to the effect of nevirapine. The lack of effect of abacavir was most likely due to cross-resistance between abacavir and lamivudine/zidovudine used in previous treatment.
