Since community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease with a high morbidity rate, it is important to obtain information concerning its etiology and susceptibility to antibiotics across different geographic areas. This study presents data obtained in 5 Latin American counties in the course of an international clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of treatment with either moxifloxacin or amoxicillin administered for 10 days to patients suspected of having CAP caused by a pneumococcal infection. Details are given of the pathogens identified, the patterns of sensitivity to antibiotics observed, and the clinical and microbiological results obtained.A total of 84 patients were studied, of whom 70 (83.3%) were evaluated at the end of the trial to determine the efficacy and safety of the treatment received. Gram-positive bacteria were found in samples from 29 patients (80.5%). The pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae in 28 of those cases (77.7%). Gram-negative bacteria were found in 7 patients (19.4%), the most common being Haemophilus influenzae in 3 patients (8.3%). The presence of atypical microorganisms was detected in 18 of the 70 patients (25%), mainly Mycobacterium pneumoniae (n=11), and in 6 cases (8.5%) the infection was mixed. Ten strains of S. pneumoniae (35.7%) were shown to be susceptible to penicillin, 2 (7.1%) were highly resistant, and 16 (57.1%) showed moderate resistance. The clinical success rate at the final visit after treatment was 94.1% for moxifloxacin and 91.7% for amoxicillin. The results of this trial demonstrate a high prevalence of S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin in patients with CAP in Latin America. It also revealed a high incidence of atypical pathogens and mixed infection in 8.6% of patients. This information should be taken into account when establishing protocols for empirical treatment of CAP in Latin America.
