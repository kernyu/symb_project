We compared the in vitro activity of six antifungal agents against 62 isolates of Candida dubliniensis by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI [formerly National Committee for the Clinical Laboratory Standards]) M27-A2, Sensititre YeastOne, disk diffusion, and Etest methods and we studied the effect of the time of reading. For the azoles, voriconazole was the most potent in vitro followed by fluconazole, ketoconazole, and itraconazole. All the isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B and flucytosine. The highest rate of resistance was obtained against itraconazole with a high number of isolates defined as susceptible dose-dependent. At 24 hr, 100% of the isolates were susceptible to ketoconazole, amphotericin B, and flucytosine, 98% susceptible to voriconazole and fluconazole, and 95% for itraconazole. At 48 hr, 100% of the isolates remained susceptible for flucytosine and amphotericin B, 95% for voriconazole, 93% for fluconazole, 90% for ketoconazole, and 82% for itraconazole. The agreement between the CLSI and the other methods was better at 24 than 48 hr.
