It was shown that aminoglycosides (streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin) prevented manifestation of postvaccine immunity in albino mice immunized by vaccine strain Yersinia pestis EV. Avirulent strain Y. pestis 363 Monr with chromosome resistance to aminoglycosides of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations provided manifestation of antiplague immunity when streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin and amikacin were administered for prophylaxis. ED50 achieved 1.0-1.2 x 10(3) CFU and in control group (without treatment) 9.3 x 10(2) CFU. Gentamicin and amikacin were highly effective for experimental plague prophylaxis (90-100% animal survival), but inhibited development of postinfective immunity. Protective index (PI) value was 1.1 x 10(2). It was demonstrated that combination of specific prophylaxis (Y. pestis 363 Monr) and emergency prophylaxis with aminoglycosides in albino mice infected with approximately 1000 LD50 of virulent strain Y. pestis 358 (5 hours after infection) was highly effective and provided protective effect against subsequent infection with plague pathogen. Value of PI was 1.1 x 10(5) and practically did not differ from PI (1.7 x 10(5)) in control group (intact mice, immunized with strains EV [symbol: see text] 363 Monr).
