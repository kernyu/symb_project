Drug resistant bacteria is an increasingly urgent challenge to public health. Bacteria adaptation and extensive abuse of antibiotics contribute to this dilemma. Active efflux of antibiotics is employed by the bacteria to survive the antibiotic pressure. Efflux pump is one of the hot spots of current drug related studies and ideal targets for the improvement of treatment. The efflux pumps and related mechanisms of action, regulation of expression and methodologies were summarized. Comparative genomics analyses were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action and evolution of efflux pump as exemplified by the Mycobacterium in our lab, which is a crucial re-emerging threat to global public health. The pathway and state-of-art drug development of efflux pump related drugs are included too.
