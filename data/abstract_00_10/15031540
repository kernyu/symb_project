The novel peptides based on a putative active site of defensin, an anti-bacterial peptide from the beetle Allomyrina dichotoma, were synthesized. These synthetic oligopeptides exhibited strong anti-bacterial activity in vitro, even against antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Then, anti-bacterial activity of two newly synthesized peptides, RLYLRIGRR-NH(2) (peptide A) and RLRLRIGRR-NH(2) (peptide B) was also examined by macroscopic and histopathologic assessment during the course of infection in mice inoculated with antibiotic-resistant pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) in vivo. Peptide B decreased the mortality of mice inoculated with antibiotic-resistant pathogenic E. coli. The results of macroscopic and histopathologic examinations revealed that peptide B could protect the mice from infection. In contrast, peptide A failed to protect mice from infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogenic E. coli. Also, modified peptides A and B produced no toxicity or side effects in mice. These results suggest that peptide B is useful for developing novel antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria.
