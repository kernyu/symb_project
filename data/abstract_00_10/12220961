The clinical pharmacology of itraconazole is presented in relation to its use in the treatment of fluconazole-resistant oropharyngeal candidosis. The oral solution is a new formulation of itraconazole in which itraconazole is solubilised with the use of cyclodextrin. This formulation has a higher bioavailability and leads to higher local concentrations in the oral cavity which are advantages over the solid capsule formulation. Literature, in which the use of itraconazole oral solution was described to treat fluconazole-resistant oral candidosis, is reviewed. In about 55% of the patients signs and symptoms of oral candidosis were resolved after treatment with itraconazole oral solution. Although all the reviewed studies lack data to objectively qualify all the included patients as having a fluconazole-resistant candidosis, the authors conclude, that based on the available information itraconazole oral solution 100 or 200mg twice daily can be effective for fluconazole-resistant oropharyngeal candidosis (OPC) and should be considered prior to salvage therapy with intravenous amphotericin B. The use of itraconazole, however, requires careful monitoring of the patients co-medication for potential serious drug-drug interactions.
