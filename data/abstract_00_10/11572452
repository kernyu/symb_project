Enterocin BC25, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium BC25 isolated from the rumen of cow was purified to homogeneity and sequenced. Twenty amino acids were identified in the peptide chain (TTHSGKYYGNGVYCT-KNKCT), identical to the N-terminal sequence of enterocin A. The DNA sequence of the enterocin BC25 structural gene and putative immunity protein exhibited high similarity to the entA gene. The occurrence of a 726 bp amplicon containing the enterocin A structural gene was studied among gram-positive ruminal cocci by PCR. Our results showed wide occurrence of the entA structural gene among ruminal enterococcal and streptococcal bacterial strains tested, and indicate variable ability to express bacteriocin production and resistance.
