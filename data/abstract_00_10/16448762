Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has been increasingly reported as a nosocomial opportunistic pathogen in debilitated patients, including burn patients. There is, however, only one published report in English that discusses S. maltophilia bacteremia in burns. We performed a retrospective chart review and statistical analysis of the incidence, the duration of hospital stays before a diagnosis of bacteremia, antimicrobial susceptibility, prognosis, and mortality risk factors in burn patients. From January 1996 to December 2004, 14 episodes of S. maltophilia bacteremia in 13 of 666 patients admitted to the burn center at our hospital were identified. The patients, nine males and four females, ranged in age from 1 to 76 years (mean: 42.9+/-24.4 years). Eleven injuries were from flame burns and two were from scald burns. The mean total burned surface area (TBSA) was 47+/-30.2% and mean prognostic burn index (PBI) was 81.7+/-31.3. The average annual incidence was 2.3 episodes per 1000 admissions, and no outbreak cluster was noticed. The mean hospital stay before bacteremia was 19.8+/-11.9 days. Most isolates were susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate (87.5%) and moxalactam (85.7%). The overall mortality was 30.7% (4/13) and correlated significantly with TBSA (P<0.01) and PBI (P<0.05). The incidence of S. maltophilia bacteremia was higher in hospitalized burn patients than in hospitalized non-burn patients. Different antimicrobial susceptibility patterns may exist, especially in different geographic regions. Awareness of the possibility of infection by this opportunistic pathogen and commencement of adequate antibiotics treatment, especially after 3 weeks of intensive care, should be incorporated into the strategy of treatment in major burn patients.
