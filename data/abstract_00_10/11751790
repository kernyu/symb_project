OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of screening specimens and different criteria for exclusion of duplicate isolates when surveillance of antimicrobial resistances is performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trends in resistance were analysed for recent isolates of selected organisms from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals with the use of various criteria for the exclusion of duplicates, including time since the last isolate and antibiogram pattern, and the effect of excluding screening specimens. RESULTS: There was a significant difference of about 8% in the apparent frequency of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus in inpatients if the time limit for duplicates was set at 5 rather than 30 days; it was about 10% if a 5 day limit was compared with a 365 day limit. There was also a significant difference, of 6-10%, in apparent resistance frequencies if isolates from screening specimens were excluded. Apparent gentamicin resistance rates in Klebsiella spp. varied between 11% and 28%, and the number of apparent patient isolates of gentamicinresistant organisms varied by up to 35%, depending on the duplicate exclusion criteria chosen. Effects were smaller, though still significant, for vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus spp. There was little effect for amoxicillin or cefuroxime resistance in Escherichia coli isolates from general practitioners, where the proportion of duplicates was small. CONCLUSION: Improved surveillance of antibiotic resistance is needed. However, care needs to be taken in setting the criteria for classifying isolates as duplicates and in comparing results where these criteria may be different or unknown.
