This study aimed to test the susceptibility of Escherichia coli strains isolated from the water, bottom sediments and individuals cultivated in shrimp farm ponds, to antibiotics belonging to different families, namely B-Lactams: Imipenem (IPM; 10 micro g), Ampicillin (AMP; 10 micro g), Cephalothin (CEP; 30 micro g), Cefoxitin (FOX; 30 micro g), Ceftriaxone (CRO; 30 micro g); Tetracycline: Tetracycline (TCY; 30 micro g); Aminoglycosides: Gentamicin (GEN; 10 micro g), Amikacin (AMK; 30 micro g); Chloramphenicol: Chloramphenicol (CHO; 30 micro g); Fluoroquinolones: Ciprofloxacin (CIP; 5 micro g); Nitrofurans: Nitrofurantoin (NIT; 300 micro g); Sulfonamides: Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (SXT; 30 micro g); Quilononas: Nalidixic Acid (NAL; 30 micro g). In the laboratory, the method of dissemination (Test Kirby-Bauer) was performed in order to fulfill the antibiogram tests. The results showed high indices of resistance to Imipenem, Cephalothin and Ampicillin. Chloramphenicol, Nitrofurantoin, Cefoxitin, Ceftiaxone and Ciprofloxacin have displayed the highest index of sensitive strains. The antibiotic resistance index (ARI) and the multiple resistance index (MAR) varied within the ranges of 0.068-0.077 and 0.15-0.39, respectively. More than 90.5% of strains of Escherichia coli showed a variety of resistance profiles to the tested antibiotics. The high indices of resistance may be a consequence of indiscriminate use of antibiotics, but also the transfer of resistance through mobile genetic elements found in shrimp farms.
