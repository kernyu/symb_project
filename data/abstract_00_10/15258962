The aim of the study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of a salvage therapy initiated after interrupting treatment in patients with virological failure and more than 200 CD4(+) T lymphocyte count. In this prospective study, 77 patients who received failing regimens had stopped completely all medication for 3 months before starting an optimised regimen consisting of 3-5 drugs. Patients were tested for HIV resistance before and after treatment interruption. Discontinuation of therapy for 3 months was associated with a median increase in HIV RNA of 1.1 log(10), a median decrease in CD4(+) T cell count of 136 x 10(6)/L and five clinical events related to HIV, but no AIDS-defining event. Eighty-seven percent of patients showed a shift from a drug resistant genotype to a wild-type genotype based on the major resistance mutations. Forty-seven percent of patients with a genotype shift reached fewer than 200 HIV RNA copies/ml of plasma 6 and 12 months after treatment resumption whereas none of those without a genotype shift did so (P = 0.03). However, the genotypic shift was not associated with a sustained virological response by multivariate analysis. The use of a new therapeutic class of compound in the salvage regimen was the only predictor of the sustained virological response. Salvage therapy with 3-5 drugs after interrupting treatment for 3 months can be a safe and effective strategy provided the HIV disease is not too advanced. Randomised trials in this population are needed to assess the clinical benefit of this strategy.
