OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution of pathogens and their characteristics of drug susceptibility originating from nosocomial infections in the intensive care units (ICU), and to provide evidence for clinical anti-infection treatments. METHODS: Retrospective analysis to the pathogens and their drug susceptibility characteristics was carried out. These pathogens were isolated from the samples that came from patients infected in the ICU from 2002 to 2004. RESULTS: The main nosocomial infective pathogens in the ICU were gram negative bacilli (48.2%), and the next ones were gram positive bacteria (43.3%) and fungus (8.5%). The most common gram negative bacilli were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli; while for gram positive bacteria, the main bacterin were Staphylococcus aureus. The gram negative bacilli could resist 4 or more than 4 antibiotics, and the rate for resistance exceeded 40%. Similarly, oxacillin resistance staphylococcus could resist 7 antibiotics, and the rate was over 50%. The detective rates of ESBLs and AmpC enzymes produced by Escherichia coli and K. peumoniae were 34.0% & 30.7% and 13.2% & 23.1%, respectively. The rate for oxacillin resistance staphylococcus was 66.3%, and there was relative high resistance rate ( > 55%) for most antibiotics: There was statistical difference, compared with that of non-resistant strains. CONCLUSION: Though gram positive coccus still play an important role, most infections are caused by gram negative bacilli of nosocomial infections in the ICU. The antibiotics resistant rate of all bacteria has been rising gradually. It shows strong resistance and multi-drug resistance. The most importment cause for resistance of gram negative bacilli is that the bacteria can produce ESBLs and AmpC enzymes. The antibiotic resistant rate for oxacillin resistance staphylococcus is really high.
