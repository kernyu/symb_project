A case of a young adult with refractory nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is reported. Several treatments had been used without success including steroids, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Immunoadsorption was performed as a last resort to manage the nephrotic syndrome, which led to a drastic urinary protein reduction. We review the literature supporting immunoadsorption in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
