Myeloid-related protein (MRP) 14, an intracellular protein involved in calcium-dependent activation of myeloid cells, presents a differentiation marker for a subtype of macrophages. In experimental leishmaniasis, BALB/c mice succumb to visceral dissemination after infection with L. major, due to a Th2 cell response, while C57Bl/6 mice develop protective immunity associated with a Th1 cell response. We have previously shown that resistance in (C57Bl/6 mice was also associated with a significantly lower percentage of MRP14-positive cells in the infiltrate than in susceptible BALB/c mice. In C57Bl/6 mice, weekly injections of bone marrow (BM) cells enriched with MRP14-positive cells (d1 of culture) did not reverse, but prolonged the course of infection, associated with increased local parasite spread. In BALB/c mice a single dose of an antiphlogistic agent (dexamethasone or lipoxygenase inhibitor) was associated with reduction of infiltrating MRP14-positive cells and also with a decrease of parasite loads in footpads, lymph nodes as well as spleens, and with delayed progression of disease, Double labeling experiments in vitro revealed that at least 43.1% of MRP14-positive mononuclear cells in BM cultures (8h) had phagocytosed parasites after 4 h of co-incubation. Activation by IFN-gamma (20 U/ml) for 24h and 48h did not significantly reduce parasite load in these cells. In contrast, 77.0% of F4/80-positive macrophages (6d of culture) were infected with L. major parasites and these cells responded to activation with IFN-gamma (20 U/ml) with significant reduction of parasite load (25.3%). The protein MRP14 did not have an effect on parasite survival in vitro. Thus, the impaired capability of MRP14-positive cells to kill L. major upon stimulation may be one reason for the adverse course of infection observed with their increased appearance.
