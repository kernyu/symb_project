Multicentre surveillance is essential in order to monitor the prevalence of certain resistance phenotypes and to identify rapidly the emergence of new ones. However, many surveillance studies are based either on a relatively small number of isolates from a single country, or on a large number of isolates from many different countries and so are not equally meaningful. Extensive national multicentre surveillance would provide a more reliable strategy for assessing the extent of antimicrobial resistance in individual countries. This article describes Spanish experience with the surveillance network SAUCE, and summarizes the main results on antimicrobial resistance in the three key bacterial pathogens involved in community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Spain: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
