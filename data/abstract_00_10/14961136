A study was conducted from 1997 to 2001 on the trends of the antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis in a Spanish multicenter study involving 26 hospitals. During the five years of the study the susceptibility by 81,779 strains of P. aeruginosa, 306,689 strains of E. coli and 2866 strains of B. fragilis to at least one antibiotic were studied. When the three microorganisms were considered together, meropenem (3.49%), piperacillin-tazobactam (5.54%) and imipenem (5.27%) were the antibiotics to which they showed the lowest resistance rate.
