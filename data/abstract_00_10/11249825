Streptococcus pneumoniae is a significant pathogen of respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, sinusitis, meningitis, and acute otitis media. Rising incidences of antimicrobial resistance among pneumococcal strains reported worldwide have led to research into and development of advanced antibacterials with improved gram-positive activity. Moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxy quinolone, has been tested against a variety of S. pneumoniae strains, including penicillin-sensitive, intermediately resistant to penicillin, and penicillin-resistant strains. We review the preclinical data corroborated by the available clinical experience to demonstrate moxifloxacin's activity against S. pneumoniae strains, irrespective of penicillin susceptibility.
