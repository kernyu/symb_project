The aim of this study was to determine whether induction of tachyphylaxis to peroxynitrite (induced by giving 10 intravenous injections of a 10-micromol/kg dose) differentially affects the vasodilator responses elicited by systemic injections of the L- and D-isomers of S-nitrosocysteine (L-SNC and D-SNC), in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. L- and D-SNC (12.5-200 nmol/kg, iv) elicited dose-dependent reductions in hindquarter, mesenteric, and renal vascular resistances. The L-SNC-induced vasodilator responses in the hindquarter and renal vascular beds were virtually abolished whereas the vasodilator responses in mesenteric bed were markedly diminished after administration of peroxynitrite. The D-SNC-induced vasodilator responses in the hindquarter and renal beds were slightly attenuated whereas the vasodilator responses in the mesenteric bed were not diminished after administration of peroxynitrite. The vasodilator responses elicited by the nitric oxide donor, MAHMA NONOate (5-50 nmol/kg, iv), were not attenuated by peroxynitrite. The finding that induction of tachyphylaxis to peroxynitrite diminishes the effects of L- and D-SNC but not MAHMA NONOate suggests that the stereoisomers exert their vasodilator effects by mechanisms other than their decomposition to nitric oxide. Moreover, the finding that induction of tachyphylaxis to peroxynitrite causes a more pronounced attenuation of the vasodilator effects of L- than D-SNC supports evidence that the stereoisomers differentially interact with stereoselective S-nitrosothiol recognition sites in the vasculature. Taken together, these novel results support the possibility that peroxynitrite diminishes the vasodilator potencies of L- and D-SNC by oxidation and/or nitration of amino acids in these recognition sites.
