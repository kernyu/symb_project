OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the performance of the OSIRIS video-assisted reading system for disk diffusion susceptibility testing with conventional manual reading. METHODS: Prospectively collected clinical isolates (n = 119) and isolates with well-characterised resistant mechanisms, including extended-spectrum (ESBL) or inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) beta-lactamases producing Enterobacteriaceae (80), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (16) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (14) were studied using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards disk-diffusion technique. The OSIRIS reading (inhibition zone in mm) was compared with manual reading (reference value). RESULTS: Essential agreement (< or =3 mm discrepancy with manual reading) was 91.6% in routine isolates and 94.8% in those with well-characterised resistant mechanisms, respectively. Overall agreement for susceptibility testing interpretation was slightly higher in the former (95.5%) than in the latter (93.2%) group. The presence of ESBL enzymes enhanced variations of measurements due to synergy among amoxicillin-clavulanate and cephalosporins, as a consequence of closer disk placement. The poor growth characteristic of enterococci affected the video reading; on the other hand, there was a high performance with MRSA isolates. Combining all interpretative results, 4.1% minor, 1.0% major and 2.8% very major errors were observed. CONCLUSION: The OSIRIS system is a useful tool for the reading and interpretation of inhibition zone sizes in disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
