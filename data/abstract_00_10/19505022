In article is presented, the analysis of the data of the literature and own researches, concerning molecular-genetic mechanisms of antimycobacterial immunity infringements. The role of the factors defining features of a current and an outcome of a tubercular infection, namely of immunity system condition, feature of infecting microbic Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain biological properties (a genotype, a spectrum of drag sensitivity/resistance), influence of combined antitubercular chemotherapy is disc issed. The opinion is expressed that the given factors are necessary for taking into consideration for working out methodology the personalised preventive maintenance and correction of immunity infringements during pulmonary tuberculosis.
