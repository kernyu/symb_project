Candida albicans produces a virulence-associated immunomodulatory protein (p43), which activates lymphocytes polyclonally, suppresses specific antibody responses to Candida antigens, and potentiates systemic growth of C. albicans. In this study, athymic, unlike euthymic, C57BL/6 mice were resistant to systemic candidiasis and produced lower serum levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10. Pretreatment with p43 stimulated the production of both cytokines. Depletion of IL-10, but not of IL-4, in euthymic animals reestablished resistance and abrogated p43-dependent suppression of the specific antibody response and facilitated C. albicans growth. In agreement with these results, both immunosuppression and p43-mediated facilitation of the fungus growth were abolished in IL-10 knockout mice. These observations demonstrate the relevance of IL-10 in facilitating systemic candidiasis and suggest a critical role for the immunosuppressive virulence factor p43 in the process.
