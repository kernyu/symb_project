Early in the 1950's antibiotic therapy was introduced in humans, as well as in animals. In 1997 48% of the total European antibiotic sales were intended to veterinary use. However, there are significant differences between antibiotic classes regarding either administered quantities or intent for use, e.g. growth factor or therapeutic use. Furthermore, food chain or direct contact may be responsible for antimicrobial resistance through animal-to-human transmission. Although various preventive measures were implemented during the past years, evidence of public health risks has been demonstrated. This should lead to better use of antibiotic therapy not only in animal husbandry but also in medical practice.
