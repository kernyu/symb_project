OBJECTIVE: To investigate the carrier rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to 10 different antimicrobial drugs among children in China. METHODS: Nasopharageal swab specimens were collected from randomly selected 3578 out-patients with upper respiratory infection aged 1 month to 5 years in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou 2000-2002 so as to isolate S. pneumoniae. The susceptibility of these strains to erythromycin and beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime and ceftriaxone) was determinated by E-test MIC method, and the susceptibility to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin was determinated by disk diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of 892 strains of S. pneumoniae were isolate from the 3578 children with a carrier rate of 24.9% (9.0%-36.0%). 634 isolates of S. pneumoniae were tested to examine their susceptibility to chloramphenicol, 199 to ciprofloxacin, and 887 to the other 8 antimicrobial drugs. The insusceptibility rate of S. pneumoniae to penicillin was 39.9%, and the resistance rate was 6.4%. The resistance rate to cefaclor was 20.4%. The insusceptibility rate to cefuroxime was 19.0%. The susceptibility rate to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was 98.5% and that to ceftriaxone was 97.2%. More than 80% of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Chloramphenicol resistance was less common (32.3%) than the resistance to other non-beta-lactam antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin to which the resistance rate was 2.0%. The national insusceptibility rates for beta-lactam antibiotics did not vary significantly during the three years with the widest varying range of 5.1% for penicillin (38.1%-43.2%). Each of the three cities had their different varying patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility, especially for beta-lactam antibiotics. Multi-drug resistance was common (88.7%). Strains of S. pneumoniae insusceptible to penicillin were significantly more common than those susceptible to penicillin (99.1% vs. 78.8%, chi(2) = 50.36, P < 0.001), and strains of S. pneumoniae insusceptible to erythromycin were significantly more common than those susceptible to erythromycin too (95.8% vs. 17.1%, chi(2) = 360.26, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistant S. pneumoniae has already become a serious problem in China. Ongoing surveillance study on the antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae is necessary for appropriate antimicrobial use in clinical work and modification of medical strategies for people's health.
