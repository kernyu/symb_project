OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to know the prevalence and tendency of microorganisms producing urethritis, in men, in the City Centre of Madrid. METHODS: Cross-sectional study. The urethral samples of 1.248 men were analyzed, for 3 years. The samples were studied for: GRAM stain, when secretion exists; culture in habitual plates; detection of C. trachomatis, U. urealyticum and M. hominis, when there was suspicious, study of T. vaginalis and when suspicious injuries exist, study of virus Herpes simplex. RESULTS: The percentage of positive samples was 22.60%. The isolated microorganisms were: U. urealyticum 7.61%, N. gonorrhoeae 6.33%, C. trachomatis 4.81%, M. hominis 0.24%, H. parainfluenzae 1.76%, H. influenzae 1.12%, Candida spp 0.48%, S. pyogenes 0.16% and Herpes virus simplex (2) 0.08%. Two or more microorganisms were isolated in 1.68%. The percentage of positive samples in 2003 was 17.41% and N. gonorrhoeae the most frequent microorganism (6.22%). In 2004 was 25.57% and the most frequent U. urealyticum (10.18%). In 2005 the 24.50% of the samples were positive and U. urealyticum the most frequent (7.92%). The 79.41% of N. gonorrhoeae were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. It is not found resistance to ceftriaxone, claritromicine and amoxicilline/clavulanic acid. The 11.76% were betalactamase- producing. The 26.47% of Haemophilus spp. were betalactamase- producing and all strains were susceptible to cefotaxime. CONCLUSIONS: The isolated microorganisms most frequently were: U. urealyticum, N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. There is an increase of 7% of prevalence between the years 2003 and 2005. Ceftriaxone, claritromicine and amoxicilline/clavulanic acid were susceptible to all the strains studied and cefotaxime to all Haemophilus spp.
