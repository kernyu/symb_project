The molecular characterization of five clinical isolates of vanA-containing vancomycin-resistant enterococci with altered resistance to glycopeptides was examined. One strain represented an IS1216V insertion accompanied by partial deletion of the reading frame of vanX following a transposition event. The other four strains represented IS1216V within the vanX-vanY intergenic region associated with deletion of vanY or vanZ.
