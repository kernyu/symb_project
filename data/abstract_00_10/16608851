Virus infection may induce host cell death by apoptosis, but some DNA viruses are capable of preventing this process. RNA viruses were thought not to display anti-apoptotic activities, as their spread appears to benefit from a rapid induction of cell death. Here, we report an antiapoptotic activity in the Picornavirus Coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4). CVB4 infection of HeLa cells induced negligible apoptosis over a period of 10 h. However, infected cells developed resistance to drug-induced apoptosis using staurosporine and actinomycin D and to death receptor-induced apoptosis using tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Despite this resistance, the apoptotic machinery was nonetheless fully activated in these drug-treated infected cells because the levels of pro-caspase-3 processing to its active form were similar to control cells. However, the DEVDase (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp protease) activity of the processed caspase was significantly inhibited in the virus-infected staurosporine-treated cells compared with drug treatment alone. Likewise, extracts of CVB4-infected cells suppressed recombinant caspase-3 activity in vitro. Immunoprecipitation of activated caspase-3 from radiolabeled virus-infected cells revealed the co-precipitation of a 48-kDa protein that was tentatively identified as viral protein 2BC. Recombinant caspase-3 was found to co-precipitate with virus protein 2BC. Finally, when protein 2BC was expressed in HeLa cells, both staurosporine-induced apoptosis and in vitro caspase-3 DEVDase activity were significantly reduced. Taken together these data imply that CVB4 infection suppresses apoptosis through virus protein 2BC associating with caspase-3 and inhibiting its function. Thus, 2BC is the first reported RNA virus inhibitor of apoptosis protein.
