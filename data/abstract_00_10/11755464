The multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter-proteins P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug resistance protein (MRP) and lung resistance protein (LRP) have been associated with treatment failure. The aim of this study was to investigate prospectively the clinical significance of expression and function of the MDR proteins, considering other prognostic factors, such as age, immunophenotype, and cytogenetics. Mononuclear cells of peripheral blood or bone marrow from 61 patients with de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were analyzed. The monoclonal antibodies JSB1, MRPm6 and LRP56 were used for expression studies. Accumulation and retention studies were performed using the substrates Daunorubicin, Calcein-AM, Rhodamine-123 and DiOC(2) in the presence or absence of the modifiers Verapamil, Genistein, Probenecid, BIBW22S and PSC833. Induction treatment consisted of a 3+7 combination of Ida/Ara-C for patients < or = 60 years of age and a 3+5 Ida/VP-16 combination per OS for patients >60. MDR function was expressed as the ratio of mean fluorescence intensity substrate in the presence of modifier over the substrate alone (resistance index, RI). Patients with advanced age, low CD15 expression and high RI for accumulation of DiOC(2) in the presence of BIBW22S had significantly lower complete remission (CR) rates. No factor was prognostic for event-free survival analysis, which was limited to remitters only. Overall survival was shorter in patients with advanced age, poor prognosis cytogenetics, high CD7 expression, and high RI for Daunorubicin efflux modulated by Verapamil. These results suggest that MDR transporter-proteins have a limited role in the treatment failure of patients treated with Idarubicin-based regimens.
