Since the introduction of antimicrobial agents, resistance has increased steadily across all classes of antibiotics. Organisms vary in susceptibility. Therefore, an antibiogram or susceptibility profile is needed for each infecting organism to determine the most appropriate antibiotic. When the infecting organism has not yet been identified, an informed decision can be made only by obtaining an accurate profile of antibiotic resistance in the hospital, the community, and, in some instances, the world. The appropriate use of antibiotics is correlated with a more favorable clinical outcome and also delays the emergence of resistance. Ensuring such prescribing behavior requires a multidisciplinary approach. Familiarity with the trends and prevalence of antibiotic resistance also facilitates the early identification of individuals harboring resistant organisms. Early isolation can then be initiated, thereby minimizing the risk of nosocomial cross-infection. This article offers a clinician's pragmatic view of antimicrobial resistance.
