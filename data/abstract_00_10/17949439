The susceptibility of 136 Escherichia coli isolates from cases of neonatal meningitis to amoxycillin, ceftriaxone, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was determined in relation to the carriage of virulence factors and phylogenetic group. Only amoxycillin and nalidixic acid resistance was observed (40% and 3%, respectively). Nalidixic acid resistance alone was associated with non-virulent phylogenetic group A (50% vs. 6% of susceptible isolates; p 0.03). No difference in virulence was observed between two representative nalidixic acid-susceptible virulent group B2 isolates and their nalidixic acid-resistant derivatives in a rat model of neonatal meningitis, suggesting that nalidixic acid resistance does not affect the virulence of E. coli strains causing meningitis.
