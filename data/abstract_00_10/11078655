The complete nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance plasmid pAG1 from the gram-positive soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum 22243 (formerly Corynebacterium melassecola 22243) was determined. The R-plasmid has a size of 19,751 bp and contains at least 18 complete open reading frames. The resistance determinant of pAG1 revealed homology to gram-negative tetracycline efflux and repressor systems of Tet classes A through J. The highest levels of amino acid sequence similarity were observed to the transmembrane tetracycline efflux protein TetA(A) and to the tetracycline repressor TetR(A) of transposon Tn1721 with 64 and 56% similarity, respectively. This is the first time a repressor-regulated tet gene has been found in gram-positive bacteria. A new class of tetracycline resistance and repressor proteins, termed TetA(Z) and TetR(Z), is proposed.
