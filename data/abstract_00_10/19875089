PURPOSE: To report the use of topical voriconazole 1% (Vfend; Pfizer Inc, New York, New York, USA) ophthalmic solution for Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) resistant to treatment with chlorhexidine (PerioChip; Dexel Pharma Technologies, Jerusalem, Israel). DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Three eyes of 2 patients with culture-proven AK were treated at a tertiary care institution, and their charts were reviewed. Topical voriconazole 1% was instituted as second-line treatment for AK unresponsive to standard treatment with chlorhexidine and hexamidine. Treatment with voriconazole 1% was started at 1-hour intervals. Improvement was assessed and defined by absence of clinical signs of active infection and visual improvement. RESULTS: One patient with unilateral AK and 1 patient with bilateral AK who remained culture-positive for Acanthamoeba despite ongoing treatment with chlorhexidine and hexamidine were treated with voriconazole 1% topical solution as an adjuvant. Both patients were contact lens wearers. Of 3 eyes additionally treated with voriconazole, 2 eyes had clinical resolution of disease. One eye demonstrated recurrent disease after penetrating keratoplasty that resolved after intrastromal injection of voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: We report the use of topical and intrastromal voriconazole in successfully treating AK in cases of chlorhexidine- and hexamidine-resistant Acanthamoeba. Voriconazole may be a promising adjuvant agent in treating AK.
