The development of new antibiotics is crucial to controlling current and future infectious diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Increased development costs, the difficulty in identifying new drug classes, unanticipated drug toxicities, the ease by which bacteria develop resistance to new antibiotics and the failure of many agents to address antibiotic resistance specifically, however, have all led to an overall decline in the number of antibiotics that are being introduced into clinical practice. Although there are few, if any, advances likely in the immediate future, there are agents in both clinical and preclinical development that can address some of the concerns of the infectious disease community. Many of these antibiotics will be tailored to specific infections caused by a relatively modest number of susceptible and resistant organisms.
