The synthesis of a series of N-aminoimidazoles (NAIMs) with an uncommon spectrum of antiretroviral activity is described. From a group of 60 closely related molecules, we were able to subdivide the molecules in different groups based on their anti-HIV and anti-SIV activity in vitro: (i) molecules acting on a new, immediate postintegration step, (ii) molecules acting on both postintegration and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as NNRTI, and (iii) molecules that mainly act at the HIV-1 RT according to an NNRTI-type mode of action.
