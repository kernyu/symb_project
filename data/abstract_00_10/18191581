Mx is an interferon-induced protein that protects against viral infections. In this study the absolute number of Mx transcripts after poly I:C injection (a synthetic dsRNA) or sole aquabirnavirus (solevirus) inoculation in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis Kaup) has been quantified. Mx expression profiles differed clearly in both experimental conditions; the induction response was faster and more intense after poly I:C injection than after solevirus inoculation. Moreover, pre-injection of soles with poly I:C prior to solevirus infection eliminated the induction of Mx expression associated with this virus. To evaluate the possible interference of poly I:C treatments on solevirus replication, the mRNA levels of the virus capsid protein (VP2) were determined by RT-PCR. VP2 transcripts were hardly detected in poly I:C pre-injected animals from 12 to 72 h after solevirus inoculation. All these data suggest that poly I:C is able to induce an antiviral state that interferes with solevirus replication, and support the suitability of Mx expression analysis as a marker to study the defensive response against solevirus.
