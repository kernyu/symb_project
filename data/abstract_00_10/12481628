For a period of 24 months (1997-1999) were isolated 266 clinically significant staphylococcal strains, S. aureus, 36 (13.5%) and 230 (86.5%) coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) from urines of hospitalised patients (over 14 years) with UTI. The most frequently isolated strains from CNS was S. haemolyicus, 110 (47.8) strains, followed by S. saprophyticus 47 (20.4%) strains and S. epidermidis 18 (7.8%). The susceptibility of the isolates to 13 antimicrobial agents was determined by agar dilution method (NCCLS). From the isolated 36 strains S. aureus, 24 were sensitive and 12 were resistant to methicillin. From 230 CNS, 105 strains showed sensitivity and 125 strains resistance to methicillin. All staphylococci were sensitive to vancomycin and most of them (over 95%) to amikacin and rifampin. It was established a considerable difference between the sensitivity of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The established resistance accompanied with high rate percentage methicillin resistance requires careful consideration to antimicrobial therapy of staphylococcal urinary tract infections (UTI).
