OBJECTIVES: We propose a comparative study of sensitivity to antibiotics of Gram-positive germs isolated in urocultures from patients in ambulatory and two wards with surgical risk (urology and obstetrics-gynaecology), and also to establish the resistance phenotypes of these strains. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 124 strains of Gram-positive cocci were studied: 28 S. aureus strains, 24 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS), 23 Streptococcus aglactiae strains, 1 Streptococcus anginosus strain and 48 Enterococcus spp. strains. The isolated strains came from 4398 urocultures (1889--ambulatory, 1871--urology, 629--obstetrics-gynaecology). Testing of antibiotic sensitivity was performed through Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion method, with automatic phenotyping (Osiris Evolution system). RESULTS: In ambulatory, the wild phenotype was predominant in all isolated strains (33.33% S. aureus, 50% CNS, 100% Streptococcus aglactiae, 60% Enterococcus spp.). In the urology ward, the following multiresistant strains were isolated: 9 MRSA strains (47.36%), 1 MRSE strain (100%), 1 VRE strain (4.34%). In the obstetrics-gynaecology ward, 7 strains showed multiple antibiotic resistance: 4 MRSA strains (66.66%), 2 MRSE strains (50%), 1 VRE strain (6.66%). CONCLUSIONS: Multiresistant strains were isolated in hospital environment, which can be explained by the improper use of antibiotics, the instrumental approach of the urinary tract, and the existence of risk factors in the patients admitted in the above-mentioned wards. Enforcement of efficient nosocomial infection control measures is advisable, as well as a policy for rational antibiotic use.
