Clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) of the bladder is used to imitate normal bladder emptying in patients with bladder dysfunction. CIC is associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) that may be difficult to treat in the case of antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study was to establish the effect and safety of intravesical gentamicin treatment in such settings. In 2009, intravesical gentamicin treatment was started in selected patients. Here we describe our experience with two patients treated until March 2010. Two patients using CIC suffering recurrent UTI with multiresistant Escherichia coli were treated with daily administration of 80 mg intravesical gentamicin. On treatment they appeared asymptomatic. During 8- and 9-month follow-up they were free of UTI, urine cultures were negative and there were no side effects. A systematic review was conducted through searches of PubMed and other databases. Clinical trials that met the eligibility criteria and displayed the efficacy or safety of intravesical aminoglycoside treatment in patients using CIC were studied. Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers. Eight studies were included for review. Owing to study heterogeneity, a meta-analysis could not be performed. Of four controlled studies using neomycin or kanamycin, two demonstrated a significant reduction in bacteriuria, whilst two other trials did not. One case series on neomycin/polymyxin showed that the majority of patients still developed bacteriuria. Three case series using gentamicin all pointed towards a significant reduction in bacteriuria and UTIs. There were no clinically relevant side effects reported but follow-up in all studies was limited. Although data are limited, intravesical treatment with gentamicin might be a reasonable treatment option in selected patients practicing CIC who suffer recurrent UTIs with highly resistant microorganisms.
