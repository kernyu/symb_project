A three week old extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant infected by vancomycin-resistant Leuconostoc spp is presented. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics was successful after the percutaneous inserted central catheter (PICC) was removed. The infection with Leuconostoc spp is rare but should be suspected when vancomycin-resistant organisms resembling streptococci are isolated. Previous pediatric case reports are also summarized and reviewed.
