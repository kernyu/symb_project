BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were monitored during 4 years. In Korea, ciprofloxacin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae has dramatically increased after recommendation as a therapeutic drug. GOAL: The goal of this study was to determine the resistance patterns and characterize Korean ciprofloxacin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. STUDY DESIGN: Antimicrobial susceptibilities were performed. PFGE profile and DNA sequencing of gyrA and parC genes were used to characterize the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates in Korea. RESULTS: Tetracycline, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were increased and among them, the proportion of isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin increased remarkably from 1% in 1999 to 48.8% in 2002. Fifteen different types by PFGE profile were identified. Major alteration type was M12 (67%), which have amino acid substitution in gyrA (S-91-->F, D-95-->G) and parC (S-87-->A). CONCLUSION: We could conclude that resistance for ciprofloxacin was remarkably increased during 4 years. Ciprofloxacin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae was supposed by the spread of several strains that had a small number of origins.
