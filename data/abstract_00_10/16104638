OBJECTIVE: A multicentre evaluation was performed to assess two rapid low-cost methods, MTT (3-[4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and resazurin assays, for testing the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs rifampicin (RMP), isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (SM). METHODS: Thirty coded M. tuberculosis strains were sent to seven laboratories located in Latin America, representing six countries. Each site performed the colorimetric assays, MTT and resazurin, blind for the first-line drugs RMP, INH, EMB and SM. The minimum inhibitory concentration results obtained were compared to the conventional proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. RESULTS: After establishing the breakpoint concentrations, excellent results were obtained for RMP, INH and EMB, with levels of specificity and sensitivity of between 96% and 99%. CONCLUSION: MTT and resazurin assays are promising, accessible new alternative methods for middle- and low-resource countries that need low-cost methods to perform rapid susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis to key anti-tuberculosis drugs.
