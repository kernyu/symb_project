As do many temperate bacteriophages, integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) recruit the SOS DNA damage response to mobilize themselves from the bacterial chromosome and infect other cells. This transfers resistance to multiple antibiotics. Several commonly used antibiotics induce the SOS response, potentially hastening genetic change and the evolution to resistance of pathogenic populations. The use of such antibiotics should be reconsidered.
