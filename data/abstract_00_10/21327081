Controlled nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is an important feature for fine-tuning signaling pathways in eukaryotic organisms. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) composed of nucleoporin proteins (Nups) are essential for the exchange of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. A recent genetic screen in our laboratory identified a partial loss-of-function mutation in Arabidopsis MOS7/Nup88 that causes defects in basal immunity, Resistance (R) protein-mediated defense and systemic acquired resistance. In Drosophila and mammalian cells, exportin-mediated nuclear export of activated Rel/NFkappaB transcription factors is enhanced in nup88 mutants resulting in immune response failure. Consistent with Nup88 promoting nuclear retention of NFkappaB, our functional analyses revealed that MOS7/Nup88 is required for appropriate nuclear accumulation of the autoactivated R protein snc1, as well as the key immune regulators EDS1 and NPR1. These results suggest that controlling the nuclear concentrations of specific immune regulators is fundamental for defining defense outputs.
