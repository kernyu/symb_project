In the present study MRSA prevalence increased from 12% in 1992 to 80.83% in 1999. Indian literature shows that MRSA incidence was as low as 6.9% in 1988 and reached to 24% and 32.6% in Vellore and Lucknow in 1994 and was of the same order in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore in 1996 and in Rohtak and Mangalore in 1999. However, in some of the centres it was as high as 87%. All the MRSA isolates in India including in the present study were sensitive to vancomycin and resistance to netilmycin appears to be low among MRSA isolates in India. All the MRSA isolates were also found to be sensitive to teicoplanin in the present study. Like in other Indian studies, resistance to cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, gentamicin, other penicillins and cephalosporins appeared to be a common feature for MRSA isolates in the present study.
