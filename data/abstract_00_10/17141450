A total of 50 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were tested by the proportion method and the broth microdilution method (BMM) for primary antitubercular drugs. The results were obtained after 14 days of incubation. There was a 100% agreement for all drugs except streptomycin, which showed a 96% agreement. Thus, the BMM was found to be a rapid, reliable, and less labor-intensive method to determine MIC.
