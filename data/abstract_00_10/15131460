Increased resistance of pneumococci and other pathogens to available antibiotics raises concerns about bacteriologic and clinical failure in children with acute otitis media. Few therapeutic options exist for patients with recurrent infections or recent treatment failure. The limited experience from the compassionate use of fluoroquinolones in pediatrics and pediatric studies has not been linked unequivocally with arthrotoxicity, the primary safety concern in children. Newer 8-methoxyfluoroquinolones may have a role in selected cases associated with multidrug-resistant pathogens.
