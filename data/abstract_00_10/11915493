AIMS: To assess the frequency of acquisition of secondary Helicobacter pylori resistant-strains after a first course of antimicrobial treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed during the 1994-2000 period, in 15 girls and eight boys, mean age 10.9 +/- 4.8 years (1.4-17 years), with Helicobacter pylori gastritis (culture and antimicrobial susceptibility) presenting a failure of first course treatment, with during one week a proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin together with either clarithromycin (n = 14) or metronidazole (n = 9). Two endoscopies were performed, the first at the time of diagnosis and the second after the failure of bacterial eradication demonstrated by a positive 13C urea breath test six weeks after the end of treatment. Antimicrobial susceptibility of all Helicobacter pylori strains was tested after each endoscopy and before starting a second course of the treatment. RESULTS: Comparison of antimicrobial susceptibility before and after the first course of treatment showed that Helicobacter pylori strains were all sensitive to amoxicillin, clarithromycin-resistant in eight children (34.7%) before treatment vs 12 (52.1%) after treatment, p = 0.42, ns, metronidazole-resistant in 13 (56.5%) vs 12 (52.1%), p = 0.80, ns, and both clarithromycin and metronidazole-resistant in four (17.3%) vs seven (30.4%), p = 0.63, ns. Among the 14 children treated by a triple therapy including clarithromycin, three (21.4%) developed a secondary resistance to clarithromycin and in one metronidazole resistance was no more detected. Among the nine children treated with a triple therapy including metronidazole, none developed a secondary resistance to metronidazole and one developed a secondary resistance to clarithromycin. CONCLUSION: This study shows the absence of amoxicillin-resistant strains, a high initial clarithromycin-resistant strains level (primary resistance), increasing after a first course of treatment, and for metronidazole a high initial level of resistance not influenced by treatment. Secondary clarithromycin-resistance of Helicobacter pylori strains following the first course of treatment could account for failure of bacterial eradication and suggests the importance of antimicrobial susceptibility.
