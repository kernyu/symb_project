Four Plasmodium species cause malaria in humans: Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread and results in pronounced morbidity. India (population >1 billion) is a major contributor to the burden of vivax malaria. With a resurgence in interest concerning the neglected burden of vivax malaria and the completion of the P. vivax genome, it is timely to review what is known concerning P. vivax in India. The P. vivax population is highly diverse in terms of relapse patterns, drug response and clinical profiles, and highly genetically variable according to studies of antigen genes, isoenzyme markers and microsatellites. The unique epidemiology of malaria in India, where P. vivax predominates over Plasmodium falciparum, renders this location ideal for studying the dynamics of co-infection.
