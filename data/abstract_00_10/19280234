A nationwide susceptibility surveillance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae isolates collected from patients treated at the intensive care units (ICUs) of ten Taiwanese major teaching hospitals was conducted from September 2005 through November 2005. High rates of resistance (intermediate/resistant) of S. pneumoniae to penicillin (85% resistance), ceftriaxone (46%/20%), and cefepime (43%/15%) by meningitis criteria, and in contrast, non-susceptibilities (intermediate/resistant) to penicillin (0%/0%), ceftriaxone (20%/0%) and cefepime (15%/0%) by non-meningitis criteria were noted (p values < 0.05) by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2008. Resistant rate of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin was also high (63%). S. pneumoniae isolates were significantly more susceptible to ertapenem (87%) than to imipenem (39%) and meropenem (44%) (p values < 0.05). Rates of non-susceptibilities of H. influenzae isolates to ampicillin and cefaclor were high (55% and 45%, respectively). No beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae isolates were found. Imipenem has a notably higher MIC(90) value (8 microg/ml) for H. influenzae than that of the other two carbapenems. Tigecycline showed good in vitro activities against these two respiratory pathogens. High rates of resistance among isolates of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae continue to exist in the ICUs of Taiwan.
