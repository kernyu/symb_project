A transformation protocol mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens is described for the sapstaining fungus Ophiostoma piceae. We compared transformants obtained from Agrobacterium with those obtained from yeast-like cells made into spheroplasts and treated with CaCl2. For all putative transformants analyzed, Southern hybridization confirmed that the hygromycin resistance gene had been integrated into the genomic DNA. While all transformants obtained from the treated spheroplasts had multiple copy vector insertion, 85% of the Agrobacterium-mediated transformants had single copy vector insertion.
