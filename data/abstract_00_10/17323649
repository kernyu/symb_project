Novel rifamycins such as ABI-0043, ABI-0369, and ABI-0699 had comparable in vivo bactericidal activity with ceftriaxone against a penicillin-G-resistant, mefA-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae in a murine pneumonia model. ABI-0043 demonstrated a dose-dependent response with a high correlation to bacterial kill (+0.1 to -3.7 log 10CFU).
