We evaluated the activity of ceftobiprole against 100 community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and 100 hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) isolates. Eight isolates were evaluated by time-kill studies for kill rate and potential for synergy with tobramycin. Ceftobiprole MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively, against CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA. In time-kill analysis, ceftobiprole was bactericidal at all concentrations tested.
