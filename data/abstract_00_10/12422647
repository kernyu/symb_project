Activity of levofloxacin (Tavanic) against 10 species of nontuberculosis of mycobacteria was investigated by indirect method of absolute concentrations on Levenstain-Jensen media (levofloxacin concentration 5 and mcg/mL). The investigation was performed on 71 strains of nontubercolosis mycobacteria: Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare--24 strains, M. fortuitum--17 strains, M. chelonae--10 strains, M. malmoense--13 strains and 6 other species of mycobacteria. Susceptible to critical levofloxacin concentration were 8 species of 10. Resistance to levofloxacin (10 mcg/mL) was estimated for 16.7 per cent of M. avium-intracellulare and 30 per cent of M. chelonei strains. It is concluded that levofloxacin may be a drug of choice for management of mycobacteriosis caused by M. fortuitum, M. kansasii, M. xenopi, M. malmoense, and in the most of cases due to M. avium-intracellulare and M. chelonae.
