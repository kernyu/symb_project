Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum mycoplasmacidal concentrations (MMC) of the antimicrobials danofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, spectinomycin and tilmicosin were determined in vitro for 20 isolates of Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides small colony type (MmmSC), the causative agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP). The majority of strains were most susceptible to tilmicosin, followed by danofloxacin, oxytetracycline, florfenicol and spectinomycin with MIC50 values of 0.015, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 8 microg/ml, and MMC50 values of 0.06, 0.5, 8, 8 and 16 microg/ml, respectively. However, tilmicosin had poor mycoplasmacidal activity against two recent strains from Portugal. There was no evidence of resistance to danofloxacin in any of the strains.
