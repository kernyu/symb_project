OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application of differential display-2PCR(DD-PCR) in research on gene expression of Candida. METHODS: Resistance to fluconazole was induced in a Candida albicans isolate 435 from vagina by culturing in YEPD broth with increasing fluconazole concentration in vitro, and the resistant isolate 435-2 (MIC=128 microg/ml ) was obtained after 80 days of incubation. Comparisons between 435 and 435-2 either in fluconazole-containing medium or in drug-free medium were performed with the modified DD-PCR including amplification with long primers, silver staining, reverse dot blot and non-radiographic labeling techniques. RESULTS: Three differential displayed bands were found which showed high homology to alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1), TOP2 and CDR1, respectively. The up-regulating expression of ADH1 and CDR1 associated with fluconazole resistance was further identified by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: The up-regulating expression of ADH1 and CDR1 was associated with fluconazole resistance in Candida albicans, ADH1 might be a candidate of novel fluconazole resistant gene.
