UV radiation suppresses the immune response, a fact which raises the question of whether the phenomenon may find practical applications in the outcome of infectious diseases. In this study, BALB/c mice were exposed to low-dose UVB (250 J/m(2)) from Dermaray M-DMR-100 for 4 consecutive days. Twelve hours after the last UV exposure, groups of mice were injected with 2 x 10(6) Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes. The development of skin lesions, as assessed by measurement of visible cutaneous lesions, was significantly suppressed in low-dose UVB-irradiated mice compared to nonirradiated controls. In order to characterize the cytokines involved in this phenomenon, BALB/c mice were irradiated with identical doses of UVB, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 4 cytokine levels in blood serum and skin were examined at different times by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemical analysis, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Upregulated expression of serum IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was observed from 6 to 24 h. Positive results for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in UVB-irradiated mice were obtained by immunohistochemical analysis. By RT-PCR, the mRNA expression of both IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha cytokines was detected in a time-dependent manner only in UVB-irradiated mice. Histopathological analysis and electron microscopy revealed that cellular infiltration, tissue parasitism, and parasitophorus vacuoles in irradiated mice were markedly less noticeable than those in nonirradiated controls. These results suggested that low-dose UVB irradiation played a pathogen-suppressing role in Leishmania-susceptible BALB/c mice via systemic and local upregulation of Th1 (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) cytokines.
