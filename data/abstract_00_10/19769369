The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of foliar application of glyphosate (Gly) alone, boron (B) alone, and Gly-B combined on seed composition and nitrogen metabolism in glyphosate-resistant soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). No Gly and no B application plants were used as control (C). Results showed that Gly, Gly-B, or B applications increased protein, oleic acid, and total amino acid concentrations in seed. However, oil and linolenic acid concentrations decreased under those treatments compared with the nontreated control. Gly-B combined or B treatments increased B concentration in leaves and seed, nitrate reductase activity (NRA), and nitrogenase activity and resulted in a significant positive correlation between B concentration in leaves and NRA (r = 0.54; P < 0.0001) and B concentration in leaves and nitrogenase activity (r = 0.35; P = 0.005). The results suggest that Gly-B tank mixing may not antagonize B uptake and translocation to leaves and seeds, and the inhibitory effect of Gly on nutrient uptake and translocation may depend on the ion species and form of the nutrient mixed with Gly. These results demonstrate that Gly-B application alters seed composition, nitrogen metabolism, and B status in leaves and seed.
