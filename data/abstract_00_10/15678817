To alleviate the insufficient number of experienced medical teams invited to and accepting to monitor the effectiveness of drugs prescribed to patients with a diagnosis of uncomplicated malaria and to insure the surveillance of the susceptibility of P. falciparum to current antimalarials used in Madagascar, there is a need to draw a feasible study protocol carefully discussed with them. We carried out a preliminary study in two rural areas and assessed the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for curing uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, with a simplified protocol based on the principle of observational study. A single dose of SP was given on day 0 with paracetamol. The persons to whom the drugs were administered accepted two other interventions of one member of the medical teams on day 14 and day 28. Nineteen patients, 3-63 years old, fulfilled the follow-up. The efficacy of this combination was noted for the 19 persons. Our results show that P. falciparum strains are susceptible to SP. Since SP will be used in intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women in Madagascar, one way to delay the occurrence of SP resistant parasites will be (a) to avoid massive use of SP for the non pregnant persons and (b) to monitor susceptibility of P. falciparum to SP as part of pilot studies using standard WHO protocol (which is not really easy for most of the peripheral health facilities--with the follow-up procedures with clinical examination and parasitological control at Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28), and routinely with simplified protocol such as the analytical observational study illustrated in this present study. Limit and advantage of observational study are discussed.
