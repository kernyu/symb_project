The widespread occurrence of antibiotics as contaminants in the aquatic environment has increased attention in the last years. The concern over the release of antibiotics into the environment is related primarily to the potential for the development of antimicrobial resistance among microorganisms. This article presents an overview of analytical methodologies for the determination of quinolone (Qs) and fluoroquinolone (FQs), macrolide (MLs), tetracycline (TCs), sulfonamide (SAs) antibiotics and trimethoprim (TMP) in different environmental waters. The analysis of these antibiotics has usually been carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and to a lesser extent by ultraviolet (UV) or fluorescence detection (FD). A very important step before LC analysis is sample preparation and extraction leading to elimination of interferences and prevention of matrix effect and preconcentration of target analytes.
