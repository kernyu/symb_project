Eighteen patients with multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT), including 4 (22.2%) children aged 12-14 years and 14 (77.8%) adolescents, were followed up. In 89% of cases, 5 drugs were included into the intensive phase of the chemotherapy regimen. The commonest causes limiting the use of the sixth drug were MBT resistance to essential and reserve drugs (41.2%), uncorrectable adverse reactions to the drugs to which sensitivity was retained (30.7%). The intensive phase lasted 5 months; the mean continuation phase was 5.5 months. The reduction in the latter is attributable to the surgical treatment in 38.9% of the patients with sustained decay cavities and bacterial isolation. Treatment should be complex, by applying different treatment options, such as chemotherapy, collapdotherapy, and surgical treatment. After complex treatment, bacterial isolation ceased in 94.4% of cases, decay cavities closed in 83.3%. There were pronounced residual changes in 66.6%.
