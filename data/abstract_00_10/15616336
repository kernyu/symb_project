A pyrosequencing method for detection and quantification of macrolide resistance mutations at positions 2058 and 2059 (Escherichia coli numbering) of the 23S rRNA gene is described. The method was developed and tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium avium, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae.
