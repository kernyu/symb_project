The 31 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were examined for the presence of smr and qacA determinants. The smr gene was found in 15 strains. Fourteen of them were MRSA resistant to quaternary ammonium compounds, ethidium bromide, and acriflavine. One was MSSA strain resistant to ethidium bromide and acriflavine. The qacA gene was found in two MRSA strains resistant to quaternary ammonium compounds, ethidium bromide, chlorhexidine and acriflavine. One of these two strains possessed both smr and qacA genes.
