Treatment of gestational multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is controversial. We describe follow-up of 6 children exposed to second-line antituberculous agents in utero. Each child (average age, 3.7 years) underwent comprehensive clinical evaluation. One child had MDR-TB diagnosed. There was no evidence of significant late-presentation toxicity among the children. The results suggest that aggressive management of gestational MDR-TB may benefit both mother and child.
