BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is an aerobic, gram-negative, glucose-nonfermenting bacterium, which has emerged as a serious opportunistic pathogen. In recent years, the increasing instance of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii producing metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) or OXAtype beta-lactamases is causing a serious clinical problem. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of Ambler class A, B, and D beta-lactamases and their extended-spectrum derivatives in carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates. METHODS: A total of 31 consecutive, non-duplicate, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii were isolated from three university hospitals in the Chungcheong province of Korea. The modified Hodge and inhibitor-potentiated disk diffusion tests were conducted for the screening of carbapenemase and MBL production, respectively. PCR and DNA sequencing were performed for the detection of beta-lactamase genes. We also employed the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR method for the epidemiologic study. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 31 isolates harbored bla(OXA-2)(51.6%), bla(OXA-23)(22.6%), bla(IMP-1)(48.4%),and bla(VIM-2)(3.2%). All of the OXA-2-producing strains also evidenced MBLs. The strains that harbored bla(OXA-23)were isolated only in hospital C, and only in a limited fashion. The ERIC-PCR pattern of the five OXA-23 strains indicated that the isolates were closely related in terms of clonality. The six strains producing IMP-1 isolated from hospital A were confirmed to be identical strains. CONCLUSIONS: A. baumannii strains harboring IMP-1 or OXA-type beta-lactamases are currently widely distributed throughout the Chungcheong province of Korea. The most notable finding in this study was that a bla(OXA-2)-producing A. baumannii harboring MBL, which has not been previously reported, can also lead to outbreaks.
