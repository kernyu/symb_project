Lower susceptibility of previously designed experimental polyresistant variants of Yersinia pestis EV76 (NIIEG line) with inserted R plasmid or transposons to some present antibiotics efficient in the treatment of plague, i. e. doxycycline, amikacin and ceftriaxone, was shown. Clones, more resistant to them vs. the initial variants, were selected. They accustomed in vivo in laboratory animals per se and after administration of antibiotics. The data on the protective activity of the new variants in the treatment of experimental plague after combined vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis are presented.
