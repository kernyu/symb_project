The genome sequencing of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has revealed that secondary metabolism plant glycosyltransferases (UGTs) are encoded by an unexpectedly large multigenic family of 120 members. Very little is known about their actual function in planta, in particular during plant pathogen interactions. Among them, members of the group D are of particular interest since they are related to UGTs involved in stress-inducible responses in other plant species. We provide here a detailed analysis of the expression profiles of this group of Arabidopsis UGTs following infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato or after treatment with salicylic acid, methyljasmonate, and hydrogen peroxide. Members of the group D displayed distinct induction profiles, indicating potential roles in stress or defense responses notably for UGT73B3 and UGT73B5. Analysis of UGT expression in Arabidopsis defense-signaling mutants further revealed that their induction is methyljasmonate independent, but partially salicylic acid dependent. T-DNA tagged mutants (ugt73b3 and ugt73b5) exhibited decreased resistance to P. syringae pv tomato-AvrRpm1, indicating that expression of the corresponding UGT genes is necessary during the hypersensitive response. These results emphasize the importance of plant secondary metabolite UGTs in plant-pathogen interactions and provide foundation for future understanding of the exact role of UGTs during the hypersensitive response.
