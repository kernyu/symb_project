Chronic hepatitis B infection presents a number of challenges to clinicians. There are additional considerations when defining management strategies for individuals with advanced liver disease, or coinfection, or those at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is particularly important. Evidence suggests that suppression of viral replication through nucleos(t)ide analog therapy leads to longer time to transplantation, improved liver function, and improved survival times. The use of interferon in patients with decompensated hepatitis B is associated with serious complications and is currently contraindicated for these patients by the AASLD Practice Guidelines. Hepatitis B coinfection is often associated with more extensive disease. In patients with HBV/HCV coinfection, one disease is usually dominant and consequently should be the focus of therapy. HIV/HBV coinfection increases the risk of progressive liver disease. Therapeutic agents active against both viruses should be utilized at the correct dose to limit the development of resistance. Agents specific for HBV, e.g., entecavir, enable hepatitis to be treated while avoiding the risk of HIV resistance developing. Dual infection with HBV and HDV is particularly challenging. Nucleos(t)ide analogs are ineffective in treating HDV infection, and there is limited data concerning the efficacy of interferon in this setting. The association between chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is well established. In patients at high risk of HCC, screening regimes may be effective. Furthermore, there is an increasing body of evidence indicating that effective suppression of viral replication may be associated with a reduced risk of HCC.
