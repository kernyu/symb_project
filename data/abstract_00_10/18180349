The genetic relatedness of ciprofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected from 1997 to 2002 (n = 82) and 2003 to 2005 (n = 123) was compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Increased genetic homogeneity among the isolates from 2003 to 2005 (cluster analysis; P < 0.001) appeared to be due to expansion of existing clonal groups and to introduction of new PFGE types.
