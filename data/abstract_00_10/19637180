1-Substiuted 6-(3-cyanobenzoyl) and [(3-cyanophenyl)fluoromethyl]-5-ethyl-uracils were synthesized and evaluated in cell-based assays against HIV-1 wild-type and its clinically relevant non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistant mutants. Some of the synthesized compounds showed activity against HIV-1 wild-type in the same range as Emivirine (MKC-442). 3-{[3-(Allyloxymethyl)-5-ethyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-4-yl]fluorom ethyl}-benzonitrile 11b showed moderate activity against the Y181C HIV-1 mutant strain.
