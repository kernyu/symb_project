The incidence of serogroup D Salmonella has been increasing in Taiwan. Most of these isolates belonged to Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and showed a relatively higher rate of resistance to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim than to other antimicrobial agents. The results of molecular experiments indicated that genes responsible for the resistance were located on plasmids. The resistance may occur via horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, the first identification of ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone resistance in serogroup D Salmonella in our hospital is also than they did to other antimicrobial agents cause for concern.
