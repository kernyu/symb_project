BACKGROUND: Recent but scarce reports of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains (MRSA) among children without risk factors associated with its acquisition prompted us to investigate its presence in the community. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the September and October months in 1997, nasal and pharyngeal swabs were obtained from 358 children aged less than five years who attended three day-care centers in the Marianao Area, La Habana City, Cuba. The isolated S. aureus strains were characterized for antimicrobial sensitivity using the Kirby-Bauer method. Methicillin resistance was confirmed by te Oxacillin Salt-Agar Screening-Plate method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: 18.7% of children were carriers of S. aureus in the upper respiratory tract; 2.2% of children carried MRSA strains. The highest resistance levels corresponded to erythromycin (50.74%) and tetracycline (29.9%). All tested strains were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence on the recovery of MRSA strains among healthy children attending day-care centers and are suggestive of a rapid colonization and spread of these microorganisms in the community.
