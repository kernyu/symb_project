AIM: To analyze the clinical features, etiology and evolution of nosocomial bacillary meningitis admitted to the Clinic of Infectious Diseases Iasi between 1988 and 2007. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The data were gathered from the archive of the Clinic of Infectious Diseases Iasi. We studied the clinical and laboratory features of 28 cases of nosocomial bacillary meningitis admitted in the study period. RESULTS: The development of nosocomial meningitis was subsequent to interventions on the central nervous system for hematoma, ventriculo-peritoneal shunts, tumors, rah anesthesia. The symptoms were fever, headache, stiff neck and vomiting. The etiological agents were: Acinetobacter spp--35.71%, Pseudomonas spp.--25%, Klebsiella pneumoniae--17.85%, Escherichia coli--14.28%, and mixed etiology, in 3.57% of the cases each. The treatment was according to their susceptibility, using systemic quinolones and ceftazidime or colymicin. The evolution was favorable in 13 patients and unfavorable in another 15. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial meningitis caused by Gram negative bacilli is a severe infection, with diverse etiology, which raises therapeutical problems due to antibiotic resistance and a high mortality rate.
