It has been known that treatments of post-pneumonectomy empyema are difficult. We report a successful case of irrigation for the post-pneumonectomy. The patient was 68-year-old man with advanced lung cancer. He underwent induction chemoradiotherapy following by pneumonectomy of the right side. A few days later after the chest drain was withdrawn, spike fever appeared. Empyema was suspected, so a 28 Fr diameter double lumen chest drain was intubated again. Turbid effusion was discharged through the drain, in which methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was cultured. Irrigation using a lot of saline and acid electrolyzed water started. A month later, irrigator through the drain was looking clear, however, MRSA was cultured so far. After putting minomycine into the irrigator, MRSA died away. This physical and chemical irrigations were effective.
