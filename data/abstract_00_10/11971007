Using a murine model of susceptibility and resistance to paracoccidioidomycosis, we have previously demonstrated that immunosuppression occurs in susceptible (B10.A), but not in resistant (A/Sn), mouse strains. Accumulating evidence shows that NO is involved in the induction of T cell immunosuppression during infection as well as in the killing of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. In the present work, we focused on NO and other macrophage products that could be associated with resistance or susceptibility to paracoccidioidomycosis. A striking difference was related to NO and TNF production. Macrophages from B10.A mice produced high and persistent NO levels, while in A/Sn animals, TNF production predominated. In in vitro cultures, P. brasiliensis-infected macrophages from A/Sn mice also produced large amounts of TNF, while B10.A macrophages only produced NO. TNF production by B10.A macrophages appeared to be suppressed by NO, because the addition of aminoguanidine sulfate, an inducible NO synthase (NOS2) inhibitor, resulted in TNF production. These results suggested that enhanced TNF or NO production is associated with resistance and susceptibility, respectively. However, regardless of the mouse strain, NOS2-deficient or aminoguanidine sulfate-treated mice presented extensive tissue lesions with increased fungal load in lungs and liver compared with their controls. We conclude that NOS2-derived NO is essential for resistance to paracoccidioidomycosis, but overproduction is associated with susceptibility.
