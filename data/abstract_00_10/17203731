BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to describe the geographical and seasonal distributions of reported human Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) definitive type 104 (DT104) cases, to compare these characteristics to those of non-DT1 04 cases, and to investigate specific antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns in four Canadian provinces. METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed ST cases originating from passive reporting in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan, and every second case in Ontario identified from December 1999 through November 2000 were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 470 human Salmonella Typhimurium cases were identified during the study period. DT104 was the most common phage type, although its incidence varied by province. The proportion of DT104 cases living in urban Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan did not differ from the general population, but in Alberta, the DT104 cases were more likely to live in rural areas. Overall, DT104 isolates were more often R-type ACSSuT compared to non-DT104 cases, and R-type AKSSuT was often associated with DT208. DT104 cases displayed no seasonality whereas non-DT104 cases were more frequent in the summer than in the winter. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that DT104 and non-DT104 cases vary by province, urban vs. rural residential status and by resistance patterns. Lack of seasonality in the DT104 cases may indicate a lesser influence of the agro-environmental route (i.e., farm -manure - water and direct contact) compared to the agro-food route (i.e., farm - animals -food) for these infections. Strain characterization and integration of surveillance information related to ST from animal, food and humans is warranted.
