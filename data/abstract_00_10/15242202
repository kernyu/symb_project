Fifteen (8.4%) of 179 patients admitted with femoral neck fractures carried MRSA. Among 96 patients admitted from their homes, only 2 (2%) were carriers, whereas 13 (15.6%) of 83 patients from nursing or residential homes or long-term-care facilities were colonized (P = .001). Routine prophylaxis with vancomycin is recommended in the latter group.
