A multiplex quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay was developed to detect azole resistance in Candida glabrata, an important opportunistic pathogen that develops resistance rapidly. Resistance was defined as a >or=3-fold increase in CDR1 expression by this assay, which proved to be 100% sensitive and 95% specific in comparison to the gold standard broth microdilution assay.
