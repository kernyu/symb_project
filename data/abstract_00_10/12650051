Occurrence of high-level mupirocin resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains isolated from 18 hospitals in Gdansk area was determined. The study was carried out on 190 MRSA isolated in 1997-2000 from various clinical samples. The strains were tested for high-level mupirocin resistance by 200 micrograms mupirocin disc. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for methicillin were estimated by agar dilution. Sensitivity to other antibiotics was determined in disc-diffusion method and to vancomycin in agar dilution method additionally. The strains were typed by set of 10 experimental phages and compared by the method of PCR-RFLP analysis of coagulase gen restriction fragment length polymorphism. There were low frequency of high-level mupirocin resistance in MRSA strains (4.7%) that were found only in 3 hospitals, in 6 patients. All of them were high-resistant also to methicillin and resistant to doxycyclin, gentamycin, erytromycin, klindamycin, ciprofloksacin, rifampicin, resistant or intermediate sensitive to fusidic acid but sensitive to vancomycin, teikoplanin and bacitracin. The origin all of the MRSA strains high-resistant to mupirocin probably was the same, except one strain, because they were belonged to one genetic type and possessed the same phage pattern.
