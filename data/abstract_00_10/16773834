The aim of this study was to determine an in vitro activity of cefepime against ESBL-positive clinical strains of Gram-negative rods isolated from hospitalized patients. Experiments were performed with 100 ESBL-positive strains of Gram-negative rods isolated from clinical samples in 2004. Strains were identified with the use of automatic ATB Expression system and biochemical ID 32 GN tests (bioMdrieux sa). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were detected by means of disc diffusion methods: the double-disc synergy test (DDST) and the diagnostic disc test (DD, Oxoid Ltd, UK). Susceptibility in vitro of ESBL producers to 4th generation--cefepime was determined with gradient diffusion method Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). MIC value of cefepime was assessed for each strain. Among 100 ESBL-producing strains, 94--belonged to enteric rods and 6--to nonfermentative rods. The greatest number of strains belonged to the species Serratia marcescens (27% of all strains) and next--to the species Enterobacter cloacae (21%). Fourteen strains were susceptible (S) in vitro to cefepime, 12--intermediately susceptible (I) and 74--resistant (R). Application of cefepime in a therapy of infections caused by ESBL-positive strains of Gram-negative rods highly susceptible in vitro to this antibiotic, should be considered.
