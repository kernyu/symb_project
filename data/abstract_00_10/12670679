Mutants of Salmonella Enteritidis selected following exposure to the sanitizer chlorine or to the preservatives sodium nitrite, sodium benzoate or acetic acid show resistance to multiple antibiotics (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin). Complementation experiments with a functional marR restored antibiotic susceptibility of selected mutants to levels similar to wild-type strains, suggesting that mar mutation was responsible for resistance. The multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) operon is a global regulator controlling intrinsic resistance towards structurally and functionally unrelated antibiotics and other noxious agents. Mutants selected after exposure to an inducing agent maintained elevated antibiotic resistance after serial subculture in media void of the inducing agent. Results highlight the importance of monitoring the use of antimicrobial agents to ensure that concentrations capable of inactivating target pathogens are used.
