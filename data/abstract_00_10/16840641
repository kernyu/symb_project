The aims of this study were to describe antibiotic use and biosecurity practices among Washington State dairy producers and to evaluate the effectiveness of a collaborative approach to promoting judicious antibiotic use on dairy farms. In collaboration with a statewide industry group, Washington State dairy producers participated in a written, self-administered survey in 2003. They were then provided several educational interventions followed by a second written survey in 2005. Sixty-five percent (381) of dairy producers completed the 2003 survey. The most commonly cited drugs used for disease treatment were penicillin, ceftiofur, and oxytetracycline. Participants also indicated significant preventive uses with 28% using medicated milk replacer. Most producers appeared to consider intramammary infusion at dry-off to be a treatment rather than a preventative practice. Twenty-three percent of initial respondents indicated at least one extra-label use of antibiotics, yet only half routinely consulted with a veterinarian when doing so. Most agreed that using written protocols for disease treatment could reduce errors, but less than one-third had protocols. After the educational intervention there was a tendency toward reduced use of antibiotic medicated milk replacer: 51% of producers who originally reported using medicated milk replacer discontinued this practice, whereas 12% of producers began using medicated milk replacer between the 2003 and 2005 surveys. Most reported that the resources and educational materials were useful. Areas where additional work is needed include reducing the use of medicated milk replacer, increasing veterinary involvement in antibiotic use decisions, implementing treatment protocols, enhancing biosecurity, and ensuring optimal cow and calf immunity.
