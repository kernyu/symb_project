An important aspect of malaria vaccine development is the identification of an appropriate adjuvant which is both capable of stimulating a protective immune response and safe for use by humans. Here, we investigated the feasibility of using novel immunostimulatory molecules as adjuvants combined with a crude antigen preparation and coadsorbed to aluminum hydroxide (alum) as a vaccine against blood-stage Plasmodium chabaudi AS malaria. Prior to challenge infection, immunization of genetically susceptible A/J mice with the combination of malaria antigen plus recombinant interleukin-12 (IL-12) in alum induced a Th1 immune response with production of high levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and diminished IL-4 levels by spleen cells stimulated in vitro with parasite antigen compared to mice immunized with antigen alone, antigen in alum, or antigen plus IL-12. Mice immunized with malaria antigen plus recombinant IL-12 in alum had high levels of total malaria-specific antibody and immunoglobulin G2a. Compared to unimmunized mice, immunization with antigen plus IL-12 in alum induced the highest level of protective immunity against challenge infection with P. chabaudi AS, which was evident as a significantly decreased peak parasitemia level and 100% survival. Protective immunity was dependent on CD4(+) T cells, IFN-gamma, and B cells and was long-lasting. Replacement of IL-12 as an adjuvant by synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing CpG motifs induced a similar level of vaccine-induced protection against challenge infection with P. chabaudi AS. These results illustrate that it is possible to enhance the potency of a crude malaria antigen preparation delivered in alum by inclusion of immunostimulatory molecules, such as IL-12 or CpG-ODN.
