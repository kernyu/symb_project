The reported requirement of functional Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 for resistance to Gram-negative pyelonephritis prompted us to localize the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA in the kidney at the cellular level by in situ hybridization. The majority of the constitutive TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression was found to be strategically located in the renal epithelial cells. Assuming that the TLR mRNA expression is representative of apical protein expression, this suggests that these cells are able to detect and react with bacteria present in the lumen of the tubules. To gain insight in the regulation of TLR expression during inflammation, we used a model for renal inflammation. Renal inflammation evoked by ischemia markedly enhanced synthesis of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA in the distal tubular epithelium, the thin limb of Henle's loop, and collecting ducts. The increased renal TLR4 mRNA expression was associated with significant elevation of renal TLR4 protein expression as evaluated by Western blotting. Using RT-PCR, the enhanced TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression was shown to be completely dependent on the action of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. These results indicate a potential mechanism of increased immunosurveillance during inflammation at the site in which ascending bacteria enter the kidney tissue, i.e., the collecting ducts and the distal part of the nephron.
