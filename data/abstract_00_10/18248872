OBJECTIVES: To evaluate resin-dentine bond degradation after 1 year of water storage. METHODS: Human dentine surfaces were bonded with two etch-and-rinse self-priming adhesives (Single Bond/SB and Prime & Bond NT/PBNT), three 2-step self-etching adhesives (Clearfil SE Bond/SEB, Resulcin Aqua Prime/RES and Non-Rinse Conditioner with Prime & Bond NT/NRC-PBNT), and five 1-step self-etching adhesives (Etch & Prime 3.0/EP, Prompt L-Pop/PLP, Solist/SOL, Futurabond/FUT and AQ Bond/AQ). Adhesives were applied according to manufacturers' instructions. Composite build-ups were constructed and the bonded teeth were stored (24 h, 6 months, 1 year) in distilled water at 37 degrees C. After storage, the intact teeth were sectioned into beams and all specimens were tested for microtensile bond strengths (MTBS). ANOVA and multiple comparisons tests were applied at alpha = 0.05. Fractographic analysis of debonded beams was performed using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: SB, PBNT and SEB attained the highest MTBS, regardless of the storage period. A significant decrease in MTBS was observed after 6 months for SOL. After 12 months the only groups that did not reduce bond strength were SB and SEB. Bonded specimens in NRC-PBNT, RES and FUT produced pre-testing failures after 12 months, and MTBS could not be measured. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance of resin-dentine bonds to degradation is material-dependent. When the enamel-resin interface is preserved, the etch-and-rinse adhesives and the mild 2-step self-etch adhesive SEB exhibited the best resin-dentine bond durability. Those tested self-etching adhesives having a pH < or 1 and using water or acetone as solvent attained catastrophic bond failure after 1 year of water storage.
