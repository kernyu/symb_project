The aim of performed examinations was the analysis of fungi as etiological agents of blood infections in patients hospitalized in surgical wards, internal medicine wards and intensive care units of the Medical Academy Central Clinical Hospital in Warsaw. Blood samples from patients hospitalized in 1997 were examined. Peripheral blood samples were incubated in BacT/Alert system (Organon Teknika, USA). Positive blood samples were inoculated on Sabouraud medium with chloramphenicol (bioMerieux, France or Oxoid, England). The time of cultivation was from 48 hours to 7 days at 30 degrees C. Fungal strains were identified by standard mycological procedures with the use of chromogenic medium BBL CHROMagar Candida (Becton Dickinson, USA) and biochemical test ID 32 C (bioMerieux, France). Susceptibility of strains to antifungal agents was determined by ATB FUNGUS method (bioMerieux, France). The total number of positive blood cultures in 1997 was 1380. Forty-two fungal strains were isolated from blood samples (3%). Strains belonged to the following species: C. albicans (17 isolates), C. parapsilosis (15), C. glabrata (3), melibiosica (2), C. pelliculosa (2), C. guilliermondii (1), C. tropicalis (1) and T. beigelii (1). Among fungi cultured from patients hospitalized in operative wards dominated C. parapsilosis (11) and C. albicans (10) strains, whereas from patients hospitalized in conservative wards most often C. albicans (6) strains were isolated. Candida strains were mostly susceptible to antifungal agents tested. It was interesting to culture Trichosporon beigelii (T. cutaneum) strain as an etiological agent of fungemia. This strain was multidrug-resistant.
