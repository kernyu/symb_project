Metronidazole (Mz)-resistant Giardia and Trichomonas were inhibited by 1 of 30 new 5-nitroimidazole drugs. Another five drugs were effective against some but not all of the Mz-resistant parasites. This study provides the incentive for the continued design of 5-nitroimidazole drugs to bypass cross-resistance among established 5-nitromidazole antiparasitic drugs.
