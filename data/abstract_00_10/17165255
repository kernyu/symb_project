The data on the taxonomic structure and antibiotic resistance of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from bile of patients with various clinical variants of cholangitis are presented. It was shown that bacteriocholia was registered in 53.3-90.9% of the patients during operations and in 88.9-100% of the patients during the postoperative period. Among bilicultures enterobacteria dominated (93.4% of the cases) with predominance of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. (the total about 70%). The enterobacteria isolates were frequently resistant to ampicillin and amoxycillin/clavulanate (92.6 and 70.4% of the strains respectively), gentamicin and amikacin (74.1 and 22.2%), cefazolin and cefotaxime (88.9 and 37.0%). The resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin (7.4%) was rare, that should be considered while prescribing drugs for empirical antimicrobial chemotherapy.
