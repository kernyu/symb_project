MxA protein production in peripheral blood leukocytes is a valuable marker to evaluate biologic effects of interferon-beta (IFNbeta) therapy in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The three IFNbeta preparations available in the treatment of MS differ with respect to antigenicity and biologic activity. We studied prospectively the induction of MxA protein and the development of binding (BAb) and neutralising antibodies (NAb) in nine relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients during one year of intramuscular IFNbeta -1a (Avonex) treatment. Another nine RRMS patient treated with Avonex for 1-3.5 years were also included. The results were compared with our earlier published data of subcutaneous IFNbeta-1a (Rebif). None of these 18 patients developed NAb but three of the long-term patients developed BAb. The baseline MxA protein levels rose but the induction was weaker compared to Rebif. The stimulation index (MxA after/before IFNbeta-1a injection) remained elevated. Weekly intramuscular dosing of IFNbeta-1a provides a sustained effect on lymphocytes but differences in leukocyte stimulation may underlie some of the differences between IFNbeta therapies.
