A total of 407 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, most of which were resistant to one or more antibiotics, were tested for susceptibility to telithromycin and four other agents. Telithromycin was the most active agent tested, with 98% of isolates susceptible to < or = 1.0 mg/L. For strains resistant to the other antibiotics, susceptibility to telithromycin ranged from 98.6% for strains resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to 94.4% for strains resistant to cefotaxime.
