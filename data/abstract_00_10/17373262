Antibiotics and antiseptics are the treatments of choice for controlling infection. Appropriate use of antibacterial products can help reduce the level of infection, but should be limited to situations in which they have demonstrable benefit. With the continually expanding uses of antibacterials, environmental overload from these agents and the threat of resistance are very real scenarios. Therefore, when antibacterial use is warranted, products that minimize the use of antibiotics and the potential for resistance development should be employed. The two articles in this supplement distinguish antibiotics from antiseptics and address their applications to wound care.
