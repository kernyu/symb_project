Antibiotic resistance is a potential problem around the world. Among the bacteria that cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae is a primary concern.

In this article, Dr Cunha explores the misperceptions about antibiotic resistance and its occurrence, as well as the most appropriate therapy for CAP in the clinical setting.
