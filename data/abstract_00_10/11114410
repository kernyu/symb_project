Innate, non-specific, resistance mechanisms are important barriers to pathogens, particularly delaying virus multiplication at the onset of infections. These innate defense mechanisms include a series of mechanical barriers, pre-existing inhibitory molecules, and cellular responses with antimicrobial activity. The antiviral activities of these innate inhibitors reside in a variety of partly characterized substances. This review presents the innate antiviral inhibitors in cell cultures, urine, serum, the gastrointestinal tract, the nervous system, tissues of crustaceans, and saliva. Medical adaptation of the innate antiviral defense mechanisms may be useful for prevention and treatment of viral infections.
