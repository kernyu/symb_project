BACKGROUND: Triple therapy with proton pump inhibitors or ranitidine bismuth citrate, clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or nitroimidazole derivatives are the present gold standards for cure of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, primary resistance to either clarithromycin or nitroimidazole derivatives is increasing and alternative therapies are needed. AIM: To determine the efficacy and safety of three regimens consisting of amoxicillin and tetracycline or doxycycline combined with either lansoprazole or ranitidine bismuth citrate. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy H. pylori infected patients were randomly given one of the following treatments: amoxicillin 1 g twice a day (b.i.d.) plus tetracycline 500 mg four times a day (q.i.d.) with either lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. (group LAT) or ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.i.d. (group RBCAT) for 7 days and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. plus doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d. and lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. for 14 days (group LAD). Eradication rate was assessed by UBT at 4-6 weeks after therapy. RESULTS: The three groups (LAT, RBCAT, and LAD) of patients achieved eradication rates of 35% (25-45), 20% (12-29) and 36% (25-46), respectively, on intention-to-treat analysis. Patient compliance was optimal and side-effects minimal in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although the amoxicillin/tetracycline combination is attractive (inexpensive, safe, and with low primary resistance rate), it can not be recommended for H. pylori eradication.
