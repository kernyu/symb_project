PURPOSE: To investigate antibiotic utilization in a rural district of western Nepal that is currently receiving azithromycin as part of a trachoma program and is being monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for drug resistance. METHODS: Antibiotic purchase receipts were collected for 3 months from all medicine halls, pharmacies, and government sub-health posts in a sub-district of Western Nepal. Supplementary surveys of antibiotic sales were performed in different seasons. RESULTS: Macrolides account for 3.9% of total antibiotic use, far less than quinolones, penicillins, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides. CONCLUSIONS: If trachoma programs in Western Nepal generate transient macrolide resistance in pneumococcus and other bacteria, the epidemiological impact may not be great, as macrolides are not commonly used in the area.
