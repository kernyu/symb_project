Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium caprae are zoonotic bacteria that cause tuberculosis with several clinical manifestations. We have evaluated the susceptibility to anti-tuberculosis drugs of a panel of Spanish isolates of animal origin. The analysis of the sequence of the main genes involved in resistance was performed in 41 M. bovis and five M. caprae. The katG, inhA, rpsL, embB and gyrA genes had single nucleotide polymorphisms, not previously described in other organisms of the complex. Thirty-two M. bovis and three M. caprae isolates were tested for susceptibility to isoniazid (INH), rifampin, streptomycin, ethambutol, and ofloxacin using the standard proportion method. The results revealed that the isolates were sensitive to the five drugs. However, interference caused by sodium pyruvate in the INH test was detected: 94.3% grew at 0.2 microg INH/ml and 68.6% grew at 1 microg INH/ml. In the medium without pyruvate, 34.3% of the isolates did not grow whereas growth of the others was poor and slow. Nine M. bovis isolates were also tested by ESP Culture System II test and were sensitive to INH. The susceptibility of M. bovis to INH cannot be reliably determined using the standard proportion method due to the M. bovis growth requirements and the interference of pyruvate with INH.
