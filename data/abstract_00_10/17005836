Clostridium difficile isolates from a 2004 outbreak in Quebec, Canada, were all found to be susceptible to metronidazole, vancomycin, rifampin, and meropenem but resistant to bacitracin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin, and most (>80%) were resistant to ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The predominant NAP1 isolates were susceptible to clindamycin, while the NAP2 isolates were resistant.
