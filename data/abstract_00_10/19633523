Treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is a challenge. We describe a young child with pulmonary XDR-TB who did not respond to an aggressive multidrug-resistant TB treatment regimen, but was cured with linezolid in combination with other reserve antituberculous drugs. No serious adverse events were observed during 19 months of treatment for XDR-TB.
