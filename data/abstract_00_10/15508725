DNA sequences of Mycobacterium leprae in particular regions of the gyrA, rpoB, and folP genes responsible for resistance to new quinolones, rifampicin and dapsone, respectively, were analyzed. Among 88 isolates of M. leprae from leprosy patients in Japan, Haiti, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines, eleven isolates had mutational changes in 2 genes (resistance to 2 drugs), and 2 isolates (Shinsei-1 and Zensho-4) showed mutations in 3 genes (resistance to 3 drugs). These findings are suggesting emergence of multi-drug resistant M. leprae.
