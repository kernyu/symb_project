A 17-year-old girl developed refractory rhabdomyosarcoma. An allogeneic peripheral-blood stem-cell transplant was performed after a myeloablative regimen. Although rapid disease progression had resolved transiently, after the start of high-dose chemotherapy, re-progression was apparently observed from day 14. However, delayed tumor regression occurred on day 30, shortly after the reduction of immunosuppressants. She achieved a partial remission. The second tumor regression provides suggestive clinical evidence that graft-versus-tumor effect may occur against rhabdomyosarcoma. Although further investigation is required, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation could provide a new therapeutic option for refractory rhabdomyosarcoma.
