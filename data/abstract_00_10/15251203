This study was designed to investigate the individual or combined effects of sanitizers on survival of planktonic or sessile Listeria monocytogenes cells at different phase of growth. The sanitizers tested included: (i) acetic acid (pH 5.0), (ii) NaOH (pH 12.0), (iii) 10% Na2SO4, (iv) 10% Na2SO4 and acetic acid (pH 5.0), (v) 10% Na2SO4 and NaOH (pH 12.0), (vi) a quaternary ammonium (20 ppm) and (vii) glyceryl monolaurate (75 ppm). Results revealed a great efficacy of alkaline treatments on both sessile and planktonic cells with a slightly higher resistance of 6 h biofilms. Quaternary ammonium appeared very effective in killing more than 98% of cells, but a resistance of 7 days biofilm was observed. Other sanitizers did not succeed in inhibiting totally the pathogen but acted in a similar way on both sessile and planktonic cells. Renewing the medium or not do not seem to be the major cause of a resistance emergence.
