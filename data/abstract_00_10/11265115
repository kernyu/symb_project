The following topics are described: 1. chemistry of beta-lactamases; 2. beta-lactamases from Streptomyces including distribution of beta-lactamases in actinobacteria, properties of beta-lactamases from Streptomyces, cloning and regulatory mechanism of expression of beta-lactamase genes from Streptomyces and evolution and classification of beta-lactamases in general; 3. penicillin-binding proteins from Streptomyces including beta-lactam-producing- and non-producing strains and 4. eukaryotic-type protein kinases from Streptomyces including cloning of the genes and evolution and classification of eukaryotic-type protein kinases in general.
