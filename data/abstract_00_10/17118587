Interaction of norfloxacin and ofloxacin with copper(II) and copper(II)/phenanthroline has been studied in aqueous solution and the stability constants of the binary complexes Cu(II)/fluoroquinolone and of the ternary complexes Cu(II)/phenanthroline/fluoroquinolone have been determined by potentiometry and UV-vis spectrophotometry. The stability constants for the binary and ternary complexes of norfloxacin were always higher than those found for ofloxacin and comparing the values obtained for the binary and ternary species (DeltalogK) it is possible to conclude that the ternary complexes are more stable than the binary ones, suggesting that an interaction occurs between the ligands in the ternary complexes. From the distribution diagrams it is possible to state that at physiological pH 7.4, the copper ternary complexes, are the main species in solution not only at the concentration used to determined the stability constants but also at the minimum inhibitory concentration. The antibacterial activity of these complexes, in different bacterial strains, was determined, at physiological pH, and the results obtain show that these ternary complexes may be good candidates as metalloantibiotics.
