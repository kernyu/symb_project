In AIDS vaccine strategies, live attenuated vaccines can confer good resistance against pathogenic virus infections but have the potential risk of inducing disease, whereas safer replication-negative strategies such as DNA vaccinations have so far failed to prevent the disease onset. Here, we developed a novel DNA vaccine strategy to induce restricted replication of an avirulent virus and evaluated it in a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection model. We generated a chimeric SIV, FMSIV, by replacing SIV env with ecotropic Friend murine leukemia virus (FMLV) env to confine its replication to FMLV receptor (mCAT1)-expressing cells. In primate cells lacking mCAT1, FMSIV did not replicate unless mCAT1 was introduced exogenously. Vaccination to macaques with both the FMSIV DNA and the mCAT1-expression plasmid DNA induced SIV Gag-specific cellular immune responses and resistance against pathogenic SIV(mac239) challenge more efficiently than the replication-negative control vaccination with the FMSIV DNA alone. This strategy may be useful for development of safe and effective vaccines against various kinds of pathogenic viruses.
