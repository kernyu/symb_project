Since some antiviral drugs have a broad spectrum of action, the aim of this study was to assess whether o-(acetoxyphenyl)hept-2-ynyl sulphide (APHS), a recently described inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, has an effect on the replication of other retroviruses, (-) and (+) RNA viruses and DNA viruses. APHS did not affect the replication of feline immunodeficiency virus, HIV-2 and a HIV-1 strain resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). APHS could also not inhibit the replication of the RNA viruses, respiratory syncytium virus or mouse hepatitis virus. In contrast, APHS did inhibit the replication of wild-type herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as well as acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 and HSV-2 mutant. These results suggest that APHS is a NNRTI of HIV-1 replication, but not HIV-2 replication, and that APHS is an inhibitor of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication.
