So far the prevalent method of the identification of pneumococci in the routine diagnostic practice has included three tests: sensitivity to optoxin, solubility in biliary salts and reaction with omniserum. At present optoxin-resistant pneumococcal strains, as well as those giving dual reaction to solubility in biliary salts, occur sufficiently often thatconsiderably complicates the identification of this infective agent. We have summarized experience in the isolation of S. pneumoniae strains, resistant to optoxin and not soluble in biliary salts; in addition, the prospects of introducing the complex approach to the identification of a given culture with the use of molecular diagnostic methods into daily practice are evaluated.
