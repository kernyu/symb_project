The results of the laboratory diagnosis of respiratory tract candidiasis in patients with tuberculosis of the respiratory organs within 2-year observation in a tuberculosis clinic were generalized. The species composition of 327 isolates of the pathogens of the respiratory tract mycotic infection and the frequency of their detection in the specimens of various clinical material from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were determined. The data on the resistance of the Candida spp. isolates to 6 antifungal drugs are presented. The number of the strains resistant to azol drugs (intraconazol and fluconazol) amounted to 10% of the total number of the Candida spp. isolates.
