Mortality due to severe bacterial infections has not been markedly effected by the introduction of new antimicrobial drugs over the last 30-40 years. This has emphasized the need for development of new therapeutic strategies to combat sepsis. The outcome of an infection depends on two factors: the growth of the microorganisms (including the effect of antibacterial drugs), and the host's defensive response to the invading organism. It is known that injection of bacterial products into experimental animals leads to enhanced nonspecific resistance to a variety of microorganisms. The discovery of the specific mediators responsible for modulation of host defense has created new possibilities for the development of alternative treatment strategies. Molecules such as interleukins, interferons, tumor necrosis factors and hematopoietic growth factors have become available in recombinant form, and their therapeutic potential in various infectious diseases has been tested in various experimental models of infections. Initial data in various patient groups indicate that adjunctive therapy with recombinant proinflammatory cytokines may have beneficial effects in the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
