We herein present a case of a 75-year-old female with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the transverse colon with the stage IE (Ann Arbor classification). Colonoscopy revealed the tumor's appearance as a IIa plus II c-like early colon cancer as defined according to the macroscopic classification of the Japanese Research Society for Cancer of Colon, Rectum and Anus, measuring less than 2 cm in diameter. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as MALT lymphoma because of the presence of lymphoepithelial lesions consisting of diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphocytes and glandular destruction. The majority of these lymphocytes immunohistochemically stained for the B-lymphocyte marker. The patient first underwent H pylori eradication therapy with Lansap. However, the tumor size gradually increased over the next 4 mo and the patient eventually underwent surgical resection. The operative procedure included a partial colectomy with dissection of the paracolic lymph nodes. The tumor measured 45 mm multiply 30 mm in diameter and histological examination showed that the lymphoma cells had infiltrated the muscle layer of the colon without nodal involvement. The patient has had no recurrence postoperatively without any chemotherapy.
