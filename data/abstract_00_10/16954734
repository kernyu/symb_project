The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether enfuvirtide can be discontinued in patients on long-term viral suppression. Eight patients with multidrug-resistant virus were randomly assigned to stop and 10 subjects to continue enfuvirtide. At week 48, viral rebound occurred in five (62.5%) and in no patients, respectively, (P = 0.007). The CD4 cell decrease in failure patients was 5% (P = ns). These results suggest that enfuvirtide should be maintained until new active drugs became available.
