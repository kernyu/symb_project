BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Diarrhoeal disease outbreaks are causes of major public health emergencies in India. We carried out investigation of two cholera outbreaks, for identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, phage typing and molecular characterization of isolated Vibrio cholerae O1, and to suggest prevention and control measures. METHODS: A total of 22 rectal swabs and 20 stool samples were collected from the two outbreak sites. The V. cholerae isolates were serotyped and antimicrobial susceptibility determined. Pulsed- field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to identify the clonality of the V. cholerae strains which elucidated better understanding of the epidemiology of the cholera outbreaks. RESULTS: Both the outbreaks were caused by V. cholerae O1 (one was caused by serotype Ogawa and the other by serotype Inaba). Clinically the cases presented with profuse watery diarrhoea and dehydration. All the tested V. cholerae isolates were sensitive to tetracycline, gentamycin and azithromycin but resistance for ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, and furazolidone. PFGE pattern of the isolates from the two outbreaks revealed that they were clonal in origin. Stoppage of the source of water contamination and chlorination of drinking water resulted in terminating the two outbreaks. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The two diarrhoeal outbreaks were caused by V. cholerae O1 (Inaba/Ogawa). Such outbreaks are frequently seen in cholera endemic areas in many parts of the world. Vaccination is an attractive disease (cholera) prevention strategy although long-term measures like improvement of sanitation and personal hygiene, and provision of safe water supply are important, but require time and are expensive.
