Eukaryotic cells have developed diverse strategies to combat the harmful effects of a variety of stress conditions. In the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the increased concentration of ethanol, as the primary fermentation product, will influence the membrane fluidity and be toxic to membrane proteins, leading to cell growth inhibition and even death. Though little is known about the complex signal network responsible for alcohol stress responses in yeast cells, several mechanisms have been reported to be associated with this process, including changes in gene expression, in membrane composition, and increases in chaperone proteins that help stabilize other denatured proteins. Here, we review the recent progresses in our understanding of ethanol resistance and stress responses in yeast.
