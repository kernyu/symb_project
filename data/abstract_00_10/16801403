Cefovecin is a new extended-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin indicated for the treatment of bacterial infections in dogs and cats. This study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of cefovecin against 2,641 recent clinical isolates (1,660 canine and 981 feline isolates) from Europe and the United States. MIC determinations against cefovecin and other reference antimicrobials were performed by broth microdilution methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS). Cefovecin demonstrated bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Cefovecin exhibited in vitro activity against all major aerobic and anaerobic bacterial pathogens associated with skin, urinary tract, and periodontal infections in dogs and cats. The MIC90 values of cefovecin against Staphylococcus intermedius, Escherichia coli, and Pasteurella multocida were 0.25 microg/ml, 1.0 microg/ml, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. No significant differences were observed in terms of the activities of cefovecin against pathogens from different European countries and against pathogens of European and U.S. origin.
