We studied the isolation of Shigella spp., and their antimicrobial resistance. S. flexneri (54 %) was most frequently isolated, followed by S. dysenteriae (20 %), S. boydii (16 %) and S. sonnei (10 %). Among S. flexneri (n = 122), 29 (24 %) were 2a, and 23 (19 %) were 2b. None of the Shigella strains were resistant to mecillinam or ciprofloxacin. Resistance to nalidixic acid was most frequent among S. dysenteriae type 1 (100%) followed by S. flexneri 2a (69%), and S. flexneri 2b (52 %). Systematic monitoring is needed to identify most prevalent serotypes, and to detect changes in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern.
