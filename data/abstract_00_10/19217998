INTRODUCTION: The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) has modified the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Our aim was to investigate the epidemiological features of IPD before and after implementing the use of PCV-7. METHODS: All invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated in our hospital from 2000 to 2006 were included. Serotypes were identified and antibiograms were performed in all cases. Data obtained before (2000-2001) and after (2004-2006) authorization of PCV-7 use in Spain were compared. RESULTS: There were 241 cases of IPD. None of the patients with IPD aged 2 years or younger had received PCV-7. PCV-7 coverage in children aged 5 or younger was about 48%. There was a non-significant increase in the incidence of IPD in children (from 53.8 to 57.8 cases/100 000 population), with no change in adults. When IPD incidence was adjusted by the number of blood samples collected, there was a non-significant decrease in both children and adults. Since PCV-7 came on the market, there has been a decrease in vaccine serotypes and an increase in non-vaccine serotypes. The emergent serotypes since that time include 3, 6A, 15, and 19A. Penicillin resistance decreased significantly (p<0.001) from the pre-vaccine period (87.3%) to 2003 (13.8%), and later rose from 2003 through 2006 (41.7%). Erythromycin resistance showed no changes during the study. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IPD in children aged 2 years and younger in Gran Canaria has not decreased despite the introduction of PCV-7. However, there has been a reduction in the number of cases related to vaccine serotypes and a significant decrease in penicillin resistance. In contrast, non-vaccine serotype IPD cases have increased. Universal vaccination and the use of new polyvalent vaccines may enhance these effects.
