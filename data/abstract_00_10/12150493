In recent years, antibacterial resistance among respiratory pathogens implicated in community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs) has spread worldwide at an alarming rate. Thus, there is a pressing need for new antibacterials that retain activity against resistant organisms, have a low potential to select for resistance and do not induce cross-resistance. Telithromycin is the first of a new class of antibacterials - the ketolides - that have been designed specifically to overcome resistance among respiratory tract pathogens. This paper presents the first results of the PROTEKT study (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin), a worldwide surveillance study initiated to chart the prevalence of important resistance phenotypes and genotypes and the comparative activity of telithromycin against such strains. Analysis of over 7,000 bacterial isolates by April 2001 has confirmed the notable prevalence of strains resistant to commonly prescribed RTI antibacterials for all the pathogens studied. Telithromycin demonstrates high activity against isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, irrespective of penicillin G, macrolide or fluoroquinolone resistance. Telithromycin is also highly active against other respiratory tract pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes and beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. These data justify the assertion that telithromycin is a promising new candidate for the empirical treatment of community-acquired RTIs, particularly in the face of increasing antibacterial resistance.
