Francisella tularensis is the intracellular gram-negative coccobacillus that causes tularemia, and its virulence and infectiousness make it a potential agent of bioterrorism. Previous studies using mononuclear leukocytes have shown that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of F. tularensis is neither a typical proinflammatory endotoxin nor an endotoxin antagonist. This inertness suggests that F. tularensis LPS does not bind host LPS-sensing molecules such as LPS-binding protein (LBP). Using priming of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) oxidase as a measure of endotoxicity, we found that F. tularensis live vaccine strain LPS did not behave like either a classic endotoxin or an endotoxin antagonist in human PMNs, even when the concentration of LBP was limiting. Furthermore, F. tularensis LPS did not compete with a radiolabeled lipooligosaccharide from Neisseria meningitidis for binding to LBP or to the closely related PMN granule protein, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein. Our results suggest that the inertness of F. tularensis LPS and the resistance of F. tularensis to oxygen-independent PMN killing may result from the inability of F. tularensis LPS to be recognized by these important LPS-sensing molecules of the innate immune system.
