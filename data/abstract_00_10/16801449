Genetic and functional characterization of the cephalosporinases produced by 65 clonally unrelated clinical Escherichia coli isolates revealed genetic diversity of the ampC genes and showed that Gln287, Cys287, Pro296, Leu298, and Phe350 substitutions were involved in extension of the hydrolysis spectrum to include ceftazidime and cefepime.
