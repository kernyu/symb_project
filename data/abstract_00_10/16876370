We describe a case of necrotizing pneumonia in Greece caused by a community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) producing Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) carrying the staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) type V. The pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern of this strain differed significantly from the PVL-positive multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)-80 clone of MRSA, which predominates in Greece and in Europe. Further analysis of this strain revealed that it belonged to the agr1 allele type, and its resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and kanamycin was associated to the presence of aac-(6')-Ie+aph(2') gene. This is the 1st report that documents the emergence of CA-MRSA with PVL genes in combination with the SCCmec type V in Europe.
