Fifty-nine clinical strains of bacteria, isolated from patients in the Regional Hospital of Talca, were studied. Seventy-four percent of these strains produced antibacterial substances, in comparison with 18% of the same bacterial species obtained from patients from a non-hospital habitat. Almost all the bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients demonstrated in vitro resistance to different antimicrobial agents. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent species producing antibacterial substances and its products were of high potency, with a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Cure of plasmid DNA, in most of the antibacterial-producer strains, resulted in the loss of their lethal activity and they also became susceptible in vitro to anti-microbials. These results indicated that such properties are encoded in extrachromosomal DNA. We believe that the knowledge of the antimicrobial activity and resistance to antimicrobials of bacteria from a hospital habitat can help explain the selection and persistence of such strains in this particular ecological niche.
