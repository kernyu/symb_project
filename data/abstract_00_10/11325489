BACKGROUND: Docetaxel in combination with gemcitabine is an active front-line chemotherapy regimen against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with acceptable toxicity. A multicenter phase II study was conducted in order to determine the toxicity and efficacy of this combination, as salvage treatment in patients progressing after a cisplatin-based front line regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with histologically confirmed, bidimensionally measurable NSCLC, who failed prior cisplatin-based chemotherapy were enrolled. The patients' median age was 62.5 years, 29 (91%) were male, 23 (72%) had disease stage IV, and 22 (69%) had a performance status (WHO) 0-1. Gemcitabine (900 mg/m(2)) was administered on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) on day 8, after appropriate premedication. rhG-CSF (150 microg/m(2)) was given prophylactically from day 9 to 15. Treatment was repeated on an outpatient basis every three weeks. RESULTS: A total of 127 chemotherapy cycles were administered. In an intention-to-treat analysis five patients (15.6%; 95% CI: 3.04-28.21%) achieved a partial response, 11 (34.4%) stable disease, and 16 (50%) progressive disease. The median duration of response was 9 months, the median TTP 7 months, and the overall median survival 6.5 months; the overall 1-year survival probability was 27.6%. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in five (15.6%) patients and in two of them associated with fever. Grade 3 anemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in three (9%) and two (6.5%) patients, respectively. Non-hematologic toxicity was very mild with only one episode of grade 4 diarrhea and mucositis, respectively; two (6%) patients complained for grade 3 asthenia. CONCLUSION: The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel with prophylactic use of rhG-CSF is a safe and well-tolerated regimen for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC, who failed front-line treatment with cisplatin-based regimens.
