A zinc ion-sensitive mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis was isolated. The transposon insertion was located in zitA (MSMEG0750), a gene coding for a cation diffusion facilitator family protein. Zinc ions specifically induced expression of zitA. In silico analysis revealed that environmental and opportunistic pathogenic species contain higher numbers of cation diffusion facilitator genes than do obligate pathogens.
