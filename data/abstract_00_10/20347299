A series of 4-substituted 4-(1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)piperidine building blocks was synthesized and introduced to the C7 position of the quinolone core, 7-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, to afford the corresponding fluoroquinolones in 40-83% yield. The antibacterial activity of these new fluoroquinolones was evaluated using a standard broth microdilution technique. Among them, the quinolone 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-7-(4-(4-formyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl)-4-oxo -1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (34.15) exhibited comparable antibacterial activity against quinolone-susceptible and multidrug-resistant strains, especially to Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, in comparison with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.
