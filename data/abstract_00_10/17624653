Methionine sulfoxide reductase A overexpressing WI-38 SV40 human fibroblasts have been previously shown to exhibit higher resistance to oxidative stress by decreasing intracellular reactive oxygen species content and oxidative damage to proteins [C.R. Picot, I. Petropoulos, M. Perichon, M. Moreau, C. Nizard, B. Friguet, Overexpression of MsrA protects WI-38 SV40 human fibroblasts against H(2)O(2)-mediated oxidative stress, Free Radic Biol Med 39 (2005) 1332-1341]. In order to get further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance to oxidative stress, proteins that are differentially expressed in methionine sulfoxide reductase A overexpressing cells were identified by 2D gel and Western blot quantitative analyses. Five proteins were shown to be differentially expressed and were identified by mass spectrometry, some of them were related to either cellular protection against oxidative stress, apoptosis or premature ageing.
