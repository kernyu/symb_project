We evaluated the mutations in a 193bp of the rpoB gene by automated sequencing of rifampicin (RMP)-resistant and susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from Brazil (25 strains) and France (37 strains). In RMP-resistant strains, mutations were identified in 100% (16/16) from France and 89% (16/18) from Brazil. No mutation was detected in the 28 RMP-susceptible strains. Among RMP-resistant or RMP-susceptible strains deletion was observed. A double point mutation which had not been reported before was detected in one strain from France. Among French resistant strains mutations were found in codons 531 (31.2%), 526, 513 and 533 (18.7% each). In Brazilian strains the most common mutations were in codons 531 (72.2%), 526 (11.1%) and 513 (5.5%). The heterogeneity found in French strains may be related to the fact that most of those strains were from African or Asian patients.
