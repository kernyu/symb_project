Intestinal epithelial cells can secrete interleukin-8 (IL-8), among other substances in response to different stimuli, which plays an important role in mucosal immune response. Above a certain concentration range, hydrogen peroxide causes cell death by necrosis or apoptosis. We investigated the time- and dose-dependent induction of IL-8 by hydrogen peroxide in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2. In addition, the changes of transepithelial electrical resistance and cell death induction in response to hydrogen peroxide were studied. Nonfilter-grown and filter-grown Caco-2 cells were employed in our experiments. Interleukin-8 synthesis was measured by ELISA. Necrosis was determined by DAPI staining of cells, apoptosis by measuring caspase-3 enzyme activity or annexin V staining. In nonfilter-grown Caco-2 cells, 1 mM of hydrogen peroxide induced the highest level of IL-8 production 24 hr after treatment. In filter-grown Caco-2 cells, IL-8 was produced only on the apical side in response to 1 mM of hydrogen peroxide. This level was 10-fold lower than that measured in nonfilter-grown Caco-2 cells 24 hr after the treatment. In filter-grown Caco-2 cells 10 mM hydrogen peroxide induced the highest IL-8 level on the apical as well as basolateral side. Transepithelial electrical resistance decreased markedly upon application of 40 mM hydrogen peroxide. Late effect of hydrogen peroxide was observed in nonfilter-grown Caco-2 cells, as 1 mM hydrogen peroxide caused necrosis after 24 hr while early-necrosis induction occurred in filter-grown cells exposed to 40 mM of hydrogen peroxide after 1 hr. Filter-grown Caco-2 cells were less sensitive to hydrogen peroxide than the nonfilter-grown ones.
