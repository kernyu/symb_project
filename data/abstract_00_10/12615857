The mechanisms of the mycobactericidal action of ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), glutaraldehyde (GTA) and chlorhexidine diacetate (CHA) were investigated using mycobacterial spheroplasts of two reference strains, Mycobacterium chelonae NCTC 946, Mycobacterium abscessus NCTC 10882 and two GTA-resistant strains, M. chelonae Epping and M. chelonae Harefield. Transmission electron microscopy of the spheroplasts revealed an altered cell wall structure compared with the parent cells. Structural alterations resulting from the spheroplasting process were in part correlated to a loss of lipid content. Low concentrations of CHA induced protein coagulation in M. chelonae NCTC 946 spheroplasts, which also exhibited the highest loss of free non-polar lipids. Higher concentrations of CHA were required to produce similar results to the other spheroplasts investigated in which there was a less substantial decrease in lipid content. OPA (0.5% w/v) readily penetrated the residual cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane, producing significant protein coagulation in M. chelonae NCTC 946. GTA (0.5% v/v) induced a similar effect but to a lesser extent. Pre-treatment of the spheroplasts with OPA and GTA and their subsequent suspension in water demonstrated that GTA was a more potent cross-linking agent. This protective effect of GTA results from extensive cross-linking of amino and/or sulphydryl side-chain groups of proteins. The rapid mycobactericidal effect of OPA probably arises from its more efficient penetration across biological membranes. Mycobacterial spheroplasts represented a useful cellular model with an altered cell wall permeability. This study also showed the importance of the mycobacterial cell wall in conferring intrinsic resistance to CHA.
