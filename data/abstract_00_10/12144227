PURPOSE: To present a case of recurrent, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) wound ulcer after clear-cornea cataract surgery. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: An 82-year-old man underwent an uncomplicated phacoemulsification procedure with posterior-chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) implantation. Two weeks after surgery, a corneal ulcer was present at the wound site. Corneal tissue sample cultures produced methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The ulcer responded to high-dose vancomycin but recurred twice as vancomycin was tapered. Lamellar keratectomy with conjunctival flap was performed at 6 months after surgery, with no additional ulcer recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Wound infection after clear-cornea cataract surgery occurs infrequently. Management of these infections, however, can provide challenging clinical decisions.
