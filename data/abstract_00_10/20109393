Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are antimalarials used as first-line treatment of cutaneous lupus. Quinacrine is not often employed by Spanish physicians due to a lack of information about its use and the fact that it is not marketed in Spain. It is effective in monotherapy or in combination therapy with other antimalarials. One of the advantages of quinacrine over chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is that it does not appear to cause retinal toxicity. Quinacrine is used as second-line therapy in patients with pre-existing eye problems that contraindicate treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (after evaluation of which drug has the better risk-benefit relationship), and in combination therapy with other antimalarials inpatients with resistance or only a partial response to chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We report 8 cases of patients with cutaneous lupus who received treatment with quinacrine in monotherapy or in combination with others antimalarials. Lesions resolved in 5 patients and improved in 3. Therapy had to be withdrawn in 1 patient due to an exacerbation of his psoriasis.
