Previously, we have shown that PKC-eta (protein kinase C-eta) positively regulates glioblastoma proliferation and confers resistance to irradiation-induced apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of rapamycin in inhibiting cell proliferation in two glioblastoma cell lines U-251MG (PKC-eta expressing) and U-1242MG (PKC-eta deficient) following PKC-eta activation. In U-251MG cells, rapamycin (10 nM) treatment was less effective as an antiproliferative agent when cells were concurrently stimulated with 10% serum and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 nM), a potent activator of PKC isozymes. Rapamycin-insensitive growth was owing to PKC-eta, as U-1242MG and U-251MG cells infected with a kinase-dead form of PKC-eta (U-251kr) were susceptible to rapamycin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. Furthermore, U-251MG cells transfected with PKC-eta antisense oligonucleotides were sensitive to rapamycin. PKC-eta-expressing cells stimulated with PMA maintained p70S6K phosphorylation on Thr389 and phosphorylation of rpS6 (ser235/36), suggesting p70S6K kinase activity was still intact. Inhibition of p70S6K expression with small interfering RNA oligonucleotides inhibited cell proliferation greater than 50% in the presence of a combination of PMA and serum. Additionally, p70S6K co-precipitated with PKC-eta, suggesting a physical interaction between PKC-eta and p70S6K regulates the observed phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that rapamycin-insensitive glioblastoma proliferation involves PKC-eta signaling.
