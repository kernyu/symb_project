7-Arylvinyl-1,2,4-trioxepanes 7a-d, 8a-d, 9a-d, 10a-d, 11a-c, and 12a-c, prepared by photooxygenation of homoallylic alcohols 5a-d, were evaluated against multi-drug resistant Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis in Swiss mice by oral and intramuscular routes. Trioxepane 11c, the most active compound of the series, showed more than 98% suppression of parsitaemia at 96 mg/kg by both oral and intramuscular routes. This is the first report on in vivo active 1,2,4-trioxepanes.
