In 2000, the chemosusceptibility of imported malaria was stable in France. All countries of infection considered, the bi-resistance to chloroquine and cycloguanil has not changed from 1996 to 2000. The monotherapy using quinine or mefloquine remains the first-line treatment to falciparum malaria. Resistance to these two antimalarials is rare in Africa and has not evolved over the past 15 years.
