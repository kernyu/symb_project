A 71-year-old woman was admitted with fever up and weight loss. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed right renal tumor 7 cm in diameter and inferior vena caval thrombus and multiple lymph node metastases and lung metastases. Transabdominal right nephrectomy and thrombectomy was performed and pathological examination was renal cell carcinoma (clear cell carcinoma, G3, INFbeta, v (+), pT3b, pN2) with adrenal invasion and lymph node metastases. She received 600 x 10(4) IU/day of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) intramuscularly 3 times a week for 16 weeks from the 20th post-operative day. The disease showed progression and liver metastases 5 cm in diameter appeared. Then she received 140 x 10(4) JRU/day of IL-2 (div) 5 times a week for 4 weeks. CT showed a complete response on lung metastases and lymph node metastases and marked decrease of liver metastases after the first course of IL-2. After the second course, the liver mass remained 2 cm in diameter and then radiofrequency ablation (RFA) under CT was performed. CT after RFA showed a low density area at the liver tumor without enhancement. About five years after the operation, she is alive without evidence of disease.
