In November-December 2002, 98 patients presented at the Elhara Eloula health centre, in the New Halfa area of eastern Sudan, with Plasmodium falciparum malaria that had failed to respond to chloroquine treatment. After informed consent was obtained, 93 of these patients were randomly allocated to one of three regimens for quinine treatment, being given the drug, orally and sometimes intravenously, for 7 days, at doses of 10 mg/kg thrice daily (32 patients), 10 mg/kg twice daily (31 patients) or 15 mg/kg once daily (30 patients). All the patients were followed daily until day 7 and then weekly until day 28. There was no significant difference in the parasite-clearance times observed in the three groups. Parasitaemias re-occurred by day 28 in 12 patients: two (6.3%) of the patients treated thrice daily, five (16.1%) of those treated twice daily, and five (16.7%) of those treated once daily (P > 0.05). Genotyping indicated that in nine of these 12 patients the parasitaemias that developed post-treatment represented true recrudescences and not re-infections. In the treatment of chloroquine-resistant, P. falciparum malaria in Sudan, once-daily treatment with quinine, in a relatively low daily dose (15 mg/kg. day), appears as effective as the thrice-daily treatment (at 30 mg/kg. day) often recommended.
