We studied 13 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enteropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates from children suffering acute diarrhea in Uruguay. ESBL characterization in crude extracts showed a single band at pI 5.4. PCR amplification and sequencing data allowed identification of blaPER-2 and blaTEM-116. Retrospective analysis suggests that these strains were disseminated in the community, even if unnoticed, prior to their access to the hospital environment more than a decade ago.
