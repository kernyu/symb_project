Helicobacter pylori is an organism that is thought to be important in the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. Eradication of the organism is useful in clinical cure of infected patients. Efficacious regimens generally include an antisecretory agent combined with two to three antimicrobials. The main determinant of overall cost of treatment is the rate of eradication of the organism. Impediments to patient compliance include intensive dosage schedules and drug side effects. Resistance can occur to the commonly used antibiotics but can usually be overcome with an altered regimen.
