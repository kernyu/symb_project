Influenza virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is the centrepiece of the viral response to the host interferon (IFN) system. NS1 has been demonstrated previously to be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral therapy by identification of specific small-molecule inhibitors. This study demonstrated the biological mechanism for a potent new NS1 antagonist. Compound JJ3297 inhibited virus replication by more than three orders of magnitude without affecting cell viability. Importantly, it efficiently reversed NS1-induced inhibition of IFN mRNA production. The hypothesis was tested that JJ3297 facilitates IFN production in infected cells, leading to protection of the surrounding uninfected cells. Accordingly, the compound efficiently prevented virus spread through a cell population during a 48 h multi-cycle infection initiated at a very low m.o.i. Consistent with the hypothesis, the compound had no detectable influence on a 6 h single-cycle infection initiated at a high m.o.i. The effect of JJ3297 on virus replication was not caused by inhibition of NS1 expression or its mislocalization in the cell. JJ3297 facilitated the induction of an IFN-like antiviral state, resulting in increased resistance to subsequent challenge with vesicular stomatitis virus. The activity of JJ3297 absolutely required the function of cellular RNase L, indicating that an intact IFN system is required for function of the compound. These results support a model in which inhibition of NS1 function results in restoration of the IFN-induced antiviral state and inhibition of virus replication and spread. This represents a new direction for anti-influenza virus drug development that exploits the IFN pathway to challenge virus replication.
