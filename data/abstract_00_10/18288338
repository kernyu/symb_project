Surgical site infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials are an important and increasing problem in veterinary medicine. Organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci, extended spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacteriaceae and multi-drug resistant Enterococcus, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. are among the current concerns; however, the emergence and dissemination of other multi-drug resistant organisms will likely follow. Despite the negative connotations that are associated with multi-drug resistant infections, most infections are potentially treatable if basic principles of infection treatment and infection control are followed.
