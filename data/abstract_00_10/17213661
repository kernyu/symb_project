Silkworms show high variability in silk quality and disease resistance. Attempts are on to combine the disease tolerance of multivoltine races and the silk quality of bivoltine races to generate new races with desirable phenotypic traits. We report the identification of a 26.5-kDa protein that is overexpressed in the gut juice of disease-resistant multivoltine races and that has anti-BmNPV activity. We have characterized this protein as a soluble NADH-oxidoreductase-like protein (BmNOX). Treatment of live BmNPV particles with BmNOX inhibited the capability of the viral particles to infect BmN cells in vitro.
