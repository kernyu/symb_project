Current antibiotics available for the treatment of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) may result in clinical failure due to resistance development, side effect intolerance, or poor pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profiles. New agents active against common HCAP pathogens are needed. The mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and clinical efficacy of seven new agents in clinical development or recently approved with either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or pseudomonal activity are reviewed. They include doripenem, a new antipseudomonal carbapenem; ceftobiprole and ceftaroline, two anti-MRSA cephalosporins; iclaprim, a selective dihydrofolate reductase antagonist; and three glycopeptides, dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin.
