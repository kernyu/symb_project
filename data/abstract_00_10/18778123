Doripenem, a parenteral, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent of the carbapenem family, is indicated as empirical therapy in serious bacterial infections in adults. Doripenem is indicated in Japan for use as a single agent in intra-abdominal infections (IAIs), lower respiratory tract infections (including nosocomial pneumonia), complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and a variety of other bacterial infections, such as complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs), obstetric and gynaecological infections, serious ear, nose and throat infections, sepsis and endocarditis, dental and oral surgical infection, and ophthalmic infection caused by various susceptible strains of Gram-negative, Gram-positive or anaerobic bacteria. Doripenem is indicated in the US for the treatment of complicated IAIs (cIAIs) or cUTIs, including pyelonephritis, caused by susceptible strains of designated pathogens, and in the EU for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (including ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]), cIAIs or cUTIs.Doripenem has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobic pathogens. The drug also has a low propensity to select for resistance and is suitable for the prolonged infusions that may be required to achieve pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic targets for bactericidal activity (and therefore efficacy) against pathogens with increased MICs (minimum concentrations required to inhibit the pathogens). Doripenem is no less effective than other antibacterial agents, including meropenem, imipenem/cilastin, piperacillin/tazobactam or levofloxacin in a wide range of serious bacterial infections, such as complicated lower respiratory infections, nosocomial pneumonia (including VAP), cIAIs and cUTIs, and is well tolerated. Thus, doripenem is a valuable addition to the options available for the empirical treatment of serious bacterial infections in hospitalized patients.
