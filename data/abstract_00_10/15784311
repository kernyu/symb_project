It is becoming clear that antimicrobial peptides are important components of the innate defences of all species of life. They kill very rapidly, do not easily select resistant mutants and are synergistic with potentially toxic conventional therapeutic agents against microbes. This paper describes an attempt to expand a lead hexapeptide motif synthesized through combinatorial approach. A cationic peptide H-Arg-Trp-Trp-Arg-D-Trp-D-Phe-Ile-D-Phe-His-NH2 was found to be active with a therapeutic index of >17. I was proposed that the combination of peptide with known antifungal agents may identify synergistic combinations that would ideally reduce the dosage of conventional antifungals as well as their associated toxicity. Nine different pathogenic strains and species of Candida and two of Cryptococcus neoformans were employed in chequerboard method and in time kill assays to evaluate the synergistic effect of the lead peptide in combination with amphotericin B, 5-flucytosine, ketoconazole and fluconazole. We found synergistic interaction between the peptide and all four drugs against Cryptococcus isolates whilst both synergistic and additive combinations occurred when Candida isolates were used.
