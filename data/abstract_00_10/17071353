Anthelmintic resistance has been a problem almost from the first use of the drugs introduced during the past 50 years. Evaluation of anthelmintics on a specific farm is essential to determine which drugs may be used in controlling parasite numbers. Treatment of livestock during the season in which parasite transmission is unfavorable lessens pasture contamination. Targeting treatment places less pressure on susceptible worms, diluting the resistant parasite population. Pasture management and using safe pastures for animals at highest risk lower pasture exposure. Selection for individual animals resistant to the effects of parasites lessens the need for use of anthelmintics. Alternatives to anthelmintics include cryptic antigen vaccines, copper wires, and biologic compounds.
