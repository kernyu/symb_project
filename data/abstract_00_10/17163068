Current views on the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of multiple drug resistance in clinical bacterial isolates are considered. Hypotheses on the origin of resistance genes derived from determinants of actinomycetes, antibiotic producers, and chromosomal genes of bacteria involved in cellular metabolism are reviewed. The mechanisms underlying the diffusion of resistance determinants by means of bacterial mobile elements (plasmids, transposons, and integrons) are discussed. Examples of the horizontal transfer of resistance determinants between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are presented.
