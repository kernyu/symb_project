OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of two clarithromycin formulations given for 5 days to patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study of ambulatory patients between 40 and 75 years of age with a medical history of chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a presumptive diagnosis of ABECB who met Anthonisen Type 1 criteria (increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume and increased sputum purulence). Eligible patients received a 5-day course of clarithromycin extended-release (ER) 500 mg once daily or clarithromycin immediate-release (IR) 250 mg twice daily. Clinical cure, bacteriological cure and pathogen eradication rates were determined at the end of therapy and at a follow-up visit. RESULTS: Clinical cure rates were similar at the test-of-cure visit for evaluable patients in the clarithromycin ER group (97%, 298/307) and clarithromycin IR group (98%, 300/307) (95% CI (-3.2, 1.9)). The bacteriological cure rate was 89% and the pathogen eradication rate was 90% in both treatment groups. Resolution or improvement in cough, sputum production, sputum volume and sputum appearance was observed in > 90% of evaluable patients in each treatment group. The incidence of study drug-related adverse events was 6.6% (23/351) in the clarithromycin ER group and 5.4% (19/352) in the clarithromycin IR group. The most frequently occurring study drug-related adverse events were abdominal pain, diarrhea and taste perversion. CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin ER 500 mg once daily for 5 days is equivalent to clarithromycin IR 250 mg twice daily for 5 days in treating adults with ABECB. Both regimens were effective in resolving clinical signs and symptoms of ABECB and eradicating the target pathogens, and were well tolerated.
