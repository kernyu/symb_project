Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common infectious complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and accounts for exorbitant use of resources in the intensive care unit. Antimicrobial management of VAP incorporates an initial broad-spectrum, empiric regimen to ensure appropriate coverage with deescalation of therapy after 48-72 hours based on culture results and sensitivities. When VAP clinically responds to treatment, antimicrobials should be discontinued after 7-8 days to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and the selection pressure on flora observed in the intensive care unit and thus minimize the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
