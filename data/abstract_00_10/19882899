The paper presents the results of studying the spectrum of influenza A and B viruses to rimantadine, arbidol, and oseltamivir and describes the methods used for these purposes for epidemiological surveillance. Different sensitivities to rimantadine were found among influenza A viruses. During the 2007-2008 season, the vast majority of influenza A(H3N2) virus strains were resistant to rimantadine (77%) while all influenza A(H1N1) virus strains preserved their resistance to this drug. The fact that the epidemic influenza A(H1N1) virus strains that carry the mutation responsible for resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu) circulated in the Russian Federation was first established. At the same time all the study influenza A(H1N1) virus strains preserved their susceptibility to rimantadine. The sensitivity of the epidemic strains to arbidol has been confirmed.
