Strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are generally characterized by auxotyping, serotyping, plasmid profile, antibiotic sensitivity and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) amplification fingerprinting. The aim of this study was to analyse the generation of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns by BgIII digestion of total genomic DNA of N. gonorrhoeae isolated from the community (n =30) and the hospital (n =15) and to establish an association with serogrouping and antibiogram. The RFLP patterns produced by BgIII restriction digestion showed 7 different patterns among 30 community isolates and 9 different patterns among 15 hospital isolates. 66.7% of isolates belonged to serogroup WI. Penicillin resistance was observed in 46.7% of community isolates and 66.7% hospital isolates. However, penicillinase producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) were lower in the community (6.6%) than in the hospital isolates (53.3%). PPNG strains were more often seen in serogroup WI. This is the first Indian report on RFLP genotype pattern in N. gonorrhoeae. We noted differences in RFLP genotypes of the community (RFLP types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7) and hospital strains (RFLP types 6 and 8), while no differences in the serogroup were observed. Ciprofloxacin resistance was 20.0% and 26.6% in the community and hospital isolates, respectively. Ceftriaxone emerges as the current drug of choice for an effective policy of antibiotic treatment of gonorrhoea through syndromic management in developing countries.
