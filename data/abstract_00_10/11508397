Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.
