The efficacy and safety of isepamicin at 7.5 mg/kg i.v. q 12 h was prospectively compared with that of amikacin at the same dose for the treatment of febrile neutropenic children with malignancies. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled in the study; 25 received isepamicin and 14 amikacin. Clinical and bacteriological response rates were 100% for both groups. No adverse events occurred. Median peak serum levels were 19.7 mg/l for isepamicin and 19.20 mg/l for amikacin. Median trough serum levels were 0.72 mg/l for isepamicin and 0.68 mg/l for amikacin. It was concluded that isepamicin was as effective and safe as amikacin for the treatment of febrile neutropenic children with malignancies, and might be used in areas where resistance to other aminoglycosides is a problem.
