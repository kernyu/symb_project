We enrolled 382 college-age women in a cross-sectional survey to investigate the relationship between use of over-the-counter (OTC) azole-based antifungal drugs and vaginal colonization by drug-resistant Candida. This study showed no correlation (P=.506) between previous OTC exposure and colonization of drug-resistant Candida in vaginal flora. However, a small number of resistant Candida species isolates were obtained from women with a history of multiple exposures to OTC antifungals; given the widespread use of these products, this may be an emerging concern.
