BACKGROUND: CAY-1 is a fungicidal saponin from cayenne pepper whose mode of action differs from amphotericin B (AB) and itraconazole (IT). This work determined CAY-1 synergism with AB or IT. METHODS: CAY-1 was purified and used in checkerboard microdilution studies where CAY-1 and AB or IT were mixed with nongerminated (NG) and germinating (G) conidia of three Aspergillus species and Candida albicans. Inhibition was visually determined at 24 and 48 h. RESULTS: CAY-1 had predominantly additive-synergistic interaction with AB or IT against the Aspergillus NG and G conidia. Excellent synergy between CAY-1 and AB occurred at 24 and 48 h against C. albicans. Results suggest CAY-1 enhances AB and IT efficacy.
