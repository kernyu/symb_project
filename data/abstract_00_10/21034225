From 2004 to 2005, 60%-72% of invasive Staphylococcus aureus isolates from Romanian hospitals were resistant to methicillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]), the highest frequency for any European nation. Few reports, however, have addressed the molecular characteristics of S. aureus in Romania. In this study, we utilized spa typing, multilocus sequence typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, dru typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and detection of virulence factors to characterize 146 S. aureus strains isolated from 2004 to 2005 at the Clinic County Hospital in Brasov. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns for all MRSA isolates and patient demographic data were also obtained. Fifty-six strains (38.4%) were determined to be MRSA by susceptibility testing and SCCmec typing. All MRSA strains were resistant to beta-lactams and tetracycline, but susceptible to nitrofurans, vancomycin, and clindamycin, with inducible clindamycin resistance in 23/28 clindamycin-sensitive/erythromycin-resistant isolates. Molecular typing identified 15 clonal backgrounds (CC 1, 5, 8, 8/239, 9, 15, 20, 22, 25, 30, 45, 80, 97, 101, and 121), only 4 of which were associated with MRSA (CC 1, 8/239, 30, and 80). Spa types 35 (t127, CC 1) and 351 (t030, CC 8/239) accounted for 27.4% and 21.9% of all S. aureus strains, respectively, and 19.6% and 57.1% of all MRSA strains. Both hospital-associated (SCCmec type III) and community-associated (SCCmec type IV) elements were identified within MRSA strains, whereas Panton-Valentine leukocidin was detected in 10 MRSA and 12 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains. These results demonstrate the presence of various endemic S. aureus clones within the Clinic County Hospital in Brasov, suggestive of ongoing nosocomial and community transmission.
