Infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci are becoming increasingly important, particularly those of nosocomial origin, as the organisms are frequently multi-resistant. New antimicrobial strategies are needed. The bactericidal activity of a combination of cefpirome with either vancomycin or teicoplanin against 12 strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci with a decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin was determined in vitro by a time killing method. Strains Mu3 and Mu50 of Staphylococcus aureus were also studied. Cefpirome (0.125-0.5 x MIC) combined with vancomycin (0.25-1 x MIC) or teicoplanin (0.125-1 x MIC) acted synergically against 12 isolates over 18 h in most cases. A synergistic killing effect was also observed with the Mu3 and Mu50 strains of glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus but over a longer period.
