OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in a nasal flora and oral environment, the correlation between frequency of transmission of S. aureus and oronasal fistula size, and the pattern of methicillin resistance on S. aureus strains in children with cleft lip and palate (CLP). DESIGN: Thirty-two CLP children with and without oronasal fistulas, ranging in age from 5 to 13 years were examined for oronasal fistula presence and size. Stimulated saliva samples and nasal swab samples were taken and investigated for S. aureus presence. S. aureus presence and counts were correlated with fistula presence and size. RESULTS: Saliva samples showed statistical differences between the groups with and without oronasal fistulas with an area ranging from 0.80 to 28.26 mm2. The S. aureus counts were significantly higher (r = .535, p = .002) in saliva samples from children with larger oronasal fistula. The S. aureus count was not significantly different (r = -.013, p = .942) in nasal samples compared with oronasal fistula size. Methicillin resistance with disk-diffusion method was recorded as sensitive (> or =13 mm) in all S. aureus strains. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate a positive correlation between fistula size and S. aureus transmission to one oral environment through oronasal fistulae, and a positive correlation between frequency of S. aureus transmission and fistula size. All S. aureus strains were sensitive to methicillin. These results may have implications for preventive treatment of CLP children.
