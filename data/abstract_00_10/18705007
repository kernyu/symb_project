OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immunoregulatory effects of pertussis protein on airway inflammatory, IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids(BALF) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in the sensitized mice. METHODS: The sensitized mice were reexposed to ovalbumin and the airway response to methacholine injection was monitored. Inflammatory cells and cytokines IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio in BALF were measured. Lung tissue specimens were collected for histological examination. RESULT: Intramuscular injection or intranasal instillation of pertussis protein inhibited changes in lung resistance and lung dynamic compliance, upregulated IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio and decreased eosinophil accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. Pathological examination showed that goblet cell hyperplasia and inflammatory cells infiltration in lung tissue were suppressed by pertussis protein. CONCLUSION: Pertussis protein inhibits the inflammation and regulates the function of lungs in asthma mice, suggesting its potential application in treatment of asthma.
