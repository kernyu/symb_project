We tested the susceptibility patterns of 128 N. gonorrhoeae isolates to six antimicrobials; penicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, and examined whether certain demographic or behavioral factors related to antibiotic use increased the likelihood of infection by a resistant strain. There was a low rate of resistance to penicillin; penicillinase-producing and chromosomal-mediated penicillin resistant gonorrhea were estimated to be 0.8%. A much higher proportion of isolates were resistant to tetracycline (up to 15%). All isolates were sensitive to spectinomycin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. However, less than 2% of isolates displayed intermediate resistance to both ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, and 9% exhibited intermediate resistance to spectinomycin. Patients who had obtained medication before attending the clinic and had taken all of the medication were more likely (p = 0.03) to be infected with a resistant strain of gonococcus. Also, patients who were asked by a clinic doctor to return for a test of cure during an earlier clinic visit, but who did not return were more likely to be infected with a resistant organism (p = 0.006) compared to those who returned at the doctor's request. These findings have important implications for antibiotic use and educational programs in Trinidad and Tobago.
