Phenotypical methods are routinely used to detect methicillin resistance in Staphylococci. These methods are time-consuming and there are difficulties in detecting all resistant strains carrying the mecA gene. We detected methicillin-resistant Staphylococci in biological samples by PCR amplification of mecA, without the time-consuming step of identifying a bacterial isolate. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococci isolates were also detected by screening on agar supplemented with oxacillin. The biological samples were collected from the hands of 17 healthcare workers at the Department of Paediatrics at the University Hospital of Tromso. mecA was amplified in 12 of the 17 samples. The gene was verified by DNA sequencing of the PCR amplicon. Using the phenotypical method, methicillin-resistant Staphylococci were isolated from 6 of the samples. In all 6 of these samples, mecA was amplified by PCR. We conclude that PCR is a sensitive and specific method for detecting methicillin resistance in Staphylococci. The PCR detection of mecA is rapid, fairly simple and can easily be assimilated into the routines of a clinical microbiological laboratory.
