The species Campylobacter fetus is divided into the subspecies C. fetus subsp. venerealis (CFV) and C. fetus subsp. fetus (CFF). CFV is the causative agent of bovine genital campylobacteriosis, a highly contagious venereal disease that may lead to serious reproductive problems, including sterility and abortion. In contrast, CFF can be isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a wide range of host species, is associated with abortion in sheep and cattle, and can also be isolated from local and systemic infections in humans. Despite differences in host and niche preferences, microbiological differentiation of the two subspecies of C. fetus is extremely difficult. This study describes the identification of a new insertion element, ISCfe1, which is present exclusively in CFV strains, with highly conserved specific ISCfe1 insertion sites. The results are useful for identification and differentiation of the two C. fetus subspecies and will help in understanding the evolution and pathogenesis of C. fetus.
