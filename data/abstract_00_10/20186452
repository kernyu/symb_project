This study analyzed the prevalence of antibiotics resistance and the distribution of genes responsible for carbapenems resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Clinical A. baumannii isolates were cultured, identified, and collected during the period from May 2007 to February 2009. Antibiotics resistance rates of the clinical isolates were analyzed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The distribution of carbapenemase alleles were investigated in the multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii isolates by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. A total of 1,265 independent A. baumannii isolates were identified. Approximately 70% of the clinical isolates were resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, followed by imipenem, meropenem, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone. Overall, 15.18% (192/1,265) of the isolates were characterized as MDR strains. All of the MDR A. baumannii isolates carried the bla (OXA51-like) allele. The detection rate of the bla (OXA23-like) and bla (OXA24-like) alleles was 96.35% (185/192) and 0.52% (1/192), respectively. Most of the isolates (185/192, 96.35%) carried genes which encode more than one carbapenemase. This report demonstrated that approximately 15% of A. baumannii clinical isolates in central Taiwan are MDR strains, with most of them harboring multiple carbapenemases. This study provides updated data regarding the prevalence of beta-lactam resistance and genotyping information of carbapenems resistance of A. baumannii in central Taiwan.
