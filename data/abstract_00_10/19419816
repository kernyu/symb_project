Sheep production is very important in Morocco and two regions (Chaouia plain and semi-mountainous Middle-Atlas) play a significant role in this production. Ten farms were investigated for nematode species and resistance each region. Pooled material from each region provided evidence of benzimidazole resistance in Teladorsagia in both regions; Haemonchus contortus was resistant in the Chaouia only. Forty eight farms in Chaouia and 27 farms in Middle-Atlas were given questionnaires in order to characterize farms and sheep production and to investigate interest in anthelmintic targeted selective treatments (TST) against digestive-tract strongyles. TST is intended to restrict the use of anthelmintics to animals with high infection or presenting clinical signs. The acceptance of TST (67 and 81% of farmers at Chaouia plain and Middle-Atlas respectively) was strongly associated with availability of guidance for infection or clinical markers for selecting sheep in need of treatment. TST interest is associated with health indicators (Gower coefficient nearly one) and the lower cost of TST is highly attractive. The farmers showing an interest in TST have a larger number of ewes, use pasture under forest and have higher number of lambs consumed or sold per ewe. They tend to have collective ownership, acceptable hygienic conditions in the sheepfold and contracted workers. They turn to their neighbours regarding sick animals and get advice on drug selection from veterinarians. The structure of the farm is then linked to the potential use of TST.
