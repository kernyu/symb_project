OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of dose and duration of treatment with interferon (IFN)-alpha on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after IFN treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: A total of 291 noncirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C without hepatitis B virus coinfection in whom hepatitis C virus (HCV) was not eradicated by IFN-alpha therapy were retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of HCC after IFN therapy was compared according to the total dose or duration of treatment. RESULTS: Patients were followed up for 6-117 months after the end of IFN treatment. The duration of IFN treatment (< or =24 vs. >24 weeks) had no effect on the incidence of HCC. However, the incidence of HCC was significantly lower in patients who received >500 million units of IFN as a total dose than in patients who received < or =500 million units of IFN (p = 0.0480), and the total dose of IFN (>500 million units) was an independent factor affecting the incidence of HCC (p = 0.0405). In addition, when focusing on patients whose histology was F2 or F3 before IFN treatment, the suppressive effect of the total dose of IFN (>500 million units) was emphasized (p = 0.0049 in generalized Wilcoxon test and p = 0.0178 in multivariate analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic hepatitis C should receive more than 500 million units of IFN when IFN is used to decrease the incidence of subsequent HCC.
