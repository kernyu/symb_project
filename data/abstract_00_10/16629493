Isolated of multidrug resistance Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) that the receptivity pattern of the antimicrobial suscepti respectively resembled isolated from clinical specimens (sputum) in two patients of each internal medicine ward in Kitasato University East Hospital for two days from September 18 and 20, 2004. Both of bacteria were formed small colonies of a smooth-type on dollargalluskey improvement-type BTB agar plates, and the judgment of ClassB (metallo)-beta-lactamase by biochemical properties and disk diffusion method sodium mercaoto-acetic acid (SMA) was mutually corresponding. Moreover, it was same serotype C according to the serotype, and it was confirmed that it was the same bacterial strain from the molecular epidemiology analysis by Random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (Random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction: RAPD). From the investigation of clinical backgrounds of two patients who isolated bacterial strains, September 18, 2004. 10 : 20 a.m., and 10 : 40 a.m., other chances that can become with contact infection in this hospital, except conducted X-Ray or roentgenograph of the chest and abdomen of Portable X-ray device continuously done by one radiation technician was not seen. Because it had turned out that a radiation technician who had taken charge had been neglecting the hand washing at the time of each X-Ray or roentgenograph, it was guessed the case with nosocomial infection by contact infection occurred via specific radiation technician.
