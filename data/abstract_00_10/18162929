Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a cause of infection among otherwise healthy children and adults in the community. Skin and soft tissue infections are most common, but invasive manifestations also occur. A limited number of strains that may possess unique virulence or transmissibility factors have accounted for the majority of these infections. These strains emerged in the community but now are being transmitted in both community and healthcare settings. Incision and drainage remains the primary treatment for skin abscesses. Strains of MRSA circulating in the community generally are susceptible to a number of nonbeta-lactam antimicrobial agents, although resistance patterns may vary temporally and geographically. Educating patients on strategies to prevent further transmission is a critical component of case management. More data are needed to determine optimal strategies for management and prevention of MRSA skin infections in the community.
