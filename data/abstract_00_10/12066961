STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term tolerability of prophylactic administration of pyrazinamide and levofloxacin in patients possibly exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) after undergoing solid organ transplantation. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Community outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: Forty-eight recipients of solid organ transplants beginning prophylaxis for MDRTB during August 1999 after possible exposure to a single index case of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis within our community INTERVENTION: Prophylaxis consisted of pyrazinamide 30 mg/kg/day plus levofloxacin 500 mg/day, administered for 1 year. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen (27.1%) of the 48 patients completed therapy; 27 (56.3%) discontinued therapy within 4 months due to adverse drug events. Gastrointestinal intolerance was the major adverse event resulting in early discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis of MDRTB with levofloxacin and pyrazinamide was associated with limited tolerability due to the high frequency of adverse events. While we search for a better tolerated prophylactic regimen, close monitoring for adverse reactions is recommended.
