BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones are often used interchangeably in dogs and cats. HYPOTHESIS: Predicted therapeutic efficacy differs among fluoroquinolones. ANIMALS: Bacterial pathogens isolated from dogs and cats. METHODS: Using microtube-dilution procedures, percent resistance and 2 pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic indices (maximum concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration [Cmax/MIC] [target 0.10] and area under curve/minimum inhibitory concentration [AUC/MIC] [target 0.125]) were compared prospectively at low and high doses (mg/kg) for ciprofloxacin (5 and 20), difloxacin (5 and 10), enrofloxacin (including enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin) (5 and 20), marbofloxacin (2.5 and 5), and orbifloxacin (2.5 and 7.5). Indices were calculated for organisms represented by < or = 15 isolates. RESULTS: Percent resistance for all Gram-negative (n = 180; 20+/-3%; 39+/-5% for Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive isolates (n = 66; 18+/-3%) did not differ among drugs or organisms. The pattern of Cmax/MIC was generally enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin > or = enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin > or = marbofloxacin > or = orbifloxacin > or = difloxacin; and for AUIC/ MIC, enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin > or = marbofloxacin > or = ciprofloxacin > or = enrofloxacin > difloxacin > orbifloxacin. Among susceptible Gram-negative isolates studied (n = 117), targeted Cmax/MIC or AUC/MIC were achieved in 88% of E. coli, 53% of Proteus mirabilis, and 35% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and for susceptible Gram-positive isolates studied (n = 49), 53% of Streptotoccus spp. and Staphylococcus intermedius and 27% of Staphylococcus spp. At the high dose, the proportion of isolates for which a target was reached was: ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin+ciprofloaxin, and marbofloxacin (77%), enrofloxacin (73%), orbifloxacin (51%), and difloxacin (40%); and at the low dose, enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin (43%), ciprofloxacin (40%), marbofloxacin (39%), orbifloxacin (29%), and difloxacin (28%). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli resistance to fluoroquinolones approximated 40%. For susceptible isolates, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin more consistently reached indices associated with predicted efficacy, but only at the high dose.
