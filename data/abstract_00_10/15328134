Three clinical Chlamydia pneumoniae isolates for which the MIC of azithromycin increased after treatment were investigated for genetic evidence of macrolide resistance. Attempts to induce antibiotic resistance in vitro were made. No genetic mechanism was identified for the phenotypic change in these C. pneumoniae isolates. No macrolide resistance was obtained in vitro.
