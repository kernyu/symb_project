The identification of two Arabidopsis thaliana genes involved in determining recessive resistance to several strains of the causal agent of bacterial wilt, Ralstonia solanacearum, is reported. Dominant (RRS1-S) and recessive (RRS1-R) alleles from susceptible and resistant accessions encode highly similar predicted proteins differing in length and which present a novel structure combining domains found in plant Toll-IL-1 receptor-nucleotide binding site-leucin-rich repeat resistance proteins and a WRKY motif characteristic of some plant transcriptional factors. Although genetically defined as a recessive allele, RRS1-R behaves as a dominant resistance gene in transgenic plants. Sequence analysis of the RRS1 genes present in two homozygous intragenic recombinant lines indicates that several domains of RRS1-R are essential for its resistance function. Additionally, RRS1-R-mediated resistance is partially salicylic acid- and NDR1-dependent, suggesting the existence of similar signaling pathways to those controlled by resistance genes in specific resistance.
