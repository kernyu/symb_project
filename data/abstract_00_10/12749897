Bioassay-directed fractionation for Staphylococcus aureus multidrug resistance efflux pump inhibitors resulted in isolation of novel acylated neohesperidosides from Geranium caespitosum. The more highly acylated compounds had no direct activity against S. aureus, but potentiated activity of the antibiotics berberine, rhein, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Cellular concentrations of berberine were greatly increased in the presence of active esters.
