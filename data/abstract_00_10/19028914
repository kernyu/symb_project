Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis, and recent findings suggest that turkeys are an important reservoir for this organism. In this study, 80 C. jejuni isolates from eastern North Carolina were characterized for resistance to nine antimicrobials, and strain types were determined by fla typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI and KpnI, and (for 41 isolates) multilocus sequence typing (MLST). PFGE analysis suggested that many of the isolates (37/40 [ca. 93%]) in a major genomic cluster had DNA that was partially methylated at SmaI sites. Furthermore, 12/40 (30%) of the isolates in this cluster were completely resistant to digestion by KpnI, suggesting methylation at KpnI sites. MLST of 41 isolates identified 10 sequence types (STs), of which 4 were new. Three STs (ST-1839, ST-2132 and the new ST-2934) were predominant and were detected among isolates from different farms. The majority of the isolates (74%) were resistant to three or more antimicrobials, and resistance to ciprofloxacin was common (64%), whereas resistance to the other drug of choice for treatment of human campylobacteriosis, erythromycin, was never encountered. Most (33/34) of the kanamycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to tetracycline; however, only ca. 50% of the tetracycline-resistant isolates were also kanamycin resistant. Isolates with certain antimicrobial resistance profiles had identical or closely related strain types. Overall, the findings suggest dissemination of certain clonal groups of C. jejuni isolates in the turkey production industry of this region.
