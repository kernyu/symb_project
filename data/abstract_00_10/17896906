In response to the global antibiotic resistance crisis, antimicrobial stewardship programs have emerged throughout the United States. Effective programs integrate several strategic methods, including evaluation and feedback regarding the necessity and appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy, staff education, and formulary restrictions. Multidisciplinary teams as well as institutional support are needed to form effective subcommittees to monitor national and local surveillance reports and resistance patterns, and to update antibiograms. Computerized decision support programs have been effective and successful methods of antimicrobial stewardship and can be a powerful tool in stewardship programs. Successful programs have reduced not only institutional resistance rates, but also morbidity, mortality, and cost.
