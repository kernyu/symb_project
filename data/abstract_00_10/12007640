Quinolone-resistant Salmonella enterica usually contain a mutation in gyrA within the region encoding the quinolone resistance determining region of the A subunit of DNA gyrase. These mutations confer substitutions analogous to Escherichia coli Ser83-->Phe and Asp87-->Gly or Tyr, or a novel mutation resulting in Ala119-->Glu or Val. Mutations in gyrB are rare, and no mutations in parC or parE have been described. Quinolone-resistant Salmonella can also be cross-resistant to other agents including chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Increased efflux has been demonstrated and for some strains this has been associated with increased expression of acrB. Mutation in soxR has also been shown for one isolate. Detection of low level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentrations <0.5 microg ml(-1)) to fluoroquinolones is proving an increasing problem in the treatment of invasive Salmonella infections.
