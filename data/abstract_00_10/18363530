Telavancin is a once-daily lipoglycopeptide antibiotic structurally derived from vancomycin. It has broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive bacteria, including strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Telavancin's multifunctional mechanism of action, including inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis and disruption of membrane potential, account for this enhanced activity as well as rapid bactericidal properties. In vitro activity has been demonstrated against a wide range of gram-positive pathogens such as multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as methicillin-resistant, glycopeptide-intermediate, and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The agent also displays activity against many gram-positive anaerobic organisms. Predictable linear pharmacokinetics have been demonstrated over a wide range of doses, with the most common adverse effects being taste disturbance and nausea. Clinical experience with telavancin in phase II and III studies for complicated skin and skin structure infections has shown it to have similar efficacy and tolerability compared with vancomycin and antistaphylococcal penicillins, and recently telavancin received an approvable letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration for this indication. Telavancin appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of serious infections caused by gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant pathogens. Further clinical experience will clarify its role in therapy.
