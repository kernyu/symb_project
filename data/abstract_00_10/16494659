With increasing antibiotic resistance reported worldwide, there is an urgent need for novel treatments for infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Daptomycin is the first in a new class of antibiotic, the cyclic lipopeptides, with activity against a range of Gram-positive pathogens. US approval of daptomycin for the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) caused by Gram-positive bacteria was gained in 2003, with European approval granted in January 2006. Most Gram-positive clinical isolates tested have proved susceptible to daptomycin, including methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant strains. Daptomycin has a novel mode of action, is rapidly bactericidal in vitro and has a low potential for the development of resistance. Two pivotal phase III studies, in a total of 1092 patients with cSSTIs, demonstrated non-inferiority to currently used antibiotics and a comparable tolerability profile. The unique mode of action of daptomycin is described alongside studies demonstrating its potential in the treatment of cSSTIs and other infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria.
