Gatifloxacin penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (49 +/- 11%), measured by comparison of AUC(CSF)/AUC(serum), and showed good bactericidal activity (leading to a decrease of 0.75 +/- 0.17 log10 cfu/mL/h) in the treatment of experimental meningitis in rabbits caused by a penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strain (MIC 4 mg/L). It was significantly more effective than the standard regimen, ceftriaxone with vancomycin, which led to a decrease of 0.53 +/- 0.17 log10 cfu/mL/h. The addition of cefepime to gatifloxacin slightly improved the killing rates (giving a decrease of 0.84 +/- 0.14 log10 cfu/mL/h). In vitro, synergy was demonstrated between cefepime and gatifloxacin by the chequerboard method (fractional inhibitory concentration index = 0.5) and by viable counts over 8 h.
