Ribonucleases are evoking medical interest because of their intrinsic cytotoxic activity. Most notably, ranpirnase, which is an amphibian ribonuclease, is in advanced clinical trials as a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer. Here, we describe a strategy to create a novel antiviral agent based on bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A), a mammalian homologue of ranpirnase. Specifically, we have linked the N- and C-termini of RNase A with an amino acid sequence that is recognized and cleaved by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease. This linkage obstructs the active site, forming an HIV-specific RNase A zymogen. Cleavage by HIV-1 protease increases ribonucleolytic activity by 50-fold. By relying on the proper function of HIV-1 protease, rather than its inhibition, our approach will not engender known mechanisms of resistance. Thus, we report an initial step toward a new class of agents for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
