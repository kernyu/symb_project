A nonpathogenic rhizobacterium, Pseudomonas putida LSW17S, elicited systemic protection against Fusarium wilt and pith necrosis caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and P. corrugata in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.). LSW17S also confers disease resistance against P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000) on Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0. To investigate mechanisms underlying disease protection, expression patterns of defense-related genes PR1, PR2, PR5, and PDF1.2 and cellular defense responses such as hydrogen peroxide accumulation and callose deposition were investigated. LSW17S treatment exhibited the typical phenomena of priming. Strong and faster transcription of defense-related genes was induced and hydrogen peroxide or callose were accumulated in Arabidopsis treated with LSW17S and infected with DC3000. In contrast, individual actions of LSW17S and DC3000 did not elicit rapid molecular and cellular defense responses. Priming by LSW17S was translocated systemically and retained for more than 10 days. Treatment with LSW17S reduced pathogen proliferation in Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 expressing bacterial NahG; however, npr1, etr1, and jar1 mutations impaired inhibition of pathogen growth. Cellular and molecular priming responses support these results. In sum, LSW17S primes Arabidopsis for NPR1-, ethylene-, and jasmonic acid-dependent disease resistance, and efficient molecular and cellular defense responses.
