Kept under continuous medical surveillance were 77 children with streptococcal tonsillitis. In all patients, a pathogenic streptococcus (GABHS) was invariably found in culture. Among other common features of the above disease were decline in the tonsil colony resistance state and lowering of those parameters characterizing immunity. A highly efficient means of treating tonsillitis of streptococcal etiology has been elaborated, relying on the use of macrolides and L. acidophilus according to our methods, which can, we believe, come to be widely used in health care practice.
