Several defined vaccine candidate antigens of Schistosoma japonicum have shown promise in large animal vaccination experiments. However, vaccination of mice in the laboratory with either single recombinant antigens or DNA encoding forms of the individual antigens has so far failed to induce significant protection against S. japonicum cercarial challenge infection as judged by worm reduction, although specific antibodies were generated. This is in contrast to the results achieved using radiation-attenuated vaccines which are highly protective. Even in large animal vaccination experiments, the protection levels obtained with single defined antigens were far below those achieved using the attenuated vaccines. One possible interpretation is that the immune responses induced by single antigen vaccination may not be strong enough to combat the challenging infection. We, therefore, carried out mouse vaccination experiments using a cocktail DNA vaccine comprising four DNA plasmids encoding four different S. japonicum antigens, Sj62, Sj28, Sj23 and Sj14-3-3, respectively. We, also investigated whether co-injection of the mouse IL-12 encoding plasmid with the cocktail DNA vaccine was able to enhance the Th1 responses and hence the protective immunity. Three intramuscular injections of the cocktail DNA vaccine induced a significant Th1-type cellular response with high level of IFN-gamma production by splenocytes upon in vitro stimulation with recombinant antigens. Importantly, significant IgG antibody responses were also induced against crude worm antigens. In two out of three experiments, significant resistance (34-37 and 44-45%, respectively) was demonstrated while another experiment did not show any protection against S. japonicum cercarial challenge infection. Co-injection of the IL-12 encoding DNA did not further enhance these responses, nor the level of resistance, compared with the cocktail DNA alone.
