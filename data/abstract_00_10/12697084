BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified the control of antimicrobial resistance as an important effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with health care. Methods to prevent these infections in surgical patients have rarely been addressed specifically. METHODS: The peer-reviewed literature and published guidelines were examined to identify proven or suggested techniques for controlling antimicrobial resistance that would be particularly relevant to surgeons and the surgical patient population. RESULTS: A multi-step approach to the prevention of antimicrobial-resistant infections in surgical patients was developed. This program consists of four major strategies: Infection prevention, effective diagnosis and treatment of infection, optimal antibiotic utilization, and the prevention of transmission. CONCLUSION: The control of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria is an important objective for all physicians, including surgeons. An approach to attain this goal in surgical populations is outlined. Further research will be needed to determine the value of these practices and to develop newer, even more effective interventions.
