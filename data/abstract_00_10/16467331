The TruGene human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotyping kit/OpenGene DNA sequencing system (Bayer HealthCare, Tarrytown, NY) reliably produced clinically acceptable resistance profiles for reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors on patient samples diluted to approximately 100 copies/ml following extraction with the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). One modification of the standard protocol was made to guarantee PCR amplification: a centrifugation step to concentrate virus was added before RNA extraction. For genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing, no significant differences in the identification and sensitivity of detection for codon mutations, base mutations, and multibase sites were found between the original and diluted samples.
