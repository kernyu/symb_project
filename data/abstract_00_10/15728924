Selection of resistant mutants in sequential subcultures with increasing concentrations of six and four different fluoroquinolones was studied for one reference strain each of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma hominis, respectively. All fluoroquinolones tested selected for resistance, with alterations affecting the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the four target topoisomerase genes.
