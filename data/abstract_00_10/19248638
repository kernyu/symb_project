Man's desire to conquer diseases and to find a cure for them exists from the beginnings of humankind However the first scientific discoveries of substances with antibacterial effects originate from 1877 and they are attributed to the researches of Louis Pasteur Ever since, we have been living in so-called antimicrobial era. The battle between microorganisms, trying to survive antimicrobials, and man's wish to conquer diseases, resulted in the development of resistance to antimicrobials, but simultaneously led to the development of novel antimicrobials. Their role is primarily in therapy of complicated and polymicrobial infections caused by multiresistant strains. In spite of precisely defined legal obligations, the usage of antimicrobials in Serbia is still very problematic due to their availability in pharmacies without prescription, and lack of local strategies for antimicrobial resistance surveillance.
