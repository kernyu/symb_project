OBJECTIVE: To determine if isoniazid- and/or rifampicin-free antituberculosis treatment regimens are safe and effective and to identify any factors that might require changes in the regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study of patients treated with isoniazid- and/or rifampicin-free regimens between 1995 and 2005 at 2 specialized hospitals in Barcelona, Spain. Predictive factors were studied by logistic regression and the odds ratio; 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were included in the study: 35% were immigrants and 34% were infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The reason for omitting isoniazid or rifampicin was toxicity (53%), followed by multidrug resistance (39%). Rifampicin-free regimens were most common (42%). A change in the isoniazid- and/or rifampicin-free regimen was required in 30% of cases, but was not associated with being an immigrant. The rate of toxicity with these regimens was higher (36%), although progress was always satisfactory. Clinical course was satisfactory in 77% of patients and they were discharged. CONCLUSIONS: Isoniazid- and/or rifampicin-free regimens with adequate follow-up showed similar treatment outcomes compared with standardized treatment regimens. Although these regimens were more toxic, patient progress was good.
