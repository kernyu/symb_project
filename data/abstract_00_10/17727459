During the last year, epidemiologic studies have shown that spontaneous clearance of Helicobacter pylori infection has a less significant role in countries with high prevalence and, in contrast to adults, there is no male predominance of H. pylori infection in children. Early acquisition of H. pylori may play a role in the development of recurrent abdominal pain in children less than 5 years of age. In this very young age group, the adequate performance of stool antigen test and (13)C urea-breath test demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity and specificity as non-invasive methods to diagnose H. pylori infection. In the current paper, the most relevant pediatric studies on H. pylori infection published between April 2006 and March 2007 are reviewed.
