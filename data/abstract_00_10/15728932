A lack of sigma(B) activity reduces methicillin resistance in heterogeneous Staphylococcus epidermidis 1057, whereas inactivation of the anti-sigma factor RsbW switched the phenotype to homogeneous expression of resistance. Oxacillin induction of mecA transcription is reduced in a sigma(B)-negative strain. However, mecA is not involved in the switch of expression phenotype.
