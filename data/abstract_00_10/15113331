Europe has been at the forefront of efforts to control antibiotic resistance, and this globally important health care problem has prompted numerous recommendations for action at both the national and international levels. Starting in 2002, research on antimicrobial resistance has been considered to be one of the specific objectives of the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) within the European Union. This report summarises the plenary presentations, as well as the findings of six Working Groups covering specific areas of antibiotic resistance, given at a conference in November 2003 entitled 'The Role of Research in Combating Antibiotic Resistance', co-organised by the European Union and the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, and held in Rome under the patronage of the Italian government.
