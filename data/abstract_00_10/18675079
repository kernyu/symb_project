BACKGROUND: Complications related to posttransplantation immunosuppressive therapy remain common. New-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (PTDM) is a well-recognized complication associated with reduced graft and patient survival. The type of immunosuppression may be responsible for more than two thirds of PTDM. We retrospectively reviewed our experience in a population of 284 kidney transplant recipients, evaluating the incidence of PTDM with regard to the type of immunosuppression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2005, 284 kidney transplantations were performed using tacrolimus-based (TAC) immunosuppression in 192 patients and a cyclosporine-based (CyA) regimen in 62 patients, whereas 30 patients received sirolimus-based immunosuppression. RESULTS: The overall incidence of PTDM was 4.9%. Among the immunosuppression protocols, 8 patients (4.1%) received TAC and 6 patients (9.6%) received CyA, whereas no patients treated with sirolimus developed PTDM. Graft and patient survival rates were 93% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The overall risk of PTDM with recent immunosuppressive protocols is low, but it is increased among calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-treated kidney transplant recipients. Sirolimus did not increase the risk of PTDM, allowing potential clinical application in diabetic recipients and in patients affected by PTDM.
