Antimicrobial-resistant foodborne pathogens are acquired primarily through consumption of contaminated food of animal origin or water. While there is much disagreement on the health burden imposed by resistance in foodborne bacterial pathogens, it is generally agreed that the use of antimicrobials, whether for growth promotion, prevention, or treatment, can select for resistant bacterial pathogens, and that these pathogens can be transmitted on food originating from sites processing treated animals. Information on the evolution and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in foodborne pathogens shows that the situation is complex and differs by organism and antimicrobial. A clearer understanding of the ecology of resistance is needed in order to support science-based assessments of the public health risks due to the use of antimicrobials in the animal husbandry environment.
