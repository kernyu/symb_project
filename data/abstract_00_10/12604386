Over the last years, the emergence of resistance to antibiotics has complicated the management of streptococcal infections. The resistance of streptococci to antibiotics is increasing and seems to be linked to the consumption of antibiotics. Resistances to antibiotics have been noted in all species of streptococci and no family of antibiotics is unaffected by resistances. The incidence of resistance to antibiotics varies from one species to another and according to countries. Presently, even though no Streptococcus pyogenes has shown diminished susceptibility to betalactams, this phenomenon has been reported for some strains in the B, C, and G groups, and for up to 56 % of oral streptococci. As for the resistance to macrolides, it reaches as many as 41 % of Streptococcus pyogenes, 46 % of group B streptococci, and 63 % of oral streptococci responsible for severe infections. This evolution is worrying for all streptococci but particularly for oral streptococci which represent a potential reservoir of virulence genes, notably towards Streptococcus pneumoniae. New families of antibiotics as the ketolides or the oxazolidinones appear to be effective in the treatment of streptococcal infections, but it seems that only a policy of control of the consumption of antibiotics could globally decrease the occurrence of resistance.
