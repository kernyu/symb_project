The increasing prevalence of resistant Gram-positive cocci requires the need to search for more effective agents and synergistic combinations. Forty-two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), 30 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 36 Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strains were studied. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined and synergy testing was performed by using E test for daptomycin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate against staphylococci; for daptomycin, ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin against enterococci. Daptomycin in combination with ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin was tested against enterococci; daptomycin in combination with ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ticarcillin-clavulanate was tested against staphylococci. Interaction categories were defined by the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index. All strains of staphylococci and enterococci were susceptible to daptomycin. All three combinations showed synergy against more than 70% of the MRSA strains. Daptomycin in combination with ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin against enterococci showed synergies of 64.2%, 57.1% and 21.4%, respectively. This study indicates that daptomycin alone and combined with beta-lactams seems to be effective against MRSA, but further in vitro and in vivo studies on the subject are required before clinical use can be recommended.
