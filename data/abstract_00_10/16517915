We developed a new multiplex PCR assay for detection of Panton-Valentine leukocidin virulence genes and simultaneous discrimination of methicillin-susceptible from -resistant staphylococci. This assay is simple, rapid, and accurate and offers the potential for prompt detection of newly emerging community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
