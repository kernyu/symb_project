Infections due to Staphylococcus aureus are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Antimicrobial resistance in strains of S. aureus is a continually evolving problem, including widespread methicillin resistance in hospitals, increasing methicillin resistance in community strains, and the recent acquisition of glycopeptide resistance. New antimicrobials with activity against S. aureus have recently entered the market or are in the late stages of development. In addition, there has been significant interest in the development of novel and immune-based strategies for prevention or treatment of S. aureus infections. This review describes established and emerging therapies for S. aureus infections, and considers the safety profiles and likely impact on present treatment standards of novel agents either undergoing clinical development or emerging onto the market.
