Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of plant disease resistance is of central importance to sustainable agriculture and human health. Use of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has resulted in an explosion of information regarding both disease resistance and susceptibility to pathogens. The last 20 years of research have demonstrated the commonalities between Arabidopsis and crop species. In this review, commemorating the 10th anniversary of the sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome, we will address some of the insights derived from the use of Arabidopsis as a model plant pathology system.
