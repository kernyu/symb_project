To describe the presence of protease inhibitor (PI) resistance-associated mutations and subtype distribution in drug-naive villagers of six provinces of Cameroon, we sequenced the protease (PR) gene (297 bp) of 128 viruses. Secondary PI resistance-associated mutations were identified at five sites: L10I/V (16%), K20R (8%), M36I (98%), L63P (13%), and V77I (6%). No primary mutation in the PR was identified. Of the 128 specimens analyzed, subtypes A (11%), C(2%), D (6%), F2 (3%), G (6%), H (0.8%), J (6%), and CRF02_AG (60%) were identified. The mutations identified were not characteristic to any particular subtype. The absence of primary mutations, in addition to the few secondary mutations, gives good perspectives for PI treatment interventions in these rural areas.
