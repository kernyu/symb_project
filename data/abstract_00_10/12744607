Analogs of 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxycytidine, MMdCyd (1) by substitution at N4 were synthesized to impart resistance against deamination. The anti HSV-1 activity and solution conformation of analogs were determined. N4-Butanoyl-MMdCyd (10) was a potent inhibitor of HSV-1 replication while N4-hexanoyl-MMdCyd (11), N4-propanoyl-MMdCyd (9) and N4-acetyl-MMdCyd (8) had good activity against HSV-1 replication. All other analogs were devoid of activity against HSV-1.
