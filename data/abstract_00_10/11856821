Antioxidants are likely potential pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease. Metallothionein (MT) is a cysteine-rich protein and functions as an antioxidant. This study was designed to determine whether MT confers resistance to acute alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity and to explore the mechanistic link between oxidative stress and alcoholic liver injury. MT-overexpressing transgenic and wild-type mice were administrated three gastric doses of alcohol at 5 g/kg. Liver injury, oxidative stress, and ethanol metabolism-associated changes were determined. Acute ethanol administration in the wild-type mice caused prominent microvesicular steatosis, along with necrosis and elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase. Ultrastructural changes of the hepatocytes include glycogen and fat accumulation, organelle abnormality, and focal cytoplasmic degeneration. This acute alcohol hepatotoxicity was significantly inhibited in the MT-transgenic mice. Furthermore, ethanol treatment decreased hepatic-reduced glutathione, but increased oxidized glutathione along with lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and superoxide generation in the wild-type mice. This hepatic oxidative stress was significantly suppressed in the MT-transgenic mice. However, MT did not affect the ethanol metabolism-associated decrease in NAD(+)/NADH ratio or increase in cytochrome P450 2E1. In conclusion, MT is an effective agent in cytoprotection against alcohol-induced liver injury, and hepatic protection by MT is likely through inhibition of alcohol-induced oxidative stress.
