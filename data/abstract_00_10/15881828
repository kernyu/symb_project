A new actinomycete strain designated as BT-408 producing polyketide antibiotic SBR-22 and showing antibacterial activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus has been characterized and found to be a novel strain of Streptomyces psammoticus. Nutritional and cultural conditions for the production of antibiotic by this organism under shake-flask conditions have been optimized. Glucose and ammonium nitrate were found to be best carbon and nitrogen sources respectively for growth and antibiotic production. Similarly initial medium pH of 7.2, incubation temperature of 30 degrees C and incubation time of 96 h were found to be optimal. Optimization of medium and cultural conditions resulted in 1.82-fold increase in antibiotic yield.
