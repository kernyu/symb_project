OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of restriction of third-generation cephalosporin use on antibiotic resistance and the outcome of patients with infection. DESIGN: A prospective, before-after comparative study. SETTING: A general intensive care unit with 14 beds at a university-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the intensive care unit within 2 yrs. INTERVENTIONS: A new antibiotic treatment strategy was implemented during phase II. All patients with confirmed or suspected Gram-negative bacterial infections were treated mainly with antibiotics other than third-generation cephalosporins. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Antibiotic resistance among common Gram-negative bacilli and infection-related hospital mortality during phase I were compared with phase II. A 26.6% reduction in third-generation cephalosporin use (from 168.2 +/- 48.0 to 123.5 +/- 39.3 g/month, p =.021), accompanied by a 277.7% increase in cefepime use (from 10.3 +/- 19.2 to 38.9 +/- 31.7 g/month, p =.014) occurred in phase II compared with phase I. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in reduced susceptibility of Gram-negative bacilli to third-generation cephalosporins (p <.05), mainly because of the improved susceptibility of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species (p <.05). Infection-related hospital mortality was significantly lower in phase II (19.3% vs. 36.3%, p =.014). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated lower respiratory tract infection, the status of immunocompromise, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration as independent risk factors for infection-related hospital mortality (p <.05), whereas infection with E. coli or Klebsiella species (p =.039) and restriction of third-generation cephalosporin use (p =.025) were associated with a significantly lower mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Restriction of third-generation cephalosporin use may improve the antibiotic susceptibility and reduce infection-related hospital mortality in critically ill patients.
