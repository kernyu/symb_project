BACKGROUND: [corrected] The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the outcome of directly observed therapy short course (DOTS) application in a Nigerian rural community. METHODS: A retrospective study of all the records of DOTS at the centre from January 2001 to December 2005 was compiled and features such as: age, gender, drugs used, and outcome of treatment (defaulted, cured, died, or developed multidrug resistant-TB) were considered. Also the different personnel and infrastructure at the centre for the programme were also assessed. Results were analysed using Epi Info 6 statistical software, and P values < 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy four (274) cases of pulmonary TB were registered at the centre during the study period, consisting of 100 (36.5%) females and 174 (63.5%) males with a statistically significant gender difference (P<0.001). The age range with the highest number of pulmonary tuberculosis cases was 31-40 years (24.8%; n=68), and the age range with the lowest number was 71 years and above (1.1%; n=3). Treatment outcome showed that 84.7% (n=232) completed treatment with cure; 2.5% (n=7) developed multidrug resistance at completion of treatment; 5.5% (n=15) defaulted; 3.3% (n=9) died in the course of treatment, and treatment in 11 people was still ongoing. CONCLUSION: The outcome of DOTS in the present study was impressive, and the programme should be extended to other rural communities; however, more efforts should be made towards the tracing of defaulters.
