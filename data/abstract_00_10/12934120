BACKGROUND: We wanted to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of urinary tract pathogens in uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in adult women in Norway. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine samples from 312 adult women with symptoms of uncomplicated urinary tract infections from eight general practices were included. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was found in 187 samples (60%). E coli was isolated from 153 (82%) of these samples. Other isolated uropathogens were S saprophyticus 18 (10%), Proteus spp 6 (3%), Klebsiella spp 4 (2%), Enterobacter spp 2 (1%), enterococci 1 (0.5%) and other Gram-positive bacteria 3 (1,5%). No fungi were isolated. Of the E coli isolates, 1 %, 1 % and 9 % were resistant to nitrofurantoin, mecillinam and trimetoprim respectively. All S saprophyticus isolates were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and trimetoprim. INTERPRETATION: Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract pathogens causing uncomplicated urinary tract infections in adult women in general practice is still low in Norway.
