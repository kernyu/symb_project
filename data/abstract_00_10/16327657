Effective therapies are available that can stop or slow down the progression of HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is a combination of antiretroviral drugs such as viral protease inhibitors or nucleoside-analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. Among the side effects due to these drugs, lipodystrophy is a pathology characterized by fat wasting in face and limbs, accumulation of visceral fat, breast adiposity, cervical fat-pads, hyperlipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia), insulin resistance, and lactic acidemia. The main clinical features include peripheral fat loss (presumed lipoatrophy in the face, limbs, and buttocks) and central fat accumulation (within the abdomen, breasts, and over the dorsocervical spine, so-called "buffalo hump"). Histopathological features disclose a peculiar type of involutional lipodystrophy. Skin biopsies generally show thinning of the subcutaneous fat, associated with fibrosis, lipogranuloma and sometimes vessel proliferation. There is still an open debate concerning the precise responsibility of HAART as well as the metabolic pathways and mechanisms that are involved in the onset of lipodystrophy. There is no proven therapy for any component of lipodystrophy syndrome.
