A microelectronic array assay was developed to specifically genotype Helicobacter pylori versus Helicobacter heilmannii and to determine antimicrobial resistance. Helicobacter 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes were specifically generated with Helicobacter genus-specific primers, respectively. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16S rRNA, 268T specific in the H. pylori sequence, and 263A specific in H. heilmannii were used as molecular markers for identification of H. pylori and H. heilmannii, respectively. A triple-base-pair resistant mutation, AGA965-967TTC in 16S rRNA, is known to be responsible for H. pylori tetracycline resistance and was detected to identify resistant strains. H. pylori macrolide resistance was determined by the identification of 3 defined mutations in the 23S rRNA gene using the same method. The assay could be directly used to detect H. pylori in feces. The assay performs multiple determinations, including identification of Helicobacter species and antibiotic resistances, on the same microelectronic platform and is highly amenable to the development of other DNA-based assays.
