Five hundred nineteen Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from nasopharyngeal aspirates of 3,157 children (age, <16 years) participating in a respiratory surveillance study in Hong Kong in 2005 and 2006 indicated that 64.9% and 37.2% of the isolates were not susceptible to penicillin and cefotaxime, respectively. The rate of potential coverage by the seven-valent conjugate vaccine was 72.3%, and the rate increased to 74.6% for serogroup-specific types.
