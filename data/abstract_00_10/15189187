Fourteen Fonsecaea pedrosoi isolates from six chromoblastomycosis patients were submitted to susceptibility testing. Some patients were undergoing treatment with itraconazole (ITZ) and/or cryosurgery with liquid nitrogen. The antifungal agents amphotericin B (AMB), ITZ, fluconazole (FCZ), ketoconazole (KCZ), 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), and terbinafine (TBF) were tested. AMB and FCZ showed less activity for all isolates. The most active agents were KCZ and TBF. Sequentially isolates from four patients presented ITZ minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) higher than the previous ones; for two of these patients, response to therapy with this agent was not observed. These results suggest development of microbiologic resistance to ITZ in four instances, two of them coinciding with lack of clinical response to this drug.
