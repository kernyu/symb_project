Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy in the United States. Modest advances with therapeutic approaches that include oxaliplatin (L-OHP) have brought the median survival rate to 22 months, with drug resistance remaining a significant barrier. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is undergoing clinical evaluation. Although human colon carcinomas express TRAIL receptors, they can also demonstrate TRAIL resistance. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation has been implicated in resistance to TRAIL and to cytotoxic agents. We have demonstrated constitutive NF-kappaB activation in five of six human colon carcinoma cell lines; this activation is inhibited by quinacrine. Quinacrine induced apoptosis in colon carcinomas and potentiated the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL in RKO and HT29 cells and that of L-OHP in HT29 cells. Similarly, overexpression of IkappaBalpha mutant (IkappaBalphaM) or treatment with the IKK inhibitor, BMS-345541, also sensitized these cells to TRAIL and L-OHP. Importantly, 2 h of quinacrine pretreatment resulted in decreased expression of c-FLIP and Mcl-1, which were determined to be transcriptional targets of NF-kappaB. Extended exposure for 24 h to quinacrine did not further sensitize these cells to TRAIL- or L-OHP-induced cell death; however, exposure caused the down-regulation of additional NF-kappaB-dependent survival factors. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of c-FLIP or Mcl-1 significantly sensitized these cells to TRAIL and L-OHP. Taken together, data demonstrate that NF-kappaB is constitutively active in colon cancer cell lines and NF-kappaB, and its downstream targets may constitute an important target for the development of therapeutic approaches against this disease.
