Pretreatment with salicylic acid (SA), an inducer of plant disease resistance, enhanced the capacity of parsley cells for the induction of a rapid K(+)/pH response and the subsequent coumarin (phytoalexin) secretion. In SA-primed cells, a low elicitor dose induced these two responses to a similar extent as did a high elicitor dose in non-primed cells. These observations suggest that the SA-mediated augmentation of the early K(+)/pH response may contribute to the enhancement of subsequent coumarin secretion. As the amphotericin B-induced K(+)/pH response was not enhanced in SA-primed cells, it is concluded that signaling components that are improved by priming are located between elicitor signal perception and the plasma membrane transporters mediating the K(+)/pH response.
