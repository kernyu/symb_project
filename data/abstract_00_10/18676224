Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production by Enterobacteriaceae is an emerging problem. This 3-year prospective study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of such enzymes among the clinically significant isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae family gathered from patients, and to evaluate the different techniques for their detection as well as their clinical significance. Members of the Enterobacteriaceae family isolated from blood, inhibited by the third-generation cephalosporins with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of < or =2 microg/ml and MIC < or =8 microg/ml and isolates from other sources inhibited by MIC < or =8 microg/ml were also investigated for ESBL production by VITEK2 and E test. Their clinical significance in septicemic patients was analyzed. Out of 3,215 isolates, 1018 (31.7%) were ESBL-producers by both VITEK2 and E test. Of these, 428 (42%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae and 376 (37.0%) were Escherichia coli with overall prevalence rates of 13.3% and 11.7%, respectively. There were a total of 184 septicemic patients infected by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae out of which 134 (73%) needed modification of therapy; most (58%) of these patients were initially on third-generation cephalosporin therapy. A total of 58 (31.5%) patients were infected by ESBL-producing blood isolates which were inhibited by cefotaxime/ceftriaxone at MICs =8 microg/ml (within the susceptibility range). Resistance to both aminoglycosides and quinolones were significantly higher among ESBLproducing isolates compared to non-producers (P <0.05). This study highlights a high prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a major tertiary teaching hospital in our country and demonstrates that almost a third of the ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae blood isolates would have been released as susceptible by routine susceptibility testing; a finding inimical to optimal therapeutic success.
