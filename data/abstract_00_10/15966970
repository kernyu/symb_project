A molecular approach was developed to identify drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by means of biochips with oligonucleotides immobilised in polyacrylamide gel pads. The technique was based on multiplex PCR, followed by hybridisation on an oligonucleotide microarray, and detected > 95% of rifampicin-resistant and c. 80% of isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates within 12 h. In total, 220 drug-resistant isolates and 131 clinical samples were tested using biochips. The sensitivity and specificity of the developed method were comparable with those of standard bacteriological testing of M. tuberculosis drug resistance.
