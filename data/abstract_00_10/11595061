AIM: To assess antibiotic susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains to metronidazole, clarithromycin and tetracycline in the Chinese population, and to test the stability of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori 1 year after storage at -80 degrees C. METHODS: Fifty H. pylori strains isolated from patients with peptic ulcer disease were recovered from storage at -80 degrees C. Susceptibility of these strains to metronidazole, clarithromycin and tetracycline was determined by using validated disk diffusion tests, which was repeated 1 year after storage at -80 degrees C. The DNA profiles of each strain were determined by using the polymerase chain reaction-based-random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting technique (PCR-RAPD). This was repeated if any change in antibiotic susceptibility pattern was noticed. RESULTS: The resistance rate was 50% to metronidazole and 8% to clarithromycin. None of the strains was resistant to tetracycline. A dual resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin was demonstrated in three H. pylori strains. The antibiotic susceptibility test reproduced itself in 92% (36 of 39) of the strains 1 year later; the three strains with dual resistance exhibited susceptibility to both antibiotics. Variation in antibiotic susceptibility pattern in the three H. pylori strains was associated with change in the RAPD fingerprint. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of resistance in H. pylori is high to metronidazole but low to clarithromycin in the Chinese population. The disk diffusion test appears to be a simple and reliable test, while antibiotic resistance in some H. pylori strains may disappear after long-term storage at -80 degrees C.
