The effect of cocultivation of eukaryotic HeLa cells and Mycoplasma hominis mycoplasma on the resistance of the latter to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin) was examined. It was shown that cocultivation of the M. homonis and HeLa cells during 24 h with subsequent addition of ciprofloxacin resulted in an increase of the mircoplasma resistance to this antimicrobial agent. In the M. hominis cells cultivated in the presence of HeLa cells and the increasing concentration of ciprofloxacin mutations in the parC gene were observed only at low concentrations of the antimicrobial agent, while mutations in the gyrA gene were never detected. A gradual elevation of ciprofloxacin concentration up to 10 micrograms/ml resulted in the reversion of the parC mutations in mycoplasmas. Mycoplasma cells resistant to high flouroquinolone concentrations and isolated after cocultivation with the HeLa cells were characterized by the wild-type genotype in respect of the gyrA and parC genes. It was shown for the first time that infection of HeLa cells resulted in the appearance of genome rearrangements in M. hominis cells.
