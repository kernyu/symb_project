OBJECTIVE: To obtain primary knowledge of drug resistance of Staphylococcus, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS), so as to facilitate clinical decision over the choice of appropriate antibiotics. METHOD: A total of 105 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus,were isolated from blood, sputum, pus and secretion sample from in-patients of Nanfang Hospital from January to July, 2002, and their status of drug-resistance was examined. RESULTS: MRS was isolated from 68.8% of the samples, and 69.6% of these isolates were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 63.3% resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). The rate of multi-drug resistance for MRS was much higher than that for methicilllin-susceptible Staphylococcus (MSS), and MRSA showed high multidrug resistance rates (all>50%) to the antibiotics erythromycin, imipenem, amikacin, SXT, ciprofloxacin, which fell into 4 categories according to their different antibiotic mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and high MDR rate of MRS isolated form the samples suggest that in cases of infection, identification of the pathogenic bacterium should be routinely performed. Besides controlling MRS infection, importance should also be given to its prevention.
