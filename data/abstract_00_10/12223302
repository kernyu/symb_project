Cefoxitin-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are widespread in Korea. Significant proportions of them are considered to be CMY-1 producers. For effective screening of CMY-1 producers, the Hodge test was modified by using a cefoxitin disk and the performance was evaluated. The sensitivity and specifity of the test were 100% and 94.9%, respectively. The test was easier to perform than the three-dimensional extract test. This modified test should be suitable for screening CMY-1-producing strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae.
