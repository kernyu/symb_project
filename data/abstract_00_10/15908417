Immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) improve host resistance to listeriae. CpG ODN trigger immune cells to produce gamma interferon and "prime" host cells to secrete nitric oxide in response to bacterial exposure. CpG treatment does not protect inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 knockout mice, indicating that NO is critical to CpG-mediated protection against listeriae.
