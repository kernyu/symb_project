A series of 22 novel 1,2-disubstituted-1H-benzimidazole-N-alkylated-5- carboxamidine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against S. aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), E. coli, E. faecalis and for antifungal activity against C. albicans. Compound 59 [1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-N- (2-diethylaminoethyl)-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxamidine], with a 3,4-dichlorophenyl group at the C-2 position, displayed the greatest activity (MIC = 3.12 microg/mL against both some bacteria and the fungus C. albicans).
