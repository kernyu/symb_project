The clinical impact of these three bacterial threats is readily apparent to any who practice pediatrics. The potential virulence of CA-MRSA and MDR pneumococci and the threat of failed antimicrobial options for MDRGN pose enormous challenges now and in the near future. With careful attention to antimicrobial stewardship, however, and knowledge of the clinical and epidemiologic factors of these organisms, one can hope to mitigate the impact on patient care and outcomes while awaiting ongoing discovery of new antimicrobial options. Most important, however, will be careful and thoughtful management of any new antimicrobial products to protect their efficacy for the future.
