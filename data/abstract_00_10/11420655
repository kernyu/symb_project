Benomyl-resistant (BR) and wild-type (WT) strains of Fusarium lateritium were examined for their tolerance to benomyl on potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing benomyl and control of the Eutypa lata in grapevine bioassays. The WT strain grew on PDA containing 1 microg/ml benomyl at 13, 26 and 29 degrees C. The BR strain grew on PDA containing 10 microg/ml benomyl at 4 degrees C, on PDA containing 100 microg/ml benomyl at 29 degrees C, and on PDA containing 1,000 microg/ml benomyl at 13 degrees C and 26 degrees C. The BR strain was also able to colonize grapevine segments and control E. lata in the presence of 1,000 microg/ml benomyl. Both strains were amenable to production via liquid fermentation and both achieved 100% control of E. lata in grapevine bioassays. Neither the duration of fermentation nor incubation temperature during grapevine bioassays influenced the efficacy of either strain against E. lata. The results suggest that application of BR F. lateritium alone or in combination with benomyl may provide good control of E. lata.
