There has been a marked decline in the industrial research aimed at discovering novel antibacterial agents, including new drugs that target resistant organisms. While this decline may reflect past cyclical changes that often affect resource allocation at pharmaceutical companies, this decline is occurring at a time of increasing levels of antibacterial drug resistance and meagre pipelines of new agents that are active against them. There are multiple reasons for this decline, although few are unique to antibacterial drug discovery research. These include: lack of industry productivity, increasing size of clinical trials, increased generic competition and other pressures on drug pricing, a crowded and confused marketplace and industry consolidation. And while many (if not most) large companies and biotechs have exited the field or severely curtailed their research, others have made it a point to continue their efforts, citing both the unmet medical need and a large and apparently growing market. Despite the fact that some companies have remained engaged, the view here is that the current level of industrial effort is insufficient to sustain a healthy flow of new and better agents that are needed to counter the imminent threat of bacterial drug resistance. Therefore, a clear and urgent need for finding ways to improve the level and quality of industrial research in this area is apparent.
