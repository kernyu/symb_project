We summarize 41 cases of bacterial meningitis in the last 11 years caused by Haemophilus influenzae. All isolates were serotype b strain (Hib). Initial chemotherapy was started with ceftriaxone (CTRX) in 22 cases, ampicillin plus cefotaxime (CTX) in 9, CTRX plus panipenem/betamipron in 5, and CTX in 2. Some 31 cases were treated mainly with CTRX. Although therapeutic antibiotics showed good susceptibility for isolates, 8 complicated cases (19.5%) occurred. Sequalae were observed in 7 (17.1%) but none were fatal. Five strains with elevated MIC of CTX (0.12 to 1 microg/mL) recovered after 2001, and 3 of 5 strains also showed elevated MIC of CTRX (0.12 to 0.5 microg/mL), but all were cured completely with CTRX. At present, no treatment failures due to antibiotic resistance have been observed, and CTRX remains suitable as initial therapy for Hib meningitis. A decline in susceptibility for third-generation cephalosporin against beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae is emerging, however, so it will be necessary to consider combination therapy with CTRX given the foreseeable trend in MICs.
