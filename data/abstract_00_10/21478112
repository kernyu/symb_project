Extended spectrum beta-lactamases production is one of the most common mechanism of resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics is increasing worldwide. Twenty five strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from clinical specimens were tested. Based on the phenotypic confirmatory test all these strains were defined as ESBL producers named ESBL(+). The plasmid DNA from each strains was used to investigate the presence of blaSHV genes responsible for extended spectrum beta-lactamases production. Moreover, susceptibility of these strains to antibiotic other than beta-lactams in was tested.
