The study evaluated the development of drug resistance in a group of HIV-1 patients. After failure to respond to previous therapy with two non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), as assessed by the presence of a rebound in viral load or a constant high level of HIV plasma viraemia, the patients were treated with a combination of stavudine, lamivudine and efavirenz (EFV). Results showed that viruses carrying primary mutations, usually K103N, T215Y and M41L, presented higher levels of HIV-1 RNA, suggesting an association between a precise mutation pattern and treatment failure.
