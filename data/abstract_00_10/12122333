General treatments for immunocompetent individuals with herpes simplex infections are based on the use of antiviral agents which constitute the only treatment with proven efficacy. Antivirals were developed in the 1980s with aciclovir (ACV) as the leading compound and have greatly changed management. However, once the virus has penetrated the organism, it cannot be eradicated, neither by the immune system nor by antiviral agents. This viral resistance is basically related to its capacity to maintain itself in a latent form in the sensorial ganglions. ACV is the first line treatment, used since the 1980s; other antiviral agents are also available.
