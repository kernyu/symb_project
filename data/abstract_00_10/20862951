OBJECTIVE: To transform the antimicrobial peptide fusion gene of cecropin B and rabbit NP-1(CN) into Houttuynia cordata to improve its antimicrobic capability. METHOD: The fusion gene of CN designed and synthesized artificially was recombined with expression vector pBI121. The recombined vector was transformed to Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404, by which CN gene was transformed to the explants of H. cordata. The transgenic regeneration plantlets were selected by kanamycin and rapid screening PCR. The transgenic plants were identified by PCR-Southern of genomic DNA and RT-PCR. The disease resistances were detected by antibacterial zone trail of leaf extracts to E. coli K12 and infection by Rhizoctonia solani. RESULT: Gene of interesting CN was inserted into genomic DNA and expressed in transformed H, cordata, whose resistance to E. coli K12 and Rh. solani was stronger than that of the non-transformed control. CONCLUSION: The fusion gene CN can improve antimicrobic capability of transformed H. cordata.
