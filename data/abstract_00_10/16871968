Susceptibility to triclosan in Staphylococcus aureus was determined. The study was carried out on 200 strains, including 100 resistant (MRSA) and 100 susceptibile (MSSA) to methicillin. The examined strains were isolated from varied clinical samples and patients in 18 medical centers, in majority from hospitals in the region of Gdansk. The susceptibility was estimated by the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) using dilution test in Mueller-Hinton agar. The antimicrobial resistance patterns were determined, including resistance to methicillin and mupirocin. The most of MRSA strains (62%) demonstrated reduced susceptibility to triclosan (MIC 2mg/L), while 93% of MSSA strains were highly sensitive to this antibacterial agent (MIC 0,031mg/L). The majority (66,1%) of MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to triclosan demonstrated the same antimicrobial resistance pattern. Reduced susceptibility to triclosan was observed in 8 from 9 high - level mupirocin resistant strains, but the most of MRSA strains with reduced triclosan susceptibility (91,5%) were found among fusidic acid resistant strains.
