Preclinical and clinical investigations of levofloxacin in complex with antituberculosis drugs of the main and reserve groups in 152 patients with newly diagnosticated drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis demonstrated its efficacy and safety. The adverse events due to levofloxacin (8.6% of the cases) disappeared after discontinuation of the drug use without any affection of the patient's organs. Levofloxacin is applicable in antituberculosis therapy of patients with extended, acute progressing or polycavernous tuberculosis of the lungs. It provides significant clinical improvement and if necessary allows to prepare the patient in a short period for surgical operation.
