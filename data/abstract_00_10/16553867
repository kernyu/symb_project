The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of cefoxitin disc diffusion as a prediction of oxacillin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and also to compare genotypic and phenotypic methods for detecting this resistance property. A total of 151 clinical CoNS isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of the mecA gene (gold standard method). The isolate susceptibilities were determined by the disc diffusion method with oxacillin (1 microg) and cefoxitin (30 microg) and by the agar dilution method for cefoxitin and oxacillin. Although none of the techniques showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, the cefoxitin disc diffusion and oxacillin agar dilution were the best methods for detecting resistance to oxacillin among CoNS as these methods produced the best negative and positive predictive values. A combination of methods can be used routinely to identify resistance to oxacillin in CoNS.
