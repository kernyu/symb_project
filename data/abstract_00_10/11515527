Mating experiments between Magnaporthe grisea Japanese rice pathogens and Guy11, a hermaphroditic fertile rice pathogen, were done aimed at identification of avirulence genes. A cross named cross 2107 with thirty-six random progenies was obtained. Segregation analyses of genetic markers found that the cross was less suitable for genetic analysis. Backcrosses with cross 2107 progenies and Guy11 were done and another cross named cross 5307 with sixty-five progenies was obtained. A locus controlling kasugamycin resistance named Ksg1R was identified and used for a model case of genetic mapping. Bulked segregant analysis was done to find adjacent RAPD markers for mapping of the gene. Three adjacent markers to Ksg1R were obtained and a genetic map around the Ksg1R was made, but these markers were not located on a single chromosome. These results suggest that genetic analysis to identify a gene locus is available in cross 5307. Infection assay of parental strains of cross 5307 to Japanese differential rice cultivars suggested the possibility of genetic analysis of cultivar specificity toward four rice cultivars: Aichi-asahi, Kusabue, Tsuyuake, and K59.
