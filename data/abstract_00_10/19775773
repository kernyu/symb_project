Current knowledge about noroviruses in relation to healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) merely scratches the surface. Most data come from outbreak-based studies, which represent only a small piece of the puzzle. Nevertheless, the data available show that the clinical impact of noroviruses is particularly severe in outbreaks in healthcare settings, and that it may be increasing. Coupled with the projected increases of the population aged >65 years, especially those needing healthcare, it is timely to consider noroviruses in discussions around HCAIs. In particular, broadening the scope from a field mostly discussing bacteriological problems and a more holistic approach to dealing with HCAIs may be needed to avoid introducing new risks when trying to deal with the antimicrobial resistance problem.
