We report 2 outbreaks of Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive, doxycycline-resistant, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infections in French soldiers operating in Cote d'Ivoire. In a transssectional survey, nasal carriage of this strain was found in 2.9% of 273 soldiers about to be sent to Cote d'Ivoire and was associated with prior malaria prophylaxis with doxycycline.
