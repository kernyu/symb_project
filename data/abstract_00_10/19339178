In search of new 4-aminoquinolines which are not recognized by CQR mechanism, thiourea, thiazolidinedione and thioparabanic acid derivatives of 4-aminoquinoline were synthesized and screened for their antimalarial activities. Thiourea derivative 3 found to be the most active against CQ sensitive strain 3D7 of Plasmodium falciparum in an in vitro model with an IC(50) of 6.07ng/mL and also showed an in vivo suppression of 99.27% on day 4 against CQ resistant strain N-67 of Plasmodium yoelii.
