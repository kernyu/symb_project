A total of 74 Streptococcus thermophilus isolates collected between 1948 and 2005 from different environments were investigated to assess erythromycin, clindamycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and ampicillin susceptibility by means of microdilution, Etest and disk diffusion methods. For this purpose a new S. thermophilus Susceptibility test Medium (SSM) was developed. This medium allowed a better identification of strains with atypical tetracycline resistance. The recipe is a mixed formulation of Iso-Sensitest medium (90% v/v) and M17 medium (10% v/v) supplemented with lactose (0.5% w/v). The overall agreement of the techniques was good with exception of tetracycline, for which Etest provided lower MICs than the microdilution method. Most strains were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested while a few erythromycin, tetracycline and streptomycin resistant strains were detected.
