Oropharyngeal candidiasis is the most common fungal infection among patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. It can be treated with either systemic or topical antifungal agents, which are indicated empirically on the basis of clinical data. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of yeast in mouthwashes from HIV-positive patients, compare the results between patients presenting different states of immunodeficiency, and investigate the susceptibility profile of the species isolated in relation to antifungal agents, with the aim of evaluating whether the treatments used in clinical practice are able to reach the majority of the species identified. Yeasts were isolated from 58% of the mouthwash samples collected. Candida albicans was the most (93%) frequent species. Resistance or dose-dependent susceptibility in relation to the antifungal agent tested was registered in approximately 17% of the samples. The significant variability of responses suggests that there are limitations regarding the effectiveness of the empirical therapies instituted.
