Several studies have suggested an association between the use of antimicrobial agents in animal feeds and an increased risk that humans will contract resistant strains of bacteria such as Salmonella species, Escherichia coli, and other enteric isolates. The authors of this study evaluated whether animal feeds might serve as sources of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially bacteria that are pathogenic to humans. From July through August 1998, samples of feed ingredients were collected from a total of 50 feed piles located on 12 dairy farms in western Oregon. From a subset of 10 piles, repeated samples were collected over time until each pile was depleted. Analysis of the samples indicated that 42.0 percent of all 50 piles and 60.0 percent of the piles from which there was repeated sampling were presumptive positive for Salmonella. Sixty-two percent of 50 Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed ampicillin resistance, and 10.0 percent displayed tetracycline resistance. Other bacteria displayed varying degrees of resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, or a combination of these antimicrobials. The extent of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in feed ingredients observed in this study raises significant concerns about the potential for human health risks from food-producing animals such as dairy cows.
