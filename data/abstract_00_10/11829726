Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis for people of all age groups after infancy. Prior to the emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci as the cause of meningitis, penicillin was the traditional therapy for this life-threatening infection. Treatment guidelines for both suspected and confirmed cases of pneumococcal meningitis (PM) have had to evolve in response to the phenomenon of increasing antibiotic resistance. In addition, research efforts have attempted to clarify the role of dexamethasone and the importance of prompt antibiotic therapy in the management of patients with PM. This article provides a review of general therapeutic principles, current treatment guidelines and alternative therapeutic choices for patients with PM.
