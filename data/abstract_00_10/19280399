Jolted into action by the thalidomide tragedy, developed Western countries began to establish national systems for identifying and responding to adverse drug reactions and events (or pharmacovigilance systems) about 40 years ago. These systems focus on side effects, adverse reactions, and drug interactions. In developing countries, especially in Africa, the scope for pharmacovigilance needs to be broader (despite the additional challenges this brings) because of growing problems with substandard and counterfeit drugs and the need to have an early warning signal system for the development of antimicrobial resistance to the 'new essential drugs' that are barely beyond the clinical trial stage in Africa, e.g. artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) for malaria and antiretrovirals (ARV) for HIV/AIDS. Zambia learned important lessons from its own initial experiences in attempting to use ACT as a pathfinder for pharmacovigilance, as well as its experience with other drug information systems. In preparing its own renewed plans, it also drew lessons from international experience, including the weaknesses of the Food and Drug Administration's approach to pharmacovigilance in the USA, the UK's 'yellow card scheme', Brazil's fledgling pharmacovigilance systems for AIDS treatment, and the guidance provided by the World Health Organization and the Uppsala Monitoring Centre. These lessons are relevant for other African countries and even for developed countries seeking to improve pharmacovigilance systems.
