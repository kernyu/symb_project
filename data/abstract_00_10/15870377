Nineteen E. faecium strains isolated from chicken caecum samples, collected in slaughterhouses and highly resistant to vancomycin or gentamicin, were coresistant to erythromycin, and/or tetracyclines, and/or streptogramins, and/or avilamycin. Multiple antibiotic resistance was related to the presence in various combinations of aac(6')-aph(2"), erm(B), emtA, mef(A), tet(L), tet(M), and vanA genes.
