The hepatic peptide hormone hepcidin regulates plasma iron concentrations and tissue iron distribution by inhibiting dietary iron absorption and mobilization of iron from stores in macrophages and hepatocytes. Dysregulation of hepcidin production underlies many iron disorders. Deficient production of hepcidin causes systemic iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis and iron-loading anemias, such as beta-thalassemia, whereas hepcidin excess contributes to the development of anemia in inflammatory disorders and chronic kidney disease, and may cause erythropoietin resistance. The Scientific Program on Iron and Heme session at the 51st ASH annual meeting discussed recent advances in understanding hepcidin biology and explored the potential for hepcidin therapeutic applications. The session included three 30-min presentations.
