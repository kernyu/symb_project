The prevalence of resistance to cephalosporins among viridans-group streptococci causing 88 (18%) cases among 485 bacteraemias in neutropenic cancer patients was studied. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefpirome and cefepime were 22, 53, 14 and 34%, respectively. Previous administration of beta-lactam therapy was the only factor significantly associated with bacteraemia due to cephalosporin-resistant strains; only 11 (16%) of 68 patients infected with cephalosporin-susceptible bacteria had received these antibiotics compared with 10 (50%) of 20 patients infected with cephalosporin-resistant bacteria (P = 0.0052).
