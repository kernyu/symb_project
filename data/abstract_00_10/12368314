The coding region of influenza A virus RNA segment 7 from the 1918 pandemic virus, consisting of the open reading frames of the two matrix genes M1 and M2, has been sequenced. While this segment is highly conserved among influenza virus strains, the 1918 sequence does not match any previously sequenced influenza virus strains. The 1918 sequence matches the consensus over the M1 RNA-binding domains and nuclear localization signal and the highly conserved transmembrane domain of M2. Amino acid changes that correlate with high yield and pathogenicity in animal models were not found in the 1918 strain. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that both genes were mammalian adapted and that the 1918 sequence is very similar to the common ancestor of all subsequent human and classical swine matrix segments. The 1918 sequence matches other mammalian strains at 4 amino acids in the extracellular domain of M2 that differ consistently between avian and mammalian strains, suggesting that the matrix segment may have been circulating in human strains for at least several years before 1918.
