This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter and Salmonella isolates from retail poultrymeat in the UK during 2003-2005. Poultrymeat (n = 2104) were more frequently contaminated with Campylobacter (57.3%) than with Salmonella (6.6%). Chicken exhibited the highest contamination from Campylobacter (60.9%), followed by duck (50.7%), turkey (33.7%) and other poultrymeat (34.2%). Duck had the highest contamination from Salmonella (29.9%), compared with chicken (5.6%), turkey (5.6%), and other poultrymeat (8.6%). C. jejuni predominated in raw chicken, whereas C. coli predominated in turkey and duck. C. coli isolates were more likely to exhibit antimicrobial drug resistance, including quinolones, than C. jejuni. Salmonella Enteritidis was the most frequent Salmonella serotype isolated. Salmonella isolates from turkey exhibited higher rates of multiple drug resistance (55.6%) than isolates from chicken (20.9%) and duck (13.6%). The findings reinforce the importance of thorough cooking of poultrymeat and good hygiene to avoid cross-contamination.
