Enterococci are the third most common pathogen isolated in bloodstream infections. Increasing resistance against multiple antimicrobial agents has left few treatment options for enterococcal infections, and alternative therapeutic approaches are needed. Although a variety of virulence factors have been described for Enterococcus faecalis, only aggregation substance (AS) and a teichoic acid-like capsular polysaccharide have been evaluated for their potential for vaccine development. Antibodies raised against purified capsular polysaccharide are highly opsonic and protect mice against bacteremia after active and passive immunization. Since E. faecalis expresses only a limited number of capsular serotypes, this antigen may be an attractive candidate for development of a conjugate vaccine.
