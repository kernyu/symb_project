INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to determine the most frequent microorganisms in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 6-month prospective study was conducted in a NICU. All neonatal hospital infections were registered, and microorganisms were isolated by standard methods. Their susceptibility to antibiotics was tested using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-four neonatal nosocomial infections were detected. 87% of all infections were supported by a microbiological diagnosis, and 144 pathogens were isolated Gram-negative bacteria were dominant (80%). The most commonly isolated microorganisms were Acinetobacter spp. (47.9%), Pseudomonas spp, (23.6%), Klebsiella/Enterobacter spp. (8.3%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.3%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) were the most frequent reported gram-positive bacteria. All microorganisms showed resistance to most of commonly used antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Environmental control around neonatal patients and strict antibiotic policy are important in prevention of nosocomial transmission of resistant bacteria in the NICUs.
