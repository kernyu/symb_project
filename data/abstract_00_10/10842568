Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is an increasing problem in many areas of the tropics. In most countries there is little information available to determine the patterns of resistance in different pathogens, nor are local data available to influence prescribing. This paper will review the development of antimicrobial resistance in the tropics, consider the current priority problems, and suggest strategies that may be taken to improve the surveillance of resistance.
