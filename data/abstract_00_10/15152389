Enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) are relatively avirulent enteric bacteria that usually only cause infections in immunocompromised patients. Antimicrobial treatment, however, is hampered as enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. For years, vancomycin was considered the last available antibiotic. Plasmid-mediated resistance against vancomycin among enterococci was first described in the nineteen-eighties and since then incidences of infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have increased dramatically, especially in the United States. In 2000, three outbreaks of VRE occurred in hospitals in the Netherlands and a set of infection-control measures was proposed to limit further transmission. These measures were based on the simultaneous isolation of VRE from multiple patients. All three outbreaks were controlled by these measures and no new outbreaks in Dutch hospitals have been reported since then. Epidemiological studies have shown that hospital outbreaks on three continents were caused by a subpopulation of E. faecium, which is characterized by the presence of a potential virulence gene (variant esp) and resistance to amoxicillin. This 'hospital strain' of E. faecium has probably been prevalent within hospital settings for some time, but only became clinically relevant when it had acquired vancomycin-resistance. Current advice is to implement the set of infection control measures formulated in 2000, only in those patients colonized by amoxicillin-resistant VRE. The potential dangers of VRE were recently underlined by the proven transmission of the vancomycin-resistance gene from VRE to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in two patients in the United States. It is in the interest of the patients that prevalence of VRE and MRSA in Dutch hospitals should be kept as low as possible.
