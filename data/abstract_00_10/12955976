Most cases of malaria in the United States, including the case described below, are due to travelers not taking proper prophylactic medications. With a potentially long incubation period, patients are frequently misdiagnosed (often with viral syndrome or pharyngitis) and correct treatment is delayed. Effective preventative medicines include Malarone, mefloquine, and doxycycline. Chloroquine, a staple of malaria prevention in the past, now has very limited usefulness due to drug resistance.
