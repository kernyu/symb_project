The in vitro inhibitory activities of quinolones against Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA gyrase were measured. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase were 1.67, 4.80, 12.2 and 13.9 mg/L, respectively, and correlated well with their MICs. Two altered proteins of GyrA containing Ala-90Val, or Ala-90Val and Asp-94Gly were also purified and the inhibitory activities of the quinolones ranged from 12 to >83 times weaker than those against the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that mutations in the corresponding genes confer quinolone resistance.
