We have monitored the in vitro sensitivities of Plasmodium falciparum isolates predeployment and during the deployment of artesunate plus amodiaquine treatment in Mlomp, Casamance (southwestern Senegal) during 2000 to 2004. Parasites remained susceptible to both drugs. Chloroquine resistance levels were high but stable. Quinine continues to be effective.
