Antibacterial resistance continues to increase world wide, with some bacterial pathogens exhibiting resistance to virtually all available drugs. As the plague of antibacterial resistance continues to grow and create serious therapeutic problems, it is essential that the development of new antibacterial agents continue. Pharmacodynamic research plays an important role in the development of new antibacterial agents, as pharmacodynamic data can help define the clinical potential of a new drug and identify the strengths and weaknesses in comparison to other drugs already on the market. Furthermore, pharmacodynamic experiments can help focus the clinical phases of drug development by providing key information on the pharmacodynamic parameters that influence efficacy and the pharmacodynamic targets that should be achieved to optimize clinical success. Characterization of these pharmacodynamic properties for a new drug in development can help direct the design of the best dose and dosing strategy for clinical trials. This review will focus on the tools, methods, and strategies used to characterize the pharmacodynamics of antibacterial agents and aide in their development for clinical use.
