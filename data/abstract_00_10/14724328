The percentage of AIDS cases among women--particularly women of color--in the United States is increasing yearly. Despite this increase, there has been a relatively steady decline in the number of AIDS cases occurring perinatally. Regardless of the reasons HIV-infected couples choose to become pregnant, studies indicate that providing support, such as contraceptive counseling and assisted reproduction techniques, can improve the health outcome in the face of HIV-related challenges. Issues specific to antiretroviral therapy, including viral resistance, pregnancy outcomes, and adverse fetal effects, complicate the treatment of perinatal HIV. Postpartum case is yet another area that requires special consideration when supporting HIV-infected parents and children. The growing body of data on pregnancy and HIV may indicate a rising commitment to research of and support for the unique challenges HIV-infected families face.
