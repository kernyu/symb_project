In Salmonella typhimurium, a single enzyme catalyzes both the acetyl CoA-dependent O-acetylation of hydroxylamines (a key step in the activation of mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds and related aromatic and heterocyclic amines) and the N-acetylation of aromatic amines. S. typhimurium Ames test mutants lacking this activity are highly resistant to the genotoxic effects of nitro compounds. However, such mutants have not yet been obtained in Escherichia coli. We used a PCR-based method to engineer a null mutation (deletion) of the nhoA gene encoding the enzyme in E. coli and we transduced this mutation into a lacZ strain background suitable for use in mutation assays. In E. coli, as in S. typhimurium, nhoA mutants show marked resistance to nitro compound mutagenicity. The new strains provide a clean background for expression of recombinant N-acetyltransferases.
