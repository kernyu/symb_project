The objective of this study was to examine the degree of phenotypic and genotypic diversity between 43 French Taylorella asinigenitalis strains isolated from 22 jacks, two stallions and one mare between 1995 and 2008 by culturing genital swabs obtained during routine diagnosis for contagious equine metritis. This retrospective analysis revealed the existence of T. asinigenitalis species since 1995 and the natural colonization of a mare's genital tract in 2001. Despite the presence of 27 different patterns revealed by the combination of API ZYM, antibiogram and 16S rDNA profiles, we show that T. asinigenitalis is a highly homogeneous species. API ZYM diversity only concerns acid phosphatase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase activity. The majority of strains are susceptible to a wide range of antimicrobial agents but most are streptomycin-resistant (95.5%), ampicillin-resistant (88.4%), and four strains are atypical due to a high degree of resistance to at least eight antimicrobial agents. 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed only two clusters and revealed similarity of 99.3-100% between T. asinigenitalis strains. The geographic origin of the 43 isolates correlates to the two 16S rDNA clusters.
