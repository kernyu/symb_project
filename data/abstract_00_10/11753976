BACKGROUND: An every-2-week regimen of gemcitabine and paclitaxel was adapted for patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) who had received prior cisplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Forty-one patients with advanced or metastatic TCC who had received prior cisplatin-based systemic chemotherapy were treated with an outpatient regimen of gemcitabine 2500-3000 mg/m(2) and paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Forty of 41 patients had measurable disease. Response was observed in 24 patients (60%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 45-75%). Eleven (28%) achieved complete response, and 13 (33%) obtained partial response. Twenty of 25 patients (80%; 95% CI, 64-96%) who had been previously treated in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting responded versus 4 of 15 (27%; 95% CI, 5-49%) in patients who received prior methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin (M-VAC) for metastatic disease. The median duration of survival for patients given gemcitabine and paclitaxel after failing neoadjuvant or adjuvant M-VAC was 12 months (range, 2-43+), as compared with only 8 months (range, 2-28) for patients who had been treated after failure of prior therapy for metastatic disease. For all patients, the median duration of response was 6.4 months (range, 2-43.3+ months), and the median survival was 14.4 months (range, 2-43+). Thirteen patients (32%) developed World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia, with febrile neutropenia in 3 (7%) patients. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given to 10 (24%) patients. There was no Grade 3-4 anemia or thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of gemcitabine and taxol in previously treated patients with recurrent TCC is highly effective and produces objective durable responses. This every-2-week schedule is a well tolerated outpatient regimen with minimal toxicity.
