Pelvic inflammatory disease and upper genital tract infection describe inflammatory changes in the upper female genital tract of any combination: endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, peritonitis in the small pelvis. The International Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends a revision of the CDC guidelines taking into account the type of germ or the triggering agent and the seriousness of the disease. Infections with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are increasing worldwide. They are one of the main causes of tubal sterility, chronic abdominal pain and ectopic pregnancies. More than 30% of the infections are subclinical and asymptomatic. Therefore it is most recommendable to generally screen young, sexually active women with any of the risks mentioned above. Antibiotic therapy should be started as early as possible, in case of doubt even probatively, and should cover a broad spectrum of germs. C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should be treated according to resistance testing. In uncomplicated cases, hospitalization is unnecessary, ambulant therapy is sufficient.
