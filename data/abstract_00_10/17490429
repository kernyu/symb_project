Many Candida spp. produce surface-adherent biofilm populations that are resistant to antifungal compounds and other environmental stresses. Recently, certain chelating agents have been recognized as having strong antimicrobial activity against biofilms of Candida species. This study investigated and characterized the concentration- and time-dependent killing of Candida biofilms by the chelators tetrasodium EDTA and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. Here, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis biofilms were cultivated in the Calgary Biofilm Device and then exposed to gradient arrays of these agents. Population survival was evaluated by viable cell counting and by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in conjunction with fluorescent viability staining. At concentrations of > or =2 mM, both EDTA and diethyldithiocarbamate killed c. 90-99.5% of the biofilm cell populations. Notably, a small fraction (c. 0.5-10%) of biofilm cells were able to withstand the highest concentrations of these antifungals that were tested (16 and 32 mM for EDTA and diethyldithiocarbamate, respectively). Interestingly, CLSM revealed that these surviving cells were irregularly distributed throughout the biofilm community. These data suggest that the use of chelating agents against biofilms of Candida spp. may be limited by the refractory nature of a variant cell subpopulation in the surface-adherent community.
