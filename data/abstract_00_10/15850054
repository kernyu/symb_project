Clinical and microbiological efficacies of antibiotic rotation in the intensive care unit of the Hospital were evaluated. The results of the local microbiological monitoring of the profile of the acquired resistance of gramnegative nosocomial pathogens (n = 151) isolated from adult patients with artificial ventilation of the lungs for more than 3 days after the open heart operations (n = 150) were analysed. Three 6-month cycles of cephalosporins rotation in the following order were performed: cefoperazone--ceftazidime--cefepime. The procedure provided a significant decrease in the frequency of infectious complications (7.2 vs. 4.5%, p=0.015). The rotation did not require any increase of the use of reserve antibiotics such as vancomycin and carbapenems. The use of the drugs active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa promoted its eradication in the structure of the nosocomial pathogens in the intensive care unit.
