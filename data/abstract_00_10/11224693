The prognosis of untreated patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is poor, as the disease progress to end-stage renal disease in approximately 50--70% of nephrotic patients. Although focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially considered to be a steroid-resistant disease, several studies have shown a better responsiveness to more prolonged courses of steroids. For patients with steroid-resistant or -dependent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, cyclosporine A and cytotoxic agents have shown efficacy in clinical trials. Plasmapheresis or LDL-apheresis may represent a rescue treatment in patients who do not respond to other therapies. The role of other agents used in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, including azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, pefloxacin or vitamin E is still poorly defined.
