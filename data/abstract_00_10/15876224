The in vitro susceptibility to penicillin G, erythromycin and clindamycin was determined by the disc diffusion test and by E-test for a total of 47 streptococcal strains (three Streptococcus uberis, 36 Streptococcus agalactiae, eight Streptococcus dysgalactiae spp. dysgalactiae) isolated from bovine intramammary infections in Argentina. Moreover, resistance phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant streptococcal isolates was characterized. MIC90 of penicillin G, erythromycin and clindamycin for S. agalactiae were 0.75, 8.0 and 12.0 microg/ml respectively. Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was detected in 13 (27.6%) and 12 (25.5%) isolates respectively. No isolate was resistant to penicillin G. Resistance against macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLS(B)) represented by the constitutive MLS(B) phenotype was present in 11 (23.4%) erythromycin-resistant isolates and two isolates (4.3%) expressed the M phenotype. The inducible MLS(B) phenotype was not identified. Results suggest that beta-lactams are the first-line antibiotics when treating streptococcal udder infections; however, the continuous monitoring of the antibiotic resistance is essential, as the emergence of resistant strains has become a growing concern on the therapy of bovine mastitis.
