Prompt detection of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producing isolates is necessary to prevent their dissemination. Frequency of MBLs producing strains among multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was evaluated in critical care patients using imipenem-EDTA disk method. One hundred MDR Acinetobacter spp. and 42 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were checked for MBL production, from January to June 2001. MBL was produced by 96.6 % of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter isolates, whereas 100% imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeroginosa isolates were MBL producers. Carbapenem resistance in MDR Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in this study was due to MBLs. This calls for strict infection control measures to prevent further dissemination.
