A cross-sectional study was carried out in our tertiary care hospital between January 1998 and December 2001. All 161 consecutive patients naive to nelfinavir and who had received a nelfinavir-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) of at least 24-week duration were extrapolated from the 802 adult HIV-infected subjects treated with antiretroviral therapy. All cases of virologic failure were considered and viral genotyped. Virologic failure occurred in 80 out of 161 nelfinavir-treated patients, all belonging to the experienced group. On the whole, only 11 patients (7%) developed the D30N substitution, whose 6 was in association with the N88D mutation. Among the 80 failed patients, the M184V mutation was detected in 52 (65%), while only 7 patients showed simultaneously the M184V, T215Y and K103N substitutions. In our HIV-infected population receiving a nelfinavir-based HAART, the D30N mutation has shown a low absolute frequency, while the detection of M184V substitution and the simultaneous occurrence of M184V, T215Y and K103N mutations were related to a more favorable virological response.
