The present endeavor was conducted to evaluate the role of activated macrophage in the susceptibility of two different rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) strains, a susceptible American (T) and a more resistant German (H), to infection with Myxobolus cerebralis. Arginase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) genes were used as references to the alternative and classical pathway of macrophage activation. The expression level of both genes was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression level of arginase-2 was significantly upregulated in strain T at 2 h and 8 days post exposure in the strain H. In case of iNOS, the expression level was significantly upregulated from 24 h to 8 days p.e. in strain T and only in 8 days p.e. in strain H. During this study also, the influence of nitric oxide (NO) on the viability of the triactinomyxon spores (TAMs) of M. cerebralis was evaluated using the NO-donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP). Rising final concentrations of SNAP from 0.25 to 1 mM at 2, 4, and 24 h resulted in increasing numbers of propidium iodide-positive TAMs detected. The results of this study suggest an inability of strain T to react with an effective immune response against infection with M. cerebralis. Furthermore, the TAMs of M. cerebralis react with significant decrease of viable spores to rising concentration of SNAP and longer incubation, but there is also evidence for some resistance to NO activity.
