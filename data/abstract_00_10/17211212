Defensins are cationic peptides of the innate host defense system with antimicrobial activity against many of the microorganisms commonly found in burn units. Beta defensins are variably expressed in the epithelia of skin and other organs. Human beta defensin 4 reportedly has antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is not normally expressed in intact skin. Genetic modification was used to ectopically express human beta defensin 4 in cultured primary epidermal keratinocytes. Keratinocytes expressing human beta defensin 4 showed significantly elevated antimicrobial activity against clinically-isolated P. aeruginosa compared with controls. These results suggest that genetic modification of keratinocytes can increase their resistance to microbial contamination. Bioengineered skin replacements containing human beta defensin 4-modified keratinocytes may be useful for transplantation to contaminated burn wounds.
