Evernimicin (EV) belongs to the orthosomycin class of antibiotics and consists of several modified L- and D-deoxysugars containing unusual orthoester and glycosyl linkages and two orsellinic acid groups, one that is halogenated. The EV biosynthetic gene cluster from Micromonospora carbonacea var. africana ATCC39149 was localized by hybridization to a dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase probe and a 120-kb region containing the EV biosynthetic cluster and surrounding regions has been sequenced. BLAST analysis has identified a type I polyketide synthase for orsellinic acid biosynthesis as well as enzymes required for L- and D-deoxyglucose and D-deoxymannose synthesis. In addition, genes involved in glycosyltransfer and resistance were identified. Insertional mutations in several biosynthetic genes blocked EV production, indicating a role for these genes in EV biosynthesis.
