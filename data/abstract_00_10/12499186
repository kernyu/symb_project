Pneumococcal resistance to antimicrobials presents problems to physicians for empirical treatment of acute otitis media (AOM). Three hundred thirty-three isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae selected for nonsusceptibility to penicillin (MIC >0.1 microg/ml) from the middle ear (n = 325) or mastoid (n = 8) of children seen between 1994 and 2000 at four children's hospitals in the United States were tested by broth microdilution for susceptibility to nine antibiotics. Using NCCLS 2002 breakpoints, resistance to the following drugs was as indicated: amoxicillin, 1%; azithromycin, 71%; cefprozil, 71%; ceftriaxone, 2%; cefdinir, 98%; erythromycin, 70%; levofloxacin, 0%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 93%. Of the penicillin- and erythromycin-nonsusceptible isolates, 97% were inhibited by cethromycin (ABT-773) and 83% were inhibited by telithromycin at a concentration of <or=0.125 microg/ml. Macrolide resistance among penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci increased from 44 to 80% in the 6 years of the study from which the isolates were selected; however, the proportion of isolates with M or MLS(B) phenotypes remained constant over the time period (53 and 18%, respectively). Prior treatment with a macrolide or clindamycin alone or in combination with a beta-lactam resulted in 94 or 85% of isolates causing infections being macrolide and or clindamycin resistant. No prior individual macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin, or clarithromycin) resulted in more macrolide resistance or in a more prevalent resistance phenotype. The ketolides appear to be active antimicrobials against penicillin- and macrolide-resistant pneumococci.
