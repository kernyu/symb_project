Penicillin and chloromycetin were regarded as the sign of resistance to antibodies of R. leguminosorum USDA2370 and S. xinjiangnesis CCBAU110 respectively. Using the protoplast fusion technique, USDA2370 and CCBAU110 were successfully fused. Fusion hybrid can inoculate in the leguminous of parental strains respectively. There were apparent differences between parents and fusion hybrid in cell morphology, colony and pattern of whole-cell protein. The values of DNA homology between fusion hybrid and USDA2370 and CCBAU110 were 56.6% and 10.2% respectively.
