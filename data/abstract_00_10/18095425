The aims of this study were to ascertain the population structure and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella enterica serovars isolated in 2002 from food in 16 Spanish regions. Serovars were characterized by serotyping, phage typing, antimicrobial susceptibility, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, and 264 nonrelated strains were selected for further analysis. The main sources were eggs and their derivatives (21.6% of strains), poultry and related products (16.6%), and seafood (16.3%). High serotype diversity was detected (51 serotypes); the most common were Enteritidis (n = 96, 36.3%) and Typhimurium (n = 53, 20.1%), followed by a miscellaneous group of 49 different serotypes (n = 115, 43.5%). A 15% increase in Salmonella Enteritidis isolation was observed. Common phage types for Salmonella Enteritidis were PT1 (41.6% of isolates), PT4 (9.4%), PT6 (9.4%), and PT6a (9.4%), and common types for Salmonella Typhimurium were DTU302 (18.8%), DT104 (15.1%), and DT104B (13.2%). Salmonella Enteritidis strains were categorized into eight PFGE types with a similarity of 81 to 96%, and 73.9% of the strains were grouped into just one cluster. Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were divided into 13 PFGE types with a similarity of 64 to 86%, and one predominant clone contained 41.5% of the strains. Resistance rates for Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, and the miscellaneous group were, respectively, 8.3, 69.8, and 13.9% for ampicillin, 3.1, 52.8, and 59% for streptomycin, 40.6, 22.6, and 10.4% for nalidixic acid, 15.6, 71.7, and 31.1% for tetracycline, 7.3, 18.8, and 9.5% for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 0, 50.9, and 4.3% for chloramphenicol, and 6.2, 71.7, and 17.4% for multiple (at least four) antimicrobials. All the strains remained susceptible to other beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones. Surveillance of S. enterica isolated from food is strongly recommended to reduce community exposure to antimicrobial resistant strains.
