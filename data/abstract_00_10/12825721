Sixty-six broiler flocks were sampled to determine the presence of Campylobacter spp. at slaughter in 1998. Thirty flocks (45%) tested positive and C. jejuni was identified in all isolates. Combined pulsed-field gel electrophoresis/amplified fragment length polymorphism (PFGE/AFLP) subtyping of 177 isolates from 24 positive flocks revealed 62 subtypes; 16 flocks harboured more than one subtype. When subtyping 101 clinical C. jejuni isolates collected in the same time period and area, 60 PFGE/AFLP types were identified. Comparison of subtypes from poultry and human isolates revealed three shared PFGE/AFLP types, which were present in 11 human isolates. Fifty per cent of all poultry isolates and 39% of all human isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. The present study confirms the increase in ciprofloxacin resistance in both human and poultry C. jejuni isolates in Austria, as observed in several countries worldwide. A small number of human isolates shared PFGE/AFLP types with poultry isolates, however, further studies should also focus on the identification of other sources of C. jejuni infection in humans.
