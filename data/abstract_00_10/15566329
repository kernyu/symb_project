Glycopeptide antimicrobials have been a component of our therapeutic armamentarium for nearly 50 years. Although vancomycin, and more recently teicoplanin, have performed yeoman service over the years, the specter of bacterial resistance among Gram-positive aerobes has created doubts concerning how long they will continue to be useful antimicrobial agents. In an attempt to prolong the utility of the glycopeptides, efforts are underway to create new derivatives with improved pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties. One example of an improved glycopeptide from the pharmacokinetic perspective is dalbavancin (BI397)--a teicoplanin analog currently undergoing human testing. Elimination of this compound from the body occurs extremely slowly, with terminal disposition half-lifes of up to 200 h in healthy volunteers, thus allowing once-weekly dosing. Although not generally considered to be a potential alternative for the treatment of infections due to glycopeptide-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, dalbavancin may still be considered an advance on existing agents based on its patient-convenient once-weekly dosing regimen.
