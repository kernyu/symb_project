Helicobacter pylori infection causes peptic ulcer disease and must be regarded as a serious infectious disease. Over the past two decades treatment of the infection has been a controversial issue. Treatment is purely empirical and based on combinations of two, three or four existing drugs. Antimicrobial resistance is important and an observed increase in the prevalence of resistance may change the relative importance of certain antibiotics. Bismuth-based triple therapy with bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole is a well investigated, cheap and FDA approved regimen to cure the infection. Adding a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) increases efficacy. A novel monocapsule ("Helicide") that contains bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole simplifies the regimen. This new and patient-friendly drug has been investigated in clinical studies and is expected to be released in North America in 2002.
