Information on V. cholerae eltor isolated in the focus of cholera in Kazan in 2001 at different periods of the outbreak is presented. The identity of strains isolated from patients, vibriocarriers and environmental objects, including their antibioticograms (sensitivity to cyprofloxacin and resistance to trimethoprim--sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, furazolidone and nalidixic acid, which may be regarded as markers), is shown. Variable tandem repetitions in the DNA of 30 isolates strains of different origin have been determined. The results of this determination make it possible to classify all these strains as one genotype, which confirms the suggestion on the circulation of one subclone of the infective agent of cholera in the focus. As revealed in this investigation, the isolated strains are labile with respect to diagnostic phage eltor, while ctx+ strains are resistant to phage eltor ctx+.
