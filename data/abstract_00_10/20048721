PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There have been several new compounds developed from new and old antiretroviral drug classes recently that are active against highly resistant HIV-1. The management of patients who are highly drug experienced is complex and challenging and this article reviews current knowledge on the investigational agents in development for these patients. This review will examine some of the compounds that may have a role to play in highly experienced patients in the future. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in early phases of therapy and some dose-ranging efficacy and safety clinical trials of investigational drugs have brought some drugs closer to licensing. New drugs in established classes not only have to be less toxic than the already licensed compounds but also have to be active against resistant viruses, these conditions make drug development difficult. SUMMARY: It is now possible for the majority of patients who are highly experienced in terms of drug treatment and who have virological failure to achieve HIV-1 viral loads below the limit of detection. There are, however, some patients who continue to have virological failure and develop further resistance and these patients need therapy that is effective; new drugs are being developed to meet this need.
