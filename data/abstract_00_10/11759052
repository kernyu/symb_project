The probiotic potential of a Lactobacillus strain, isolated from pig faeces, was assessed as a probiotic in piglets. The strain was examined for resistance to pH 2.0, 0.5% oxgall and antibiotics, and antimicrobial activities against enteric pathogenic bacteria. The probiotic strain, L. reuteri BSA131, was administered through the feed to 25 1-month-old Landrace piglets. The piglets were divided into five groups of five piglets each and fed with different diets for 28 days. The daily consumption of L. reuteri BSA131 was assigned into two groups by the concentration of 10(6) or 10(8) freeze-dried bacteria. Fecal samples were collected before, during, and after consumption. Lactobacilli and enterobacteria cell counts were determined in the fecal samples. The liveweight gains and feed consumption of the piglets were recorded daily. This study showed that strain BSA131 enhanced liveweight gains and feed conversion rates in piglets. It also showed a significant increase in lactobacilli cell counts and decreases in enterobacterial numbers in the fecal samples. Strain BSA131 was considered to be a potential probiotic for piglets, especially after weaning.
