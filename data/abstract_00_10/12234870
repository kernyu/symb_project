Extensive biochemical testing and 16S rRNA and rpoB sequence analysis revealed that clinical strain CF01Ent1, initially identified as Buttiauxella agrestis by the use of Api 32 biochemical strips, is a new organism in the Enterobacteriaceae family. It produced an inducible AmpC-type beta-lactamase whose sequence shares 69 to 72% identity with those of the other AmpC-type beta-lactamases of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: This enzyme exhibits an atypical high affinity for all beta-lactams tested.
