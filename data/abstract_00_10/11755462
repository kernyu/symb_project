P-glycoprotein is a product of the multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, less than 20% of untreated de novo lymphomas express MDR-1 compared with approximately 50% after failure of chemotherapy. We wished to study the expression of MDR-1 in AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (AIDS-NHL). Tissue biopsies from 50 patients with newly diagnosed AIDS-NHL were studied by immunohistochemical analysis using C494, a monoclonal antibody specific for the MDR-1 isoform of P-gp. MDR-1 expression was correlated with patient demographics, lymphoma characteristics, response to chemotherapy, and survival. Forty-six males and four females with a median age of 38 years (range 26-63) were studied. A prior AIDS-defining opportunistic infection was reported in 35 patients (70%). The median CD4+ lymphocyte count was 69/mm(3) (range 0-920). Thirty-two patients (63%) had received prior anti-HIV therapy, including a protease inhibitor in five (10%). Pathologic types consisted of diffuse large cell in 13 (26%), immunoblastic in 13 (26%), small non-cleaved in 22 (44%), and high grade not otherwise specified in two (4%). The majority of patients (76%) had stage III/IV disease. Pre-treatment lymphoma tissues from 33 patients (66%) stained positively for MDR-1. MDR-1 positive patients had a significantly lower complete remission rate compared to MDR-1 negative patients (33 versus 65%, P=0.042). Duration of complete response was significantly longer in MDR-1 negative patients compared with MDR-1 positive patients (not reached versus 9.9 months, P=0.003). Strategies to overcome MDR-1 expression may be important for initial treatment in patients with AIDS-NHL.
