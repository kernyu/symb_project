Selective systems for screening Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. mutants with altered sensitivity to the oxidative stress (OS) inductors norflurazon (NF), acifluorfen (AF), and plumbagin (PB) were developed and a collection of 28 mutants was obtained. Dwarf and necrotic forms predominated among the NF-tolerant mutants, while pigment mutants and those with changed root morphology prevailed among the AF-tolerant and PB-sensitive mutants, respectively. Genetic and biochemical analysis of certain mutants was performed; quantitative and qualitative changes in the content of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase isoforms have been revealed. These data, complemented by the data on the cross-tolerance (sensitivity) of the mutants to paraquat, indicate a correlation between tolerance to the OS inductors and the functions of antioxidant systems.
