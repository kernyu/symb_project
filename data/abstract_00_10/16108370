Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was employed to compare the proteome of Diclazuril-resistance Eimeria tenella with that of sensitive strains for identifying unique proteins of these stains. 5 protein spots were found to express differentially. Four spots which remarkably were measured by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The data obtained from peptide mass fingerprinting were used in NCBInr database search, two protein spots in gel were identified as Eimeria tenella sporulated oocyst TA4 antigen protein, Heat shock 70kD protein, two protein spots were functional proteins of Eukaryote. These proteins are potentially basic work for finding molecular mechanism about drug-resistance of Eimeria tenella and new marker in the detection of resistance of Eimeria tenella.
