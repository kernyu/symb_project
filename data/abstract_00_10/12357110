Nosocomial pneumonia is a dynamic disease with multiple etiologic agents and a changing natural history. The highest attack rates and mortality occur in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia is often made by clinical criteria that are sensitive but lack specificity. The use of quantitative endotracheal aspirates or bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and protected specimen brush clearly improve diagnostic specificity and outcome in patients who are mechanically ventilated. The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant, spp, and has made initial empiric therapy more difficult. Management principles include the use of techniques for more accurate diagnosis and early antimicrobial therapy with appropriate agents along with careful analysis of culture results, clinical response, and potential complications of pneumonia and therapy. Strategies for prophylaxis are of critical importance for risk reduction, improvement in patient outcome, and reduction of hospital costs.
