A study on the prevalence of genital mycoplasmas and their susceptibility to the most common antimicrobial agents used for treating the infection was conducted on 94 women attending a family planning clinic in Guine-Bissau. Fifty-four women (57.4%) were positive for Mycoplasma hominis and/or Ureaplasma urealyticum. M. hominis and U. urealyticum separately isolated from infected women yielded frequencies of 31.5 and 27.8%, respectively, the remainder were infected with both species. No strain was found to be resistant to all three commonly employed antibiotics for the management of these infections (erythromycin, tetracycline and ofloxacin), although multiple resistance to two antibiotics was frequent, especially when both genital mycoplasmas were present. Some 90.7 and 24.1% of all isolates were resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline, respectively. No resistance was observed to ofloxacin, although 50% of the strains had intermediate resistance. The high prevalence of genital mycoplasmas in women attending a family planning clinic in Guine-Bissau, as demonstrated in this study, appears to be associated with trichomonosis and bacterial vaginosis. These infections were also found to be highly resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline and to have intermediate resistance to ofloxacin. However, further studies are necessary to establish the burden of infection due to antibiotic resistant genital mycoplasmas.
