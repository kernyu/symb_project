PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of dentin collagen modifications induced by various cross-linkers on the stability of collagen matrix and the inhibition of root caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following cross-linkers were tested: 5% glutaraldehyde (GA), 0.5% proanthocyanidin (PA), 0.625% genipin (GE). In the first experiment, cross-linker-treated demineralized human root dentin was digested with bacterial collagenase, centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to amino acid analysis to determine collagen content. The residues were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and hydroxyproline analysis. In the second experiment, bovine root surfaces were conditioned with phosphoric acid, treated with the cross-linkers, incubated with Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus for 1 week and the root caries inhibition was evaluated with confocal microscopy. Lastly, the ability of the bacteria to colonize the root surface was evaluated. In this experiment slabs of bovine root were treated with the cross-linkers and incubated in a suspension of S. mutans and L. acidophilus. The slabs were washed, resuspended in water, glucose was added, and the pH measured. RESULTS: While all collagen was digested with collagenase in the control groups, only a small proportion was solubilized in the GA-, PA-, and GE-treated groups. The root caries was significantly inhibited by treatment with PA or GA. Drops in pH in the cross-linker-treated groups were essentially the same as in the untreated group. CONCLUSION: Naturally occurring cross-linkers, especially PA, could be used to modify root dentin collagen to efficiently stabilize collagen and to increase its resistance against caries.
