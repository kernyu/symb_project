Virgin olive oil has a high resistance to oxidative deterioration due to its tryacylglycerol composition low in polyunsaturated fatty acids and due to the presence of a group of phenolic antioxidants composed mainly of polyphenols and tocopherols. We isolated several phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil (phenyl-ethyl alcohols, lignans, and secoiridoids) by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified them using ultraviolet, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, and electrospray ionization MS detection. The purity of these extracts was confirmed by analytical HPLC using two different gradients. Finally, the antioxidant capacity of the isolated compounds was evaluated by measuring the radical scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical, by accelerated oxidation in a lipid model system (OSI, oxidative stability instrument), and by an electrochemical method.
