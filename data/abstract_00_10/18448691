The caspofungin susceptibilities of 28 Candida sp. clinical isolates, including 8 caspofungin-resistant isolates characterized by mutations in the Fks1 protein, were determined by the Etest in RPMI and AM3 media. Good discrimination between wild-type and mutant isolates was obtained. These results suggest that the Etest is valuable for the detection of caspofungin resistance in Candida spp.
