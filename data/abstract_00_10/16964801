The Genotype MTBDR assay was tested for its capability to detect rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) resistance (r) and susceptibility (s) directly from 42 smear-positive sputum specimens (15 RMPr/INHr, 2 RMPs/INHr and 25 RMPs/INHs Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains). The concordance between the MTBDR assay and conventional drug susceptibility testing was 100%.
