Triple-antibiotic ointment (TAO) is a safe and effective topical agent for preventing infections in minor skin trauma. The formulation contains neomycin, polymyxin B and bacitracin in a petrolatum base. TAO is active against the most common disease-causing pathogens found in wounds and on the skin and may be an attractive alternative to oral therapy in select circumstances. Resistance to TAO does not develop readily, and safety studies have shown that the risk of allergic sensitivity to TAO is low. Susceptibility profiles of TAO have remained relatively unchanged since its discovery. Prophylaxis or treatment with TAO should be considered as resistant organisms continue to emerge in the community and hospital setting.
