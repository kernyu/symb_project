With the elimination of malaria now considered a realistic goal, it would be useful for scientists and policy makers to have an inventory of the arsenal of antimalarials, current and prospective, that could help make this goal a reality. In order to provide an overview of antimalarial projects in recent clinical development, we review here the global portfolio of antimalarial drugs in clinical phases of development complemented by projects in the preclinical and early discovery phases. The portfolio is discussed in terms of the novelty of the new molecules and their potential health impact in terms of addressing the requirements for the control and eventual eradication of malaria.
