Monitoring and evaluation of programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) depends on epidemiological assessment using appropriate indicators. Minimum efforts using reliable tests are necessary to guide the programme managers in decision-making. Impact of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) towards filariasis elimination can be assessed by the detection of microfilariae (mf) or parasite DNA (infective), filarial antigens (infected) and antibodies (exposure). It is also important to monitor drug resistance and variation in genetic structure of parasite populations using molecular markers. We developed a method to carry out parasitological, molecular, immunological and genetic analysis from a minimum volume of blood sample (about 150 microl) drawn from finger tip of an individual residing in LF endemic area. The method involves separation of sera for immunological assays and isolation of mf of Wuchereria bancrofti from the blood clots for counting, which were then used for W. bancrofti specific PCR, screening for albendazole sensitivity/resistance alleles by AS-PCR, RAPD profiling and ITS 2 PCR for genotyping. A protocol is also suggested for the separation of sera for assays to detect antigen and antibodies and isolation of mf from clots for genetic analysis. The protocol developed has shown potential application in monitoring several immunological, parasitological and molecular parameters from a limited amount of blood sample collected by finger prick, in large-scale operations.
