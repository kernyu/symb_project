Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease of plasma cells that has fatal consequences. New insights into the biology of MM have identified molecular mechanisms that hold promise as therapeutic targets. Laboratory and preclinical studies have shown that intracellular regulatory proteins and functional interactions between MM cells and the bone-marrow microenvironment have a pivotal role in the growth, survival, drug resistance, and malignant progression of MM cells. New agents associated with molecular targets have prompted clinical investigators to design new treatment strategies initially for advanced MM and later for newly diagnosed MM, with encouraging preliminary results. Here, we discuss the mechanisms of action of these new rational drugs and the preliminary clinical outcomes of a new treatment regimen for MM.
