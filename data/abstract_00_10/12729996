To identify epidemic Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) clones, 38 carbapenem-resistant AB isolates from 5 hospitals were analyzed. Macrorestriction classified 24 isolates as clone IV, susceptibility pattern clustering analysis grouped almost all of them together, and they were uniformly biotype 8. Clone IV was present at all 5 hospitals, so that it represents a carbapenem-resistant AB strain with epidemic behavior.
