OBJECTIVE: This study had for aim to define the pattern of Haemophilus influenzae infections in a Tunisian hospital during the prevaccination era. We determined serotypes, biotypes, and antibiotic susceptibility of H. influenzae strains. DESIGN: 187 H. influenzae strains were identified in various samples between 1999 and 2002. RESULTS: Strains were isolated essentially from respiratory samples in 63.7% and cerebrospinal fluid in 21.4 %. The mean age of children with invasive infections was 16 months. All invasive strains belong to serotype b. Biotypes I, II and III were the most frequent (84.7%). Ampicillin resistance with betalactamase producing mechanism occurred in 26,7% of isolates, this type of resistance was more frequent among invasive strains (37.2%) than in non-invasive ones (22.8%). All betalactamase producing strains had amoxicillin MICs above 1 mg/l, these strains were susceptible to amoxicillin+clavulanate. Three strains were betalactamase negative ampicillin resistant with ampicillin MICs: 1.5, 3, and 4 mg/l. All strains were susceptible to cefotaxim with MICs < 0.19 mg/l. Antibiotic resistance concerned: chloramphenicol: 7.5%, tetracycline: 6.9% and trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole: 13.9%. 8.1% of the strains were kanamicin resistant but concerned only betalactamase producing strains. CONCLUSION: Before the introduction of a conjugate vaccine, all invasive infections in young children were caused by H. influenzae b strains.
