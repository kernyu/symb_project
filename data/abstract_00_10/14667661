Mediastinitis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a devastating potential complication of cardiac surgery. We treated 4 patients with this condition using a new technique. First we performed an early radical removal of infected tissue and omental transposition with direct primary closure of the sternum and closed continuous irrigation with saline/vancomycin hydrochloride; that was followed by an administration of intravenous antibiotics. We obtained good clinical results, which are reported herein along with the clinical courses.
