Eukaryotic halotolerant microorganisms are important as model organisms to understand the general mechanisms of resistance to environmental salinity. The ability of the extremely halotolerant black yeast Hortaea werneckii to combat oxidative stress was addressed, using hydrogen peroxide to generate the reactive oxygen species. Increasing environmental salinity was found to have no effect on its high ability to degrade hydrogen peroxide but resulted in a decrease in viability in response to externally added hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that the latter property determines the upper limit of the salt tolerance of H. werneckii. A refinement of the model of adaptation of H. werneckii to high-salinity environments is proposed.
