The comparative activity of meropenem with that of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime against 856 gram-negative bacilli was studied studied by an agar dilution method. Meropenem and imipenem were high active against tested strains. Resistance to third generation cephalosporins was high for most microorganisms tested. For rapid detection of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing gram-negative bacilli a simple disk diffusion test was used. EDTA, FeCl2 and CuCl2 were evaluated as IMP-1 inhibitors. The method is helpful for screening of IMP-1 producers in daily clinical activity.
