Combination drug therapy for malaria is recommended both to prevent and to overcome drug resistance. Drug combinations developed for use in Asia are being deployed in Africa, where higher rates of malaria affect the therapeutic and public health objectives of malaria chemotherapy as well as drug safety. Rational consideration of drug mechanisms, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and malaria epidemiology should result in more effective combination regimens that retain therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in the face of resistance.
