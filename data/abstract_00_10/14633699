In neuroblastoma cells, apoptotic programs can be activated by cytokines and cytostatic drugs. Apoptotic dysfunction confers resistance against therapeutic drugs and is a major complication for achieving optimal therapy response. Deregulated expression of the MYCN gene is a critical determinant in neuroblastoma progression, and one of the pleiotropic functions of the MYCN protein is cellular sensitization to cytokine-induced and drug-induced apoptosis. By using the functional approach of technical knockout (TKO), we have identified five genes that regulate sensitization for IFN-gamma-induced cell death. Most efficient among them is the newly identified SOXN (neuroblastoma-derived sulfhydryl oxidase), which comprises 12 exons and maps to 9q34.3. SOXN encodes a putative protein of 698 amino acids that contains a signal sequence, a protein-disulfide-isomerase-type thioredoxin and a yeast ERV1 domain and is highly homologous to members of the sulfhydryl oxidase/Quiescin6 family. The SOXN protein is predominantly located in the plasma and in the nuclear membrane. Antisense SOXN confers resistance to IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis. In contrast, ectopic overexpression of sense-SOXN sensitizes the cells to induced cell death. These results identify SOXN as a major player in regulating the sensitization of neuroblastoma cells for IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis.
