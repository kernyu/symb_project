The v-Crk oncogene encodes an adaptor protein containing an SH2 domain and an SH3 domain. v-Crk-transformed fibroblast cells display enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation levels, and the v-Crk protein localizes in focal adhesions, suggesting that transformation may be due to enhanced focal complex signaling. Here we investigated the mechanism of transformation and found that v-Crk-transformed NIH 3T3 cells display growth rates and serum requirements similar to control cells. However, v-Crk enhanced survival in conditions of serum starvation. Both an intact SH2 and SH3 domain are required; moreover, SH2 mutants displayed dominant interfering properties, enhancing cell death. Using other cell death-inducing stimuli, it appeared that v-Crk in general inhibits apoptosis and enhances cell survival. In search of the signaling pathways involved, we found that v-Crk-transformed cells show constitutively higher levels of phospho-protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt and PKB/Akt activity, especially in conditions of serum starvation. These data strongly suggest involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB survival pathway in the v-Crk-induced protection against apoptosis. In accordance, inhibition of this pathway by wortmannin or LY924002 reduced protection against starvation-induced apoptosis. In addition to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB pathway, a MEK-dependent pathway and an unknown additional pathway are also implicated in resistance against apoptosis. Activation of survival pathways may be the most important function of v-Crk in its oncogenic properties.
