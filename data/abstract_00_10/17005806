We investigated the efficacies and durability of novel antimicrobial central venous catheters (CVCs) in preventing the adherence of microbial organisms to the surfaces of the CVCs. Novel antimicrobial CVCs investigated in this in vitro study were impregnated with antibiotics (minocycline and rifampin), with Oligon agent (silver, platinum, and carbon black), with approved antiseptics (chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine), or with a novel antiseptic agent, gendine, which contains gentian violet and chlorhexidine. When tested against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gendine-coated CVC segments provided protection against bacterial adherence significantly more than all other types of tested CVCs (P < 0.05). Gendine-coated CVCs also provided better protection against Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis than CVCs impregnated with antibiotics or with silver, platinum, and carbon (P < 0.02). After 28 days of being soaked in serum, the CVCs impregnated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine and the CVCs impregnated with silver, platinum, and carbon had lost antimicrobial activity against MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and C. parapsilosis, and the CVCs impregnated with minocycline and rifampin had lost activity against P. aeruginosa and C. parapsilosis. The CVCs impregnated with gendine maintained antimicrobial activities against MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and C. parapsilosis after 28 days of being soaked in serum. Central venous catheters impregnated with the novel investigational antiseptic gendine showed in vitro efficacy and provided protection against bacterial adherence more than other approved novel antimicrobial-coated CVCs.
