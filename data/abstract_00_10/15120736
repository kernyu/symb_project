The activity of caspofungin (CSP) combined with terbinafine (TRB) against Candida dubliniensis, Candida kefyr and azole-resistant Candida albicans was evaluated in vitro by checkerboard analysis. The combination of CSP with TRB resulted in positive interactive effects in vitro against C. albicans and C. kefyr but not against C. dubliniensis. Moreover, true synergism was observed only against TRB resistant strains which became susceptible to this drug in the presence of CSP. In contrast, indifference was observed against strains that were already sensitive to TRB indicating that CSP may inhibit resistance to TRB.
