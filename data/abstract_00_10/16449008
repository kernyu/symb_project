A 54-y-old morbidly obese male presented with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia secondary to chronic right hip arthroplasty infection. Bacteremia persisted despite prolonged vancomycin-based therapy (MIC < or = 1 microg/ml) and prosthetic removal. Adding daptomycin-rifampin resolved bacteremia within 48 h; hip cultures remained negative post-discharge. This case describes alternative treatment for chronic MRSA infections.
