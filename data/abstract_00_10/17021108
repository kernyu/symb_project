A total of 7,860 community-acquired Moraxella catarrhalis isolates (SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 1997 to 2004) were tested by broth microdilution methods, and 399 randomly selected strains from North American sites were tested for BRO-1 and BRO-2 by PCR methods. Several antimicrobials remained very active, including amoxicillin-clavulanate (MIC90s, < or =0.25 microg/ml), azithromycin (MIC90s, < or =0.12 microg/ml), ceftriaxone (MIC90s, 0.5 microg/ml), and levofloxacin (MIC90s, < or =0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml). The BRO-2 incidence rates by year were 3 to 4% overall (96 to 97% for BRO-1) and were the highest in Canada (7.9%), with the incidence in the United States being only 2.0%.
