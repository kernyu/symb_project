Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects approximately 4 million persons and is the major indication for liver transplantation in the United States. The current standard for treatment of HCV is pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin. Despite significant advances in treatment, only approximately 50% of patients of treated patients clear HCV infection. Polymerase inhibitors, given their potent antiviral effects, represent a major contribution to the future of HCV treatment. Whether these new drugs will have a role in the treatment of the difficult patient (non-responders, those co-infected with HIV, decompensated liver disease and liver transplant recipients) remains to be determined.
