AIMS: To investigate the influence of avilamycin (AVM) administration and its subsequent withdrawal on the emergence and disappearance of AVM-resistant enterococci in the intestine of broiler chickens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five chicks each of C, L and H groups were given the basal diet, the basal diet supplemented with 5 g AVM/ton and the basal diet supplemented with 50 g AVM/ton, respectively. The AVM-resistant Enterococcus faecalis population did not emerge during 30 days of the AVM administration period, whereas the AVM-resistant Enterococcus faecium with a minimum inhibitory concentration of >512 microg ml(-1) in the faeces of chicks of the L and H groups emerged on 3 and 1 days after the AVM administration, respectively. Thereafter, the AVM-resistant Ent. faecium population density in both L and H groups maintained high levels during the AVM administration period. Twenty days after the AVM withdrawal, the AVM-resistant Ent. faecium population disappeared from the intestines of both four of five chicks of L group and three of five chicks of H group. The AVM-resistant Ent. faecium population density in one chick from each of the groups, L and H, did not change before and after the AVM removal. CONCLUSIONS: The AVM-resistant Ent. faecium emerged during the AVM administration, and disappeared from the intestine of most chicks after the AVM withdrawal. However, the AVM-resistant Ent. faecium persisted in some chicks 20 days after AVM withdrawal. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results suggest that introducing an AVM withdrawal period could minimize the risk of AVM-resistant Ent. faecium becoming carcass contaminants, and that prudent antibiotic use alone is not sufficient to stem emergence of the AVM-resistant Ent. faecium.
