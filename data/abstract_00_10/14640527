New polyoxygenated farnesylcyclohexenones, 7-deacetoxyyanuthone A (1) and its 2,3-hydro derivative (2), were isolated together with the known farnesylquinones (3, 4) from a marine isolate of the genus Penicillium. The structures of the new deacetoxyyanuthone A (1) and its 2,3-hydro derivative (2) were assigned by spectroscopic methods, including 2D NMR and CD for the Cotton effect of alpha-epoxyketone experiments. Compounds 1 and 3 showed moderate in vitro cytotoxicity in a panel of five human tumor cell lines, and 1 also exhibited mild in vitro antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC, 50 microg/mL).
