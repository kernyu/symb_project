We evaluated dipicolinic acid (DPA) as a chelating agent for detection of IMP- or VIM-type metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates. Using the broth microdilution testing in the presence or absence of DPA, MBL producers exhibited 100%, 92%, or 100% of >or=8 times (media, 32 times) reduction of MICs in presence of DPA for ceftazidime, imipenem, or meropenem, respectively. In disk diffusion testing, expansion of growth inhibitory zone of these clinical isolates was clearly observed. Thus, DPA could be useful in the detection for MBL-producing P. aeruginosa clinical isolates.
