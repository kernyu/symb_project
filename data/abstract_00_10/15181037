Adipose tissue is the source of production and site of action of several pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines. We have recently shown that white adipose tissue (WAT) is a major producer of the antiinflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Because IL-1Ra serum levels are elevated 7-fold in human obesity and an excess of this protein has been implicated in the acquired resistance to leptin and insulin, we investigated the regulation of IL-1Ra in human WAT. We demonstrate that IL-1Ra is mainly produced by adipocytes, rather than the stromal fraction of WAT, and that IL-1alpha and beta, as well as interferon-beta (IFN-beta), strongly up-regulate the expression and secretion of IL-1Ra in WAT. Moreover, human WAT expresses the receptors and proteins known to be required for the action of IL-1 (IL-1 receptor type I, IL-1 receptor accessory protein) and IFN-beta (IFN-alpha/beta receptor subunits 1 and 2). Finally, human WAT actively secretes these regulatory cytokines, suggesting that they up-regulate IL-1Ra through a local autocrine/paracrine action, which is hypothesized to play a regulatory role in adipogenesis and metabolism.
