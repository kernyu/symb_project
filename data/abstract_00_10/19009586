Previous studies have demonstrated that gamma-synuclein is overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies. Overexpression of gamma-synuclein in human breast cancer cells leads to an increase in cell motility, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, and mitotic checkpoint dysfunction. We report in this study that gamma-synuclein is up-regulated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. The up-regulation of gamma-synuclein expression by endoplasmic reticulum stress is mediated, at least in part, by activation transcription factor (ATF) 4. Knockdown of gamma-synuclein sensitized human breast cancer cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by endoplasmic reticulum stress when gamma-synuclein was inhibited was dependent on JNK or caspase activation, with caspase-3 and caspase-7 being involved. Treatment with the JNK or caspase-3 and caspase-7 inhibitor partially blocked endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells transfected with or without the siRNA against gamma-synuclein. Taken together, these data suggest that gamma-synuclein may promote cancer progression by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis.
