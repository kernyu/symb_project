Scrutiny of regionally occurring bacteria with unusual forms of resistance to antimicrobials according to section sign 23 section 1 of the Protection Against Infection Act is useful for individual hospitals in assessing their own resistance situation. This study summarizes frequencies of antimicrobial resistances in 19 hospitals in the Berlin region in 2001 and 2002. MRSA so far is the only bacterium of epidemiological significance, other resistance phenomena bearing relevance for individual hospitals only. The average incidences of MRSA in hospitals and their "risk areas" in comparison to a particular hospital can serve as an indicator for unusually high resistance rates or nosocomial outbreaks. Using one hospital outbreak as an example, possibilities are presented for recording incidences and implementing measures to successfully reduce the MRSA incidence.
