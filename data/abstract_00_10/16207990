Although standard conditions are available for testing the susceptibilities of filamentous fungi to antifungal agents by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) broth microdilution assay, quality control (QC) MIC limits have not been established for any mold-agent combination. This multicenter (eight-center) study documented the reproducibility of tests for one isolate of Paecilomyces variotii ATCC MYA-3630 and 11 other mold isolates (three isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus; two isolates of A. terreus; one isolate each of A. flavus, A. nidulans, Fusarium moniliforme, and F. solani; and two isolates of Scedosporium apiospermum) by the CLSI reference broth microdilution method (M 38-A document). Control limits (amphotericin B, 1 to 4 microg/ml; itraconazole, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml; posaconazole, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; voriconazole, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml) for the selected QC P. variotii ATCC MYA-3630 were established by the analysis of replicate MIC results. Reference isolates and corresponding MIC ranges were also established for 6 of the 12 molds evaluated. MIC limits were not proposed for the other five molds tested due to low testing reproducibility for these isolates.
