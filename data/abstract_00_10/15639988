According to standard K B method, bacteriostatic tests were performed to screen out aminoglycoside resistance bacteria from 47 strains of isolated E.coli. To analyze correlations between the degree of E.coli aminoglycoside resistance and aac(3)-II gene conserved region, PCR amplified aac(3)-II gene conserved regions and were analyzed by DNA sequencing. The results showed that there were two species of aac(3)-II gene type including 65G and 84T or 65A and 84C in the samples. Strains with high activity of modifying enzyme to gentamicin all were 65G and 84T aac(3)-II gene type.
