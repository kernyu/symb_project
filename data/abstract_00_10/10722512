Quinupristin-dalfopristin produced postantibiotic effects (PAEs) on exponentially growing (log phase) and nongrowing (lag phase) cultures of 0.4 to 6.9 h. PAEs of the other antibiotics tested were 0.5 to 1.9 h, determined with exponentially growing cultures. None of these antibiotics show a PAE on lag-phase bacteria.
