A large number (272) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates recovered from Italian hospitals during the early and late 1990s were characterized for multidrug resistance pattern and clonal type using a combination of genotyping methods, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), spaA typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), determination of SCC mec type, and hybridization pattern with Tn 554. The majority of MRSA belonged to four genetic lineages: the pandemic Iberian and Brazilian clones, and two unique clonal types-the "Italian" and "Rome" clones of MRSA. The Italian clone carried the SCC mec type I in the genetic background of ST228, which is a double-locus variant of the sequence type of the multidrug-resistant New York/Japanese clone (ST5). The properties of the Rome clone showed several striking similarities to those of the Archaic clone of MRSA that was dominant among MRSA isolates in the mid-1960s to 1970s, but has not been detected since then in recent global surveillance studies.
