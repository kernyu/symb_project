A 78-year-old woman developed an early knee-prosthesis infection due to multiresistant Serratia marcescens that was successfully treated with high-dose meropenem, after failure of a long-term therapy combining imipenem and multiple surgical interventions. Because of its lower neurotoxicity, meropenem might be preferred to imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of osteo-articular infections due to multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli in the elderly.
