We evaluated the activity of several antibiotics against 225 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 252 isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae. Only tigecycline, glycopeptides, and linezolid were active against all the isolates of S. aureus, whereas the beta-lactams were also active against S. agalactiae. Tigecycline could be a good alternative to ampicillin in the treatment of group B Streptococcus infections in patients allergic to beta-lactam.
