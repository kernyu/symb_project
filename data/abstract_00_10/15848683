UNLABELLED: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections on transplant recipients. METHODS: Liver and kidney recipients with MRSA infections were retrospectively identified and compared to an age, gender, UNOS status, organ transplanted, and transplant date matched (2:1) non-MRSA-infected recipient control group. All MRSA infections were initially treated with vancomycin, and four (33%) liver recipients were converted to linezolid therapy after failing to improve with vancomycin. RESULTS: The overall MRSA infection incidence was 1.4% (24/1770) with MRSA more common in liver (3.75%; 12/320) than kidney transplants (0.8%; 12/1450) (P < .001). The most common sites of MRSA infection were blood (42%), lung (38%), and abdomen (29%). The MRSA group had a greater percentage of prior antibiotic usage (79% vs 40%; P < .0015). The MRSA group experienced more posttransplant complications (52% vs 19%; P < .011)), and exhibited a trend toward greater length of stay in the intensive care unit (7.8 vs 4.6 days; P = .09), but not overall length of stay. Survival was similar in MRSA and non-MRSA groups (75% vs 88%; P = .17). No significant differences in mortality were noted between liver and kidney recipients infected with MRSA (P = .6). CONCLUSION: MRSA infection is associated with a higher incidence of posttransplant complications and antibiotic usage in both liver and kidney recipients compared to patients with MRSA infection.
