Patients who will receive chemotherapy require careful assessment of liver function prior to treatment to determine which drugs are not appropriate, and which drugs need dose modification. However, if the hepatic parenchymal abnormalities are caused by an underlying neoplasm and the neoplasm is sensitive to the drugs, it may not be necessary to reduce the dose. Clearly, this is an area where clinical judgment must be used to assess the risk/benefit ratio. Treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) involves either the nucleoside analogue lamivudine or interferon alpha. The advantage of lamivudine includes limited adverse effects and the fact that histological improvement has been documented in the majority of patients. Primary prophylaxis with lamivudine may be a well tolerated and effective method to reduce the frequency of chemotherapy-induced HBV reactivation in chronic HbsAg carriers. HbsAg screening is necessary before beginning chemotherapy for non Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. However, the main problem with long-term lamivudine therapy is the emergence of genotypic resistance because of base pair substitution at specific sites within the YMDD locus of the DNA polymerase gene. Significant hepatic dysfunction is uncommon among hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients treated with chemotherapy for hematological malignancies. However, infection with elevated AST levels is a significant risk factor for veno-occlusive disease after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Clinical judgment and a high index of suspicion remain critical tools in preventing and treating hepatic manifestations of cancer chemotherapy.
