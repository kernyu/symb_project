Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is one of the most common opportunistic infections in immunucompromised individuals, such as AIDS patients and organ transplant recipients, and is the most frequent congenital viral infection in humans. Despite a reduction of the incidence of AIDS-related opportunistic infections in patients under highly active antiretroviral treatment, attention should be paid to the HCMV risk factor in these individuals. Furthermore, HCMV may have an important role in atherosclerosis. Existing antiviral treatments for the HCMV infection suffer from poor bioavailability, toxicity, and limited effectiveness, mainly due to the development of drug resistance. Fortunately there are novel and potentially very effective new compounds undergoing pre-clinical and clinical evaluation. This review provides an overview in the last five years of new HCMV inhibitors (chemical structures, SAR, and new mechanisms of action) with the aim to provide new clues for the development of future drugs against this opportunistic virus.
