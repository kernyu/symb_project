After implementation of programmes for active immunization against Haemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis became the most common agents of bacterial meningitis in childhood. Over a 9-year period, children showing clinical and laboratory findings of meningitis on the basis of their positive cultures of blood or cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) for S. pneumoniae were enrolled. Predisposing conditions, clinical and laboratory findings, and microbiological and imaging studies were considered. Meningitis-related death or neurological sequelae defined an unfavourable outcome. Sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-one (48%) children had predisposing conditions to pneumococcal meningitis. Fever and neck stiffness were the main symptoms; 14 patients (22%) reported seizures before admission. Twenty-one patients required treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were penicillin susceptible in 54 cases (84%). Forty-eight children (75%) showed complete recovery. Two patients (3%) died, and 14 (22%) had sequelae. Patients with a low CSF cell count, low neutrophils, early admission to ICU or infection by penicillin-nonsusceptible strains of S. pneumoniae had an unfavourable outcome more frequently. Low blood neutrophils, low CSF cell count, early admission to ICU and infection by penicillin-nonsusceptible strains are the main factors predicting an unfavourable outcome in children with pneumococcal meningitis.
