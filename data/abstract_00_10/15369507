OBJECTIVES: To describe the management of primary HIV infection (PHI), focusing on changes in the design of therapies and time to initiation of antiretroviral treatment, the clinical outcome, and the immuno-virological response over time to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and its tolerance. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the French PRIMO multicentre cohort, 291 patients presenting with PHI were enrolled between 1996 and 2001. Data were analysed to describe treatment prescription habits over a period of 5 years, and response to and tolerance of treatment. RESULTS: The proportion of patients who initiated treatment during PHI decreased from 92% in 1996 to 56% in 2001. At 6 months, whatever the initiated treatment, 74% of treated patients achieved a plasma viral load<400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL and 53% achieved a viral load of<50 copies/mL. Prescription of protease inhibitor (PI)-sparing regimens has become more frequent since 1999. Despite a similar virological response, patients in the PI-containing group tended to experience a greater 1-year increase in CD4 cell count than those in the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)-containing group (218 cells/microL versus 157 cells/microL, respectively). An adverse event was recorded in 51% of treated patients. The most frequent events were gastrointestinal disorders (71%), lipodystrophy (27%) and mood disorders (19%). The main reason for modifying or stopping therapy was the occurrence of an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Limitations of therapy and poor tolerance to antiretroviral regimens have changed physician attitudes in PHI. This suggests the need for evaluation of better-tolerated regimens and new therapeutic strategies.
