The action of the juice of Shiitake mushroom (L. edodes) on pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms, detected in cases of considerable dysbiotic changes (Escherichia coli O-114, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans), as well as on some bacterial eubiotic producer strains (Escherichia coli M-17, Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp.). The juice of this mushroom at a concentration of 5% from the volume of the nutrient medium was found to produce a pronounced antimicrobial effect with respect to C. albicans, S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli O-114 and to stimulate the growth of E. coli M-17. Bifidobacteria and lactobacteria exhibited resistance to the action of L. edodes juice.
