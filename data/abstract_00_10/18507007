Apoptosis occurs by distinct pathways that involve the cell surface, mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum. Previous studies had shown that deoxyadenosine-resistant L1210 cells (Y8) proceeded to apoptosis under conditions in which the parental L1210 cell line (WT) did not undergo an apoptotic response. Combinations of drugs, acting at different molecular targets, markedly potentiated the apoptotic response in the Y8 cells without inducing apoptosis in the WT cells. In the present study, induction of apoptosis by parthenolide and BAY 11-7085, drugs that targeted nuclear factor kappa B activation, was blocked by the presence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). On the other hand, the levels of apoptosis induced by parthenolide or BAY 11-7085 were increased by pre-treatment of the cells with glutathione lowering L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO). Western blot analyses showed that the levels of the stress proteins, Grp 78 and Gadd 153 were reduced in the parthenolide-treated Y8 cells, but not in those co-treated with NAC. Protection of the cells from apoptosis induced by parthenolide or BAY 11-7085 by NAC was relatively specific as the induction of apoptosis in the Y8 cells by MG-132, flavopiridol, Gemcitabine or PRIMA-1 was not decreased by NAC. These data suggest that multiple pathways, one of which is ER-stress induced, may ultimately be involved and interactive in the induction of apoptosis in specific cell lines.
