OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of broad-spectrum beta-lactams for treating experimental infections due to Escherichia coli expressing two types of plasmid-mediated AmpC-type beta-lactamases, LAT-1 and FOX-1. METHODS: Susceptibility testing and time-kill curves were determined for piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. A mouse model of peritonitis was developed to determine 50% effective doses (ED(50)s) of beta-lactams against E. coli clinical strains producing recombinant plasmids pLAT-1 and pFOX-1. RESULTS: MIC and MBC values correlated with the ED(50)s for ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. Among the beta-lactams tested, both cefepime and imipenem were effective for treating peritonitis caused by E. coli strains harbouring pLAT-1 or pFOX-1, whereas ceftazidime was effective only against E. coli (pLAT-1). Piperacillin/tazobactam was not effective for treating infections with either of these two strains. CONCLUSIONS: Piperacillin/tazobactam was not efficacious for treating infections due to E. coli producing plasmid-mediated AmpC-type beta-lactamases, whereas cefepime and imipenem were efficacious.
