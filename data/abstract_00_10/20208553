AIM: To investigate the effects of ethanol on adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin and cartonectin) levels in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and sera, and explore the correlation between VAT and serum adipokine levels. METHODS: Forty-eight Wistar rats were randomly divided into control, low, middle and high ethanol treatment groups that received 0, 0.5, 2.5, or 5.0 g of ethanol x kg(-1) x d(-1), respectively, via gastric tubes for 22 weeks. The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting serum insulin (FINS) were measured and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values were calculated. Adipokines in perirenal and epididymal VAT and sera were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). RESULTS: High-dose treatments of ethanol (vs control group) significantly increased FINS (eg 37.86%) and HOMA-IR values (eg 40.63%). In VAT, levels of leptin, resistin and visfatin in the middle- and high-dose groups were significantly elevated, whereas adiponectin and cartonectin levels decreased. In sera, changes in adipokine levels were similar to that observed in VAT, with the exception of cartonectin. These ethanol-induced effects were dose-dependent. A positive correlation existed between VAT and serum adipokine levels, except for cartonectin. CONCLUSION: Chronic ethanol consumption affects adipokine levels in VAT and sera in a dose-dependent manner, with the exception of serum cartonectin. The altered levels of adipokines in VAT and sera are positively correlated.
