In silico, we identified fusA (2,067 bp) in Clostridium difficile 630. Sequencing of fusA in posttherapy fusidic acid-resistant C. difficile isolates from 12 patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) identified fusA mutations, one or two nonsynonymous substitutions, or in one case a deletion of one codon associated with resistance. Five of these mutations have previously been described in fusA of fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but seven were novel fusA mutations. Fusidic acid monotherapy for CDAD seemed to rapidly select conserved resistant mutants.
