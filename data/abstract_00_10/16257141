Escherichia coli with various types of adherence patterns to cultured epithelial cells have been described over the years as being associated with both acute and persistent diarrhea. Most enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) strains harbor a 60- to 65-MDa plasmid called pAA which has been shown to encode the aggregative adherence fimbriae AAF/I and AAF/II; the enterotoxin EAST1 and Pet, a serine protease which has been described as causing enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects. Another serine protease denominated Pic, encoded by a chromosomal gene displaying mucinolytic activity, serum resistance, and hemagglutination, has also been associated with EAEC strains. In this study, EAEC strains that isolated from the rectal swab of neonates at the neonatal intensive care unit of Pusan National University Hospital in 2003 were tested for the presence of the pAA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA colony hybridization methods. To further characterize these EAEC strains, we used PCR to detect genes for proposed EAEC virulence factors and examined HeLa cell adherence assay, antimicrobial susceptibility test, serotyping, cytotoxicity test and epidemiological characteristics. EAEC isolates found were genotyped by random amplified polymorphic DNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
