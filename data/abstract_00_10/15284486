We report a fast, highly sensitive method for detecting and testing drug resistance of M-tropic and T-tropic laboratory and primary HIV-1 isolates. cMAGI cells are infected with an adenovirus vector harboring the luciferase reporter gene controlled by HIV-1 Tat-responsive element, TAR. HIV-1 Tat production by HIV-1 chronically infected cells, or by cMAGI cells as early as two days after being acutely infected with HIV-1, is readily monitored in the presence or absence of antiviral drugs. This method is more sensitive than HIV-1 Tat dependant production of beta-galactosidase in the cMAGI cells. The fast answer, ease and sensitivity as well as the possibility of using this method in high throughput screening, makes it an very attractive tool for phenotypic detection of HIV-1 in clinical samples as well as a sensitive assay for monitoring drug resistant HIV-1 variants. This method can also be used for discovery of novel anti HIV-1 drugs.
