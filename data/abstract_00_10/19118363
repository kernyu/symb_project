We purified osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs) from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and found them to be composed of 100 % glucose with 2-linked glucose as the most abundant residue, with terminal glucose, 2,3-linked and 2,6-linked glucose also present in high quantities. The two structural genes for OPG biosynthesis, opgG and opgH, form a bicistronic operon, and insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene cassette into this operon resulted in a strain devoid of OPGs. The opgGH mutant strain was impaired in motility and growth under low osmolarity conditions. The opgGH mutation also resulted in a 2 log increase in the LD50 in mice compared to the wild-type strain SL1344. Inability to synthesize OPGs had no significant impact on the organism's lipopolysaccharide pattern or its ability to survive antimicrobial peptides-, detergent-, pH- and nutrient-stress conditions. We observed that the opgGH-defective strain respired at a reduced rate under acidic growth conditions (pH 5.0) and had lower ATP levels compared to the wild-type strain. These data indicate that OPGs of S. Typhimurium contribute towards mouse virulence as well as growth and motility under low osmolarity growth conditions.
