OBJECTIVE: To analyze the CD4(+) T cells and virus load in HIV/AIDS affected population and to evaluate the HIV/AIDS antiretroviral therapy programs in Henan province. METHODS: "Henan HIV/AIDS Testing Laboratory Network Database" was used to collect the data on CD4(+) T cells and virus load (VL) value and corresponding information in HIV/AIDS population of Henan in 2009. Cross-sectional studies was used to study the constituent ratio of CD4(+) T cells and virus load value in individuals who had not received antiretroviral-treated (ART) and had joined first-line ART between the year of 2005 to 2008 among HIV/AIDS population of Henan. RESULTS: As to these people living with HIV/AIDS that had not received ART in the first half and the second half year of 2009, the constituent ratio of individuals whose CD4(+) T cells were less than 200 cells/microl both accounted for more than 20% (chi(2) = 2.059, P = 0.151). The constituent ratio of individuals whose CD4(+) T cells were in 200 - 350 cells/microl and more than 350 cells/microl increased from 27.61% to 29.41% (chi(2) = 4.636, P = 0.031) and decreased from 51.49% to 48.60% (chi(2) = 9.767, P = 0.002), respectively. Meanwhile, we saw 34.53% and 19.65% of the patients whose virus load was > 10 000 copy/ml and > 30 000 copy/ml in this population. Patients that joined first-line ART during 2005 - 2008 showed the following results: the longer of the therapy time, the higher constituent ratio of individuals whose CD4(+) T cells were more than 350 cells/microl (chi(2) = 148.689, P < 0.001) and the lower constituent ratio of individuals of whose CD4(+) T cells were less than 200 cells/microl (chi(2) = 46.686, P < 0.001). Simultaneously, the lower constituent ratio of individuals whose viral load was less than 500 copy/ml (chi(2) = 9.066, P = 0.003) and the higher constituent ratio of individuals whose virus load was more than 10 000 copy/ml (chi(2) = 6.597, P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Significant curative effect had been achieved in AIDS first-line ART of Henan, but along with the increasing treatment time, the risk of treatment failure also increased. Drug resistance test and changing of treatment protocols were needed. To reach better and more efficient effects on therapy, factors as more detections and investments on ART, expanding the scope of treatment etc. were needed on those people living with HIV/AIDS that had not received ART.
