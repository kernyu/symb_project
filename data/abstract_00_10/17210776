We tested 102 Campylobacter jejuni and 6 Campylobacter coli clinical isolates from Poland. All were susceptible to erythromycin. Among the tested C. jejuni isolates 55.9% and 13.7% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, respectively. Replacement of Thr86 with Ile in GyrA and a plasmid-borne tet(O) gene were the main resistance mechanisms for fluoroquinolones and tetracycline, respectively.
