Our experience with other chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and asthma, has shown that adherence to treatment over time is about 50%. In HIV treatment, a significantly higher rate of adherence (i.e., 95% or greater) is required to achieve good outcomes. HAART is effective and cost-effective. Even with the high cost of antiretroviral drugs, the decrease in hospital utilization in addition to improved quality of life with HAART more than offsets the increased cost of drugs. This cost shifting from hospital utilization has been shown to result in a decrease of total monthly costs of care in many settings. In addition to decreased mortality and cost savings from decreased hospital utilization associated with HAART, the appropriate use of expensive antiretroviral drugs and the resultant reduction in antiretroviral resistance can save lives and money over the long term. However, we know that the performance of drugs in clinical trials is not always borne out in today's real world of ambulatory HIV care, underscoring the need for treatment adherence strategies in the HAART era. Our understanding of what improves adherence to antiretroviral treatment is still incomplete. However, there are a number of approaches that address the patient, the provider/multidisciplinary team, and the treatment regimen itself. The dedicated TAC, while not the only solution, has been shown to be an effective team member and a solution worth considering in managed care settings. When added to the costs of today's care, this team member should still prove cost-effective in the final analysis.
