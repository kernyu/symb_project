M. tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. Rapid identification of resistant strains is crucial to institute prompt appropriate therapy, and prevent the development of further resistance and spreading of MDR strains. The INNO-LiPA Rif. TB is a commercial reverse hybridisation line probe assay designed for rapid detection of rpoB gene mutations in clinical isolates. We applied this test directly to 44 smear-positive and 45 smear-negative clinical specimens collected from patients suspected of active TB. The capability of this technique to correctly identify local MDR-TB strains was tested on 50 MDR strains isolated in Italy. Results of the test were compared to conventional antibiogram performed on isolated strains. The concordance rate of the LiPA test results on clinical specimens with those obtained with "in vitro" sensitivity was 100%. These results show that the LiPA test can be useful in rapid detection and prompt management of tuberculosis when MDR disease is suspected.
