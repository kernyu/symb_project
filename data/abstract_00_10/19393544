Lantibiotics are one of the most promising alternative candidates for future antibiotics that maintain their antibacterial efficacy through many mechanisms. Of these mechanisms, some modes of activity have recently been reported, providing opportunities to show these peptides as potential candidates for forthcoming applications. Many findings providing new insight into the detailed molecular activities of numerous lantibiotics are constantly being uncovered. The combination of antibiotic mechanisms in one lantibiotic molecule shows its diverse antimicrobial usefulness as a future generation of antibiotic. Since lantibiotics do not have any known candidate resistance mechanisms, the discovered distinct modes of activity may revolutionize the design of anti-infective drugs through the knowledge provided by these super molecules. In this review, we discuss the rising assortment of lantibiotics, with special emphasis on their structure-function relationships, addressing the unique activities involved in their individual modes of action.
