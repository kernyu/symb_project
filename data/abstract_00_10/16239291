OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The new fluoroquinolones WCK 771, WCK 1152 and WCK 1153 were developed to overcome quinolone resistance in Gram-positive bacteria. The activity of these new quinolones was tested against 159 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 52 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes using the microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: MIC50/MIC90 values (mg/L) of WCK 771, WCK 1152 and WCK 1153 for quinolone-susceptible S. pneumoniae (n = 119; 54 penicillin G-susceptible, 53 penicillin G-intermediate, and 12 penicillin G-resistant strains) were 0.25/0.5, 0.03/0.06 and 0.016/0.03, respectively. MIC50/MIC90 values (mg/L) for quinolone-resistant pneumococci (n = 40) increased to 4/16, 0.25/1 and 0.125/0.5, respectively. Against S. pyogenes, WCK 771, WCK 1152 and WCK 1153 were also highly active with MIC50/MIC90 values (mg/L) of 0.25/0.25, 0.03/0.06 and 0.03/0.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, WCK 771 was highly active against quinolone-susceptible, but not against quinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae, whereas WCK 1152 and WCK 1153 were more potent and were able to overcome quinolone resistance in both S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes.
