Seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed in February 2000. In June 2000, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the universal administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for all children 23 months of age and younger and for children 24 to 59 months of age who are at high risk for serious pneumococcal disease. Since then, >23 million doses have been administered in the United States. Postlicensure surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the United States from the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center has reported a decline in IPD and in pneumococcal disease incidence as a result of vaccine serotypes, respectively. During this period, issues critical to the long-term success of PCV7 have become more relevant: Will PCV7 be as effective in groups of children who are at high risk for IPD as in healthy children? Will nonvaccine types replace vaccine serotypes in the nasopharynx and in disease? Why are the results of the clinical trials different for IPD and for acute otitis media? How many doses of PCV7 and what concentrations of antibody are necessary for protection? Will universal administration of PCV7 to children younger than 2 years reduce antimicrobial drug resistance and alter prescribing patterns of physicians for febrile infants? Have there been unanticipated adverse events or benefits observed? The purpose of this report is to review the current data available to address these questions and to identify gaps that will require additional knowledge to determine the ultimate value of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in reducing the burden of pneumococcal disease in infants and children.
