In addition to the earlier developed rapid technique for determining the drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) to essential antituberculous drugs by using semiliquid medium (SLM), the author proposes a procedure for determining their resistance to ethambutol. She shows it necessary to use the drug only as a powder. The mean minimum suppressing concentrations of ethambutol in the semiliquid medium have been determined for stock cultures, sensitive and resistant strains, which are 3.5 +/- 2.5, 4.5 +/- 1.4, 8.5 +/- 1.6 micrograms/ml. Parallel determination of the sensitivity of 91 MBT strains by using the standard Lowenstein-Jensen medium and SLM has yielded the optimum concentration of ethambutol (5 micrograms/ml), which is marked by the highest (84.4%) percent of coincidence of results.
