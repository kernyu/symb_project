A study was made of the influence of bisol 2 and baitan compounds on morphogenesis and defence response of wheat calluse cells infected with bunt agent in associated with oxalate oxidase activation. After introduction of bisol and baitan into cultivation medium, dense area with meristema zones, germs of shoots and rhizoids appeared on non-morphogenic calluses, which correlated with enzyme activation. Parenchyma-like cells, generating hydrogen peroxide, were seen in the site of pathogen penetration under infestation, but were never revealed in control. Generation of hydrogen peroxide in the site of infection was accompanied with an increased oxalate oxidase activity in the cytoplasmic fraction, and with suppression of this activity in a fraction bound to the cell wall. Both compounds induced oxalate oxidase activity under combined cultivation of wheat calluses with bunt agent.
