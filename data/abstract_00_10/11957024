Described here is a case of meningitis caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to colistin, which was treated successfully with intravenous colistin sulfomethate sodium (5 mg/kg/day). The levels of colistin in serum and cerebrospinal fluid and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters of colistin were determined. In this case, intravenously administered colistin penetrated cerebrospinal fluid (25% of serum levels) at levels sustaining bactericidal concentrations.
