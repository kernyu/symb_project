Antibiotic resistance within the community setting is an emerging public-health concern. Infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms in the community among people lacking traditional risk factors has been reported. In addition, prevalence studies have identified individuals carrying antibiotic-resistant organisms in the absence of known risk factors. These studies strongly suggest the presence of contributing factors that have yet to be identified. In this paper we review the burden of antibiotic resistance and known risk factors within the community setting, assess the potential role of antibacterial cleaning and hygiene products containing triclosan in the emergence of resistance, and recommend future research on the assessment of household cleaning and hygiene products containing triclosan.
