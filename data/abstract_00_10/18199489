Malaria is a global disease, causing at least 500 million clinical cases and more than one million deaths each year. Moreover, drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, the organism that causes most malaria-associated deaths, has become a major problem. Therefore, discovery and investigation of novel targets for anti-malarial drug design is essential to combat this disease. The malarial genome has been sequenced, revealing approximately 5500 genes. The current post-genomic challenge is functionally to evaluate the essential genes and validate them for therapeutic design. Unfortunately, standard genetics techniques are limited in scope because of low transfection efficiency and a lack of knockdown techniques, thereby rendering the analysis of essential genes difficult.
