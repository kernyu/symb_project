The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence, proportions and identities of oral bacteria resistant to six antibiotics in 35 children (4-5 years old) who had not received antibiotics during the previous 3 months. Ampicillin-, penicillin-, erythromycin-, and tetracycline-resistant bacteria were harbored by 35 (100%), 34 (97%), 35 (100%), and 34 (97%) children, respectively. None of the children harbored metronidazole-resistant anaerobic bacteria or Gram-positive vancomycin-resistant bacteria. The median percentage of the oral microflora resistant to each of the antibiotics was ampicillin 1% (range 0.1-23), erythromycin 13% (1-45), penicillin 1% (0-14), and tetracycline 2% (0-88). A total of 432 antibiotic-resistant isolates were recovered that comprised 18 genera and 47 species. Ampicillin resistance was widely distributed throughout different genera and species, whereas tetracycline resistance was predominately found in the streptococci. Multiresistant bacteria were frequently isolated with 28% of isolates exhibiting resistance to two or more antibiotics. Veillonella spp., traditionally considered susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, were found frequently to be resistant to these two antibiotics. This study demonstrates that a diverse collection of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic, opportunistic, and nonpathogenic bacteria can be readily isolated from, and in some subjects dominate, the oral microflora of primary school children in the absence of recently administered antibiotics.
