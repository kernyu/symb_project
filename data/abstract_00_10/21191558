INTRODUCTION: Lipophilic corynebacteria are part of the saprophytic skin flora and they rarely cause infection. C. macginleyi is an exception since it has been involved in conjunctivitis and other ocular surface affections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty three C. macginleyi strains were obtained from conjunctival swabs from patients with conjunctivitis symptoms. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for 7 antibiotics (penicillin, gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, vancomycin, rifampicin and linezolid) was tested by broth microdilution method. RESULTS: One strain was resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC=16 mg/L) and two were resistant to tetracycline (MIC= 64 y 16 mg/L). The rest of the strains were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested. CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, C. macginleyi does not present a major problem due to the low resistance rates shown in the present and other studies. However, epidemiological surveillance of its susceptibility pattern is needed as well as an appropriate use of topical antibiotics in order to achieve a good infection control.
