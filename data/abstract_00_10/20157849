Misconceptions about upper respiratory infections (URI) and their treatment are widely held, especially among Latino parents, and are associated with increased health care visits. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends community based interventions to educate families about URI. We designed a community-based, culturally competent health literacy intervention regarding URI, which was pilot tested with Latino Early Head Start (EHS) parents. In depth interviews were conducted to understand parents' perceptions. A paired-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess change in pre-post knowledge/attitudes scores. Changes in care practices are described. Parents were very positive about this education, were open to non-antibiotic URI care, and reported that materials were helpful. Following the intervention, the mean composite knowledge/attitude score increased from 4.1 (total: 10) to 6.6 (P < .05). Families also reported improved care practices. EHS sites are promising locations for health literacy interventions regarding URI.
