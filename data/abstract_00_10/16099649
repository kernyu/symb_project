Nineteen compounds of various classes, such as flavonoid glycosides, pterocarpanoids, lipids, glycolipids, and alkaloids, were isolated and identified from the Desmodium gangeticum whole plant. Aminoglucosyl glycerolipid (8) is reported here for the first time. Its structure has been elucidated by spectroscopic and degradation studies. This novel compound exhibited in vitro antileishmanial and immunomodulatory activities, as it enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production and provided resistance against infection established in peritoneal macrophages by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. Another known compound, glycosphingolipid (cerebroside) (7) was found to possess significant in vitro antileishmanial and immunomodulatory activities against the same parasite. Other compounds were found to be inactive.
