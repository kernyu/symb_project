BACKGROUND: The success rate of currently recommended 7-day triple therapy with a PPI plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin has fallen into the unacceptable range. It is urgent to look for a new strategy to treat the infection of Helicobacter pylori. AIMS: To observe the efficacy of triple therapy-based, bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for H. pylori treatment. METHODS: A total of 160 patients with functional dyspepsia who were Hp+ were randomly assigned into two groups. Regimen: Omeprazole 20 mg, Amoxicillin 1.0 g, Clarithromycin 500 mg and Bismuth Potassium Citrate 220 mg, twice a day. Eighty patients received 7-day quadruple therapy and 80 patients received the same therapy for 14 days. Six weeks after treatment, H. pylori eradication was assessed by (13)C-urea breath test. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin of clinical isolates were determined by the twofold agar dilution method. RESULTS: Fourteen-day therapy led to a significant increase of H. pylori eradication success when compared to 7-day therapy in the intention-to-treat analysis (93.7 vs 80.0%; p = .01), and the per-protocol analysis (97.4 vs 82.0%; p = .0016). The H. pylori resistance rates to metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin were 42.1, 18.0 and 0%. Fourteen-day therapy was significantly more effective in patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains. Incidences of adverse events were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Addition bismuth and prolonging treatment duration can overcome H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin and decrease the bacterial load. Fourteen-day triple therapy-based, bismuth-containing quadruple therapy achieved ITT success rate 93% and could be recommended as the first line eradication regimen.
