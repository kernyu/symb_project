We evaluated two methods from Roche and Promega for RNA extraction prior to the genotypic detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 resistance by line probe assay (LiPA). Fifty plasma RNA extracts were processed in parallel by LiPA. Results obtained by the Roche method were superior in the proportion of amplified samples, the percentage of mutated samples, and band intensity.
