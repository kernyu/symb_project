Staphylococcus intermedius (S. intermedius) was isolated from 88.6% and 49.4% of skin and ear samples, respectively, during the years 1992 through 1997, and frequency of isolation remained unchanged. More than 95% of all S. intermedius isolates were susceptible to cephalothin and oxacillin, providing support for empirical treatment of canine skin and ear infections with cephalexin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was isolated from 7.5% and 27.8% of skin and ear samples, respectively. The frequency of isolation from skin samples increased over the study period. Because of multidrug-resistant profiles for P. aeruginosa isolates, especially for ear isolates, empirical treatment of P. aeruginosa infections is not advisable.
