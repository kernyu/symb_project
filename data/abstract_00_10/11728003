Viral quasispecies dynamics and variations of viral fitness are reviewed in connection with viral disease control. Emphasis is put on resistance of human immunodeficiency virus and some human DNA viruses to antiviral inhibitors. Future trends in multiple target antiviral therapy and new approaches based on virus entry into error catastrophe (extinction mutagenesis) are discussed.
