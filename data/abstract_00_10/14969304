The study evaluated prevalence of glycopeptide (vancomycin and teicoplanin) resistant enterococci (VRE) in hospitalized patients and in the community in Calabria (Italy). Rectal swabs were collected from hospitalized and community subjects. Information was gathered on demographics, ward and duration of hospital stay and antibiotics administered; in community subjects information on previous hospitalizations and antibiotics use in the previous year were also collected. Rectal swabs were plated on Enterococcosel agar alone and with addition of vancomycin (6 mg/l) and incubated aerobically at 37 degrees for 24-48 hours. Typical colonies were tested for Gram stain and catalase production. Enterococci were identified to the species level by biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility test and E-test were performed by the disk diffusion method to evaluate vancomycin and teicoplanin susceptibility. t-test and chi square test were performed to evaluate difference in means and proportions, respectively. Samples were collected from 211 subjects; 132 (62.6%) from community and 79 (37.4%) from hospitals. Enterococci were isolated from 145 subjects (68.7%), 72.7% and 62% in community and in hospital, respectively. The most frequent isolates were E. faecium (30.4%), followed by E. faecalis and E. durans (25.5%), and, finally, by Leuconostoc (18.6%). Only one E. faecium strain was resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, isolated from a non-hospitalized 45 years old woman (1.3%). The results did not show emergence of VRE in our area, although surveillance to confirm these findings is needed, considering the substantial spread of antibiotics in hospitals and in the community.
