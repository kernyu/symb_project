Moxifloxacin is a new oral 8-methoxy-quinolone with a wide spectrum of activity against Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, atypical micro-organisms and multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. This study was designed to assess the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria with different resistance patterns, anaerobes and atypical micro-organisms such as Chlamydia and Mycoplasma. Moxifloxacin had good activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae with all strains inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of moxifloxacin for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae ranged from 0.03 to 0.5 mg/l while those of ciprofloxacin were about two- to four-fold higher (MICs=0.12-1 mg/l). Moxifloxacin was poorly active against enterococci but its activity against Clostridium and Bacteroides spp. was in the same range as that of metronidazole and superior to that of clindamycin. Moxifloxacin was substantially more active than both ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Chlamydia.
