Two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and carbapenems and susceptible only to polymyxin B (MIC <or= 2 microg/ml) were identified as part of the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection program. Metallo-beta-lactamase screening tests were positive, PCR yielded products with blaVIM primers, and sequence analysis revealed blaVIM-7 and blaVIM-2. The isolates had distinct ribotype and pulsed-field gel electorphoresis patterns and appeared independently, remote in time and location, at the same cancer center.
