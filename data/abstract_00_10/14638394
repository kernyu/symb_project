We have recently designed and synthesized aminoglycoside-arginine conjugates (AACs) as potential anti-HIV-1 agents. AACs exert a number of activities related to Tat antagonism. We here present a new set of AACs, conjugates of neomycin B, paromomycin, and neamine with different number of arginines (1-6), their (a) uptake by human T-cell lines, (b) antiviral activities, (c) competition with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12G5 binding to CXCR4, (d) competition with stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1alpha) binding to CXCR4, and (e) competition with HIV-1 coat protein gp120 cell penetration. The appearance of mutations in HIV-1 gp120 gene in AACs resistant HIV-1 isolates, supports that AACs inhibit HIV-1 infectivity via interference of gp120-CXCR4 interaction. Our results point that the most potent AACs is the hexa-arginine-neomycin conjugate, the other multi-arginine-aminoglycoside conjugates are less active, and the mono-arginine conjugates display the lowest activity. Our studies demonstrate that, in addition to the core, the number of arginines attached to a specific aminoglycoside, are also important in the design of potent anti-HIV agents. The AACs play an important role, not only as HIV-1 RNA binders but also as inhibitors of viral entry into human cells.
