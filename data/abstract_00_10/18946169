Spread of antibiotic resistances through agro-food chain remains an actual question for both researchers and public health operators. Our study investigates antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella spp. strains isolated from avicultural and swine samples (prevalence: 2% and 5.5% respectively). Strains belonging to different serotypes-pulsetypes have resulted multi-resistant in 76% of cases (avicultural strains: 13/23, swine strains: 73/90). Multi-drug resistant strains (MDR) have been studied for transferability by conjugation - observed in 25.6% cases - and for genetic determinants of resistances: 73.3% MDR strains harbour plasmids; class-1 integrons have been identified in 14 strains. Comparing our findings to available scientific literature, we discuss Salmonellosis resistance pattern according to the food chain and serotype.
