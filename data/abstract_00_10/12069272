During the years from 1993 to 2000, 183 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from different pathological specimens originating from dogs. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns against 10 antipseudomonal agents were obtained on 183 P. aeruginosa strains. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer). Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles showed that among beta-lactam antibiotics, imipenem was the most active compound. Out of the 183 strains tested, 96.7% were sensitive to imipenem. Cefoperazone showed good in vitro activity against 86.9% of the tested strains. Against ceftazidime, 77.0% of strains showed sensitivity. An old penicillin, carbenicillin, gave only 71.6% sensitive strains. Sensitivity to amikacin was 87.4% and it was 83.1% to gentamicin. Pipimedic acid, a first-generation quinolone, was the least active compound of all those tested, 47.0% were resistant. The in vitro sensitivity against enrofloxacin showed that 71.0% strains were sensitive and 26.2% showed resistance. Almost all strains tested, 93.4%, were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and marbofloxacin. Besides imipenem, the quinolone antibiotics, marbofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the most effective against P. aeruginosa strains isolated from dogs.
