A novel infection-resistant biomaterial was created by applying the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) to a recently developed bifunctionalized polyethylene terephthalate ("polyester," Dacron) material using textile-dyeing technology. Dacron was modified via exposure to ethylenediamine (EDA) to create amine and carboxylic acid sites within the polymer backbone. Cipro was applied to the bifunctionalized Dacron construct under varied experimental conditions, with resulting antimicrobial activity determined via zone of inhibition. Dacron segments treated at a liquor ratio of 20:1, with 5% Cipro on weight of fabric (owf), at pH 8 for 4 h at 70 degrees C followed by autoclaving showed antimicrobial activity for 78 days (length of study). Segments treated similarly but without autoclaving lost activity within 1 day. Dyeing time and temperature did not significantly affect antibiotic release/activity, but segments dyed at pHs higher or lower than 8 had less antimicrobial activity. The long-term infection resistance provided by this technique may answer major problems of infection from which implantable Dacron biomedical devices suffer.
