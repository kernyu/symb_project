Immobilization of DNA on carbon nanotubes plays an important role in the development of new types of miniature DNA biosensors. Electrochemical characteristics of the immobilization of calf thymus DNA molecules on the surfaces of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance analysis. The peak currents for Fe(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(CN)(6)(4-) redox couple observed in the cyclic voltammograms decrease and the electron-transfer resistance (R(et)) obtained from the Nyquist plots increase due to the immobilization of DNA molecules (dsDNA or ssDNA) on the surfaces of MWNTs. Most of calf thymus DNA are covalently immobilized on MWNTs via diimide-activated amidation between the carboxylic acid groups on the carbon nanotubes and the amino groups on DNA bases, though the direct adsorption of the DNA molecules on MWNTs can be observed. Additionally, the interaction between DNA molecules immobilized on MWNTs and small biomolecules (ethidium bromide) can be observed obviously by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance analysis. This implies that the DNA molecules immobilized at the surface of MWNTs, with little structure change, still has the ability to interact with small biomolecules.
