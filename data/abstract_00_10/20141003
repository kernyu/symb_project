The ViroSeq (Celera Diagnostics) and Trugene (Bayer HealthCare) HIV-1 genotyping systems are widely used today in world clinical practice to detect drug resistance mutations resulting from ineffective treatment for HIV infection. Only the former test has gained acceptance. The present study has compared ViroSeq and Trugene genotyping systems used to identify both mutations of drug resistance and those of polymorphism in the HIV variants circulating in Russia where the unique strain IDU-A prevails. Analysis of 18 samples from HIV-infected patients who received and did not receive specific therapy has demonstrated that the agreement of the results of the tests was 95% (180 of the 190 mutations). At the same time, the results of resistance mutation detection by the ViroSeq and Trugene HIV-1 genotyping systems coincided completely. The fact that the Trugene HIV-1 genotyping system may be used along with the ViroSeq test system in clinical diagnostic laboratories is shown in the paper.
