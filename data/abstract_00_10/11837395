The early detection of mutations in the HIV-1 polymerase is a key point in the management of anti-retroviral therapy. While nucleotide substitutions and insertions have been well and frequently desribed in literature as linked to drug resistance, deletions have been rarely observed and desribed (ART67, Imamichi et al.). The aim of this study is to describe a case of deletion of three nucleotides in the RT gene (ART67) of a multi-treated HIV-1 infected patient. As this deletion has not been detected by the oligoprobe assay, the phenotyping test was used to support therapy but without an appreciable success in terms of viral load. Then a sequencing based genotyping system was used to analyse the viral polymerase and a novel deletion was found at codon 67 of RT gene.
