This study evaluates the development of resistance in Gram-negative rods to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and amikacin, meropenem and ampicillin/sulbactam over a five year period of use (1994-1998) at the University Hospital in Olomouc, Czech Republic. The development of bacterial resistance was linked with antibiotic use and hence selective pressure which was specific for the type of antibiotic and the bacterial species. Statistically significant correlations were found for the use of ofloxacin and resistance in Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri; cefotaxime and Enterobacter cloacae; ceftazidime and Acinetobacter spp., Enterobacter agglomerans and Proteus vulgaris; and gentamicin and Proteus mirabilis.
