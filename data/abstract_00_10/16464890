OBJECTIVES: To describe the distribution of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance genes and the role of horizontal gene transfer and clonal expansion in recent increases of antibiotic resistance rates among uropathogenic Escherichia coli in Europe and Canada. METHODS: We identified antibiotic resistance alleles sul1, sul2, sul3 and dfr along with type 1 and type 2 integrons among 350 uropathogenic E. coli isolates from a cross-sectional study of acute, uncomplicated, community-acquired urinary tract infections in 16 western European countries and Canada (ECOSENS). RESULTS: Trimethoprim resistance gene distributions showed no regional dependency (P = 0.84). The most common trimethoprim resistance gene was dfrA1, which occurred in 37.9% of dfr containing isolates. Similarly, the sulfamethoxazole resistance gene distributions did not vary significantly by region (P = 0.20). sul2, the most common sulfamethoxazole resistance gene, was found in 77.9% of sulfamethoxazole-resistant isolates. The distribution of type 1 and type 2 integrons varied slightly by region (P = 0.04) with type 1 integrons being the more common (85.9%). We observed 34 combinations of the sul genes, dfr genes and integron types; the most common combinations were broadly disseminated across every region examined. CONCLUSIONS: Horizontal gene transfer plays a larger role than clonal expansion in the increase of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance levels in Europe and Canada.
