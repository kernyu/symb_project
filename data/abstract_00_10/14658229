Interleukin (IL)-18 is a cytokine that plays an important role in the T helper (Th) 1 response, primarily by its ability to induce gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells. It also plays a role in host resistance to infection and in Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced histopathology. By a direct sequencing on P1 Artificial Chromosomes (PAC) clones, we have determined the genomic structure and the promoter region of the human IL-18 gene. The IL-18 gene spans approximately 20 Kb and consists of 6 exous. The 5'-flanking regions of human IL-18 and mouse IL-18 show 75% homology suggesting conserved promoter regulatory factors.
