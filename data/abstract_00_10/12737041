By PCR using the ant(3")-Ia primer pair the aadA gene was detected in 34 streptomycin- and spectinomycin-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium strains. Out of them 12 belonged to DT104 and 22 to non-DT104 phage type. Using different primer combinations it was demonstrated that this gene was integron-associated in all cases: in the DT104 strains it was generally contained by a 1 kb integron while in the majority of the non-DT104 strains by a 2.05 kb (less often by a 1.9 or 1 kb) integron. In the case of integrons carrying multiple cassettes the cassette containing the aadA gene was located closer to the 3' end of the integron. The aadA genes of DT104 and non-DT104 strains were different: in the former group the aadA2 gene, while in the latter group (constituted by strains of five different phages types as well as unclassifiable and untypable strains) the aadA1 gene could be identified. The RH50/RH51 primer pair described by Collis and Hall (1992) proved to be suitable for rapid discrimination between the aadA1 and aadA2 genes on the basis that the RH51 primer bound exclusively to the aadA2 gene.
