[reaction: see text] A novel ring opening ring closing metathesis (ROM-RCM) was demonstrated for cyclic conjugated dienes, effecting the excision of a C(2)H(2) unit and a net ring contraction. Applying the ring contraction metathesis, new 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotics were synthesized in a single step from existing 16-membered ring macrolides. This new class of macrolide antibiotics will provide access to new therapeutics for the treatment of macrolide-resistant bacterial infections.
