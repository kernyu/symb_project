Antimicrobial drugs are used in the treatment and control of many types of infections in a wide variety of animal species. As more antibiotics were discovered and introduced to veterinary clinical practice, it became clear that choice among rational agents needed to be guided by the agreement of antibiotic policies or 'ethical' measures. Prudent use of antimicrobial drugs is an integral part of good veterinary practice; it is an attitude to maximise therapeutic efficacy and to minimise selection of resistant microorganisms. This paper presents an overview of the judicious use of antimicrobial agents in animals, with particular emphasis on ethical aspects.
