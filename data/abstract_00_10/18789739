P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is implicated in multiple drug resistance (MDR) exhibited by several types of cancer against a multitude of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. This problem prompted several research groups to search for effective P-gp inhibitors. Cyclosporine A (CsA), aureobasidin A (AbA) and related analogues were reported to possess potent inhibitory actions against Pgp. In this work we employed receptor surface analysis (RSA) to construct two satisfactory receptor surface models (RSMs) for cyclosporine- and aureobasidin-based Pgp inhibitors. These pseudoreceptors were combined to achieve satisfactory three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) for 68 different cyclosporine and aureobasidin derivatives. Upon validation against an external set of 16 randomly selected Pgp inhibitors, the optimal 3D-QSAR was found to be self-consistent and predictive (r(LOO)(2)=0.673, r(PRESS)(2)=0.600). The resulting 3D-QSAR was employed to probe the structural factors that control the inhibitory activities of cyclosporine and aureobasidin analogues against Pgp.
