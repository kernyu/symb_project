OBJECTIVES: To characterize the mechanism of cefoxitin resistance in clinical isolate Escherichia coli N99-0001. METHODS: Plasmid analysis, PCR for beta-lactamases, and sequencing of the ampC genes was carried out. An RT-PCR method was developed to determine relative ampC expression. RESULTS: Analysis of the ampC promoter region of E. coli N99-0001 revealed a T-->A mutation at -32, a C-->A mutation at -11, an insertion of a T between -20 and -21, and a 28 bp deletion including the entire attenuator. RT-PCR showed that ampC was expressed 140-fold higher in E. coli N99-0001 than in E. coli ATCC 25922. CONCLUSIONS: Cefoxitin resistance in E. coli N99-0001 was due to overexpression of ampC caused by an increase in promoter strength.
