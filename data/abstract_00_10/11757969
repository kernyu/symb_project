In order to understand the mechanism(s) of the resistance/reduced susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to glycopeptide antibiotics, the current data on the modes of action of glycopeptides were reviewed. In addition, the different test systems for detecting vancomycin resistance and the clinical relevance of resistant Staphylococcus aureus were analyzed. Finally, strategies to prevent the nosocomial spread of these bacteria are presented, as are new therapeutic options.
