A crude extract prepared from Scutellaria barbata D. Don (Lamiaceae) was analyzed in the effort to discover antibacterial compounds against high-level strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Apigenin and luteolin were isolated from the plant as active constituents against the bacteria. These flavonoid congeners were selectively toxic to S. aureus, including the MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains.
