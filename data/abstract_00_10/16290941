A series of 4-oxo-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives, derivatized at the 2-position with carbon-linked substituents, were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to potentiate the activity of the fluoroquinolone levofloxacin (LVFX) and the anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam aztreonam (AZT) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling methods were applied for the incorporation of aliphatic and aromatic substituents.
