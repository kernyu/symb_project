OBJECTIVE: To investigate the drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria of nosocomial infections in the surgical intensive care unit. METHODS: The drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria of nosocomial infections in the SICU in our hospital from January 2001 to December 2004 were analyzed. RESULTS: The average nosocomial infections rate was 11.3%. The major sites of nosocomial infections were respiratory tract (30.9%), abdominal cavity (29.0%), bloodstream (9.7%) and biliary ducts (7.2%). The most common pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.6%), methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (11.1%) and candida albicans (9.7%). ESBLs-producing strains accounted for 66.2% and 58.5% of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. respectively. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus accounted for 94.7% and methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci accounted for 88.2% in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci. Carbapenems were the most powerful antibiotics against enterobacteriaceae. The non-fermenters were high resistant to antimicrobial agents. Vancomycin was the most potent antimicrobial against gram positive cocci. Amphotericin B was the most active antibiotic against fungi. CONCLUSIONS: Most strains of pathogens were antibiotic resistant in SICU. The main pathogenic bacteria of each infection site were different. So it is essential to establish nosocomial infections surveillance system in order to prevent, control and treat nosocomial infections effectively.
