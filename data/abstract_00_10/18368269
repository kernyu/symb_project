The clinical inefficacy of many medications has served to highlight the need for deeper studies on the formulation components, processes used and physicochemical characteristics of drugs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro release of primaquine phosphate from tablets available in Brazil for treating malaria, and the development of new formulations for conventional release. Although the primaquine phosphate tablets studied had been approved according to the criteria proposed by the United States Pharmacopoeia (2006) for the dissolution test, they did not present adequate dissolution performance characteristics, in that there was drug retention during the release process. The results indicate the existence of problems in the primaquine phosphate tablets analyzed, and it may suggest that this is one of the factors responsible for the appearance of parasite resistance.
