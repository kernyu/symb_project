The presence of erythromycin-resistant (ErR) commensal streptococci in the throat of 110 healthy subjects and 87 patients with pharyngitis was investigated. The resistance determinants were studied by PCR using the primers for mef and erm genes, followed by hybridization and sequencing analysis. Overall, 94.4% of the subjects carried one or more ErR strains in their pharynx. A total of 253 ErR strains was studied: 127 (50.2%) showed constitutive or inducible resistance to clindamycin (MLS(B) phenotype) and 126 (49.8%) were susceptible to clindamycin (M phenotype). In 50 subjects (25.4%) both phenotypes were detected. The ermB gene was predominant among the MLS(B) phenotype strains (97.6%). The mefA (mefA/mefE) gene was detected in 100% of the strains with the M phenotype. One Streptococcus oralis strain bearing the MLS(B) phenotype carried both mefA and ermB genes. The mefA gene from clinical isolates of Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis was transferred by conjugation to an erythromycin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae strain.
