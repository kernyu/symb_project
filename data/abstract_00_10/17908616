One hundred thirty-three Aeromonas spp. isolates were examined for multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes and prevalence of class 1 integron sequences. Twenty-four (18.0%) of these isolates contained class 1 integron. Seven different class 1 integrons were found among 24strains, with a total of 10 different gene cassettes encoding for resistance to trimethoprim (dfr12 and dfr2d), aminoglycosides (aadA1 and aadA2), beta-lactam antibiotics (oxa2), chloramphenicol (catB3 and catB8), quaternary ammonium amines (qacE2), and 2 ORFs (orfD and orfF) with unknown function. Rate of antibiotic resistance was different between integron-positive and integron-negative strains. Trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole resistances were commonly associated with integron, and all of integron-positive isolates were multiple resistant to more than 3 agents. Resistance to as many as 10 antimicrobial agents were observed in integron-positive strains. Several cassette arrays of class 1 integrons identified in this study were not previously reported in Aeromonas strains. This study demonstrates the wide distribution of class 1 integron in Aeromonas spp. isolated from foodborne outbreak-suspect samples and environmental sources in Taiwan.
