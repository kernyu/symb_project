The phytotoxin and polyketide antibiotic albicidin produced by Xanthomonas albilineans is a highly potent DNA gyrase inhibitor. Low yields of albicidin production have slowed studies of its chemical structure. Heterologous expression of albicidin biosynthetic genes in X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria resulted in a sixfold increase in albicidin production, offering promising strategies for engineering overproduction.
