Previous studies suggested that the persistence in eukaryotic cells of a Bordetella bronchiseptica mutant carrying an insertion in the locus encoding the response regulator RisAS is impaired. This suggested that ris-dependent products are required for the intracellular survival of bacteria. In this study we demonstrate that ris-regulated products play a role in B. bronchiseptica resistance against both phagosomal acidification and reactive oxygen intermediates.
