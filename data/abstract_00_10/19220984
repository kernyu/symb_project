The recently introduced Clonetics human corneal epithelium (cHCE) cell line is considered a promising in vitro permeability model, replacing excised animal cornea to predict corneal permeability of topically administered compounds. The purpose of this study was to further characterize cHCE as a corneal permeability model from both drug metabolism and transport aspects. First, good correlation was found in the permeability values (P(app)) obtained from cHCE and rabbit corneas for various ophthalmic drugs and permeability markers. Second, a previously established real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to profile mRNA expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (major cytochromes P450 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A1) and transporters in cHCE in comparison with human cornea. Findings indicated that 1) the mRNA expression of most metabolizing enzymes tested was lower in cHCE than in excised human cornea, 2) the mRNA expression of efflux transporters [multidrug resistant-associated protein (MRP) 1, MRP2, MRP3, and breast cancer resistance protein], peptide transporters (PEPT1 and PEPT2), and organic cation transporters (OCTN1, OCTN2, OCT1, and OCT3) could be detected in cHCE as in human cornea. However, multidrug resistance (MDR) 1 and organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1 was not detected in cHCE; 3) cHCE was demonstrated to possess both esterase and ketone reductase activities known to be present in human cornea; and 4) transport studies using probe substrates suggested that both active efflux and uptake transport may be limited in cHCE. As the first detailed report to delineate drug metabolism and transport characteristics of cHCE, this work shed light on the usefulness and potential limitations of cHCE in predicting the corneal permeability of ophthalmic drugs, including ester prodrugs, and transporter substrates.
