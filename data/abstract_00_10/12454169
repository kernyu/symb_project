Strains of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) have emerged worldwide. Concomitant ciprofloxacin resistance with ESBL production in K. pneumoniae isolates would severely restrict treatment options. Among 39 (18.5%) of 211 ESBL-KP isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC, >/=4 micro g/ml), 37 (95%) were high level resistant (MIC, >/=16 micro g/ml). These isolates were also cross resistant to the newer fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and garenoxacin (BMS 284756). Sitafloxacin was most active against these ciprofloxacin-resistant ESBL-KP isolates with MICs for 67% of the isolates being </=2 micro g/ml. The molecular epidemiology of these multiresistant isolates was investigated by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Ribotyping identified 18 different strains among the 39 ciprofloxacin-resistant ESBL-KP isolates. The majority (67%) of these isolates were contained in six ribogroups which were further confirmed by PFGE. The distribution of the six major strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant ESBL-KP within Taiwan included one (ribogroup 255.3-PFGE type E) with a nationwide distribution and several institution-specific strains. Interhospital cooperation appears necessary, with strict infection control practices coupled with restriction of fluoroquinolone and extended-spectrum beta-lactam use to control both the major epidemic strain and the more diverse strains observed within individual institutions.
