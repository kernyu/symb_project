Combined therapy with a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics (metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin or tetracycline) is applied in the treatment of H. pylori infection. The effects of the treatment depend on drug sensitivity of H. pylori. Growing resistance to some of the applied antibiotics has been observed. The aim of the study was to assess drug sensitivity of Helicobacter pylori strains which were isolated from the gastric mucosa of children and young people living in the macroregion of Lodz. The study comprised 45 children aged between 5 and 18 years. Biopsy specimens were put on transport medium, incubated in microaerophilic environment, then identified. Drug sensitivity to metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin and tetracycline was assessed. We found resistance to metronidazole in 18% (8/45) children, resistance to clarithromycin in 16% (7/45) children and resistance to both antibiotics in 4% (2/45) children. No resistance to amoxicillin or tetracycline was noted.
