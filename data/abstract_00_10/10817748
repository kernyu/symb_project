We investigated the in vitro postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of the ketolides telithromycin (HMR 3647) and HMR 3004 and analyzed the results using the sigmoid E(max) model. Mean maximum telithromycin PAEs against erythromycin A-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 3. 7, 8.9, and 9.7 h, respectively, while maximum PAEs for erythromycin A-resistant strains were much shorter. Mean maximum HMR 3004 PAEs were 3.2 to 4.4 h for all species.
