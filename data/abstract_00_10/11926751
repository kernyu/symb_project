Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease continue to be significant causes of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients. The potential benefits of CMV prophylaxis extend beyond prevention of the immediate CMV infection to potentially preventing CMV-associated complications, including superinfection due to Aspergillus bacteria, and other opportunistic infections, and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Longer courses of prophylactic intravenous (IV) ganciclovir, sequential IV/oral therapy, addition of intravenous CMV immune globulin (CMV-IGIV), surveillance tests, and investigation of the role of hypogammaglobulinemia are a few of the strategies and issues being evaluated to improve CMV prophylaxis and, consequently, graft and patient survival.
