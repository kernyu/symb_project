BACKGROUND: Midday and evening twice-a-day quadruple therapy appears to be the most effective therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in Northern Sardinia, a site where antibiotics resistance is common. AIM: The objective of our study was to estimate the efficacy, side-effects, and compliance of a quadruple therapy containing esomeprazole in a group of dyspeptic elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive elderly patients positive for H. pylori infection and not previously treated for eradication were enrolled. Therapy consisted of esomeprazole 20 mg, tetracycline 500 mg, metronidazole 500 mg, and bismuth subcitrate tablets 240 mg, all twice-a-day with the midday and evening meals, for 10 days. Efficacy was evaluated using 13C-urea breath testing. Compliance was assessed after completing treatment and at follow up. Side effects were graded based on daily activities. RESULTS: Ninety-five dyspeptic patients (range 65-81 years), 52 men and 43 women, were enrolled. The intention-to-treat cure rate was 91% (81 of 89; 95% CI = 88-99%) and, 95% (81 of 85; 95% CI = 83-96%) per-protocol analysis. Compliance was excellent. Mild-moderate side effects occurred in 27 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole containing quadruple therapy was highly successful for initial eradication of H. pylori in elderly patients.
