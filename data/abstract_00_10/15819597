Valganciclovir (Valcyte) is an orally administered prodrug of the standard anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) drug ganciclovir. Valganciclovir is as effective as intravenous ganciclovir for the treatment of AIDS-related CMV retinitis, and oral ganciclovir for the prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in high-risk solid organ transplant recipients. The drug is generally well tolerated and has a similar tolerability profile to that of oral or intravenous ganciclovir, but is devoid of adverse events related to intravenous or indwelling catheter access associated with the use of intravenous ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet. The simple and convenient once-daily valganciclovir regimen offers potential for improved patient compliance. It provides greater systemic ganciclovir exposure than oral ganciclovir, thus reducing the risk of viral resistance when used for prophylaxis in high-risk solid organ transplant recipients. Furthermore, the use of valganciclovir instead of intravenous ganciclovir may provide significant cost savings, based on data comparing oral versus intravenous regimens for the treatment of AIDS-related CMV retinitis. Overall, valganciclovir appears to have some advantages over ganciclovir. Therefore, when used as prophylaxis against CMV infection and disease in high-risk solid organ transplant recipients or as induction and maintenance therapy of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, oral valganciclovir is an attractive alternative to other available anti-CMV drugs.
