Six cases of cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were diagnosed between 2002 and 2005 in our center, whereas only one case was diagnosed between 1985 and 2001. Cumulative incidence reaches 2.2%, whereas this complication has been rarely described after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We aimed to describe clinical and biologic features of CMVR and search for risk factors associated with CMVR. CMVR was diagnosed on specific funduscopic examination in all patients either on visual symptoms (n=3) or on systematic ophthalmologic examination (n=3). CMVR occurred in the context of unrelated transplantation in patients with profound immune defect and multiple episodes of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. The combination of a CMV-seropositive recipient and CMV-seronegative donor was the leading risk factor.
