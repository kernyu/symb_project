According to recent international studies, the epidemiology of invasive Candidiasis has changed worldwide over these recent years, contrarily to that of invasive aspergillosis. An increase in the incidence of invasive candidiasis has been observed, as well as changes in Candida spp repartition and in the profile of patient populations with candidemia. Therefore, a re-evaluation of treatment strategies is needed on the basis of local epidemiological characteristic knowledge. Thus, current treatment strategies are more often based on patient risk factors than on results of susceptibility tests, though they are recommended by European guidelines in haematological patients.
