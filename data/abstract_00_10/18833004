In human gene therapy applications, lentiviral vectors may have advantages over gamma-retroviral vectors because of their ability to transduce nondividing cells, their resistance to gene silencing, and a lack of integration site preference. In this study, we used VSV-G pseudotype third generation lentiviral vectors harboring specific antitumor T-cell receptor (TCR) to establish clinical-scale lentiviral transduction of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL). Spinoculation (1000g, 32 degrees C for 2 h) in the presence of protamine sulfate represents the most efficient and economical approach to transduce a large number of PBLs compared with RetroNectin-based methods. Up to 20 million cells per well of a 6-well plate were efficiently transduced and underwent an average 50-fold expansion in 2 weeks. TCR transduced PBL-mediated specific antitumor activities including interferon-gamma release and cell lysis. Compared with gamma-retroviral vectors, the TCR transgene could be preferentially expressed on a less-differentiated cell population.
