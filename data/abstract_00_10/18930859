Prevalence of microorganisms was studies in clinical samples of various body fluids (n=12,259), collected from patients at Post graduate Medical Institute Hayatabad Medical Complex (PGMI, HMC) Peshawar. Only 34.90% of samples exhibited growth, 36.25% of these isolates were Gram positive and 63.75% were Gram negative bacteria. E. coli was the most prevalent organism (39.45%) followed by S. aureus (32.23%), Proteus spp. (9.23%), Pseudomonas spp. (6.54%), Streptococuss spp. (3.51%), Acinetobacter spp. (2.66%), Citrobacter spp. (2.8%), Providencia spp. (2.2%) and miscellaneous bacteria (1.38%). The growth of bacteria was high in pus samples (44.03%) followed by urine (38.21%), high vaginal swab (HVS) (8.58%), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (1.96%), blood (3.39%) and miscellaneous samples (3.83%). E. coli and S. aureus were the most prevalent organism in urine (56.57%) and pus samples (44.02%), respectively. The frequency of E. coli (61.76%) was high in samples collected from female patients and percentage of the infections caused by the S. aureus in male and female patients was 47.9 and 52.1, respectively. During the study period, frequency of the E. coli was high during April to October and the prevalence of S. aureus was very common during March to October. Consistent but insignificant increase in the beta-lactamase producing S. aureus and E. coli was observed throughout the period of the study. However, increase in the beta-lactamase producing S. aureus and E. coli was above 80%. The prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in E. coli was increased from 13.85% in year 2000 to 22.66% in year 2003. The increasing in prevalence of microorganism, particularly of beta-lactamase producing E. coli and S. aureus and ESLB is alarming situation. Various measured like prescribing and patient compliance are required to control the increase in the prevalence of microorganism.
