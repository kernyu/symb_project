The methanol and ethyl acetate extracts of the aerial parts of Cirsium tenoreanum, have been evaluated for their phytochemical constituents and antibacterial and cytotoxic properties. Three flavonoids, apigenin, quercetin-3-O-galactoside and kaempferol-3-O-ramnoside, were isolated. The ethyl acetate extract showed a good antiproliferative activity.
