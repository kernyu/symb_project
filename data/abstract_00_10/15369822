In eukaryotes, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) expression was found in brain, kidney, and several kinds of tumor tissues. But its function has been emphasized only as a neurotransmitter-synthesizer, the role in controlling intracellular physiology is poorly understood. According to our studies, when GAD 67KD expression in colon cancer HT-29 cell was repressed by antisense DNA, the cell proliferation was significantly inhibited. GAD 67KD antisensed cells exhibited the low glutathione and high reactive oxygen species level. More importantly, these cells were extremely sensitive to butyrate or pH reduction, both of which naturally cause metabolic stress in the colon lumen, as well as H2O2 and ionizing radiation. These data indicate that GAD 67KD regulates the intracellular redox potential and is important for resistance to acidic or oxidative stress. So, based on these results, we suggest that inhibition of GAD 67KD expression has potentially important implications for overcoming the drug resistance of cancer cells.
