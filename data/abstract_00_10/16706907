AIMS: To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic characteristics of Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida isolates obtained from cultured Seriola in Japan. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations of 14 antimicrobials for 74 isolates from Seriola in Japan in 2002 were determined. Isolates showed high frequencies of resistance to sulfamonomethoxine (SMMX) (97.3%), oxytetracycline (OTC) (77.0%), flumequine (FMQ) (77.0%), chloramphenicol (CP) (75.7%), kanamycin (KM) (63.5%) and oxolinic acid (OA) (62.0%), but low to ampicillin (ABPC) (2.8%). All isolates were susceptible to bicozamycin (BCM), fosfomycin (FOM) and florfenicol (FF). Of these isolates, 45 (60.8%) showed same resistance pattern (SMMX-OTC-FMQ-OA-CP-KM). In random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, no difference was observed among our 74 field isolates and ATCC51736 isolated from Seriola in 1974 in Japan, but different from ATCC 17911 isolated from white perch in USA. CONCLUSIONS: FF, BCM, FOM and ABPC were useful antimicrobials for treating pseudotuberculosis. However, the frequency of multidrug resistance was high. RAPD analysis showed homogeneity of isolates from Seriola in Japan. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates that some antimicrobials were still useful for treating pseudotuberculosis and that P. damselae ssp. piscicida strains of same origin might have spread among Seriola in Japan since 1974.
