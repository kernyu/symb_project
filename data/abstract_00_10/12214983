A total of 123 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from bovine clinical and subclinical mastitis in Argentina from March 1998 to March 2000 was investigated for in vitro susceptibility to several antimicrobial agents. Minimum inhibitory concentrations that inhibit 90% of the isolates tested (reported in micrograms per milliliter) were: 4.40, 0.38, 4.00, 0.75, 0.75, 3.60, and 2.00 for penicillin, oxacillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and ampicillin-sulbactam, respectively. Resistance was detected in 34 (27.6%), 4 (3.2%), 7 (5.7%), and 6 (4.8%) isolates for penicillin, oxacillin, erythromycin, and pirlimycin, respectively. No resistance was detected for gentamicin, cephalothin, or ampicillin-sulbactam. Results indicated that coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates in Argentina exhibited the highest degree of resistance to penicillin of all antimicrobial agents tested.
