Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis) isolates derived from diseased pigs in Japan during 2001 and 2005 were analyzed for biotype, based on H(2)S production and dulcitol fermentation, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profile, and antimicrobial resistance profile. S. Choleraesuis biotype Choleraesuis (biotype Choleraesuis) was classified into one genotype, while varietas Kunzendorf (var. Kunzendorf) was classified into two genotypes. The isolates of var. Kunzendorf belonging to one genotype were isolated in a limited area of Japan. Variation in the antimicrobial resistance pattern was observed in isolates of both biotypes Choleraesuis and var. Kunzendorf. We have also shown that the PFGE profile was associated with the biotype and isolation region of each isolate.
