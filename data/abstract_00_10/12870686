SETTING: Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai, India. OBJECTIVE: To rapidly identify multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis using phenotypic and genotypic methods. DESIGN: Two genotypic assays, DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), and one phenotypic assay, phage amplified biological assay (PhaB) were standardised in-house and performed on coded 101 rifampicin-resistant and 100 rifampicin-sensitive M. tuberculosis clinical isolates for the identification of rifampicin resistance. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results obtained using the three assays were compared with those from the conventional indirect sensitivity test. The sensitivities and specificities of DNA sequencing, PCR-SSCP and PhaB were 97% and 100%, 76% and 100%, and 97% and 84%, respectively. DNA sequencing was found to be more sensitive and specific than the other tests.
