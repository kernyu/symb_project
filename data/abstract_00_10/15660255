The purpose of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains obtained from urine samples of residents of a long-term care facility and to determine the risk factors for acquisition of ESBL-producing strains. All urine samples collected from January 2003 to October 2003 that were positive for E. coli or K. pneumoniae were tested for the presence of ESBL. Records of patients with ESBL-positive (ESBL-P) samples were analyzed for clinical and demographic data. The records of a matched control group of patients whose urine samples were positive for E. coli or K. pneumoniae but were ESBL-negative (ESBL-N) were also analyzed. The overall rate of ESBLs among the E. coli and K. pneumoniae samples was 25.6%. Of 350 urine samples that grew E. coli, 77 (22%) were positive for ESBL; 34 of 84 (40.5%) samples that grew K. pneumoniae were ESBL-P. Male sex, treatment in the subacute care unit, recent antimicrobial treatment, pressure sores, (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) PEG tube, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, permanent urinary catheter, and any recent invasive procedure were all associated with ESBL-P bacteria in the univariate analysis. The multivariate analysis revealed three independent risk factors for the presence of an ESBL-producing strain: anemia, permanent urinary catheter, and previous antibiotic use. Fluoroquinolones were most strongly associated with the development of ESBL-producing bacteria. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the long-term care facility investigated was unexpectedly high and corroborates the notion that long-term care facilities could be important reservoirs of resistant bacteria. Identification of the risk factors for ESBLs is the first step in formulating an effective strategy to curtail the spread of ESBL resistance in long-term care facilities.
