The antileishmanial evaluation of more than one hundred 2-substituted quinolines led us to identify three compounds for further studies: compound 1 (2-n-propylquinoline), compound 2 (2-(2methoxyethenyl)quinoline) and compound 3 (2-(2-hydroxyprop-2-enyl)quinoline). The final selection of a potential drug candidate was mainly based on chemical stability and acute oral toxicity as discriminating criteria. The most stable compound in various conditions was 2-n-propylquinoline (compound 1). Only reversible toxicity signs were observed for compound 1 at 1000 mg/kg after a treatment by oral route at a single dose and no sign was detected at 100 mg/kg. Interestingly, 2-substituted quinolines were active on a Leishmania donovani line, resistant to sitamaquine, a 8-aminoquinoline, suggesting that 2-substituted quinolines and 8-aminoquinoline probably affect a different target in L. donovani.
