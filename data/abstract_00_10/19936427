Community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection has become a major pathogen causing significant infection in children in Saudi Arabia. It has emerged as a frequent cause of skin and soft tissue infections and can be associated with life-threatening complications such as necrotizing pneumonia and sepsis. Between January 2005 and March 2008, 5 (6%) previously healthy children with invasive CA-MRSA infections were identified from 80 children with community-onset MRSA infections. Three children had osteomyelitis, with one patient presenting a fulminant and extensive soft tissue and bone destruction complicated by deep vein thrombosis and pathological fracture. One child had deep-seated infection, and one infant had severe orbital cellulitis and bilateral orbital abscess complicated by subdural empyema. The median age was 4-years (range 3 months to 17 years). Only one patient had a risk factor. Two patients were initially treated with ineffective antimicrobial therapy (beta-lactam). One isolate showed inducible clindamycin resistance. The recovery was uneventful in all patients. This report should increase the awareness of clinicians regarding severe CA-MRSA infections and highlight the challenges encountered in the choice of therapy of serious infections caused by this organism.
