OBJECTIVE: To investigate the SCCmec genotyping, subtype and antimicrobial susceptibility tests in methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus to guide the clinical treatment and provide the proof for molecular epidemiology. METHODS: To detect mecA gene and SCCmec genetyping and subtype in 50 MRSA by PCR. According to CLSI's guideline, antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed with disk diffusion. RESULTS: All 50 MRSA had mecA genes. 45 strains were SCCmec III types; 3 strains were SCCmec III A types; 2 strains were SCCmec II types. There were no SCCmec I and SCCmec IV types. SCCmec II, SCCmec III and SCCmec III A type strains were all multiresistant. CONCLUSION: 50 MRSA are all multiresistant. SCCmec III are the main types.
