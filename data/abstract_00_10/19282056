Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ceftazidime was isolated from ten neonates hospitalised between February and March 2006 in two Antananarivo hospitals, Madagascar. The main environmental source, for one hospital in particular, was the liquid used to rinse aspiration tubes in the paediatric wards. The risk of contamination from aspiration tubes is very high in the hospitals of Antananarivo since tap water used to rinse the tubes is not regularly changed. Phenotypical (biotyping and antibiotyping) and genotypical (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) analysis of all the clinical isolates indicated that nine cases were due to a single clone. This clone carried the genes encoding SHV-2 and CTX-M-15 beta-lactamases. This is the first description of an epidemic due to an ESBL-producing member of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Malagasy hospitals.
