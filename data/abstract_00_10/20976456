The antimicrobial resistance and the character of integrons were determined in 58 Shigella flexneri strains isolated from China. All isolates were multi-drug resistant and found to carry integrons of class 1 (94.8%), class 2 (100%), or both (94.8%). No intI3 was detected. The typical class 1 integrons were found in conjugative plasmids and could be transferred to the recipient E. coli DH5alpha. The gene cassettes of typical class 1 integrons dfrA17-aadA5 and dfrA12-orfF-aadA2 were detected in 54 strains (93.1%) and 1 strain, respectively. Atypical class 1 integrons located on the chromosome with gene cassettes bla (oxa-30)-aadA1 were detected in 55 isolates (94.8%). All the intI2 positive isolates carried gene cassettes dfrA1-sat1-aadA1. To our knowledge, this is the first report that atypical and typical class 1 integrons coexisted with class 2 integron in multi-drug resistant S. flexneri strains.
