Oxazolidinone antibacterial agents, where the N-substituted piperazinyl group of eperezolid was replaced with a N-substituted piperidinyloxy moiety, were synthesized and shown to be active against a variety of resistant and susceptible Gram-positive organisms. The effect of ring size, positional isomerism, and fluorine substitution on antibacterial activity was examined.
