A case of Haemophilus parainfluenzae meningitis in a woman with a 3-day history of acute otitis media is reported. Her medical history included bladder cancer surgery. Unequivocal identification of the isolate was obtained by using molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA sequencing besides to conventional culture methods. To investigate bacterial virulent traits possibly related to invasive properties, in vitro serum resistance of our isolate was analyzed, but it was found serum susceptible. Our study demonstrates that H. parainfluenzae can be considered an opportunistic pathogen able to cause life-threatening infections not only in children but also in patients with underlying conditions.
