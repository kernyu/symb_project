We describe the acquisition of flucytosine, azole, and caspofungin resistance in sequential Candida glabrata bloodstream isolates collected from a bone marrow transplant patient with clinical failure. Point mutations in C. glabrata FUR1 (CgFUR1) and CgFKS2 and overexpression of CgCDR1 and CgCDR2 were observed in resistant isolates.
