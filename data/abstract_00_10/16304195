In vitro synergy testing of daptomycin plus rifampin was performed against 24 unique isolates of Enterococcus faecium resistant to both linezolid and vancomycin. Synergy testing showed that 21/24 (88%) were synergistic and 3/24 (12%) were indifferent by the Etest method. Time-kill assays revealed synergy for 18/24 (75%) and indifference for 6/24 (25%).
