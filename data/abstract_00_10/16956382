It is accepted that resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine (CQ) is caused primarily by mutations in the pfcrt gene. However, a consensus has not yet been reached on the mechanism by which resistance is achieved. CQ-resistant (CQR) parasite lines accumulate less CQ than do CQ-sensitive (CQS) parasites. The CQR phenotype is complex with a component of reduced energy-dependent CQ uptake and an additional component that resembles energy-dependent CQ efflux. Here we show that the required energy input is in the form of the proton electrochemical gradient across the digestive vacuole (DV) membrane. Collapsing the DV proton gradient (or starving the parasites of glucose) results in similar levels of CQ accumulation in CQS and CQR lines. Under these conditions the accumulation of CQ is stimulated in CQR parasite lines but is reduced in CQS lines. Energy deprivation has no effect on the rate of CQ efflux from CQR lines implying that mutant PfCRT does not function as an efflux pump or active carrier. Using pfcrt-modified parasite lines we show that the entire CQ susceptibility phenotype is switched by the single K76T amino acid change in PfCRT. The efflux of CQ in CQR lines is not directly coupled to the energy supply, consistent with a model in which mutant PfCRT functions as a gated channel or pore, allowing charged CQ species to leak out of the DV.
