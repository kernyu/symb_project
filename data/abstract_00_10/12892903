We report an in vitro analysis of the spatial pattern of production of three antiviral proteins (2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase, 2'5'AS; double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, PKR; and Mx protein, Mx) in the rat testis, in basal conditions and following stimulation with interferon (IFN) or Sendai virus. The two major constituents of interstitial tissue--Leydig cells and macrophages--constitutively produce 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'5'AS), PKR and Mx. Production of an isoform of 2'5'AS was induced following Leydig cells stimulation by the Sendai virus. The most immature germ cells, spermatogonia, were devoid of 2'5'AS whatever the type of stimulation, whereas IFN treatment induced Mx production and increased PKR production in this cell type. IFN stimulation strongly increased PKR production in all three cell types. This new set of data extends our previous investigations and demonstrates that the testis possesses an anti-viral defense system involving IFNs and IFN-induced anti-viral proteins.
