The cytotoxic effects of 27 anticancer drugs including amrubicin, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and irinotecan were evaluated in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, and drug-resistant HeLa-derived Hvrl-1, HvrlO-6, and Hvr100-6 cells, which were newly established by stepwise exposure to vinblastine. FACS and RT-PCR analysis indicated that MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) was induced without any alterations in expression of its related transporters. Hvrl00-6 cells showed 2- to 200-fold higher resistance to anthracyclines than HeLa cells, and unexpectedly showed slight resistance to idarubicin and amrubicin. The relative resistance to vinca-alkaloids was 300- to 600,000-fold, and HvrlOO-6 cells showed the highest relative resistance to vinorelbine. HvrlOO-6 cells also showed 4000- and 60000-fold resistance to the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, respectively. Hvr100-6 cells were also resistant to 6-mercaptopurine, actinomycin D, etoposide, and mitomycin C, with relative resistance of 8-, 45000-, 12-, and 9-fold, respectively. In contrast, HvrlOO-6 cells showed no or slight resistance to platinum derivatives, pyrimidine analogues, and alkylating agents or to irinotecan and its active form, or tamoxifen. The cytotoxicity of anthracyclines, vinca-alkaloids, taxanes, actinomycin D, and etoposide was extensively reversed by cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A had no effect on the cytotoxicity of 6-mercaptopurine or mitomycin C, suggesting that resistance to these drugs was not mediated via MDR1. The alterations in cytotoxicity by overexpression of MDR1 and effects of cyclosporin A could be also qualitatively explained by [3H]vinblastine uptake experiments. The 27 anticancer drugs analyzed here could be classified into substrates and nonsubstrates for MDR1. This will be useful for designing effective regimens for chemotherapy.
