OBJECTIVES: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is commonly used to treat melioidosis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disc diffusion method is commonly used in melioidosis-endemic areas, but may overestimate resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed disc diffusion and Etest on isolates from the first positive culture for all patients presenting to Sappasithiprasong Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, with culture-confirmed melioidosis between 1992 and 2003. RESULTS: The estimated resistance rate for 1976 clinical Burkholderia pseudomallei isolates was 13% by Etest and 71% by disc diffusion. All isolates classed as either susceptible (n=358) or as having intermediate resistance (n=218) on disc diffusion were susceptible by Etest. Only 258 of the 1400 (18%) isolates classed as resistant on disc diffusion were resistant by Etest. CONCLUSIONS: Disc diffusion testing of B. pseudomallei may be useful as a limited screening tool in resource poor settings. Isolates assigned as 'susceptible' or 'intermediate' by disc diffusion may be viewed as 'susceptible'; those assigned as 'resistant' require further evaluation by MIC methodology.
