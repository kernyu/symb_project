Sequences from 82 protease inhibitors (PI)-experienced patients were analysed for the presence of previously described in-vitro resistance mutations to PA-457 located in the C-terminal capside (H226Y, L231F, L231M) and in the N-terminal SP1 (A1V, A3T, A3V) within the CA-SP1 boundary domain. Overall, the CA-SP1 cleavage site was highly conserved in PI pre-treated patients and only one patient showed an L231M mutation. The impact of this mutation should be further addressed in vivo.
