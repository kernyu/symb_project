Surgical site infection (SSI) remains an important cause of morbidity among hospitalized patients. We reviewed 421 patients who underwent open urological operations between January 1993 and December 1997 in our institute. Group I consisted of 259 patients who received uncontrolled antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) between 1993 and 1995. Group II consisted of 162 patients who received controlled AMP between 1996 and 1997. In group II, penicillins or first to second-generation cephalosporins was used and the duration of use for these agents regulated according to the wound class of each operation. The operations with clean wounds showed the lowest rate of SSI in both groups; the operations with contaminated wounds showed the highest rate of SSI (32.0% in group I and 33.3% in group II). There was no significant difference in the total rates of SSI between the two groups (P=0.216). The most frequently isolated bacterial species was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), isolated in 73.3% of the cases in group I and in 93.3% in group II. There was no significant difference in the incidence of MRSA isolation between the two groups (P=0.114). The controlled AMP could not lower the incidence of MRSA-induced SSIs. In SSI patients, 22.7% of group I and 35.7% in group II, had MRSA bacteriuria before operation. The prohibition of third-generation cephalosporins and shorter duration of AMP did not reduce the incidence of SSI induced by MRSA because MRSA was not the emerging microorganism but rather a resident in the urological ward. On the other hand, the total incidence of SSI did not increase after regulation of AMP. This finding suggests that older antibacterial agents can prevent infection, except those caused by resistant microorganisms such as MRSA. The effective counter-measure for the prevention of MRSA-induced SSI is needed.
