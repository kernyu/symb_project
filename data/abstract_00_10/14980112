OBJECTIVE: To investigate protective effects of hHSS transfection against CCl4 or H2O2. METHODS: cDNA coding for hHSS was constructed into eukaryotic vector of pcDNA3.1 and transfected into BEL-7402 hepatoma cells. The expression of hHSS was analyzed with Northern blot. RESULTS: The growth of the hepatoma cells was remarkably enhanced 24 to 144h after hHSS gene transfection, which suggesting hHSS gene expression could stimulate cells activity. Meantime, incubation of both wild-type and vector-transfected as well as hHSS-transfected cells with CCl4 or H2O2 resulted in severe damage as marked by cell mortality and the rate of apoptosis. However, it appeared that the transfection of hHSS enabled the hepatoma cells to raise obvious resistance against CCl4 and H2O2 injury. Compared the vector cells to the vector-transfected cells, apoptosis ratio were (32.44+/-0.52)% and (25.60+/-0.66)% in which treated with CCl4, while (47.78+/-0.45)% and (37.40+/-0.69)% in which treated with H2O2, t value is 16.82 and 25.20, P<0.01. MAPK phosphorylation was also activated after HSS transfected. CONCLUSION: The function of hHSS gene expression could be related to proliferation of cell and protection against free radical damage.
