PURPOSE: This study focused on the anti-microbial protein human lactoferrin (hLF) commonly found in saliva, and tried to develop biocompatible dental materials that have higher anti-microbial effects. METHODS: A lyophilized cation exchange resin was added to tissue conditioner at 4 wt% and 8 wt%. The amount of hLF binding to the tissue conditioner and their anti-microbial effect against Candida albicans was investigated. Then their mechanical properties and cytotoxicity were examined. RESULTS: Tissue conditioner containing cation exchange resin was bound with hLF and had an anti-microbial effect against C. albicans. In addition, their physical properties were sufficient and they were harmless to human fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: The clinical application of cation exchange resin for tissue conditioner can be effective for the prevention and treatment of denture stomatitis and systemic opportunistic infections since it is thought that these materials will increase the local concentration of anti-microbial protein in saliva at the lesion site.
