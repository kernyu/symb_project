The development of antimalarial drugs involving novel mechanisms of action is of imminent importance. Several potential drug candidates of synthetic and natural origin as well as their combination therapies are currently being evaluated for their efficacy against drug-resistant strains of the parasite. Various plasmodial targets/pathways, such as the Purine salvage pathway, Pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and also the processes in the apicoplast, have been identified and are being utilized for the discovery and development of novel antimalarial therapies. This article provides an overview of the latest developments in terms of cell and molecular biology that will improve the knowledge related to drug-resistant malaria and to new molecular targets.
