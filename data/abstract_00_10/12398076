In order to measure the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLE), and to evaluate the impact of the national guidelines for multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) prevention in hospitals of Northern France, a multicentre study was conducted for three months every year starting in 1996, in volunteer hospital laboratories. All clinical specimens positive for MRSA and ESBLE were prospectively surveyed. During the five-year surveillance period, the overall proportion of MRSA was 38.4% in the 28,534 strains of S. aureus, and that of ESBLE was 11.4% in the 6121 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 47.7% in the 2353 strains of Enterobacter aerogenes. The overall incidence rates of clinical specimens positive for MRSA, ESBL-K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes were 0.84. 0.05 and 0.12/1000 hospital-days (HD), respectively. In the 23 hospitals that participated in the survey every year, the proportion and incidence of ESBLE decreased. Hence, despite recommendations as for isolation precautions, MRSA remains poorly controlled and requires more effective measures.
