Influenza viruses are etiological agents of deadly flu that continue to pose global health threats, and have caused global pandemics that killed millions of people worldwide. The availability of neuraminidase inhibitors and attenuated vaccines improves our ability to defend against influenza, but their benefits can be significantly limited by drug-resistance and virus mutations. Nucleic acid-based drugs may represent a promising class of antiviral agents that could play a role in the prevention and treatment of influenza. Efficacy studies in animals have shown that ds RNA, such as poly ICLC can provide effective and broad-spectrum prophylaxis against lethal challenges against various strains of influenza A virus. Furthermore, similar level of antiviral protection in mice can be provided by using short fragments of oligonucleotides that induce antiviral immunity. Finally, influenza virus expression can also be specifically inhibited or suppressed using antisense oligonucleotides that bind to viral mRNA encoding key viral proteins. The versatility and potency of nucleic acid-based drugs make them potential drug candidates for used in seasonal or pandemic influenza situations.
