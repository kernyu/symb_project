The Velogene (VEL) genomic assay is a qualitative DNA probe for vanA and vanB in enterococci. 150 clinical isolates were tested with the VEL assay and characterized by pigment production, catalase levels, motility, growth in 6 micro g of vancomycin/ml, vancomycin and teicoplanin susceptibility, API 20S assay, and genotyping by multiplex PCR. The VEL assay identified all enterococcal strains with vanA and vanB genes.
