Eight naturally occurring monoindole alkaloids were evaluated in vitro for their ability to inhibit Plasmodium falciparum growth and, in drug combination, to reverse the resistance of a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. None of these indole alkaloids has significant intrinsic antiplasmodial activity (IC(50) > 10 microM or 5 microg/ml). Nevertheless, three alkaloids (icajine, isoretuline and strychnobrasiline) did reverse chloroquine resistance at concentrations between 2.5 and 25 microg/ml (IF of 12.82 for isoretuline on W2 strain). The Interaction Factor (IF) equals 2, < 2, or > 2 for additive, antagonistic or synergistic effects of alkaloids on chloroquine inhibition, respectively. Icajine and isoretuline were also assessed in vitro for their mefloquine potentiating activity on a mefloquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Only icajine proved to be synergistic with mefloquine (IF = 15.38).
