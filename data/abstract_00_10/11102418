Linezolid, a new oxazolidinone antibiotic, showed good penetration (38+/-4%) into the meninges of rabbits with levels in the CSF ranging from 9.5 to 1.8 mg/L after two i.v. injections (20 mg/kg). Linezolid was clearly less effective than ceftriaxone against a penicillin-sensitive pneumococcal strain. Against a penicillin-resistant strain, linezolid had slightly inferior killing rates compared with the standard regimen (ceftriaxone combined with vancomycin). In vitro, linezolid was marginally bactericidal at concentrations above the MIC (5 x and 10 x MIC).
