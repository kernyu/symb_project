We present a study of the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms and expression of genes encoding the drug-resistance proteins glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in order to gain insights into the pattern of failure evident in mantle cell lymphoma. We note a high preponderance of genetic alterations conferring resistance to standard chemotherapy in this illness. Concurrent with this investigation, we present a series of patients who were provided dose-dense and intense chemotherapy to circumvent these drug-resistance mechanisms. High responses were noted, though durable remissions were few, indicating non-traditional chemotherapy options are important to investigate in this illness.
