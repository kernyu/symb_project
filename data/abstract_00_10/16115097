To assess the public health risk, the prevalence and anti-microbial resistance of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) among food-producing animals were studied throughout Japan. Faecal samples were collected from healthy animals of 272 cattle, 179 pigs, and 158 broilers on 596 farms in all 47 Japanese prefectures. STEC were isolated from 62 (23%) cattle and 32 (14%) pig samples but from no chicken samples. Of the bovine isolates, 19 belonged to serotypes frequently implicated in human disease (O157:H7/non-motile (NM)/H not typeable, O26:NM/H11/H21/H not typeable, O113:H21, and O145:NM). The eae genes were observed in 37% of bovine isolates; among them one O145:NM and all four O157 isolates possessed eae-gamma1, and one O145:NM, one O103:H11, and all five O26 isolates possessed eae-beta1 gene. Among the swine isolates, stx2e were dominant, and serotypes frequently implicated in human diseases or eae-positive isolates were not observed. Bovine isolates showed less anti-microbial resistance, but six isolates of 26:NM/H11 and O145:NM were multi-resistant and may need careful monitoring. Swine isolates showed various resistance patterns; chloramphenicol resistance patterns were more common than in bovine isolates. This first national study of STEC in the Japanese veterinary field should aid our understanding of Japan's STEC status.
