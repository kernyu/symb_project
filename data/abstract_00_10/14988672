UNLABELLED: With the continuing development of clinical drug resistance among bacteria and the advent of resistance to the recently released agents quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid, the need for new, effective agents to treat multidrug-resistant gram-positive infections remains important. With treatment options limited, it has become critical to identify antibiotics with novel mechanisms of activity. Several new drugs have emerged as possible therapeutic alternatives. This review focuses on agents newly introduced and those presently in clinical development for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections. Linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and daptomycin have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections. Two newer compounds, oritavancin and dalbavancin, are in clinical development for this indication. In addition, the quinolones moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin recently were approved for cutaneous infections. LEARNING OBJECTIVE: At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the modes of action, clinical indications, dosage regimens, and contraindications and cautions for several novel antibacterial agents for skin and skin structure infections.
