OBJECTIVES: Shigellosis is a major public health problem, and increasing antimicrobial resistance has complicated its treatment. We report isolation frequency, plasmid profiles and antimicrobial resistance of Shigella subtypes in Kolkata, India, from a prospective hospital-based study. METHODS: Fresh stool or rectal swabs were collected from children (<5 years) attending the Diarrhea Treatment Unit of a governmental paediatric referral hospital in Kolkata. Samples were processed following standard methods over a 7-year period from January 2001 to December 2007. RESULTS: Of 4478 samples collected, 516 (11.5%) were positive for Shigella spp. S. flexneri (312; 6.9%) was the most frequently isolated serogroup, ranking before S. sonnei (123, 2.7%), S. dysenteriae (48, 1.1%) and S. boydii (33, 0.7%). Although 10 subtypes of S. flexneri were identified, the common ones circulating locally were S. flexneri 2a (179), S. flexneri 6 (38) and S. flexneri 3a (36). Knowledge of Shigella subtypes is important for vaccine development. The majority of Shigella isolates (81.0%) were multidrug (two or more antimicrobial classes) resistant and showed high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with commonly used drugs like ampicillin, tetracycline, co-trimoxazole and nalidixic acid. Emergence of fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant S. dysenteriae type 1 (100.0%) in 2002-2003 was followed by frequent isolation (>25.0%) of FQ-resistant S. flexneri 2a, and S. flexneri 3a in 2004, which restricted use of fluoroquinolones for treatment. A number of smaller plasmids (<20 kb) with distinct patterns have been observed for several years in predominant subtypes. CONCLUSION: Long-term surveillance of Shigellae and their antimicrobial resistance are mandatory in endemic areas to formulate treatment policy until any suitable candidate vaccine is available to control the disease.
