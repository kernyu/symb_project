The author presents a study about epidemiology of urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosed in Menzel-Bourguiba hospital laboratory. These UTI are frequent (933 in 18 months) and often concern ambulatory practice (63.4%). UTI in hospital (36.6%) are most frequent in internal medicine unit (15.9%) and in pediatric unit (7.2%). The UTI are most frequent in female gender (sex ratio F/H = 3.0). The most frequent isolates are Enterobacteriacae family (91.7%), and E. coli the major species (73.7%). Resistances to beta-lactams are frequent either concerning hospital strains or ambulatory patients strains. Beta-lactams family are the most used antibiotics (80% of prescriptions). In hospital, some isolates were shown to possess extended spectrum betalactamase, but these strains became confined in the unit where appear because of the architectural conception of the hospital (pavilion system). Aminoglycosids and fluoroquinolones are very active antibiotics, but cotrimoxazole resistance is frequent. Consequently, before any prescription, it would be necessary an antimicrobial susceptibility study, either for hospital UTI, or for UTI in ambulatory practice.
