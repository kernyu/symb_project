A novel antienterococcal peptide was prepared by fusing the enterococcal cCF10 pheromone to the channel-forming domain of colicin Ia, forming Enterococcus faecalis pheromonicin (PMC-EF). This peptide was bactericidal against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) organisms. Electron microscopy and vital dyes confirmed increased membrane permeability. All mice made bacteremic with VRE strains survived when they were treated with PMC-EF, while all controls died.
