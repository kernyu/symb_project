To assess the antibiotic policies of Central European countries, we performed an overview of antibiotic stewardship, prescription habits and antibiotic prescription regulatory procedures. Since most Central European countries have had centralized health care and drug policies, the situation 10 years after decentralization is surprising. Only 3 of 10 Central European countries have some regulation of prescription of antibiotics, only 4 restrict some antibiotics, only 5 have hospital and only 3 national antibiotic policies. In all but 3 countries physicians can prescribe quinolones and/or 3rd generation oral cephalosporins as first-line antibiotics. Information on local and national antibiotic policies in Central and Eastern European countries is given including prescription guidelines for antibiotic use in community and hospital.
