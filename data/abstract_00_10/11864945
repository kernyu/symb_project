The in vitro and in vivo activity of T-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone, was compared with that of nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin and gentamicin. The in vitro activity of T-3912 against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, ofloxacin-resistant S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Propionibacterium acnes was four-fold to 16 000-fold greater than that of other agents at the MIC90 for the clinical isolates. The activity of T-3912 was not influenced by grlA mutation in S. aureus, and the degree of MIC increase of T-3912 for grlA-gyrA double and triple mutants was lowest among the quinolones tested (nadifloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). The inhibitory activity of T-3912 was compared with other quinolones for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV of S. aureus SA113. T-3912 showed the greatest inhibitory activity for both enzymes among the quinolones tested. The isolation frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to T-3912 was < 1.7 x 10(-9) and < 2.0 x 10(-9) for S. aureus SA113 and P. acnes JCM 6425, respectively. Furthermore, resistance to T-3912 could not be clearly detected in the 28th transfer by the serial passage method. T-3912 exhibited more potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and P. acnes than nadifloxacin and clindamycin in a short time period. T-3912 in a 1% gel formulation showed good therapeutic activity against a burn infection model caused by S. aureus SA113, P. acnes JCM6425 and multidrug-resistant S. aureus F-2161. These results indicate that T-3912 is potentially a useful quinolone for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections and that its potent bactericidal activity might be able to shorten the treatment period.
