Drug resistance in pathogenic trypanosomes threatens successful control of fatal sleeping sickness in man and hinders economic livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa. We report on the occurrence and development of drug resistance, and discuss the genetic basis of such resistance in Trypanosoma brucei. Understanding these mechanisms at the molecular level will enable improved management of existing drugs and provide valuable clues to the development of new trypanocides.
