The thiostrepton resistance gene tsr, which codes methylase 23 S of ribosomal RNA and remains in the composition of vector pIJ487 on BclI-fragment of DNA, has been cloned in Streptomyces globisporus 1912 (strain A2) on two multicopy plasmids of streptomycetes pSG1912-1 and pDZ8 in the sites of recognition of BglII, complementary to BclI-site. The plasmid pSG1912-1 is an endogenic plasmid of S. globisporus 1912, and plasmid pDZ8 has been isolated from the strain Streptomyces sp. 8 with the unknown species belonging. The recombinant plasmid pDZ9 (5.3 kb) differs from the derivative plasmid pDZ8 (14.6 kb) by considerably less dimensions and this can indicate to its reconstruction in the cell of the recipient strain A2. The preliminary restriction maps of recombinant plasmids have been compiled. These plasmids are preserved constantly in the cells of thiostrepton-resistant transformants and are of interest with respect to their investigation in the role of the vector molecules.
