Antimicrobial stewardship is an important process proven to combat antimicrobial resistance, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) have provided guidelines for the provision of antimicrobial stewardship. According to these recommendations, antimicrobial stewardship teams should be multidisciplinary in nature, with core members consisting of an infectious disease physician and an infectious disease-trained clinical pharmacist. Due to limited resources, our institution chose to implement a pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship service on 1 medical/surgical ward, with the existing clinical pharmacist and 3 infectious disease physicians as core members. This clinical pharmacist was not trained in infectious disease specialty, and stewardship activities were only one part of his daily activities. Pharmacy residents and students were extensively utilized to assist in the stewardship process. Approximately two thirds of stewardship recommendations were accepted using primarily a prospective audit and feedback approach.
