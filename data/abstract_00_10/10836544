The cyanine dye 1,1',3,3,3',3'-hexamethylindodicarbocyanine iodide (HIDC) protects K562 leukemia cells from photodynamic membrane damage caused by cis-di(4-sulfonatophenyl)diphenylporphine (TPPS2) and 420 nm light. This wavelength of light is chosen because it is absorbed by TPPS2, but not by HIDC. The photodynamic system studied may be useful as a model for antineoplastic therapy. A subline of K562 leukemia (K562/DOX), expressing the multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotype, is found to accumulate smaller amounts of HIDC than the parent cell line and thus has less photoprotection. In the absence of added HIDC, the K562/DOX cell line is more resistant to photodynamic cytotoxicity than the K562 cell line. The resistance of the K562/DOX cell line is not due to a smaller accumulation of TPPS2 than the K562 cell line. However, when both cell lines are incubated with HIDC and TPPS2, and then exposed to light, the K562/DOX cell line becomes more sensitive to photodynamic cell damage than the K562 cell line. The combination of a photosensitizer with a cationic or lysomorphotropic photoprotector represents a novel strategy for the eradication of malignant cells expressing the MDR phenotype.
