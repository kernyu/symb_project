Salicylic acid (SA) is a key endogenous component of local and systemic disease resistance in plants. In this study, we investigated the role of benzoic acid (BA) as precursor of SA biosynthesis in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun NN) plants undergoing a hypersensitive response following infection with tobacco mosaic virus or in tobacco cell suspensions elicited with beta-megaspermin, an elicitor from Phytophthora megasperma. We found a small pool of conjugated BA in healthy leaves and untreated cell suspensions of tobacco, whereas free BA levels were barely detectable. Infection of plants with tobacco mosaic virus or elicitation of cells led to a rapid de novo synthesis and accumulation of conjugated BA, whereas free BA was weakly induced. In presence of diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of superoxide anion formation, SA accumulation was abolished in elicited cells and much higher BA levels were concomitantly induced, mainly as a conjugated form. Furthermore, piperonylic acid, an inhibitor of cinnamate-4-hydroxylase was used as a powerful tool to redirect the metabolic flow from the main phenylpropanoid pathway into the SA biosynthetic branch. Under these conditions, in vivo labeling and radioisotope dilution experiments with [(14)C]trans-cinnamic acid as precursor clearly indicated that the free form of BA produced in elicited tobacco cells is not the major precursor of SA biosynthesis. The main conjugated form of BA accumulating after elicitation of tobacco cells was identified for the first time as benzoyl-glucose. Our data point to the likely role of conjugated forms of BA in SA biosynthesis.
