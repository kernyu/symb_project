In a hospital setting antimicrobial resistant organisms especially Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as an important variable influencing patients' outcome and overall resource utilisation. The present study was undertaken to find out the proportion of MRSA and other organisms and their antimicrobial resistance pattern in admitted cases with postoperative wound infections. A total of 50 wound swabs were collected irrespective of age and sex of the patients from National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics Rehabilitation (NITOR). The laboratory work was performed in the department of microbiology of National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD). Isolation, identification and susceptibility testing was done according to the guideline of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 1998). Out of the 50 samples 34 yielded growths of which 15 had growth of single organism and 19 had mixed growth of 2 to 3 organisms. Four different types of organisms were identified. Highest percentage was Escherichia coli 55.9%, followed by Pseudomonas sp. 52.9%, Proteus sp. 38.2%, and Staphylococcus aureus 17.6%. Of the 6 isolates of S aureus 5 (83.3%) were MRSA. Therefore it can be concluded that MRSA is existing in the hospital premises of NITOR, which can endanger the life of many. This study emphasises that susceptibility testing of all clinical isolates is essential to reduce the morbidity, mortality and longer duration of hospital stay. In addition proper management of the cases can decrease the spread of multiple drug resistant organisms in the community.
