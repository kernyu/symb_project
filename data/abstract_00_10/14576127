A mouse model was used to test the hypothesis that antibiotics with activity against anaerobes promote overgrowth of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in stool. Subcutaneous clindamycin consistently promoted establishment of high-density colonization, whereas piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime promoted colonization only when a large inoculum and/or more resistant strain was administered.
