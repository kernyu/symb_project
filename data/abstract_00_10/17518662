Biological scaffolds composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) have been shown to be resistant to deliberate bacterial contamination in preclinical in vivo studies. The present study evaluated the degradation products resulting from the acid digestion of ECM scaffolds for antibacterial effects against clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The ECM scaffolds were derived from porcine urinary bladder (UBM-ECM) and liver (L-ECM). These biological scaffolds were digested with acid at high temperatures, fractionated using ammonium sulfate precipitation, and tested for antibacterial activity in a standardized in vitro assay. Degradation products from both UBM-ECM and L-ECM demonstrated antibacterial activity against both S. aureus and E. coli. Specific ammonium sulfate fractions that showed antimicrobial activity varied for the 2 different ECM scaffold types. The results of this study suggest that several different low-molecular-weight peptides with antibacterial activity exist within ECM and that these peptides may help explain the resistance to bacterial infection provided by such biological scaffolds.
