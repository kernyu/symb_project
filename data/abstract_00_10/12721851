Recently, it has been reported that tubers of transgenic potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) plants with decreased activity of the plastidic ATP/ADP transporter (AATP1) contain less starch, despite having an increased glucose level [P. Geigenberger et al. (2001) Plant Physiol 125:1667-1678]. The metabolic alterations correlated with enhanced resistance to the bacterium Erwinia carotovora. Here it is shown that transgenic potato tubers, possessing less starch yet increased glucose levels due to the expression of a cytoplasm-localized yeast invertase, exhibit drastic susceptibility to E. carotovora. In addition, it is demonstrated that AATP1 anti-sense tubers show an increased capacity to ward off the pathogenic fungus Alternaria solani. In contrast to AATP1 anti-sense tubers, the corresponding leaf tissue does not show changes in carbohydrate accumulation. However, upon elicitor treatment, AATP1 anti-sense leaves possess an increased capacity to release H(2)O(2) and activate various defence-related genes, reactions that are associated with substantially delayed appearance of disease symptoms caused by Phytophthora infestans. Grafting experiments between AATP1 anti-sense plants and wild-type plants indicate the presence of a signal that is generated in AATP1 rootstocks and primes wild-type scions for potentiated activation of cellular defence responses in leaves. Together, the results suggest that (i) the enhanced pathogen tolerance of AATP1 anti-sense tubers is not due to "high sugar resistance", (ii) the increased disease resistance of AATP1 anti-sense tubers is effective against different types of pathogen and (iii) a systemic signal induced by antisensing the plastidic ATP/ADP transporter in potato tubers confers increased resistance to pathogens.
