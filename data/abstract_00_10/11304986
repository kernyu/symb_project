There are two ways for a bacterium to acquire antimicrobial-resistance: 1) Horizontal transfer of resistance gene(s) from outside, 2) Mutation of its own chromosome. The former case includes conjugation, transduction and transformation. Resistance genes usually locate on transposon or integron and have inverted or direct repeats on both sides, or link to a special sequence at one side. A target of an antibiotic is an essential enzyme for the bacterium to survive, and the corresponding gene is located on the chromosome. The mutation of the essential gene may cause resistance to antimicrobials by decreasing the affinity of enzyme to the drug. The mutation of genes for drug influx or efflux also causes antimicrobial resistance.
