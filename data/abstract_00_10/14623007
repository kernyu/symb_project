Oxazolidinone-quinolone hybrids, which combine the pharmacophores of a quinolone and an oxazolidinone, were synthesised and shown to be active against a variety of susceptible and resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The nature of the spacer greatly influences the antibacterial activity by directing the mode of action, that is quinolone- and/or oxazolidinone-like activity. The best compounds in this series have a balanced dual mode of action and overcome all types of resistance, including resistance to quinolones and linezolid, in clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens.
