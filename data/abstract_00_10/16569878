A high resistance rate (47.9%) to gatifloxacin (GAT; 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone) in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains from 48 Japanese patients is observed after unsuccessful H. pylori eradication. A significant association between MICs for GAT equal to or above 1 microg/ml and mutations of the gyrA gene of H. pylori was demonstrated.
