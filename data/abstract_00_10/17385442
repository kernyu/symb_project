To study the regularities in the spread of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains among HIV-infected patients in the Southern Federal District (SFD), the HIV-1 pol gene site encoded for reverse transcriptase was sequenced in the samples taken from 22 HIV-infected SFD patients who received or did not receive antiretroviral therapy (ARVT). Analysis of the primary sequences of the HIV-1 pol gene in SFD patients untreated with antiviral agents revealed the absence of both primary and secondary mutations of resistance to a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). The group of patients receiving antiviral treatment was found to have different drug resistance mutations in the HIV-1 pol gene: K70R, M184V, K219Q, T215Y/F, L74V, etc. Moreover, the patients on ARVT had higher CD4 T lymphocyte levels and higher immunoregulatory index in the presence of significantly lower HIV replication than the untreated patients. The authors make recommendations how to study HIV resistance in patients who are to be treated and are receiving ARVT and advise to monitor the spread of drug-resistant HIV strains in the SFD.
