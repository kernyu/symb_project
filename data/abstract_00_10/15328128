Twelve clarithromycin-resistant (MIC, > or = 1 microg/ml) Helicobacter pylori isolates were analyzed for point mutations in the 23S rRNA gene. Sequence analysis of all of the resistant isolates revealed a T-to-C transition mutation at position 2182. Transformation experiments confirmed that a single T-to-C transition mutation at position 2182 is associated with clarithromycin resistance.
