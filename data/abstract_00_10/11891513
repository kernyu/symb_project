Respiratory illnesses are the leading reason for seeking medical care here in the United States. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial pathogen causing acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia in both the pediatric and adult populations. The continued development of antibiotic resistance to an increasing number of different antibiotic classes by this organism has made the treatment of some of these infections more difficult. Recently, a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was approved for infants and toddlers, beginning at 2 months of age. Widespread implementation of this vaccine in the childhood population may have a significant impact on the amount of systemic disease seen with this organism.
