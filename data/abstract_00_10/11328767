We have investigated the in vitro activity of antimicrobial peptides against Mycobacterium tuberculosis using a radiometric method and cfu determinations. PR-39, a proline-arginine-rich antibacterial peptide from porcine leucocytes, was found to be active against drug-susceptible as well as multi-drug-resistant (MDR) clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. The activity of PR-39 was concentration dependent, with 80% growth inhibition of M. tuberculosis H37Rv at 50 mg/L. The MDR M. tuberculosis strains E1380/94 and P34/95 were less susceptible to PR-39, with 39 and 49% growth inhibition at 50 mg/L peptide, respectively, suggesting a lower susceptibility than strain H37Rv and drug-susceptible clinical isolates. Reduction of counts of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and the MDR M. tuberculosis strain E1380/94 by PR-39 indicated that the growth inhibition seen in the radiometric assay is due to a mycobactericidal effect of the peptide. These observations suggest that antimicrobial peptides may play an important role in host defence against MDR M. tuberculosis.
