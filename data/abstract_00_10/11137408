Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become a serious problem in medicine. Particularly worrisome is the increasing incidence of multi-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Not surprisingly, in view of the high incidence of life-threatening infections and heavy antibiotic use, resistance has become very frequent and problematic in intensive care units. The standard approach for the treatment of MRSA is vancomycin or teicoplanin. Long-term therapeutic and unrestricted prophylactic use of vancomycin has given rise to VRE which in turn may lead to the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) through plasmid mediated transmission. In order to reduce the incidence of VRE and to avoid the emergence of VRSA, vancomycin use should be restricted and alternative antibiotic strategies should be developed. Using those antibiotics to which MRSA are still generally sensitive, perhaps in combination with new ones, such as, quinupristin/dalfopristin, should be entertained. We performed a retrospective review of the Gram-positive infections in our Level 1 Trauma Center Intensive Care Unit, and an analysis of the resistance patterns of the NMSA infections showed that additional resistance rarely develops within less than 5 days. We then designed a new strategy for the treatment of MRSA infections. This strategy consists of the sequential use of a range of antibiotics with activity against MRSA in short 5-7 day pulses until the full clinical course is completed. Studies validating the benefit of this approach are currently in preparation.
