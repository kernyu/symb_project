Because of the changes to be expected in the methods for testing disinfectants deemed to be used in the veterinary field, candidate viral species were evaluated for their suitability as test virus. Considered viral species included different non-enveloped viruses [bovine enterovirus type 1 (ECBO (Enteric Cytopathogenic Bovine Orphan) virus), mammalian reovirus type 1, feline calici virus (FCV), and bovine parvovirus (BPV)], as well as enveloped viruses, as equine arteritisvirus (EAV), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV1), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and vaccinia virus. Viruses were tested for their tenacity against different biocidal agents (formaldehyde, formic acid, peracetic acid, and sodium hypochlorite) in the suspension test at a temperature of 20 degrees C which is given as an optional test temperature according to prEN 14675 "Quantitative suspension test for the evaluation of virucidal activity of chemical disinfectants and antiseptics used in veterinary field--Test method and requirements"elaborated by the "Comite Europeen de Normalisation"(CEN) (Anonym, 2004). Of the animal viruses tested for their tenacity highest tenacity against the disinfectants. FCV and the enveloped viruses were of lower resistance. In addition to the tenacity of viruses, other parameters, such as the ability of the virus to replicate in permanent cells, the magnitude of the virus titre that can be obtained from such cultures, as well as the threat a virus poses to humans and animals are to be considered when selecting a suitable test virus. Based on these criteria and despite its tenacity being inferior to that of BPV, the ECBO virus was chosen as the most suitable test virus. The result of the efficacy of disinfectants is not based on the most resistant virus in this case. This circumstance is to be considered when giving recommendations for the practical use of disinfectants.
