Mycotic aneurysm of the descending aorta is usually described as rare. We present two recent cases of mycotic aneurysm of the descending aorta complicated with hemoptysis. Urgent tube graft replacements were successfully performed under cardiopulmonary bypass support. Bacterial causes of the aneurysms were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the first case and Staphylococcus aureus in the second case. Although the first patient died fifteenth months after surgery, the second patient remains well fourteenth months after the operation.
