The purpose of this study was to investigate enterococci for potential probiotic use in Iberian dry-fermented sausages. A total of 15 strains isolated from Iberian dry-fermented sausages, human feces, and pig feces were evaluated for their safety and functional characteristics including biogenic amine (BA) production, antibiotic susceptibility, hemolysis, virulence determinants, cell adhesion, and antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens. The strain Enterococcus faecium SE906 was able to establish itself on the intestinal epithelium, inhibiting such pathogenic bacteria as Listeria monocytogenes in vitro. This strain was also considered safe to be used for its low aminogenic potential, and its antibiotic resistance pattern and virulence determinants, being identified as a potential probiotic meat starter culture suitable for manufacture of dry-fermented Iberian sausages.
