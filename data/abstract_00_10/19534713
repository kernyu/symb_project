Influenza virus remains a significant threat to humanity despite the discovery of novel anti-viral therapies and the continuing development of seasonal vaccines. The reason for this ongoing concern is that the development of drug resistance to anti-virals has rapidly occurred and the currently developed vaccines are typically only effective against a specific influenza virus strain. The continual emergence of new influenza virus strains that may lead to the next human pandemic has inspired much research into a better understanding of the virus, particularly the role(s) of carbohydrates in the virus' lifecycle. Much of this research is directed towards next generation anti-influenza drugs. Important advances in the interrogation of influenza virus' surface glycoprotein haemagglutinin by NMR spectroscopy have been made in recent times. An overview of some of these advances is provided.
