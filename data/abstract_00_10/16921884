The state of Michigan has recognized the presence of Mycobacterium bovis in its free-ranging white-tailed deer population since 1994. This endemic infection is primarily located in a 12-county area in the northeastern lower peninsula of Michigan. A statewide surveillance and eradication program of the disease has been in effect since 1994. Worldwide, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms have a known predilection toward development of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of M. bovis isolates from white-tailed deer in Michigan and detect any changes in susceptibility over time. M. bovis isolates from 2 fall hunting seasons (1999 and 2004) were used in this study. The fall season of 2004 marked the first documented case of direct transmission of M. bovis from a wild deer to a human in Michigan. Since M. bovis is a zoonotic disease, knowledge of susceptibility can expedite treatment options in humans. M. bovis isolates were obtained from 58 deer, 4 coyotes, 3 cattle, 2 raccoons, and 1 human case from the 2 years combined. Methods of susceptibility testing included 1% proportion agar plates and Bactec radiometric broth testing. M. bovis was found to be uniformly resistant to the antibiotic pyrazinamide; this resistance is common to all M. bovis isolates. No other antimicrobial resistance was found in any of the tested M. bovis isolates, which may be, in part, attributed to the lack of any significant treatment pressure in wildlife.
