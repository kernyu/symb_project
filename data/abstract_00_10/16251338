In a community of Tanzania where trachoma is endemic, we cultured conjunctival swabs from all residents who had active trachoma and were PCR positive for ocular Chlamydia trachomatis, both before (43 isolates) and 2 months after (9 isolates) mass antibiotic treatment. No clinically or programmatically significant increase in azithromycin or tetracycline resistance was observed.
