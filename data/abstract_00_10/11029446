In Enterococcus gallinarum SC1, a low-level vancomycin-resistant strain, only monomeric muropentapeptides with a C-terminal D-alanine were detected after growth without vancomycin. In contrast, in SC1 induced by vancomycin, as well as in AIB39, a constitutive vancomycin-resistant strain, monomeric and dimeric muropentapeptides with a C-terminal D-serine were detected.
