Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli isolates were identified as a cause of traveler's diarrhea in 82 of 520 (16%) patients and tested for resistance to seven antimicrobial agents. Thirty patients (36%) needed antimicrobial therapy: 17 (56%) for persistence of symptoms and 13 (44%) for severity of symptoms. Ampicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was high. Chloramphenicol showed moderate activity, and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin showed very good activity. Five nalidixic acid-resistant strains were isolated, four from patients visiting India.
