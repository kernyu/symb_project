In the past two years, the focus of studies of the genes controlling expression of defense responses in Arabidopsis has shifted from the identification of mutants to gene isolation and the ordering of genes within branches of the signal transduction networks. It is now clear that gene-for-gene resistance can be mediated through at least three genetically distinguishable pathways. Additional genes affecting salicylic-acid-dependent signaling have been identified, and double-mutant analyses have begun to reveal the order in which they act. Genes required for jasmonic-acid-dependent signaling and for induced systemic resistance have also been identified.
