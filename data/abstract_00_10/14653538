TaqMan minor groove binder probes were evaluated as to their suitability for the real-time allelic discrimination of the beta-tubulin codon 200 TTC/TAC single nucleotide polymorphism in cyathostomin species. Amplification of titrated cloned full-length beta-tubulin cDNA revealed that the TaqMan minor groove binder PCR is capable of specifically detecting as few as 10 copies. Testing of DNA from single adult and larval stages of several different species of cyathostomin allowed reproducible genotyping of individual worms. Using the real-time PCR approach, the throughput of samples was considerably increased compared with conventional post-PCR readout procedure. Only 7.8% homozygous TAC L3 were found among 102 L3 which were genotyped from phenotypically BZ-resistant small strongyle populations. The percentages of the homozygous TTC and heterozygous TTC/TAC were 41.3% and 50.9%, respectively. This resulted in a total TAC-allele percentage of only 33.3%. These findings correspond to data obtained by genotyping of an experimentally selected BZ-resistant cyathostomin population. It is concluded that the beta-tubulin codon 200 polymorphism is not the sole mechanism involved in the process of BZ resistance in cyathostomins.
