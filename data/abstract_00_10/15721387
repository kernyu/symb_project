Tuftsin is a tetrapeptide (Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg) that specifically binds monocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes and potentiates their natural killer activity against tumors and pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of this peptide is significantly increased by attaching at the C-terminus a fatty acyl residue through the ethylenediamine spacer arm. This activity is further augmented by incorporating the modified tuftsin in the liposomes. The tuftsin-bearing liposomes not only enhance the host's resistance against a variety of infections but also serve as useful vehicles for the site-specific delivery of drugs in a variety of macrophage-based infections, such as tuberculosis and leishmaniasis.
