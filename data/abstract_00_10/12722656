The effects of glucose concentration in the medium and O-methyl-L-threonine resistance on the ratio of components of the avermectin complex produced by Streptomyces avermitilis have been studied. Glucose deficiency increases the ratio of components A and a, while decreasing that of components 1 in the complex. A mutation that renders the microorganisms resistant to O-methyl-L-threonine (an analog of isoleucine) increases the ratio of components a, while decreasing that of components 1 in the complex. The distribution of a and b in fractions 1 and 2 remains constant: the values of the ratio a/b in the fractions amount, respectively, to 1:1 and 2:1. The relation of the variations in the composition of the avermectin complex to changes in the carbohydrate metabolism of the producer stain, underlain by availability of the source of carbon, is discussed.
