C-reactive protein (CRP) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in healthy individuals and those with pre-existing disease. It also probably contributes to the disease process. CRP levels are higher in obese subjects and this link is almost certainly because of increased insulin resistance. Interventions that alter insulin resistance, such as weight loss, exercise, and conjugated linoleic acid, also alter CRP. Glycemic load is associated with CRP, but there have been no interventions with altered macronutrient composition. In the context of weight loss, macronutrient composition is probably not important. Alcohol lowers CRP, but the mechanism is unknown. The interaction between gender and obesity needs further work, but it appears that obesity has a greater effect on CRP levels in women.
