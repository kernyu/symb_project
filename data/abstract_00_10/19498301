Staphylococcus hyicus isolates (n=207), including 150 exfolitative toxigenic and 57 non-toxigenic strains, were examined for their susceptibility to 13 antimicrobial agents by using the dehydrated 96-well MIC panel system. The frequency of their resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was 76.8% (159/207), followed by erythromycin (56%, 116/207), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (28.5%, 59/207), chloramphenicol (24.2%, 50/207), kanamycin (19.8%, 41/207), and doxycycline (1.4%, 3/207). Resistance to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly higher in toxigenic strains than non-toxigenic strains (p<0.01), whereas kanamycin and erythromycin resistance was significantly higher in non-toxigenic strains (p<0.01 and <0.05, respectively). Resistance to two or more antimicrobials was observed in 85.5% (177/207) of total strains, with a significantly higher occurrence in toxigenic strains (89.3%, 134/150 vs. 75.4%, 43/57; p<0.05).
