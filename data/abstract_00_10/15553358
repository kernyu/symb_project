OBJECTIVE: To report the incidence of gonorrhoea and the development of resistance to Neisseria gonorrhoeae among attendees at the Municipal Health Service's STD-clinic in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2000-2003. DESIGN: Descriptive. METHOD: Urethral or cervical swabs for culture for N. gonorrhoea were taken from attendees at the STD-clinic. Depending on reported sexual techniques throat and rectal swabs were also taken. The disk diffusion technique in combination with a beta-lactamase test were used for sensitivity testing. RESULTS. The number of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) isolates collected at the Amsterdam Municipal Health Service's STD-clinic decreased from 1047 in 2002 to 772 in 2003. The number of fluoroquinolone-resistant NG (FRNG) isolates rose from 3 in 2000 to 56 in 2003 (p < 0.001). FRNG isolates amongst men who have sex with men increased from 1 in 568 isolates (0.2%) in 2000 to 50 in 478 isolates (10.5%) in 2003 (p < 0.001). Amongst heterosexual men, FRNG rose from 2 per 275 (0.7%) in 2000 to 16 per 297 (5.4%) in 2002 and dropped to 6 per 190 (3.4%) in 2003 (p = 0.146). No FRNG isolates were found in women in 2003 (2000: 0/180 (0.0%); 2001: 2/160 (1.3%); 2002: 4/183 (2.2%). CONCLUSION: The recent incidence of FRNG among men who have sex with men to over 5% makes ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones obsolete as the first-choice treatment option for uncomplicated gonorrhoea if no antibiogram is available. It is advised to use cefotaxim when an antibiogram is not available (yet).
