We sought to determine the epidemiological characteristics of patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by piperacillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PRPA; n=34) or piperacillin-susceptible P. aeruginosa (PSPA; n=101). According to univariate analysis, the factors associated with the development of PRPA VAP were presence of an underlying fatal medical condition, immunocompromised status, longer previous hospital stay, less-severe illness at the time of ICU admission, duration of mechanical ventilation before onset of VAP, number of classes of antibiotic received, and previous exposure to imipenem or fluoroquinolone. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following significant independent factors: presence of an underlying fatal medical condition (odds ratio [OR], 5.6), previous fluoroquinolone use (OR, 4.6), and initial disease severity (OR, 0.8). We concluded that the clinical characteristics of patients who develop PRPA VAP differ from those of patients who develop PSPA VAP. Restricted fluoroquinolone use is the sole independent risk factor for PRPA VAP that is open to medical intervention.
