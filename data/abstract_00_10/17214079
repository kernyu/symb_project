The epidemic upsurge of influenza morbidity in Russia in 2004-2005 was caused by the active circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses. A hundred and sixty-six epidemic strains were studied. All the strains were isolated in the MCK cell culture. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses (n=77) were antigenic variants of the reference A/Fujian/411/ 2002 and A/California/7/2004 strains. Three influenza A(H1N1) viral strains that were antigenic variants of A/New Caledonia/20/99 strains were isolated in sporadic cases. Influenza B virus strains (n=83) were antigenic variants of the reference B/Shanghai/361/02--lineage B/Yamagata/l6/88. In addition, 3 antigenic variants of B/Hong Kong/ 330/2002 (lineage B/Victoria/2/87) strains were isolated. Nine (20%) strains resistant to rimantadine at a concentration of 5 microg/ml were identified. Chromatographic analysis of B/Shanghai/361/02 and BIHong Kong/330/01 viral protein M1 trypsin hydrolysates revealed differences in the profiles of chromatograms of influenza A virus proteins M1. Examination of 121 pair sera from patients revealed an increase in antibodies to influenza A(H3N2) viruses in 10-21% of cases and to influenza B viruses in 20-36% of cases.
