The usefulness of genotypic resistance tests (GRT) among HIV-1 patients with low-level virological failure (LLVF) was evaluated. Up to 78% of samples with <1,000 copies/ml were sequenced successfully. For samples with 50 to 200 copies/ml, the success rate was as high as 69%. LLVF should not deter clinicians from requesting GRT.
