[reaction: see text] New derivatives of Amphotericin B (AmB) were synthesized through a double reductive alkylation of the mycosamine. These derivatives of AmB displayed superior antifungal activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type strain and especially in the case of an AmB-resistant Candida albicans strain. Moreover, these compounds are potential drug candidates because of significantly reduced hemotoxicity compared to AmB. Furthermore, the same mycosamine modification can be applied to other polyene macrolides such as Nystatin and Pimaricin to improve their antifungal activity.
