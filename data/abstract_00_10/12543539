The fully automated BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA medium for susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to pyrazinamide (PZA) was evaluated using 101 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates. The results obtained with the system were compared with those of the pyrazinamidase (PZase) assay and the Kyokuto PZA test based on a broth culture, which is commercially available in Japan. The overall concordance rate was 90.1% (91/101) among the three methods in the initial test. The concordance rates between the BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA medium vs the PZase assay, the BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA medium vs the Kyokuto PZA test, and the PZase assay vs the Kyokuto PZA test were 93.1, 91.1, and 96.0%, respectively. On the repeat test of the 10 strains with discrepant results among the three methods, the concordance rates reached over 97% between each of the two systems. The results of the repeat test were confirmed by MIC testing and sequencing analysis of the pncA gene encoding PZase of M. tuberculosis. The mean turnaround times from incubation for PZA susceptibility testing were almost similar for the two methods based on liquid media, the BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA medium and the Kyokuto PZA test (7.7 and 7.4 days, respectively). These results indicate that both methods based on liquid media, the fully automated BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA medium and the Kyokuto PZA test for susceptibility testing to PZA, are useful for rapid diagnosis of PZA resistant tuberculosis.
