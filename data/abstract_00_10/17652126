OBJECTIVE: To report a positive outcome in a patient treated with daptomycin for left-sided endocarditis associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) subsequent to vancomycin-induced neutropenia. CASE SUMMARY: A 55-year-old African American male was diagnosed with left-sided endocarditis, brain abscesses, and septic arthritis due to community-acquired MRSA. He began treatment with intravenous vancomycin to achieve a trough concentration of 15-20 microg/mL and oral rifampin 600 mg/day. A repair and resection of the mitral valve was completed on day 15 of hospitalization. Vancomycin was discontinued on day 36 secondary to drug-induced neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count nadir 162 cells/microL). Intravenous therapy with daptomycin 6 mg/kg every 24 hours was then initiated and the neutropenia resolved. The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 56. DISCUSSION: Upon discontinuation of vancomycin, treatment options were limited to a small number of alternatives. Documented clinical experience and relevant studies are limited regarding the use of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), linezolid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), and daptomycin for the treatment of MRSA left-sided endocarditis. Daptomycin was selected because of its bactericidal qualities and its recent approval for this indication. The prognostic outlook for use of daptomycin in this treatment was uncertain; however, Q/D, linezolid, and TMP/SMX posed greater risks of failure. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of MRSA left-sided endocarditis in patients intolerant to vancomycin is challenging. The positive outcome in our patient is likely attributable to aggressive vancomycin dosing and extended duration of treatment prior to the initiation of daptomycin. The use of daptomycin in this case enabled successful management of left-sided endocarditis.
