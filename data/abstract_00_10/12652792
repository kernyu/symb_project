Vancomycin-resistant enterococci(VRE) is a troublesome pathogens causing nosocomial infections worldwide. VRE infections or colonization occur mainly in immuno-compromised patients and in the course of antimicrobial treatment for other nosocomial infectious diseases. VRE are classified into 6 types by their resistance genes and of these types, both VanA and VanB type VRE are significantly important in clinical situations. Susceptibility tests for VCM and TEIC are often useful in the phenotypic screening for differentiating VanA from VanB type VRE. However, detection of the resistance genes using PCR methods is easy and essential for the conclusive identification of VRE.
