A 54-year-old man underwent simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. During his prolonged hospitalization, he developed catheter-related fungemia with Rhodotorula glutinis and azole-resistant Candida glabrata. Management of the Rhodotorula fungemia was complicated by his renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, and the concurrent fungemia with multi-azole resistant C. glabrata. He was treated with combination therapy with voriconazole and micafungin with subsequent clearance of the fungemia. Rhodotorula species are emerging as human pathogens with the increasing number of immunosuppressed patients in the last few decades. This is the first report of a R. glutinis fungemia in a solid organ transplant recipient.
