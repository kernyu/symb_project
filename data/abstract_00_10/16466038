BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), is considered a threat to TB control. Implementation of DOTS ensures high cure rates and prevents MDR. OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of MDR-TB from a retrospective analysis of the data in a tuberculosis unit where DOTS was implemented over a period of 6 years through public private mix (PPM). METHODS: Drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples isolated from the cultures of newly registered and retreatment sputum smear-positive cases during 2001-2003. RESULTS: During the study, 909 sputum-positive cases were registered and analysed. Of these, 714 were new and 195 were retreatment sputum-positive cases. INH resistance was found in 3.2% (23) of new and 9.2% (18) of retreatment cases. RMP resistance was present in 1.5% (11) of new and 7.2% (14) of retreatment cases. MDR was present only in 0.14% (1) of new and 2% (4) of retreatment cases. New cases had cure rates of 96% compared to 85% in retreatment cases. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MDR-TB is low where success rates are high.
