The treatment of fibrocavitatory pulmonary infection due to Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium malmoense poses a challenge. This study assessed microbial, inflammatory, radiographic, and clinical outcomes for a standardized 24-month triple-drug regime. Following treatment completion, all patients had fewer symptoms, experienced a reduction in systemic inflammation, and had negative sputum mycobacterial culture results.
