Fifty clinical Mycoplasma pneumoniae strains were isolated from 370 children with respiratory tract infections. Four strains were susceptible to macrolides, while the other 46 (92%) were macrolide resistant. The molecular mechanism of resistance was shown to be associated with point mutations in 23S rRNA at positions 2063 and 2064.
