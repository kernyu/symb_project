Transplantation of insulin secreting cells is regarded as a possible treatment for type 1 diabetes. One major difficulty in this approach is, however, that the transplanted cells are exposed to the patient's inflammatory and autoimmune environment, which originally destroyed their own beta-cells. Therefore, even if a good source of insulin-secreting cells can be identified for transplantation therapy, these cells need to be protected against these destructive influences. The aim of this project was to evaluate, using a clonal mouse beta-cell line, whether genetic engineering of protective genes could be a viable option to allow these cells to survive when transplanted into autoimmune diabetic mice. We demonstrated that transfer of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic gene and of several genes specifically interfering with cytokines intracellular signalling pathways, greatly improved resistance of the cells to inflammatory stresses in vitro. We further showed that these modifications did not interfere with the capacity of these cells to correct hyperglycaemia for several months in syngeneic or allogeneic streptozocin-diabetic mice. However, these cells were not protected against autoimmune destruction when transplanted into type 1 diabetic NOD mice. This suggests that in addition to inflammatory attacks by cytokines, autoimmunity very efficiently kills the transplanted cells, indicating that multiple protective mechanisms are required for efficient transplantation of insulin-secreting cells to treat type 1 diabetes.
