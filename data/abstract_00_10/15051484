This laboratory has recently reported the preparation of immortal lens epithelial cell lines conditioned to survive in concentrations of peroxide sufficient to cause cataract with in vitro lens culture conditions. The cell conditioning process takes many months during which time the peroxide concentration is gradually increased. It was found that while the acquired resistance to H2O2 was permanent, if tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBOOH) was used the resistance was lost within 6-8 weeks of the withdrawal of the peroxide. We now report that resistance is lost within a few days but can be regained within 48 hr. Furthermore, cells resistant to H2O2 while vulnerable to TBOOH could also be rapidly conditioned to tolerate TBOOH in a manner similar to the reconditioning of cells that had lost their TBOOH resistance. The results suggest that a history of exposure to certain oxidative stresses produces a change in cell biology which allows the cell to rapidly respond to the same or other stresses and survive.
