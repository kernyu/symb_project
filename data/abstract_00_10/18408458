PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This is a concise review of recent developments in the field of viral hepatitis, based on publications between December 2006 and November 2007. RECENT FINDINGS: Hepatitis A vaccine has similar efficacy to immune globulin as postexposure prophylaxis. Entecavir is a potent antiviral agent with a low rate of drug resistance in nucleoside-naive chronic hepatitis B patients but it is not as effective in lamivudine-refractory patients. A combination of adefovir and lamivudine is preferred to adefovir monotherapy for lamivudine-refractory hepatitis B patients. Two orally administered hepatitis C protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, were shown to have antiviral activity in hepatitis C genotype 1 patients. A 16-week course of pegylated interferon and ribavirin resulted in a lower rate of sustained virologic response compared with the standard 24-week course. Patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis who achieved sustained virologic response to antiviral therapy remain at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. A novel recombinant hepatitis E vaccine was shown to be safe and effective in preventing infection. SUMMARY: Advances have been made in the prevention of hepatitis A and hepatitis E. It is likely that specifically targeted antiviral therapies for hepatitis C will be available in the next few years.
