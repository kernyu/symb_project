When the oxygen atom in a peptide bond is replaced by a sulfur atom, the restriction in the available conformational space and the ability of thioamides to confer resistance to enzymatic degradation renders thioamides as potentially useful building blocks for drug design and protein engineering. The solvation free energy differences between conformers of the same dipeptide can be high. Yet, previous conformational studies, basing on the (phi, psi) conformational energy maps of thio-substituted dipeptides, neglected both explicit water interactions and free energy considerations. In this paper, the (phi, psi) conformational free energy maps are obtained by single umbrella sampling in an explicit water environment for both alanine dipeptide and the corresponding thioamide derivatives. The phi and psi angles for the minima in the relative energy maps calculated with dielectric of 80 are similar to the corresponding phi and psi angles in the relative free energy maps for both Ac-Ala-NHMe (Ac: acetyl; Ala: alanine) and Act-Alat-NHMe (Act: thio-acetyl; Alat: thio-alanine). However, some large differences between the relative energy and relative free energy of major minima indicate that the consideration of free energy is important in determination of the relative occupancy of particular minima. Free energy maps for both Ac-Ala-NHMe and Act-Alat-NHMe show that thio-substitution favors conformations where phi < 0 because of the deeper beta and alphaR minima. The changes in the position and relative stability of minima were explained in terms of the destabilization of the regions near phi = -120, 0 and 120, psi = 60, -60, 180, which correspond to the increased steric hindrance due to the bulkier sulfur atom.
