We investigated the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (isolated from the sputum of patients with respiratory infection in 4 medical institutions in Fukushima Prefecture) to 8 beta-lactam antibiotics including three carbapenems and relationships among MICs of antibiotics tested. The MIC90 values for a total of 216 strains were 6.25 micrograms/ml for meropenem, 12.5 micrograms/ml for imipenem and ceftazidime, 25 micrograms/ml for panipenem and cefsulodin, 50 micrograms/ml for cefpirome and over than 200 micrograms/ml for cefoperazone and piperacillin. The frequency of resistance of these strains to each antibiotic was as follows: The resistant strains were 19 (8.8%) for meropenem, 34 (15.7%) for imipenem and ceftazidime, 50 (23.1%) for cefsulodin, 72 (33.3%) for panipenem, 76 (35.2%) for piperacillin and 90 (41.7%) for cefpirome. Eighteen strains (18.3%) of 19 meropenem resitant straisn were resistant to imipenem and panipenem, but 16 strains of the 34 imipenem-resistant strains and 54 strains of the 72 panipenem-resistant strains were susceptible to meropenem. In investigation of isolation of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the susceptibility of strains tested to 7 antibiotics except cefoperazone was as follows: The strains susceptible to all the 7 antibiotics were 92 strains (42.6%), and 33 strains (15.2%) were resistant to 2 antibiotics, 31 strains (14.4%) were resistant to 1 antibiotic, 21 strains (9.7%) were resistant to 3 antibiotics, 13 strains (6.0%) were resistant to 5 antibiotics, 9 (4.2%) were resistant to 4 and 7 antibiotics, and 8 strains (3.7%) were reistant to 6 antibiotics. Since the emergence of these multi-resistant strains is closely related to frequent use of antibiotics for nosocomial infections, special attention should be paid to the antimicrobial susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the situation of antibiotic resistant strains.
