Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that has a broad spectrum of activity against several causative bacterial pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The efficacy and tolerability of levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for 10 days in patients with CAP are well established. Furthermore, a high-dose (750 mg), short-course (5 days) of once-daily levofloxacin has been approved for use in the USA in the treatment of CAP, acute bacterial sinusitis, acute pyelonephritis and complicated urinary tract infections. Levofloxacin can be used as a monotherapy in patients with CAP, however, levofloxacin combination therapy with anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (or aminoglycoside) should be considered if Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the causative pathogen of the respiratory infection. The high-dose, short-course levofloxacin regimen maximizes its concentration-dependent antibacterial activity, decreases the potential for drug resistance and has better patient compliance. Oral levofloxacin is rapidly absorbed and is bioequivalent to the intravenous formulation and the patients can switch between these formulations, which results in more options with respect to the therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, levofloxacin is generally well tolerated, has good tissue penetration and adequate concentrations can be maintained at the site of infections.
