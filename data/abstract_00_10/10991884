Fluoroquinolone-resistant avian Escherichia coli isolates from northern Georgia were investigated for gyrA and parC mutations. All isolates contained a mutation in GyrA replacing Ser83 with Leu; seven isolates also contained mutations replacing Asp87 with either Gly or Tyr. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed that quinolone-resistant E. coli isolates were genetically diverse.
