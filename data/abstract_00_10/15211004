A drug-resistance survey was conducted in the French territory of Mayotte in the Comorian Islands in the Indian Ocean where malaria is endemic. A high prevalence of resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites was observed, not only to chloroquine (88%) and pyrimethamine (99%), but more surprisingly to quinine (17%), mefloquine (9%), and amodiaquine (24%). This leaves few treatment alternatives other than artemisine-mefloquine combinations. However, despite notification to French Health authorities three years ago, inadequate treatment (chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) is still used in this locality. Thus, people still die of malaria in this remote territory of France.
