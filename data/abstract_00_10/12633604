Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of glycoproteins results in broad, fuzzy bands. The use of the positively charged detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) avoids this problem. Protocols for CTAB electrophoresis, electroblotting, and protein detection are presented. These methods were found useful in studies on the multiple drug resistance ATPase Mdr1.
