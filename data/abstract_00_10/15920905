Since there are few published reports regarding the impact of urologic surgery on perioperative infections, an epidemiologic analysis was performed on data from 1,156 open or laparoscopic operations in urology collected by the 21 hospitals participating in this study between September 2002 and August 2003. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered intravenously according to our protocol designed on the basis of the invasiveness and contamination levels. The surgical site infection (SSI) rates following clean, clean-contaminated and contaminated surgery were 1.2%. 5.8% and 23.4%, respectively, while the remote infection (RI) rates were 3.5%. 7.1% and 35.9%, respectively. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was most frequently isolated from SSIs as well as RIs, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequently discovered in RIs than in SSIs. Several risk factors for SSI and/or RI, such as older age, high ASA score, obesity, diabetes, preoperative chemotherapy, long operation time and much blood loss, were identified by univariate analysis.
