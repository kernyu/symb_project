Derivatives of ethyl 5-phenyl-6-oxa-1-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-carboxylate (14-20), with side chains varying from three to five carbon atoms and bearing various substituents, have been prepared from ethyl 2-phenyl-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (12). Their in vitro activity against P. falciparum (K1 strain) and antimycobacterium and also their cytotoxic activity against Vero cell have been evaluated.
