The objective of this study was to assess the effect of cyclosporin A liposome aerosol on the anticancer activity of paclitaxel (PTX) liposome aerosol against renal cell carcinoma (Renca) pulmonary metastases in mice. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was administered as a liposome aerosol for one-half hour before starting one-half hour treatment with PTX liposome aerosol (CsA/PTX), and in a second groups of animals cyclosporin A liposome aerosol was given before PTX for one-half hour and also later by mixing a second dose of cyclosporin A aerosol with PTX aerosol and extending the treatment period to one hour (CsA/PTX + CsA). In one experiment, PTX and CsA/PTX aerosols were significantly more effective compared to untreated controls against renal cell cancer as measured by lung weights and tumor surface areas. CsA/PTX was significantly better that PTX alone as measured by lung weights and tumor area. In a second experiment, tumor areas of PTX and CsA/PTX treated mice were significantly reduced compared to untreated controls and CsA/PTX treated mice had significantly smaller tumor areas than PTX treated mice. In contrast, tumor numbers were not significantly fewer than controls in either therapeutic group. In a third experiment, tumor numbers and tumor areas were significantly fewer in mice treated with CsA/PTX and CsA/PTX + CsA compared to untreated controls. Mice treated with CsA/PTX + CsA had significantly fewer tumors and less tumor area than mice receiving CsA/PTX. While PTX treated mice were not different than untreated controls with respect to tumor numbers or tumor volumes, PTX treated mice had significantly greater tumor numbers and tumor areas than CsA/PTX and CsA/PTX + CsA treated mice. Co-administration of CsA with PTX demonstrated significant dose dependent anticancer effects against renal cell pulmonary metastases in mice. Toxicity manifested by weight loss was associated with the highest dose of CsA.
