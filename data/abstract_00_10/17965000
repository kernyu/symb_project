Angiogenesis targeting with inhibitors of VEGF receptors is currently modifying in depth the treatment strategy of metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma. Although immunotherapy remains prescribed in selected patients with good prognosis, sunitinib and sorafenib are presently the most active agents in this malignancy. The results available, in terms of response as in terms of progression-free survival, argue in favour of the use of sunitinib in first line. The two agents have distinct toxicity profiles, which may lead in the future to select the treatment as a function of an individual patient basis. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of partial cross-resistance between them.
